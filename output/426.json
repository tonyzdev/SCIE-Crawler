    "abstract": "Water-borne pathogen contamination in water resources and related diseases are a major water quality concern throughout the world. Increasing interest in controlling water-borne pathogens in water resources evidenced by a large number of recent publications clearly attests to the need for studies that synthesize knowledge from multiple fields covering comparative aspects of pathogen contamination, and unify them in a single place in order to present and address the problem as a whole. Providing a broader perceptive of pathogen contamination in freshwater (rivers, lakes, reservoirs, groundwater) and saline water (estuaries and coastal waters) resources, this review paper attempts to develop the first comprehensive single source of existing information on pathogen contamination in multiple types of water resources. In addition, a comprehensive discussion describes the challenges associated with using indicator organisms. Potential impacts of water resources development on pathogen contamination as well as challenges that lie ahead for addressing pathogen contamination are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "The genus Azospirillum comprises plant-growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB), which have been broadly studied. The benefits to plants by inoculation with Azospirillum have been primarily attributed to its capacity to fix atmospheric nitrogen, but also to its capacity to synthesize phytohormones, in particular indole-3-acetic acid. Recently, an increasing number of studies has attributed an important role of Azospirillum in conferring to plants tolerance of abiotic and biotic stresses, which may be mediated by phytohormones acting as signaling molecules. Tolerance of biotic stresses is controlled by mechanisms of induced systemic resistance, mediated by increased levels of phytohormones in the jasmonic acid/ethylene pathway, independent of salicylic acid (SA), whereas in the systemic acquired resistance—a mechanism previously studied with phytopathogens—it is controlled by intermediate levels of SA. Both mechanisms are related to the NPR1 protein, acting as a co-activator in the induction of defense genes. Azospirillum can also promote plant growth by mechanisms of tolerance of abiotic stresses, named as induced systemic tolerance, mediated by antioxidants, osmotic adjustment, production of phytohormones, and defense strategies such as the expression of pathogenesis-related genes. The study of the mechanisms triggered by Azospirillum in plants can help in the search for more-sustainable agricultural practices and possibly reveal the use of PGPB as a major strategy to mitigate the effects of biotic and abiotic stresses on agricultural productivity.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural residues, such as lignocellulosic materials (LM), are the most attractive renewable bioenergy sources and are abundantly found in nature. Anaerobic digestion has been extensively studied for the effective utilization of LM for biogas production. Experimental investigation of physiochemical changes that occur during pretreatment is needed for developing mechanistic and effective models that can be employed for the rational design of pretreatment processes. Various-cutting edge pretreatment technologies (physical, chemical and biological) are being tested on the pilot scale. These different pretreatment methods are widely described in this paper, among them, microaerobic pretreatment (MP) has gained attention as a potential pretreatment method for the degradation of LM, which just requires a limited amount of oxygen (or air) supplied directly during the pretreatment step. MP involves microbial communities under mild conditions (temperature and pressure), uses fewer enzymes and less energy for methane production, and is probably the most promising and environmentally friendly technique in the long run. Moreover, it is technically and economically feasible to use microorganisms instead of expensive chemicals, biological enzymes or mechanical equipment. The information provided in this paper, will endow readers with the background knowledge necessary for finding a promising solution to methane production.",

Nowadays, the use of microbial inoculants in agriculture is spread worldwide for different crops and carrying different microorganisms. In the last decades, impressive progress has been achieved in the production, commercialization and use of inoculants. Nowadays, farmers are more receptive to the use of inoculants mainly because high-quality products and multi-purpose elite strains are available at the market, improving yields at low cost in comparison to chemical fertilizers. In the context of a more sustainable agriculture, microbial inoculants also help to mitigate environmental impacts caused by agrochemicals. Challenges rely on the production of microbial inoculants for a broader range of crops, and the expansion of the inoculated area worldwide, in addition to the search for innovative microbial solutions in areas subjected to increasing episodes of environmental stresses. In this review, we explore the world market for inoculants, showing which bacteria are prominent as inoculants in different countries, and we discuss the main research strategies that might contribute to improve the use of microbial inoculants in agriculture.",

Interest in them has also been encouraged because of the potential advantages they offer over their synthetic counterparts in many fields spanning environmental, food, biomedical, petrochemical and other industrial applications. Their large scale production and application however are currently restricted by the high cost of production and by the limited understanding of their interactions with cells and with the abiotic environment.

    "abstract": "Since fossil sources for fuel and platform chemicals will become limited in the near future, it is important to develop new concepts for energy supply and production of basic reagents for chemical industry. One alternative to crude oil and fossil natural gas could be the biological conversion of CO2 or small organic molecules to methane via methanogenic archaea. This process has been known from biogas plants, but recently, new insights into the methanogenic metabolism, technical optimizations and new technology combinations were gained, which would allow moving beyond the mere conversion of biomass. In biogas plants, steps have been undertaken to increase yield and purity of the biogas, such as addition of hydrogen or metal granulate. Furthermore, the integration of electrodes led to the development of microbial electrosynthesis (MES). The idea behind this technique is to use CO2 and electrical power to generate methane via the microbial metabolism. This review summarizes the biochemical and metabolic background of methanogenesis as well as the latest technical applications of methanogens. As a result, it shall give a sufficient overview over the topic to both, biologists and engineers handling biological or bioelectrochemical methanogenesis.",

However, its main limitation was its inability to discriminate between live and dead cells.Recently, propidium monoazide (PMA) together with qPCR has been used to overcome this problem, with good results for different bacterial species in different types of samples.Our objective was to implement this technique for analysing mortality in multi-species oral biofilms formed in vitro with five oral bacteria: Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus gordonii, Veillonella parvula, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia. We also tested its effectiveness on biofilms treated with an antiseptic solution containing 0.07% w/w cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC).Standardisation of the qPCR-PMA method was performed on pure, heat-killed planktonic cultures of each species, detecting mortality higher than 4 log in S. oralis, S. gordonii and F. nucleatum and higher than 2 for V. parvula and P. intermedia. We obtained similar results for all species when using CPC.When we analysed biofilms with qPCR-PMA, we found that the mortality in the non-CPC treated multi-species biofilms was lower than 1 log for all species. After treatment with CPC, the viability reduction was higher than 4 log in S. oralis and S. gordonii, higher than 3 log in F. nucleatum and P. intermedia and approximately 2 in V. parvula.In short, we standardised the conditions for using qPCR-PMA in 5 oral bacterial species and proved its usefulness for quantification of live and dead cells in multi-species oral biofilms formed in vitro, after use of an antiseptic.",

These enrichment cultures were obtained from oily sludge after an initial incubation of the oily sludge without any carbon source and then an enrichment transfer with n-alkanes (C15-C20) for acclimation. Activation of alkanes, methane precursor generation and methanogenic pathways are considered as three pivotal stages for the continuous methanogenesis from degradation of alkanes. The presence of functional genes encoding the alkylsuccinate synthase α-subunit indicated that fumarate addition is most likely the one of initial activation step for degradation of n-alkanes. Degradation intermediates of n-alkanes were octadecanoate, hexadecanoate, butyrate, isobutyrate, acetate and propionate, which could provide the appropriate substrates for acetate formation. Both methyl coenzyme M reductase gene and 16S rRNA gene analysis showed that microorganisms of Methanoseata were the most dominant methanogens, capable of using acetate as the electron donor to produce methane. Bacterial clone libraries showed organisms of Anaerolineaceae (within the phylum of Chloroflexi) were predominant (45.5%), indicating syntrophically cooperation with Methanosaeta archaea was likely involved in the process of methanogenic degradation of alkanes. Alkanes may initially be activated via fumarate addition and degraded to fatty acids, then converted to acetate, which was further converted to methane and carbon dioxide by methanogens.",

Here we report the presence of numerous natural variants of P450 BM3 (CYP102A1) within a species of Bacillus megaterium . Extensive amino acid substitutions (up to 5% of the total 1049 amino acid residues) were identified from the variants. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that this P450 gene evolve more rapidly than the rRNA gene locus. It was found that key catalytic residues in the substrate channel and active site are retained. Although there were no apparent variations in hydroxylation activity towards myristic acid (C 14 ) and palmitic acid (C 16 ), the hydroxylation rates of lauric acid (C 12 ) by the variants varied in the range of &gt;25-fold. Interestingly, catalytic activities of the variants are promiscuous towards non-natural substrates including human P450 substrates. It can be suggested that CYP102A1 variants can acquire new catalytic activities through site-specific mutations distal to the active site.",

The objectives of this study were to isolate and identify bacteriocinogenic LAB from various cheeses and yogurts and evaluate their antimicrobial effects on selected spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in vitro as well as on a food commodity. LAB were isolated using MRS and M17 media. The agar diffusion bioassay was used to screen for bacteriocin or bacteriocin-like substances (BLS) producing LAB using Lactobacillus sakei and Listeria innocua as indicator organisms. Out of 138 LAB isolates, 28 were found to inhibit these bacteria and were identified as strains of Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus thermophilu s, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus sakei subsp . sakei using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Eight isolates were tested for antimicrobial activity at 5°C and 20°C against L. innocua, Escherichia coli , Bacillus cereus , Pseudomonas fluorescens , Erwinia carotovora, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides using the agar diffusion bioassay, and also against Penicillium expansum , Botrytis cinerea and Monilinia frucitcola using the microdilution plate method. The effect of selected LAB strains on L. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions was also investigated. Twenty percent of our isolates produced BLS inhibiting the growth of L. innocua and/or Lact. sakei. Organic acids and/or H 2 O 2 produced by LAB and not the BLS had strong antimicrobial effects on all microorganisms tested with the exception of E. coli . Ent. faecium , Strep. thermophilus and Lact. casei effectively inhibited the growth of natural microflora and L. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions.

    "abstract": "The utilization of inoculants containing Azospirillum is becoming more popular due to increasing reports of expressive gains in grain yields. However, incompatibility with pesticides used in seed treatments represents a main limitation for a successful inoculation. Therefore, in this study we searched for alternatives methods for seed inoculation of maize and wheat, aiming to avoid the direct contact of bacteria with pesticides. Different doses of inoculants containing Azospirillum brasilense were employed to perform inoculation in-furrow, via soil spray at sowing and via leaf spray after seedlings had emerged, in comparison to seed inoculation. Experiments were conducted first under greenhouse controlled conditions and then confirmed in the field at different locations in Brazil. In the greenhouse, most parameters measured responded positively to the largest inoculant dose used in foliar sprays, but benefits could also be observed from both in-furrow and soil spray inoculation. However, our results present evidence that field inoculation with plant-growth promoting bacteria must consider inoculant doses, and point to the need of fine adjustments to avoid crossing the threshold of growth stimulation and inhibition. All inoculation techniques increased the abundance of diazotrophic bacteria in plant tissues, and foliar spray improved colonization of leaves, while soil inoculations favored root and rhizosphere colonization. In field experiments, inoculation with A. brasilense allowed for a 25 % reduction in the need for N fertilizers. Our results have identified alternative methods of inoculation that were as effective as the standard seed inoculation that may represent an important strategy to avoid the incompatibility between inoculant bacteria and pesticides employed for seed treatment.",

Human-to-human transmission of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurs most often when people are in the incubation stage of the disease or are carriers and have no symptoms. Therefore, in this study, was discussed the role of environmental factors and conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed as well as food, water and sewage, air, insects, inanimate surfaces, and hands in COVID-19 transmission. The results of studies on the stability of the SARS-CoV-2 on different levels showed that the resistance of this virus on smooth surfaces was higher than others. Temperature increase and sunlight can facilitate the destruction of SARS-COV-2 and the stability of it on surfaces. When the minimum ambient air temperature increases by 1 °C, the cumulative number of cases decreases by 0.86%. According to the latest evidence, the presence of coronavirus in the sewer has been confirmed, but there is no evidence that it is transmitted through sewage or contaminated drinking water. Also, SARS-COV-2 transmission through food, food packages, and food handlers has not been identified as a risk factor for the disease. According to the latest studies, the possibility of transmitting SARS-COV-2 bioaerosol through the air has been reported in the internal environment of ophthalmology. The results additionally show that infectious bio-aerosols can move up to 6 feet. There have been no reports of SARS-COV-2 transmission by blood-feeding arthropods such as mosquitoes.",

Microorganisms that produce unspecific oxidative enzymes such as laccases are a potential means to improve biodegradation of these compounds. Four strains of the bacterial genus Streptomyces (S. cyaneus, S. ipomoea, S. griseus and S. psammoticus) and the white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor were studied for their ability to produce active extracellular laccase in biologically treated wastewater with different carbon sources. Among the Streptomyces strains evaluated, only S. cyaneus produced extracellular laccase with sufficient activity to envisage its potential use in WWTPs. Laccase activity produced by T. versicolor was more than 20 times greater, the highest activity being observed with ash branches as the sole carbon source. The laccase preparation of S. cyaneus (abbreviated LSc) and commercial laccase from T. versicolor (LTv) were further compared in terms of their activity at different pH and temperatures, their stability, their substrate range, and their micropollutant oxidation efficiency. LSc and LTv showed highest activities under acidic conditions (around pH 3 to 5), but LTv was active over wider pH and temperature ranges than LSc, especially at near-neutral pH and between 10 and 25°C (typical conditions found in WWTPs). LTv was also less affected by pH inactivation. Both laccase preparations oxidized the three micropollutants tested, bisphenol A, diclofenac and mefenamic acid, with faster degradation kinetics observed for LTv. Overall, T. versicolor appeared to be the better candidate to remove micropollutants from wastewater in a dedicated post-treatment step.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of the simocyclinone biosynthesis (sim) gene cluster of Streptomyces antibioticus Tü6040 led to the identification of a putative pathway specific regulatory gene simReg1. In silico analysis places the SimReg1 protein in the OmpR-PhoB subfamily of response regulators. Gene replacement of simReg1 from the S. antibioticus chromosome completely abolishes simocyclinone production indicating that SimReg1 is a key regulator of simocyclinone biosynthesis. Results of the DNA-shift assays and reporter gene expression analysis are consistent with the idea that SimReg1 activates transcription of simocyclinone biosynthesis, transporter genes, regulatory gene simReg3 and his own transcription. The presence of extracts (simocyclinone) from S. antibioticus Tü6040 × pSSimR1-1 could dissociate SimReg1 from promoter regions. A preliminary model for regulation of simocyclinone biosynthesis and export is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Endotoxins are part of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria. They are potent immune stimulators and can lead to death if present in high concentrations. Feed additives, which bind endotoxins in the gastrointestinal tract of animals, could help to prevent their negative impact. The objective of our study was to determine the potential of a bentonite (Bentonite 1), a sodium bentonite (Bentonite 2), a chemically treated smectite (Organoclay 1) and a modified attapulgite (Organoclay 2) to bind endotoxins in vitro. Polymyxin B served as positive control. The kinetic chromogenic Limulus Amebocyte lysate test was adapted to measure endotoxin activity. Firstly, a single sorption experiment (10 endotoxin units/mL (EU/mL)) was performed. Polymyxin B and organoclays showed 100% binding efficiency. Secondly, the adsorption efficiency of sorbents in aqueous solution with increasing endotoxin concentrations (2,450 - 51,700 EU/mL) was investigated. Organoclay 1 (0.1%) showed a good binding efficiency in aqueous solution (average 81%), whereas Bentonite 1 (0.1%) obtained a lower binding efficiency (21-54%). The following absorbent capacities were calculated in highest endotoxin concentration: 5.59 mg/g (Organoclay 1) > 3.97 mg/g (Polymyxin B) > 2.58mg/g (Organoclay 2) > 1.55 mg/g (Bentonite 1) > 1.23 mg/g (Bentonite 2). Thirdly, a sorption experiment in artificial intestinal fluid was conducted. Especially for organoclays, which are known to be unspecific adsorbents, the endotoxin binding capacity was significantly reduced. In contrast, Bentonite 1 showed comparable results in artificial intestinal fluid and aqueous solution. Based on the results of this in vitro study, the effect of promising clay minerals will be investigated in in vivo trials.",

Given the lack of technology know-how on the cultivation of mushroom, this study was conducted in Wondo Genet College of Forestry and Natural Resource, with the aim to assess the suitability of selected substrates (agricultural and/or forest wastes) for oyster mushroom cultivation. Accordingly, four substrates (cotton seed, paper waste, wheat straw, and sawdust) were tested for their efficacy in oyster mushroom production. Pure culture of oyster mushroom was obtained from Mycology laboratory, Department of Plant Biology and Biodiversity Management, Addis Ababa University. The pure culture was inoculated on potato dextrose agar for spawn preparation. Then, the spawn containing sorghum was inoculated with the fungal culture for the formation of fruiting bodies on the agricultural wastes. The oyster mushroom cultivation was undertaken under aseptic conditions, and the growth and development of mushroom were monitored daily. Results of the study revealed that oyster mushroom can grow on cotton seed, paper waste, sawdust and wheat straw, with varying growth performances. The highest biological and economic yield, as well as the highest percentage of biological efficiency of oyster mushroom was obtained from cotton seed, while the least was from sawdust. The study recommends cotton seed, followed by paper waste as suitable substrates for the cultivation of oyster mushroom. It also suggests that there is a need for further investigation on various aspects of oyster mushroom cultivation in Ethiopia to promote the industry.",

Among the beneficial mechanisms associated with Azospirillum inoculation, emphasis has been given to the biological nitrogen fixation process and to the synthesis of phytohormones. In Brazil, the application of inoculants containing A. brasilense strains Ab-V5 and Ab-V6 to cereals is exponentially growing and in this study we investigated the effects of maize inoculation with these two strains applied on seeds or by leaf spray at the V2.5 stage growth—a strategy to relieve incompatibility with pesticides used for seed treatment. We also investigate the effects of spraying the metabolites of these two strains at V2.5. Maize growth was promoted by the inoculation of bacteria and their metabolites. When applied via foliar spray, although A. brasilense survival on leaves was confirmed by confocal microscopy and cell recovery, few cells were detected after 24 h, indicating that the effects of bacterial leaf spray might also be related to their metabolites. The major molecules detected in the supernatants of both strains were indole-3-acetic acid, indole-3-ethanol, indole-3-lactic acid and salicylic acid. RT-PCR of genes related to oxidative stress (APX1, APX2, CAT1, SOD2, SOD4) and plant defense (pathogenesis-related PR1, prp2 and prp4) was evaluated on maize leaves and roots. Differences were observed according to the gene, plant tissue, strain and method of application, but, in general, inoculation with Azospirillum resulted in up-regulation of oxidative stress genes in leaves and down-regulation in roots; contrarily, in general, PR genes were down-regulated in leaves and up-regulated in roots. Emphasis should be given to the application of metabolites, especially of Ab-V5 + Ab-V6 that in general resulted in the highest up-regulation of oxidative-stress and PR genes both in leaves and in roots. We hypothesize that the benefits of inoculation of Azospirillum on seeds or by leaf spray, as well as of leaf spraying of Azospirillum metabolites, are strongly correlated with the synthesis of phytohormones and by eliciting genes related to plant-stress tolerance and defense against pathogens.",

The use of synthetic chelates to prevent or correct iron-deficiency is not satisfactory mainly due to their poor biodegradability. The present work aimed to search suitable microorganisms to produce alternative, environment-friendly iron-chelating agents (siderophores). For this purpose, the performance of five bacteria (Azotobacter vinelandii, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus subtilis, Pantoea allii and Rhizobium radiobacter) was evaluated, regarding siderophore production kinetics, level of siderophore production (determined by chrome azurol S, CAS method), type of siderophore produced (using Arnow and Csaky's tests) and iron-chelating capacity at pH 9.0. All bacteria were in stationary phase at 24 h, except A. vinelandii (at 72 h) and produced the maximum siderophore amount (80-140 µmol L-1) between 24 and 48 h, with the exception of A. vinelandii (at 72 h). The analysis of culture filtrates revealed the presence of catechol-type siderophores for B. subtilis and R. radiobacter and hydroxamate-type siderophores for B. megaterium and P. allii. In the case of A. vinelandii, both siderophore-types (catechol and hydroxamates) were detected. The highest iron-chelating capacity, at pH 9.0, was obtained by B. megaterium followed by B. subtilis and A. vinelandii. Therefore, these three bacteria strains are the most promising bacteria for siderophore production and chlorosis correction under alkaline conditions.",

However, these bioplastics are currently far more expensive than petrochemical plastics. Many researchers are investigating the use of inexpensive substrates derived from waste streams. Waste frying oil is abundant and can be used in PHA production without filtration. Cupriavidus necator (formerly known as Ralstonia eutropha ) is a versatile organism for the production of PHAs. Small-scale batch fermentation studies have been set up, using different concentrations of pure vegetable oil, heated vegetable oil and waste frying oil. These oils are all rapeseed oils. It has been shown that Cupriavidus necator produced the homopolymer polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) from the rapeseed oils. The achieved PHB concentration from waste frying oil was 1.2 g/l, which is similar to a concentration that can be obtained from glucose. The PHB harvest from pure oil and heated oil was 0.62 g/l and 0.9 g/l respectively. A feed of waste frying oil could thus achieve more biopolymer than pure vegetable oil. While the use of a waste product is beneficial from a life-cycle perspective, PHB is not the only product that can be made from waste oil. The collection of waste frying oil is becoming more widespread, making waste oil a good alternative to purified oil or glucose for PHB production.",

We also observed that toxicity did not generally follow a trend based on the aldehyde, acid, ketone or alcohol classification of phenolic compounds, but rather that other structural properties such as additional functional groups attached to the compound may determine its toxicity. Three distinctive growth patterns that effectively clustered all the compounds involved in the screening into three categories.

These wastes are generated in large amounts throughout the year, and are the most abundant renewable resources on earth. Due to the large availability and composition rich in compounds that could be used in other processes, there is a great interest on the reuse of these wastes, both from economical and environmental view points. The economic aspect is based on the fact that such wastes may be used as low-cost raw materials for the production of other value-added compounds, with the expectancy of reducing the production costs. The environmental concern is because most of the agro-industrial wastes contain phenolic compounds and/or other compounds of toxic potential; which may cause deterioration of the environment when the waste is discharged to the nature. Although the production of bioethanol offers many benefits, more research is needed in the aspects like feedstock preparation, fermentation technology modification, etc., to make bioethanol more economically viable.",

Following pre-treatment through adsorption on activated carbon, 25%-50% (v/v) pre-treated vinasse was utilized leading to 70% maximum accumulation of PHA. Maximum PHA concentration of 19.7 g/l, product yield coefficient (based on total carbohydrates) of 0.87 and 0.21 g/l h volumetric productivity were achieved. Concomitant lowering of BOD 5 of pre-treated vinasse by at least 78% and COD by at least 80% was attained at the end of this process. The PHA was recovered by osmotic lysis of the cells and purification by sodium hypochlorite and organic solvents. Through UV–vis spectroscopy, gas chromatography, differential scanning calorimetry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the PHA was identified as poly-3-(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate). The 3-hydroxyvalerate content was 12.36 mol % (utilizing 25% pre-treated vinasse) and 14.09 mol % (utilizing 50% pre-treated vinasse). High salt concentration in the medium allowed this process without sterile conditions and thus reduction in costs of sterilization can be envisaged. Activated charcoal pre-treatment of vinasse is economical than competing processes such as ultrafiltration of whey, extrusion and enzymatic treatment of rice and corn starch. Without impacting sugar prices, this process can easily be integrated into a distillery that has fermentation equipment and trained personnel. High PHA content, productivity, zero-cost carbon source, low-cost isolation of a high-purity product and potential integration into ethanol manufacturing unit with concomitant wastewater treatment should merit further development of this process to higher scales.",

Aerobic batch tests were used to determine the nitrifying activities while fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to quantify the fractions of AOB and NOB in the activated sludge. The results showed that nitrifying bacteria accounted for 1-10% of the total population. Nitrosomonas and Nitrospira were the dominant bacteria for AOB and NOB respectively. Moreover, the average percentage of AOB was 1.27% and that of NOB was 4.02%. The numerical ratios of NOB/AOB varied between 1.72 and 5.87. The average ammonium uptake rate and nitrite uptake rate were 3.25 ± 0.52 mg (NH4+-N)/g(VSS) h and 4.49 ± 0.49 mg (NO2--N)/g(VSS) h, respectively. Correspondingly, the activity of NOB was 1.08-2.00 times higher than that of AOB. Thus, NOB was the dominating bacteria in nitrifying communities. The year-round data of Dianzicun (W6) also expressed a similar trend. Since NOB had higher activities than that of AOB, a large nitrite oxidation pool could be formed, which guaranteed that no nitrite would be accumulated. Therefore, stable nitrification could be achieved. A conceptual model was proposed to describe the population variation of AOB and NOB in a nitrifying community.",

Different nitrogen and carbohydrate rich supplements have been evaluated in crops with a substantial impact on mushroom yield and quality; however, there is still controversy regarding the nutritional requirements of mushrooms and the necessity for the development of new commercial additives. The addition of external nutrients increases the productivity of some low-yielding mushroom varieties, and therefore is a useful tool for the industry to introduce new commercially viable varieties. Spent mushroom compost is a waste material that could feasibly be recycled as a substrate to support a new commercially viable crop cycle when amended with supplements. On the other hand, a new line of research based on the use of mushroom growth promoting microorganisms is rising above the horizon to supplement the native microbiota, which appears to cover nutritional deficiencies. Several supplements employed for the cultivated mushrooms and their agronomic potential in terms of yield and quality are reviewed in this paper as a useful guide to evaluate the nutritional requirements of the crop and to design new formulas for commercial supplementation.",

Naturally produced glycolipids and lipopeptides are found as a mixture of congeners, which increases their antimicrobial potency. Sensitive analysis techniques, such as liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, enable the fingerprinting of different biosurfactant congeners within a naturally produced crude extract. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens ST34 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ST5, isolated from wastewater, were screened for biosurfactant production. Biosurfactant compounds were solvent extracted and characterised using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Results indicated that B. amyloliquefaciens ST34 produced C",

Four of the strains, CNPSo 2476, CNPSo 2477, CNPSo 2478 and CNPSo 2480 were positive for the nitrogen fixation ability evaluated through the acetylene reduction assay and amplification of nifH gene. Two Bacillus strains (CNPSo 2477 and CNPSo 2478) showed outstanding skills for the production of IAA, siderophores and lytic enzymes, but were not good candidates as growth promoters, because they reduced seed germination. However, the same strains were antagonists against the pathogenic fungi Fusarium verticillioides, Colletotrichum graminicola, Bipolaris maydis and Cercospora zea-maydis. As an indication of favorable bacterial action, Enterobacter sp. CNPSo 2480 and Bacillus sp. CNPSo 2481 increased the root volume by 44% and 39%, respectively, and the seed germination by 47% and 56%, respectively. Therefore, these two strains are good candidates for future testing as biological inoculants for corn.",

    "abstract": "In the last years, the use of probiotics, including Lactobacillus species, has received much attention to prevent and treat vaginal disorders. These species have been described as having the ability to colonize the epithelial surface and produce antimicrobial metabolites that are able to control the remaining vaginal microflora. This study aimed to identify and characterize, for the first time, a bacteriocin natively produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus KS400 (probiotic strain from Gynoflor®-Medinova AG, Switzerland) and its antimicrobial activity against relevant urogenital pathogens. After organic acids and hydrogen peroxide neutralization in the fermented Lactobacillus acidophilus KS400 culture medium, bacteriocin activity was tested against the indicator microorganism Lactobacillus delbrueckii ATCC9649. The fermentation of Lactobacillus acidophilus KS400 for bacteriocin production was carried out in batch mode, and its antimicrobial activity, optical density and pH were monitored. After production and extraction, the bacteriocin molecular weight was estimated by electrophoresis and tested against vaginal pathogenic microorganisms. As described for other bacteriocins, batch fermentation profiles indicated that bacteriocin production occurs during the exponential growth phase of the lactobacilli, and declines during their stationary growth phase. The molecular weight of the bacteriocin is approximately 7.5 kDa. The bacteriocin containing protein extract was shown to inhibit the growth of Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the indicator strain Lactobacillus delbrueckii ATCC9649. We conclude that L. acidophilus KS400 produces bacteriocin with antimicrobial activity against relevant urogenital pathogens.",

The ability of clear zone formation on emulsified poly(butylene succinate-co-adipate) (PBSA) was observed for 116 microorganisms (95.87%), on poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) for 73 microorganisms (60.33%), and on poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) for 102 microorganisms (84.3%). Moreover, the growth of microorganisms on poly(lactic acid) (PLA) agar plates was observed for 56 microorganisms (46.28%). Based on the 16S rRNA sequence, 10 bacterial strains which showed the highest ability for biodegradation were identified as species belonging to Pseudomonas sp. and Rhodococcus sp. The isolated fungal strains were tested for polycaprolactone films and commercial corn and potato starch bags degradation under laboratory conditions. Strains 16G (based on the analysis of a partial 18S rRNA sequence, identified as Clonostachys rosea) and 16H (identified as Trichoderma sp.) showed the highest capability for biodegradation. A particularly high capability for biodegradation was observed for the strain Clonostachys rosea, which showed 100% degradation of starch films and 52.91% degradation of PCL films in a 30-day shake flask experiment. The main advantage of the microorganisms isolated from Arctic environment is the ability to grow at low temperature and efficient biodegradation under this condition. The data suggest that C. rosea can be used in natural and laboratory conditions for degradations of bioplastics.",

Out of the 118 strains isolated thirty eight were found to possess cellulose degrading activity and phylogenetic studies of the 16S rDNA sequence revealed that all cellulolytic strains belonged to the phyla γ-Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. Within the three phyla, species belonging to five different genera were identified ( Klebsiella , Stenotrophomonas, Microbacterium, Bacillus and Enterococcus ). Bacterial growth on sugarcane biomass as well as extracellular endo-glucanase activity induced on soluble cellulose was found to be highest in species belonging to genera Bacillus and Klebsiella . Good cellulolytic activity correlated with high extracellular protein concentrations. In addition, scanning microscopy studies revealed attachment of cellulolytic strains to different sugarcane substrates. The results of this study indicate the possibility to find efficient cellulose degrading enzymes and microorganisms from intestines of insect larvae feeding on sugarcane and their possible application in industrial processing of sugarcane biomass such as second generation biofuel production.",

As lipid accumulation is species and substrate specific, selection of an appropriate strain is critical. Five strains of Y. lipolytica, a known model oleaginous yeast, were investigated to explore their potential for biodiesel production when grown on glucose and inexpensive wastes. All the strains were found to accumulate > 20% (w/w) of their dry cell mass as lipids with neutral lipid as the major fraction when grown on glucose and on wastes such as waste cooking oil (WCO), waste motor oil (WMO). However, amongst them, Y. lipolytica NCIM 3589, a tropical marine yeast, exhibited a maximal lipid/biomass coefficient, YL/X on 30 g L-1 glucose (0.29 g g-1) and on 100 g L-1 WCO (0.43 g g-1) with a high content of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids similar to conventional vegetable oils used for biodiesel production. The experimentally determined and predicted biodiesel properties of strain 3589 when grown on glucose and WCO, such as density (0.81 and 1.04 g cm-3), viscosity (4.44 and 3.6 mm2 s-1), SN (190.81 and 256), IV (65.7 and 37.8) and CN (56.6 and 50.8) are reported for the first time for Y. lipolytica and correlate well with specified standards.

The anti-tumour potential of these molecules is being studied, although results are still scarce and few data are available regarding the mechanisms underlying such activity. In this work, the anti-tumour activity of a surfactin produced by Bacillus subtilis 573 and a glycoprotein (BioEG) produced by Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei A20 was evaluated. Both biosurfactants were tested against two breast cancer cell lines, T47D and MDA-MB-231, and a non-tumour fibroblast cell line (MC-3 T3-E1), specifically regarding cell viability and proliferation. Surfactin was found to decrease viability of both breast cancer cell lines studied. A 24 h exposure to 0.05 g l(-1) surfactin led to inhibition of cell proliferation as shown by cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. Similarly, exposure of cells to 0.15 g l(-1) BioEG for 48 h decreased cancer cells' viability, without affecting normal fibroblasts. Moreover, BioEG induced the cell cycle arrest at G1 for both breast cancer cell lines. The biosurfactant BioEG was shown to be more active than surfactin against the studied breast cancer cells. The results gathered in this work are very promising regarding the biosurfactants potential for breast cancer treatment and encourage further work with the BioEG glycoprotein.",

Maximum decolorization was found under static conditions by using saw dust and yeast extract as carbon and nitrogen source. It also showed promising potential to decolorize mixture of multiple dyes at a rate of more than 86% in 5 days. Decolorization of dye had positive influence on the growth of bacterium as growth rate was increased along with decolorization. The cleavage of azo bond was confirmed through TLC, HPLC and GC-MS analysis. The dye metabolites produced during bacterial treatment are linked to various pathways including ATP synthesis process. The absence of peaks of wavelength 1612/cm and 1532/cm in bacterially treated FTIR sample demonstrated the cleavage of azo bond. Microbial growth in decolorized dye wastewater shows that bacterially decolorized wastewater is unharmful for the growth of micro-flora. The high decolorization ability of A. aquatilis 3c to convert toxic azo dyes into useful end products may find potential applications in the environmental biotechnology.",

Despite an increasing number of applications for this yeast, relatively few studies have focused on uptake and metabolism of carbon sources, and the metabolic basis for carbon flow to the different products. The focus of this work was quantification of the cellular performance of Y. lipolytica during growth on glycerol, glucose or a mixture of the two. Carbon substrate uptake rate, growth rate, oxygen utilisation (requirement and uptake rate) and polyol yields were estimated in batch cultivations at 1 litre scale. When glucose was used as the sole carbon and energy source, the growth rate was 0.24 h-1 and biomass and CO2 were the only products. Growth on glycerol proceeded at approximately 0.30 h-1, and the substrate uptake rate was 0.02 mol L-1 h-1 regardless of the starting glycerol concentration (10, 20 or 45 g L-1). Utilisation of glycerol was accompanied by higher oxygen uptake rates compared to glucose growth, indicating import of glycerol occurred initially via phosphorylation of glycerol into glycerol-3-phosphate. Based on these results it could be speculated that once oxygen limitation was reached, additional production of NADH created imbalance in the cofactor pools and the polyol formation observed could be a result of cofactor recycling to restore the balance in metabolism.",

While the donors displayed differences in baseline gut microbiota composition, commonly increased bacteria after pectin fermentation included Lachnospira, Dorea, Clostridium, and Sutterella. Regarding SCFAs, acetate levels rapidly increased with incubation with pectin, and butyrate levels also increased after 6 h of incubation. The results suggest that pectin fermentation increases bacterial species belonging to Clostridium cluster XIV (Lachnospira, Dorea, and Clostridium), with Lachnospira displaying the greatest increase.

The monitored results of the activated sludge sampled from six full-scale WWTPs indicated that Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Acidobacteria and Nitrospirae were dominant phyla, and Nitrospira was the most abundant and ubiquitous genus across the three biological zones. The anaerobic-, anoxic- and oxic-zones shared approximately similar percentages across the 50 most abundant genera, and three genera (i.e. uncultured bacterium PeM15, Methanosaeta and Bellilinea) presented statistically significantly differential abundance in the anoxic-zone. Illumina high-throughput sequences related to ammonium oxidizer organisms and denitrifiers with top50 abundance in all samples were Nitrospira, uncultured Nitrosomonadaceae, Dechloromonas, Thauera, Denitratisoma, Rhodocyclaceae (norank) and Comamonadaceae (norank). Moreover, environmental variables such as water temperature, water volume, influent ammonium nitrogen, influent chemical oxygen demand (COD) and effluent COD exhibited significant correlation to the microbial community according to the Monte Carlo permutation test analysis (p < 0.05). The abundance of Nitrospira, uncultured Nitrosomonadaceae and Denitratisoma presented strong positive correlations with the influent/effluent concentration of COD and ammonium nitrogen, while Dechloromonas, Thauera, Rhodocyclaceae (norank) and Comamonadaceae (norank) showed positive correlations with water volume and temperature. The established relationship between microbial community and environmental variables in different biologically functional zones of the six representative WWTPs at different geographical locations made the present work of potential use for evaluation of practical wastewater treatment processes.",

However, the susceptibility to protease is a drawback for potential peptides to be clinical used. d-amino acid substitution can be one way to increase the proteolytic stability of peptides. In the present study, we synthesized the d-lysines substituted analog (d-lys-MPI) and the d-enantiomer of polybia-MPI (D-MPI) to improve the proteolytic resistance of polybia-MPI. Our results showed that, the stability of its d-amino acid partially substituted analog d-lys-MPI was increased. However, it lost antimicrobial activity at the tested concentration with the loss of α-helix content. As shown in the CD spectra, after substitution, the spectra of D-MPI is symmetrical to MPI, indicated it turned into left hand α-helical conformation. Excitingly, the stability of D-MPI toward the tested protease was improved greatly. Notably, the antimicrobial activity of D-MPI was comparable to its L-counterpart MPI, even improved. In addition, the hemolytic activity of D-MPI was lowered. This also indicated that the action target of antimicrobial peptide polybia-MPI was not chiral specific. So, D-MPI may offer a therapeutic strategy to defend the infection of microbes, considering its stability to protease and relatively lower cytotoxicity to human erythrocytes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Antibiotics are lifesaving therapeutic drugs that have been used by human for decades. They are used both in the fight against bacterial pathogens for both human and for animal feeding. However, of recent, their effects on the gut microbial compositions and diversities have attracted much attention. Existing literature have established the dysbiosis (reduced diversity) in the gut microbiota in association with antibiotic and antibiotic drug doses. In the light of spelling out the varying effects of antibiotic use on gut microbiota, this review aimed at given an account on the degree of gut microbial alteration caused by common antibiotics. While some common antibiotics are found to destroy the common phyla, other debilitating effects were observed. The effects can be attributed to the mode of mechanism, the class of antibiotic, the degree of resistance of the antibiotic used, the dosage used during the treatment, the route of administration, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties and the spectrum of the antibiotic agent. Health status, stress or the type of diet an individual feeds on could be a great proportion as confounding factors. While it is understood that only the bacterial communities are explored in the quest to establishing the role of gut in health, other gut microbial species are somehow contributing to the dysbiosis status of the gut microbiota. Until now, long term natural fluctuations like diseases outbreaks and mutations of the strain might as well rendered alteration to the gut independent of antibiotic treatments.",

It is first ever reported S. enterica 43C bared extreme resistance against heavy metal consortia in order of Pb2+>Cd2+>As3+>Zn2+>Cr6+>Cu2+>Hg2+. Cd2+ stress altered growth pattern of the bacterium in time dependent manner. It could remove nearly 57 % Cd2+ from the medium over a period of 8 days. Kinetic and thermodynamic studies based on various adsorption isotherm models (Langmuir and Freundlich) depicted the Cd2+ biosorption as spontaneous, feasible and endothermic in nature. Interestingly, the bacterium followed pseudo first order kinetics, making it a good biosorbent for heavy metal ions. The S. enterica 43C Cd2+ processivity was significantly influenced by temperature, pH, initial Cd2+ concentration, biomass dosage and co-metal ions. FTIR analysis of the bacterium revealed the active participation of amide and carbonyl moieties in Cd2+ adsorption confirmed by EDX analysis. Electron micrographs beckoned further surface adsorption and increased bacterial size due to intracellular Cd2+ accumulation. An overwhelming increase in glutathione and other non-protein thiols levels played a significant role in thriving oxidative stress generated by metal cations. Presence of metallothionein clearly depicted the role of such proteins in bacterial metal resistance mechanism. The present study results clearly declare S. enterica 43C a suitable candidate for green chemistry to bioremediate environmental Cd2+.",

Results of this study indicated that biochar amendment significantly reduced N2O emissions from manure composting, primarily due to suppression of the nirK gene abundance of denitrifying bacteria. Pearson's correlation analysis showed a significant positive correlation between nirK abundance and N2O fluxes, while a negative correlation between nosZ density and N2O fluxes. Simultaneously, a linear correlation between nirK gene abundance minus nosZ gene abundance with N2O fluxes was also observed. In addition, a statistical model for estimating N2O emissions based on the bacterial denitrifying functional genes was developed and verified to adequately fit the observed emissions.

Among different technologies for hydrogen production, photosynthetic microorganism, such as microalgae, has a great potential to produce hydrogen, by using only water and sunlight. One of the great opportunities is that microalgae can be cultivated in urban wastewater, which contains sources of carbon and nutrients, helping to reduce the cost of biomass and energy production. Microalgae C. vulgaris and S. obliquus immobilized grown in urban wastewater was proposed for the production of biohydrogen by sulfur deprivation and two light quality prior to anaerobic condition at pH 7.5 and 30 °C and 140 µE/m2/s of light intensity.

Persister cells, often found in biofilms, are metabolically dormant, and thus, are highly tolerant to all traditional antibiotics and represent a major drug resistance mechanism. In the present study, 36 diverse indole derivatives were investigated with the aim of identifying novel compounds that inhibit persisters and biofilm formation by Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus. 5-Iodoindole and other halogenated indoles, 4-fluoroindole, 7-chloroindole, and 7-bromoindole, eradicated persister formation by E. coli and S. aureus, and 5-iodoindole most potently inhibited biofilm formation by the two bacteria. Unlike other antibiotics, 5-iodoindole did not induce persister cell formation, and 5-iodoindole inhibited the production of the immune-evasive carotenoid staphyloxanthin in S. aureus; hence, 5-iodoindole diminished the production of virulence factors in this strain. These results demonstrate halogenated indoles are potentially useful for controlling bacterial antibiotic resistance.",

The outcomes conclude that KPF ameliorates Cisplatin-mediated nephrotoxicity by modulating oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis via ERK and NF-κB pathway.",

    "abstract": "Abstract From the emerging studies, the more diverse the microbial population in the gut, the healthier the gut. Health benefits are associated with the functional characteristics of these diverse microbial genes. Extrinsic factors causing dysbiosis are extensively studied however, linking the varying degree of consequences to the respective factors and therapeutic possibilities are not explored at length. This review aims to examine from previous studies and put forward the types of dysbiosis, the immediate consequences and the scientific approaches to restore disrupted microbiota. Dietary supplements are found to be one of the factors contributing profoundly to the alteration of gut microbiota. While diet rich in fibre and fermented food established a diverse microbiome and produce vital metabolites, high fat, animal proteins and high caloric carbohydrate are as well relative to dysbiosis among infants, adult or diseases individuals. The intermittent fasting, feeding methods, the pH and water quality are among the factors associated with dysbiosis. Prebiotics and Probiotics maintain and restore gut homeostasis. Antibiotic-induced dysbiosis are relatively on the spectrum of activity, the pharmacokinetics properties, the dose taken during the treatment route of administration and the duration of drug therapy. The higher the altitude, the lesser the diversity. Extreme temperatures as well are related to reduced microbial activity and metabolism. Delivery through caserium-section deprived the newborn from restoring valuable vaginal bacterial species and the baby will instead assumed intestinal microbiota-like. While exercise and oxidative stress contribute even though moderately, fecal microbial transfer (FMT) also influence gut microbiota.",

    "abstract": "The ability to solubilize fixed inorganic phosphorus (P) for plant growth is important for increasing crop yield. More P can be released by inoculating soil with inorganic-phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (iPSBs). We used 96-well microplates instead of traditional 200-mm petri dishes to rapidly screen iPSB strains for their solubilizing ability. We simultaneously obtained 76 iPSB isolates from 576 wells containing two agricultural soils. This method conveniently identified positive iPSB strains and effectively prevented fungal cross-contamination. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees of the isolated strains showed that Bacillus megaterium was the most dominant iPSB, and strains Y99, Y95, Y924 and Y1412 were selected as representatives for the analysis of P solubilization. Succinic acid was the main organic acid of B. megaterium for releasing P. It was strongly correlated with the increase in soluble P concentration during 168 h of incubation of these four strains. pH was negatively exponentially correlated with the amount of soluble P in the medium, and the amount of succinic acid was strongly linearly correlated with the amount of P released (P < 0.001), suggesting that organic acid may mobilize microbial P. Our study provides an efficient and effective method for identifying and analyzing the growth of iPSB strains able to solubilize inorganic P and gives a better understanding of the mechanism of P solubilization.",

However, conventional chemical extraction methods of chitin from marine waste are costly and hazardous to the environment. Here we report a study where shrimp waste was co-fermented with Lactobacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum ATCC 14917 and Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis ATCC 6051 and chitin was successfully extracted after deproteinization and demineralization of the prawn shells. The glucose supplementation for fermentation was replaced by waste substrates to reduce cost and maximize waste utilization. A total of 10 carbon sources were explored, namely sugarcane molasses, light corn syrup, red grape pomace, white grape pomace, apple peel, pineapple peel and core, potato peel, mango peel, banana peel and sweet potato peel. The extracted chitin was chemically characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) to measure the degree of acetylation, elemental analysis (EA) to measure the carbon/nitrogen ratio and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to measure the degree of crystallinity. A comparison of the quality of the crude extracted chitin was made between the different waste substrates used for fermentation and the experimental results showed that the waste substrates generally make a suitable replacement for glucose in the fermentation process. Red grape pomace resulted in recovery of chitin with a degree of deacetylation of 72.90%, a carbon/nitrogen ratio of 6.85 and a degree of crystallinity of 95.54%. These achieved values were found to be comparable with and even surpassed commercial chitin.",

The bacterial strain was found to grow between 4 to 45°C (opt. 25°C) and 3 to 14 pH (opt. 5 pH) on prescribed growth medium, coinciding with production of laccase in laccase producing medium. However, the production of laccase was more consistent toward alkaline pH. Laccase enzyme was partially purified using gel filtration chromatography. The molecular mass of laccase was determined ~53 kDa on native PAGE. The Km and Vmax values were determined to be 0.10 mM and 50.00 μM min(-1), respectively, with ABTS. Inoculum size (4.0% v/v at 1.5 O.D.) resulted in significantly higher production of laccase. Carbon and nitrogen sources also affected the laccase production significantly. All the carbon sources enhanced laccase production, xylose being the best enhancer (P < 0.01). Among nitrogen sources, organic sources were found to act as inhibitors (P < 0.01), and among the in-organic sources only sodium nitrate enhanced the laccase production. Low molecular weight organic solvents significantly (P < 0.01) enhanced laccase production up to 24 h of incubation with a decline in later incubation period. Production of laccase by the psychrotolerant bacterium in wide range of temperature and pH is likely to have inference in biotechnological processes.",

However, low biomass and low production rate due to acid stress are still major challenges that must be overcome in industrial processes. Although acid resistance in AAB is important to the production of high acidity vinegar, the acid resistance mechanisms of AAB have yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we discuss the classification of AAB species and their metabolic processes and review potential acid resistance factors and acid resistance mechanisms in various strains. In addition, we analyze the quorum sensing systems of Komagataeibacter and Gluconacetobacter to provide new ideas for investigation of acid resistance mechanisms in AAB in the form of signaling pathways. The results presented herein will serve as an important reference for selective breeding of high acid resistance AAB and optimization of acetic acid fermentation processes.",

Therefore, two compounds namely M-1 and M-2 were purified from Origanum vulgare L. and were identified as carvacrol and thymol, respectively. Antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of these compounds along with chlorhexidine digluconate using various assays was determined against dental caries causing bacteria Streptococcus mutans. The IC50 values of carvacrol (M-1) and thymol (M-2) against S. mutans were 65 and 54 µg/ml, respectively. Live and dead staining and the MTT assays reveal that a concentration of 100 µg/ml of these compounds reduced the viability and the metabolic activity of S. mutans by more than 50%. Biofilm formation on the surface of polystyrene plates was significantly reduced by M-1 and M-2 at 100 µg/ml as observed under scanning electron microscope and by colorimetric assay. These results were in agreement with RT-PCR studies. Wherein exposure to 25 µg/ml of M-1 and M-2 showed a 2.2 and 2.4-fold increase in Autolysin gene (AtlE) expression level, respectively. While an increase of 1.3 and 1.4 fold was observed in the super oxide dismutase gene (sodA) activity with the same concentrations of M-1 and M-2, respectively. An increase in the ymcA gene and a decrease in the gtfB gene expression levels was observed following the treatment with M-1 and M-2. These results strongly suggest that carvacrol and thymol isolated from O. vulgare L. exhibit good bactericidal and antibiofilm activity against S. mutans and can be used as a green alternative to control dental caries.",

After three rounds of functional screening, a mutant with three amino acid changes (E116K, N229D, I393T) named PIE5 was selected.

Microbiota profiles in fecal DNA were characterized by PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA V4 variable region and deep sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq platform. The CCa-associated gut microbiota had an increasing trend in alpha diversity, although statistical significance was not reached. Inter-group variability in community structure by beta diversity analysis showed a clear separation between cancer patients and healthy controls. Gut microbiota profiles were different between patients and controls; namely, the proportions of Proteobacteria phylum was notably higher in patients with CCa (ρ = 0.012). Seven genera differentiated significantly in relative abundance between CCa and controls (all ρ < 0.05), including Escherichia–Shigella, Roseburia, Pseudomonas, Lachnoclostridium, Lachnospiraceae_UCG-004, Dorea and Succinivibrio. The characteristic microbiome in CCa patients was also identified by linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe).

The total amino acids content increased from 3.04 ± 0.14 mg/g in unfermented okara to 5.41 ± 1.21 mg/g in okara fermented with B. subtilis WX-17. Total fatty acids content increased from 153.04 ± 5.10 to 166.78 ± 2.41 mg/g okara, after fermentation. Antioxidant content (DPPH) also increased by 6.4 times after fermentation. To gain insight into the mechanism, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was carried out. In total, 49 metabolites were detected, which could be classified mainly into carbohydrates, TCA cycle metabolites, amino acids and fatty acids. The decrease in carbohydrate metabolites, showed that glycolysis was upregulated. This would have provided the energy and metabolic flux towards the amino acid and fatty acid pathway. This is also in line with the increased amino acids and fatty acid production seen in okara fermented with B. subtilis WX-17. The findings of this work demonstrated the potential of using B. subtilis WX-17 fermentation, to enhance the nutritional profile of okara.

    "abstract": "At present, antibiotic resistance is one of the most pressing issues in healthcare globally. The development of new medicine for clinical applications is significantly less than the emergence of multiple drug-resistant bacteria, thus modification of existing medicines is a useful avenue. Among several approaches, nanomedicine is considered of potential therapeutic value. Herein, we have synthesized Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) conjugated with clinically-approved drugs (Quercetin, Ceftriaxone, Ampicillin, Naringin and Amphotericin B) with the aim to evaluate their antibacterial activity against several Gram-positive (Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli K1, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria. The nanoparticles and their drug conjugates were characterized using UV-visible spectrophotometry, dynamic light scattering, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. Antibacterial activity was performed by dilution colony forming unit method and finally 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays were performed to determine their cytotoxic effects against human cell lines. ZnO-NPs revealed maxima surface plasmon resonance band at 374 and after conjugation with beta-cyclodextrin at 379 nm, polydispersity with size in range of 25-45 nm with pointed shaped morphology. When conjugated with ZnO-NPs, drug efficacy against MDR bacteria was enhanced significantly. In particular, Ceftriaxone- and Ampicillin-conjugated ZnO-NPs exhibited potent antibacterial effects. Conversely, ZnO-NPs and drugs conjugated NPs showed negligible cytotoxicity against human cell lines except Amphotericin B (57% host cell death) and Amphotericin B-conjugated with ZnO-NPs (37% host cell death). In conclusion, the results revealed that drugs loaded on ZnO-NPs offer a promising approach to combat increasingly resistant bacterial infections.",

    "abstract": "Psychrotrophic Pseudomonas is one of the significant microbes that lead to putrefaction in chilled meat. One of the biggest problems in the detection of Pseudomonas is that several species are seemingly identical. Currently, antibiotic resistance is one of the most significant challenges facing the world's health and food security. Therefore, this study was designed to apply an accurate technique for eliminating the identification discrepancy of Pseudomonas species and to study their resistance against various antimicrobials. A total of 320 chicken meat specimens were cultivated, and the isolated bacteria' were phenotypically recognized. Protein analysis was carried out for cultured isolates via Microflex LT. The resistance of Pseudomonas isolates was recorded through Vitek® 2 AST-GN83 cards. Overall, 69 samples were identified as Pseudomonas spp. and included 18 Pseudomonas lundensis (P. lundensis), 16 Pseudomonas fragi (P. fragi), 13 Pseudomonas oryzihabitans (P. oryzihabitans), 10 Pseudomonas stutzeri (P. stutzeri), 5 Pseudomonas fluorescens (P. fluorescens), 4 Pseudomonas putida (P. putida), and 3 Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) isolates. Microflex LT identified all Pseudomonas isolates (100%) correctly with a score value ≥ 2.00. PCA positively discriminated the identified isolates into various groups. The antimicrobial resistance levels against Pseudomonas isolates were 81.16% for nitrofurantoin, 71% for ampicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam, 65.22% for cefuroxime and ceftriaxone, 55% for aztreonam, and 49.28% for ciprofloxacin. The susceptibilities were 100% for cefotaxime, 98.55% for ceftazidime, 94.20% for each piperacillin/tazobactam and cefepime, 91.3% for cefazolin. In conclusion, chicken meat was found to be contaminated with different Pseudomonas spp., with high incidence rates of P. lundensis. Microflex LT is a potent tool for distinguishing Pseudomonads at the species level.",

In recent years, bulk nanobubbles, which have extraordinary properties differing from those of microbubbles, including high stability and long residence times in water, large specific surface areas, high gas transfer efficiency and interface potential, and the capability to generate free radicals, have shown attractive technological advantages and promising application prospects for wastewater treatment. In this review, the basic characteristics of bulk nanobubbles are summarized in detail, and recent findings related to their implementation pathways and mechanisms in organic wastewater treatment are systematically discussed, which includes improving the air flotation process, increasing water aeration to promote aerobic biological technologies including biological activated carbon, activated sludge, and membrane bioreactors, and generating active free radicals that oxidise organic compounds. Finally, the current technological difficulties of bulk nanobubbles are analysed, and future focus areas for research on bulk nanobubble technology are also proposed.",

Further, this study elucidated the cellular and molecular mechanisms of nanoparticles for anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects on human lung cancer cells (A549) and compared them with commercial drug cisplatin. The size of the spherical nanoparticle was 12.96 nm with negative zeta potential. Up-regulation of caspase 3,9 and p53, Annexin V-FITC/PI, DAPI staining, and ROS production indicated the remarkable apoptotic effect of AgNPs compared to cisplatin. Moreover, down-regulation of MMP2/MMP9 scratch and matrigel assays revealed anti-metastatic properties of AgNPs. Cell cycle analysis and downregulation of cyclin D1 indicated cancer cell cessation in the G0/G1 phase.

This study aimed to isolate Streptococcus mutans from different oral samples taken from saliva and dental plaques specimens to determine their capability for biofilm formation and to evaluate the antibiofilm activity of aqueous and alcoholic green tea extracts. The results revealed that 35, 4 and 1% of recovered dental plaque isolates exhibited strong, moderate and weak biofilm formation capabilities versus 26, 12 and 2% for those recovered from saliva. Two green tea extracts (aqueous and alcoholic) were tested for their antibiofilm formation activity against some selected S. mutans isolates. The results showed that the minimum biofilm inhibitory concentrations (MBICs) of the alcoholic and aqueous green tea extracts were in the range of 3.1 to 12.5 mg/ml and 6.5 to 50 mg/ml, respectively. Accordingly, green tea extracts can be incorporated in various oral preparations for preventing dental caries.",

The guava leaf extract has been used in the preparation of jelly with pectin (1.5 g), sugar (28 g) and lemon juice (2 mL). The prepared guava leaf extract jelly (GJ) and the control jelly (CJ, without extract) were subjected to proximate, nutritional and textural analyses besides determination of antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. GJ was found to contain carbohydrate (45.78 g/100 g), protein (3.0 g/100 g), vitamin C (6.15 mg/100 g), vitamin B3 (2.90 mg/100 g) and energy (120.6 kcal). Further, the texture analysis of CJ and GJ indicated that both the jellies showed similar properties emphasizing that the addition of guava leaf extract does not bring any change in the texture properties of jelly. GJ exhibited antimicrobial activity against various bacteria ranging from 11.4 to 13.6 mm. Similarly, GJ showed antioxidant activity of 42.38% against DPPH radical and 33.45% against hydroxyl radical.

Improved cultivated strains with more useful traits have been obtained using classical breeding, which is laborious and time-consuming. Here, we attempted efficient gene mutagenesis using plasmid-based CRISPR/Cas9 as the first step for non-genetically modified (non-GM) P. ostreatus generation. Plasmids harboring expression cassettes of Cas9 and different single guide RNAs targeting fcy1 and pyrG were individually transferred into fungal protoplasts of the PC9 strain, which generated some strains exhibiting resistance to 5-fluorocytosine and 5-fluoroorotic acid, respectively. Genomic PCR followed by sequencing revealed small insertions/deletions or insertion of a fragment from the plasmid at the target site in some of the drug-resistant strains. The results demonstrated efficient CRISPR/Cas9-assisted genome editing in P. ostreatus , which could contribute to the molecular breeding of non-GM cultivated strains in the future. Furthermore, a mutation in fcy1 via homology-directed repair using this CRISPR/Cas9 system was also efficiently introduced, which could be applied not only for precise gene disruption, but also for insertions leading to heterologous gene expression in this fungus.",

Thus, 75 fungal isolates were recovered from plant tissues and tested for their efficacy to biosynthesize SeNPs. Four promising strains were found able to synthesis SeNPs with different characteristics and identified. These strains were Aspergillus quadrilineatus isolated from the twigs of Ricinus communis , Aspergillus ochraceus isolated from the leaves of Ricinus communis , Aspergillus terreus isolated from the twigs of Azadirachta indica , and Fusarium equiseti isolated from the twigs of Hibiscus rose-sinensis . The synthesized SeNPs were characterized by several techniques viz., UV–Vis, X-ray diffraction, Dynamic light scattering analyses, High resolution transmission electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, to study their crystalline structure, particle sized distribution, and morphology. Furthermore, the in vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activities were evaluated. SeNPs synthesized by the four strains showed potent antifungal and antibacterial potentials against different human and phyto- pathogens. Moreover, SeNPs synthesized by the respective strains showed promising antioxidant power with IC 50 values of 198.32, 151.23, 100.31, and 91.52 µg mL − 1 . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the use of endophytic fungi for SeNPs’ biosynthesis.

A model of ulcerative colitis (UC) was induced in C57BL/6 mice by administering of 2.5% dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) for 8 days. After developing UC, some mice were treated via intragastric administration of BLa80 at a dose of 109 colony-forming units to assess the preventive effects of BLa80 on DSS-induced UC. Compared with non-treated UC model mice, BLa80-treated mice had reduced colon shortening and improvements in colonic tissue structure. Treatment with BLa80 also decreased the serum concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL) 6 and IL-17 in mice. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that BLa80 increased gut microbial diversity in mice and modulated UC-associated imbalances in the gut microbiota. BLa80 selectively promoted the growth of beneficial bacteria, including Romboutsia and Adlercreutzia, the abundances of which were negatively correlated with concentration of cellular inflammatory factors. In summary, the study results demonstrated that pretreatment with B. lactis BLa80 reduced intestinal inflammation and altered the gut microbiota, implying that BLa80 is a promising probiotic strain with potential therapeutic function in UC.",

The antimicrobial and anti-biofilm effects were evaluated against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans. The cytotoxic effect of the samples was evaluated on HEK 293 and HDFa cells by MTT test. Thymol and carvacrol contents in EO of Z. multiflora were measured at 31% and 42.2%, respectively. A. lappa had the lowest total phenolic and flavonoid value among the samples. On the other hand, the total phenolic content of Z. multiflora and the total flavonoid content of E. purpurea were the highest.

So that, an easy, ecological, and benign process for producing copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) has been developed using candy leaf ( Stevia rebaudiana) leaves aqueous extract for the first time. UV-visible spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM), Fourier transmission infrared (FTIR), and zeta potential were applied to demonstrate strong characterization for the biosynthesized stevia-CuNPs. The UV-visible absorbance at 575 nm of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was 1.2. The particle size mean diameter was recorded as 362.3 nm with − 10.8 mV zeta potential. The HR-TEM scanning revealed 51.46–53.17 nm and spherical-shaped stevia-CuNPs surrounded by coat-shell proteins. The cytotoxicity and cytocompatibility activity assay revealed that stevia-CuNPs was safe in lower concentrations and had a significant cell viability reduction in higher concentrations. The produced stevia-CuNPs were applied as antimicrobial agents against eight pathogenic bacteria and five fungi strains. The inhibitory action of the stevia-CuNPs was more pronounced in bacteria than in fungi, and they likewise demonstrated further inhibition zones in Staphylococcus aureus (50.0 mm) than in Aspergillus flavus (55.0 mm). With inhibition zone sizes of 50.0 mm and 47.0 mm and 50 µg/ml minimum inhibitory concentration, S. aureus and A. flavus were the most inhibited pathogens. The minimum lethal effect (MLC) estimate for S. aureus was 50 µg/ml, whereas 75 µg/ml for A. flavus . The stevia-CuNPs mode of action was characterized as bactericidal/fungicidal as the ratio of MIC to MLC was estimated to be equal to or less than 2. After all, stevia-CuNPs could be used as an alternative to commercial antibiotics to solve the problem of multidrug-resistant (MDR) microorganisms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The increasing demand for natural alternatives to synthetic fungicides has prompted research into natural products like essential oils for postharvest disease management. This study investigated the antifungal, antioxidant, cytotoxic, and genotoxic potential of essential oil mixtures derived from oregano, rosemary, and mint against Penicillium digitatum , the predominant fungal pathogen causing green mold in orange fruits. P. digitatum NPAGRASU 2024 was isolated and identified as the most abundant species (60.2%) from infected oranges. It was deposited in GenBank with gene accession number PP930644 and deposited in MIRCEN culture collection as EMCC 358874. The antimicrobial activity of individual essential oils was evaluated, with oregano exhibiting the highest antifungal activity (inhibition zone diameter of 4.2 cm) against P. digitatum . L-optimal mixture design of response surface methodology (RSM) optimization revealed a highly effective mixture (Run 8) comprising 46.26% oregano and 53.74% rosemary, with a 99.65% actual growth reduction. The oregano oil demonstrated potent antioxidant activity, reaching approximately 75% DPPH radical scavenging at 3.125 mg/mL. Cytotoxicity assessment using the MTT assay showed morphological changes and reduced cell viability in liver cells treated with the PEOs mixture at 300 µg/mL. However, the optimized mixture did not induce significant chromosomal aberrations compared to the control, suggesting minimal genotoxic effects. In vivo, evaluation on oranges revealed 60% inhibition of green mold by the 1% (v/v) optimized mixture for 7 days. Histological analysis indicated low toxicity to the liver at the highest tested concentration (1% mixture). GC-MS analysis identified major compounds like cavarcol, caryophyllene, eucalyptol, phenols and levomenthol in oregano oil, contributing to its bioactivities. This study demonstrates the potential of optimized essential oil mixtures as effective and eco-friendly alternatives for postharvest disease control.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The urgent need to address the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance in multidrug-resistant bacteria requires the development of pioneering approaches to treatment. The present study aims to evaluate the antimicrobial potential of the essential oils (EOs) of Moringa oleifera (moringa), Cinnamomum verum (cinnamon), and Nigella sativa (black seed) and the synergistic effect of the mixture of these oils against Staphylococcus aureus MCC 1351. Statistical modeling revealed cinnamon oil had the highest individual antimicrobial potency, followed by black seed oil. The combination of the three EOs exhibited significant synergistic effects compared to the individual oils, with a Fractional Inhibitory Concentration (∑FIC) index of 0.27. L-Optimal mixture design of response surface methodology (RSM) identified the optimal mixture as moringa: cinnamon: black seed oils by the ratio of (1:1:1) in run 15 (0.338:0.307:0.355 mL) (v/v). This mixture exhibited significant antibacterial efficacy, outperforming individual oils and conventional antibiotics like tetracycline. Specifically, the combination reduced the MIC values from 3.12, 0.78, and 6.25 to 0.25, 0.06, and 0.78 μg/mL for moringa, cinnamon, and black seed oil, respectively. Synergistic interactions between oils further boosted efficacy, with moringa-cinnamon and cinnamon-black seed pairings exhibiting the strongest synergies. The developed predictive models for IZD and MIC showed excellent fit, with R 2 values of 0.9843 and 0.9958, respectively. Pareto chart analysis highlighted the predominant individual and synergistic effects, with the Moringa-Cinnamon interaction exhibiting the highest positive synergy. Notably, the oil mixture of run 15 demonstrated excellent biocompatibility, maintaining 97.6% viability of normal human skin fibroblasts (HSF) after 24 h exposure to 200 μL EOs of the mixture per mL. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) identified abundant bioactive phytochemicals like cinnamaldehyde, linoleic acid, and palmitic acid methyl esters underlying the observed antimicrobial effects. This rationally designed, synergistic phytochemical combination presents a promising natural therapeutic against antibiotic-resistant S. aureus while exhibiting minimal cytotoxicity. The results underscore how combining essential oils could help address the issue of antibiotic resistance in S. aureus .",

    "abstract": "Resistance to antibiotics is a critical growing public health problem that needs urgent action to combat. To avoid the stress on bacterial growth that evokes the development of resistance, anti-virulence agents can be an attractive strategy as they do not target bacterial growth. There are FDA approved drugs have been screened for their anti-virulence activities. Lamivudine (LAM) is a synthetic nucleoside analogue used as an antiretroviral in treatment of HIV and can be used in treatment of HBV. The present study aimed to assess the anti-virulence activities of LAM against a clinically important pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The LAM's antibiofilm and anti-virulence activities were evaluated. The impact of LAM on the quorum sensing (QS) systems which control the production of these virulence factors was assessed virtually and by quantification of the expression of QS-encoding genes. Furthermore, in vivo mice protection assay was conducted to attest the LAM's anti-pathogenic activity. The current findings elaborated the promising anti-pathogenic and anti-QS activities of LAM. LAM interfered with biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain. Moreover, swarming motility and production of pyocyanin and protease were significantly diminished. At the molecular level, LAM downregulated the QS-encoding genes LasI, LasR, RhlR, PqsA and PqsR. Additionally, the detailed in silico docking and molecular simulation studies showed the considered high LAM's ability to bind and hinder the QS receptors in the P. aeruginosa. In an agreement with in vitro and in silico, the in vivo results showed the LAM full protection of mice against P. aeruginosa. In conclusion, LAM could be repurposed to be employed as adjunct therapy with traditional antibiotics for treating serious pseudomonal infections.",

This is the third aromatic peroxygenase (APO) that has been characterized in detail and the first one that can be produced in high yields. The highest enzyme levels of about 41,000 U l-1 (corresponding to appr. 445 mg l-1 APO protein) exceeded the hitherto reported levels more than 40-fold and were detected in carbon- and nitrogen-rich complex media. The enzyme was purified by FPLC to apparent homogeneity (SDS-PAGE) with a molecular mass of 32 kDa (27 kDa after deglycosylation) and isoelectric points between 4.97 and 5.27. The UV-visible spectrum of the native enzyme showed a characteristic maximum (Soret band) at 418 nm that shifted after reduction with sodium dithionite and flushing with carbon monoxide to 443 nm. The pH optimum of the M. rotula enzyme was found to vary between pH 5 and 6 for most reactions studied. The apparent Km-values for 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, benzyl alcohol, veratryl alcohol, naphthalene and H2O2 were 0.133, 0.118, 0.279, 0.791 and 3.14 mM, respectively. M. rotula APO was found to be highly stable in a pH range from 5 to 10 as well as in the presence of organic solvents (50% vol/vol) such as methanol, acetonitrile and N,N-dimethylformamide. Unlike other APOs, the peroxygenase of M. rotula showed neither brominating nor chlorinating activities.",

Their efficient synthesis still poses a major challenge. Transaminases (also known as aminotransferases) possess a great potential for the synthesis of optically pure β-amino acids. These pyridoxal 5'-dependent enzymes catalyze the transfer of an amino group from a donor substrate to an acceptor, thus enabling the synthesis of a wide variety of chiral amines and amino acids. Transaminases can be applied either for the kinetic resolution of racemic compounds or the asymmetric synthesis starting from a prochiral substrate. This review gives an overview over microbial transaminases with activity towards β-amino acids and their substrate spectra. It also outlines current strategies for the screening of new biocatalysts. Particular emphasis is placed on activity assays which are applicable to high-throughput screening.",

Electron microscopy, flow cytometry and spectroscopic assays were employed to determine the targets of these compounds. Treatment of C. albicans (CA04) with sub-MICs of cinnamaldehyde (50 μg/mL) and eugenol (200 μg/mL) indicated multiple sites of action including damages to cell walls, cell membranes, cytoplasmic contents and other membranous structures as observed under electron microscopy. Concentration and time dependent increase in the release of cytoplasmic contents accompanied with change in extracellular K+ concentration was recorded. Exposure of Candida cells at 4 × MIC of cinnaamldehyde and eugenol resulted in 40.21% and 50.90% dead cells, respectively as revealed by flow cytometry analysis. Treatment of Candida cells by cinnamaldehyde and eugenol at 0.5 × MIC showed 67.41% and 76.23% reduction in ergosterol biosynthesis, respectively. The binding assays reflected the ability of compounds to bind with the ergosterol. Our findings have suggested that the membrane damaging effects of phenyl aldehyde and propanoids class of compounds is attributed to their ability to inhibit ergosterol biosynthesis and simultaneously binding with ergosterol. Indirect or secondary action of these compounds on cell wall is also expected as revealed by electron microscopic studies.",

BC was produced by culturing Acetobacter xylinum supplemented with hydroxyapatite (HA) to form BC membranes (without HA) and BC/HA membranes. Membranes were subjected to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis to determine surface element composition. The membranes were further used to evaluate osteoblast growth, alkaline phosphatase activity and bone nodule formation. BC was free of calcium and phosphate. However, XPS analysis revealed the presence of both calcium (10%) and phosphate (10%) at the surface of the BC/HA membrane. Osteoblast culture showed that BC alone was non-toxic and could sustain osteoblast adhesion. Furthermore, osteoblast adhesion and growth were significantly (p ≤0.05) increased on BC/HA membranes as compared to BC alone. Both BC and BC/HA membranes improved osteoconductivity, as confirmed by the level of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity that increased from 2.5 mM with BC alone to 5.3 mM with BC/HA. BC/HA membranes also showed greater nodule formation and mineralization than the BC membrane alone. This was confirmed by Alizarin red staining (ARS) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). This work demonstrates that both BC and BC/HA may be useful in bone tissue engineering.",

In nature, isopropanol is excreted by some strains of Clostridium beijerinckii , simultaneously with butanol and ethanol during the isopropanol butanol ethanol (IBE) fermentation. In order to increase isopropanol production, the gene encoding the secondary-alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme from C. beijerinckii NRRL B593 ( adh ) which catalyzes the reduction of acetone to isopropanol, was cloned into the acetone, butanol and ethanol (ABE)-producing strain C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824. The transformants showed high capacity for conversion of acetone into isopropanol (&gt; 95%). To increase isopropanol production levels in ATCC 824, polycistronic transcription units containing, in addition to the adh gene, homologous genes of the acetoacetate decarboxylase ( adc ), and/or the acetoacetyl-CoA:acetate/butyrate:CoA transferase subunits A and B ( ctfA and ctfB ) were constructed and introduced into the wild-type strain. Combined overexpression of the ctfA and ctfB genes resulted in enhanced solvent production. In non-pH-controlled batch cultures, the total solvents excreted by the transformant overexpressing the adh , ctfA , ctfB and adc genes were 24.4 g/L IBE (including 8.8 g/L isopropanol), while the control strain harbouring an empty plasmid produced only 20.2 g/L ABE (including 7.6 g/L acetone). The overexpression of the adc gene had limited effect on IBE production. Interestingly, all transformants with the adh gene converted acetoin (a minor fermentation product) into 2,3-butanediol, highlighting the wide metabolic versatility of solvent-producing Clostridia .",

The main goal of this study was the production of useful enzymes from LBDW during treatment of this wastewater. In this study, we found that xylose strongly induced two yeast strains, Pseudozyma antarctica T-34 and GB-4(0), to produce novel xylanases, PaXynT and PaXynG, respectively. The nucleotide sequence of PaXynT [accession No. DF196774 (GAC73192.1)], obtained from the genome database of strain T-34 using its N-terminal amino acid sequence, was 91% identical to that of PaXynG (accession No. AB901085), and the deduced amino acid sequence is 98% identical. The specific activities of the purified PaXynT and PaXynG were about 52 U/mg. The optimal pH and temperature for both enzymes' activities were 5.2 and 50°C, respectively. They hydrolyzed xylan to xylose and neither had β-xylosidase (EC 3.2.1.37) activity, indicating that they are endo-β-xylanases (EC 3.2.1.8). With these results, we expect that PaXyns can be employed in saccharizing lignocellulosic biomass materials for the production of useful products just like other endoxylanases. After 72 h of LBDW fed-batch cultivation using a jar-fermentor, strain GB-4(0) produced 17.3 U/ml (corresponding to about 0.3 g/l) of PaXynG and removed 63% of dissolved organic carbon and 87% of dissolved total phosphorus from LBDW.

However, aflatoxin-producing potential varies widely among A. flavus genotypes with many producing no aflatoxins. Some non-aflatoxigenic genotypes are used as biocontrol agents to prevent contamination. Aflatoxin biosynthesis genes are tightly clustered in a highly conserved order. Gene deletions and presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in aflatoxin biosynthesis genes are often associated with A. flavus inability to produce aflatoxins. In order to identify mechanisms of non-aflatoxigenicity in non-aflatoxigenic genotypes of value in aflatoxin biocontrol, complete cluster sequences of 35 A. flavus genotypes from Africa and North America were analyzed. Inability of some genotypes to produce aflatoxin resulted from deletion of biosynthesis genes. In other genotypes, non-aflatoxigenicity originated from SNP formation. The process of degeneration differed across the gene cluster; genes involved in early biosynthesis stages were more likely to be deleted while genes involved in later stages displayed high frequencies of SNPs. Comparative analyses of aflatoxin gene clusters provides insight into the diversity of mechanisms of non-aflatoxigenicity in A. flavus genotypes used as biological control agents. The sequences provide resources for both diagnosis of non-aflatoxigenicity and monitoring of biocontrol genotypes during biopesticide manufacture and in the environment.",

    "abstract": "The interaction between diet and gut microbiota, and ultimately their link to health, has turned into the concentration of huge research. However, this relationship still needs to be fully characterized, particularly in case of the Asian population. We compared the fecal bacterial diversity and composition of healthy Indian and Chinese adults, ages 22–35 years, using next-generation sequencing analysis on IlluminaHiSeq 2500 platform. Our analysis revealed unique community structure, dominant Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and underrepresented Bacteroides, of Indian and Chinese gut bacteria. This community structure closely matched with the gut bacterial composition of the Russian population. Therefore, we hypothesized that enrichment of these bacterial clades is supported by high consumption of starch-rich diet such as rice, potato, refined grains. The dominance of genus Bifidobacterium due to carbohydrate-rich diet is another notable feature of this study. Moreover, Indian gut bacteria are significantly represented by Bacteroidetes (p = 0.001) and Prevotella (p = 0.002) in contrast to Chinese, which could be associated with whole grains and plant-based vegetarian diet of Indians. The gut bacterial population of Indian adults were as diverse as Chinese adults (p > 0.1), but significant difference was noticed in gut bacterial composition and relative abundance between two populations (R = 0.625, p < 0.005). Partial least squares discriminant analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling plots showed dietary habit wise clustering of subjects. Thus, the present work confirms an important role of diet in determining gut bacterial composition. LEfse analysis revealed genera Prevotella, Megasphaera, Catenibacterium, Lactobacillus, Ruminococcus and species Prevotella copri, Lactobacillus ruminis as the potential biomarkers of diet.",

Out of 30 collected samples 13 isolates having metal tolerance potential against Ni and Co were screened out. Maximum tolerable concentration and multi metal resistance was determined. A native bacterial strain showing maximum tolerance to Ni and Co and multi metal resistance against Ni, Co and Cr at different levels was selected and named as Abuzar Microbiology 1 (AMIC1). Molecular characterization confirmed it as Klebsiella variicola which was submitted in First fungal culture bank of Pakistan (FCBP-WB-0688). ICP-OES revealed that it reduced Ni (50, 49%) and Co (71, 68.6%) after 24 and 48 h, respectively. FT-IR was used to analyze functional groups and overall nature of chemical bonds. Changes in spectra of biomass were observed after absorption of Ni and Co by K. variicola. SEM revealed morphological changes in bacteria in response to metal stress. Both metals affected bacterial cell wall and created pores in it. However effect of Ni was more pronounced than Co. It was concluded that K. variicola, a native novel strain possessed significant heavy metal tolerance and bioremediation potential against Ni and Co. It may be used in future for development of bioremediation agents to detoxify textile effluents at industrial surroundings.",

    "abstract": "The lipopeptide iturin from Bacillus subtilis has been found to have a potential inhibitory effect on breast cancer, alveolar adenocarcinoma, renal carcinoma, and colon adenocarcinoma. In this study, the potential of B. subtilis lipopeptides (a mixture of iturin homologues, concentration of 42.75%) to inhibit chronic myelogenous leukemia was evaluated using K562 myelogenous leukemia cells. The results showed that the lipopeptides could completely inhibit the growth of K562 at 100 μM, with an IC50 value of 65.76 μM. The lipopeptides inhibited the profile of K562 via three pathways: (1) induction of paraptosis indicated by the occurrence of cytoplasmic vacuoles, and swelling of the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) without membrane blebbing in the presence of a caspase inhibitor; (2) inhibition of autophagy progress illustrated by the upregulated expression of LCII and P62; and (3) induction of apoptosis by causing ROS burst, and induction of the intrinsic pathway indicated by the upregulated expression of cytochrome c (Cyto-c), bax, and bad, together with downregulated expression of Bcl-2. The ROS-dependent apoptosis and caspase-independent paraptosis were verified using the ROS inhibitor and caspase inhibitor, respectively. The extrinsic apoptosis pathway was not involved in the lipopeptide's effects on K562. Overall, the B. subtilis lipopeptides (consisting of a majority of iturin) exhibited promising potential in inhibiting chronic myelogenous leukemia in vitro via simultaneously causing paraptosis, apoptosis, and inhibition of autophagy.",

    "abstract": "Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are considered essential omega-3 fatty acids in human nutrition. In marine microalgae EPA and/or DHA are allegedly involved in the regulation of membrane fluidity and thylakoid membrane functioning. The cellular content of EPA and DHA may therefore be enhanced at low temperature and irradiance conditions. As a result, polar and cold temperate marine microalgal species might potentially be suitable candidates for commercial EPA and DHA production, given their adaptation to low temperature and irradiance habitats.In the present study we investigated inter- and intraspecific EPA and DHA variability in five polar and (cold) temperate microalgae. Intraspecific EPA and DHA content did not vary significantly in an Antarctic (Chaetoceros brevis) and a temperate (Thalassiosira weissflogii) centric diatom after acclimation to a range of irradiance levels at two temperatures. Interspecific variability was investigated for two Antarctic (Chaetoceros brevis and Pyramimonas sp. (Prasinophyceae)) and three cold-temperate species (Thalassiosira weissflogii, Emiliania huxleyi (Prymnesiophyceae) and Fibrocapsa japonica (Raphidophyceae)) during exponential growth. Interspecific variability was shown to be much more important than intraspecific variability. Highest relative and absolute levels of DHA were measured in the prymnesiophyte E. huxleyi and the prasinophyte Pyramimonas sp., while levels of EPA were high in the raphidophyte F. japonica and the diatoms C. brevis and T. weissflogii. Yet, no significant differences in LC-PUFA content were found between polar and cold-temperate species. Also, EPA and DHA production rates varied strongly between species. Highest EPA production rate (174 μg L-1 day-1) was found in the Antarctic diatom Chaetoceros brevis, while DHA production was highest in the cold-temperate prymnesiophyte Emiliania huxleyi (164 μg L-1 day-1). We show that, following careful species selection, effective mass cultivation of marine microalgae for EPA and DHA production may be possible under low temperature and irradiance conditions.",

The objectives of this study were to identify the principal plant cell wall-degrading enzymes and the taxonomic profile of rumen microbial communities that are associated with it. The cattle rumen microflora and the carbohydrate-active enzymes were functionally classified through a whole metagenomic sequencing approach. Analysis of the assembled sequences by the Carbohydrate-active enzyme a﻿nalysis Toolkit identified the candidate genes encoding fibrolytic enzymes belonging to different classes of glycoside hydrolases(11,010 contigs), glycosyltransferases (6366 contigs), carbohydrate esterases (4945 contigs), carbohydrate-binding modules (1975 contigs), polysaccharide lyases (480 contigs), and auxiliary activities (115 contigs). Phylogenetic analysis of CAZyme encoding contigs revealed that a significant proportion of CAZymes were contributed by bacteria belonging to genera Prevotella, Bacteroides, Fibrobacter, Clostridium, and Ruminococcus. The results indicated that the cattle rumen microbiome and the CAZymes are highly complex, structurally similar but compositionally distinct from other ruminants. The unique characteristics of rumen microbiota and the enzymes produced by resident microbes provide opportunities to improve the feed conversion efficiency in ruminants and serve as a reservoir of industrially important enzymes for cellulosic biofuel production.",

It grew optimally up to 14% NaCl and produced antimicrobial peptide within 24 h of growth. The peptides were purified using a combination of chemical extraction and chromatographic techniques. The MALDI-TOF analysis of HPLC purified fractions revealed that the strain SK.DU.4 secreted a bacteriocin-like peptide with molecular mass of 5323.9 Da and a surface-active lipopeptide (m/z 1056 Da). The peptide mass fingerprinting of low-molecular-weight bacteriocin exhibited significant similarity with stretches of secreted lipoprotein of Methylomicrobium album BG8 and displayed 70% sequence coverage. MALDI MS/MS analysis elucidated the lipopeptide as a cyclic lipopeptide with a β-hydroxy fatty acid linked to Ser of a peptide with seven α-amino acids (Asp-Tyr-Asn-Gln-Pro-Asn-Ser) and assigned it to iturin-like group of antimicrobial biosurfactants. However, it differed in amino acid composition with other members of the iturin family. Both peptides were active against Gram-positive bacteria, suggesting that they had an additive effect.",

The genetic optimization was carried out by random mutagenesis by ultraviolet irradiation and mutant selection by cerulenin, a compound displaying inhibitory effects on lipid biosynthesis. Mutants demonstrating normal growth in presence of cerulenin were considered as good candidates for further studies. Using this strategy, we selected 6 mutants for further studies, in which their productivities were evaluated by fermentation in shaken flasks and bioreactor. The evaluation of the fermentative performance of mutants was carried out using xylose as sole carbon source; the fermentation of wild-type strain was used as reference. Using this strategy it was possible to identify one mutant (termed A1) presenting a significant increase in the productivity rates of both biomass and lipid in comparison to wild-type strain. A1 mutant was further studied in bioreactor using the same fermentation parameters optimized for L. starkeyi lipid production from a mixed carbon source (xylose:glucose), as previously determined by other studies in our laboratory. A1 presented a productivity increase of 15.1% in biomass and 30.7% in lipid productivity when compared to the wild-type strain with a similar fatty acid composition, despite a slight increase (approx. 7%) on the unsaturated fraction. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of the random mutagenesis strategy coupled with mutant selection based on cerulenin screening for the genetic improvement of the oleaginous yeast L. starkeyi.",

    "abstract": "Introducing of the DNA metabarcoding analysis of probiotic microbial communities allowed getting insight into their functioning and establishing a better control on safety and efficacy of the probiotic communities. In this work the kombucha poly-microbial probiotic community was analysed to study its flexibility under different growth conditions. Environmental DNA sequencing revealed a complex and flexible composition of the kombucha microbial culture (KMC) constituting more bacterial and fungal organisms in addition to those found by cultural method. The community comprised bacterial and yeast components including cultured and uncultivable microorganisms. Culturing the KMC under different conditions revealed the core part of the community which included acetobacteria of two genera Komagataeibacter (former Gluconacetobacter) and Gluconobacter, and representatives of several yeast genera among which Brettanomyces/Dekkera and Pichia (including former Issatchenkia) were dominant. Herbaspirillum spp. and Halomonas spp., which previously had not been described in KMC, were found to be minor but permanent members of the community. The community composition was dependent on the growth conditions. The bacterial component of KMC was relatively stable, but may include additional member-lactobacilli. The yeast species composition was significantly variable. High-throughput sequencing showed complexity and variability of KMC that may affect the quality of the probiotic drink. It was hypothesized that the kombucha core community might recruit some environmental bacteria, particularly lactobacilli, which potentially may contribute to the fermentative capacity of the probiotic drink. As many KMC-associated microorganisms cannot be cultured out of the community, a robust control for community composition should be provided by using DNA metabarcoding.",

    "abstract": "It is common practice to freeze dry probiotic bacteria to improve their shelf life. However, the freeze drying process itself can be detrimental to their viability. The viability of probiotics could be maintained if they are administered within a microbially produced biodegradable polymer - poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) - matrix. Although the antifreeze activity of γ-PGA is well known, it has not been used for maintaining the viability of probiotic bacteria during freeze drying. The aim of this study was to test the effect of γ-PGA (produced by B. subtilis natto ATCC 15245) on the viability of probiotic bacteria during freeze drying and to test the toxigenic potential of B. subtilis natto. 10% γ-PGA was found to protect Lactobacillus paracasei significantly better than 10% sucrose, whereas it showed comparable cryoprotectant activity to sucrose when it was used to protect Bifidobacterium breve and Bifidobacterium longum. Although γ-PGA is known to be non-toxic, it is crucial to ascertain the toxigenic potential of its source, B. subtilis natto. Presence of six genes that are known to encode for toxins were investigated: three component hemolysin (hbl D/A), three component non-haemolytic enterotoxin (nheB), B. cereus enterotoxin T (bceT), enterotoxin FM (entFM), sphingomyelinase (sph) and phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase (piplc). From our investigations, none of these six genes were present in B. subtilis natto. Moreover, haemolytic and lecithinase activities were found to be absent. Our work contributes a biodegradable polymer from a non-toxic source for the cryoprotection of probiotic bacteria, thus improving their survival during the manufacturing process.",

PCD involves DNA fragmentation, generation of ROS, and expression of a protein with caspase-like substrate specificity in bacterial cells. Prodigiosin was observed to be internalized into bacterial cells and was localized predominantly in the membrane and the nuclear fraction, thus, facilitating intracellular trafficking and then binding of prodigiosin to the bacterial DNA. Corresponding to an increasing concentration of prodigiosin, the level of certain proteases were observed to increase in bacteria studied, thus initiating the onset of PCD.

    "abstract": "High-temperature ethanol fermentation has several benefits including a reduction in cooling cost, minimizing risk of bacterial contamination, and enabling simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. To achieve the efficient ethanol fermentation at high temperature, yeast strain that tolerates to not only high temperature but also the other stresses present during fermentation, e.g., ethanol, osmotic, and oxidative stresses, is indispensable. The C3253, C3751, and C4377 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, which have been previously isolated as thermotolerant yeasts, were found to be multiple stress-tolerant. In these strains, continuous expression of heat shock protein genes and intracellular trehalose accumulation were induced in response to stresses causing protein denaturation. Compared to the control strains, these multiple stress-tolerant strains displayed low intracellular reactive oxygen species levels and effective cell wall remodeling upon exposures to almost all stresses tested. In response to simultaneous multi-stress mimicking fermentation stress, cell wall remodeling and redox homeostasis seem to be the primary mechanisms required for protection against cell damage. Moreover, these strains showed better performances of ethanol production than the control strains at both optimal and high temperatures, suggesting their potential use in high-temperature ethanol fermentation.",

Specific growth rates were fourfold higher in photobioreactor experiments when cultivation conditions were controlled. After 14 days of cultivation in nitrogen and phosphorus, limited media intracellular PHB levels reached up to 16.4% from CO2. The highest volumetric production rate of PHB was 59 ± 6 mg L−1 day−1. Scanning electron microscopy of isolated PHB granules of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6714 cultivated under nitrogen and phosphorus limitations showed an average diameter of 0.7 µm.

    "abstract": "Abstract Agricultural sustainability may represent the greatest encumbrance to increasing food production. On the other hand, as a component of sustainability, replacement of chemical fertilizers by bio-fertilizers has the potential to lower costs for farmers, to increase yields, and to mitigate greenhouse-gas emissions and pollution of water and soil. Rhizobia and plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) have been broadly used in agriculture, and advances in our understanding of plant-bacteria interactions have been achieved; however, the use of signaling molecules to enhance crop performance is still modest. In this study, we evaluated the effects of concentrated metabolites (CM) from two strains of rhizobia— Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens USDA 110 T (BD1) and Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899 T (RT1)—at two concentrations of active compounds (10 –8 and 10 –9 M)—on the performances of two major plant-microbe interactions, of Bradyrhizobium spp.-soybean ( Glycine max (L.) Merr.) and Azospirillum brasilense -maize ( Zea mays L.). For soybean, one greenhouse and two field experiments were performed and effects of addition of CM from the homologous and heterologous strains, and of the flavonoid genistein were investigated. For maize, three field experiments were performed to examine the effects of CM from RT1. For soybean, compared to the treatment inoculated exclusively with Bradyrhizobium , benefits were achieved with the addition of CM-BD1; at 10 –9 M, grain yield was increased by an average of 4.8%. For maize, the best result was obtained with the addition of CM-RT1, also at 10 –9 M, increasing grain yield by an average of 11.4%. These benefits might be related to a combination of effects attributed to secondary compounds produced by the rhizobial strains, including exopolysaccharides (EPSs), plant hormones and lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs). The results emphasize the biotechnological potential of using secondary metabolites of rhizobia together with inoculants containing both rhizobia and PGPR to improve the growth and yield of grain crops.",

    "abstract": "Heterologeous production of rhamnolipids in Pseudomonas putida is characterized by advantages of a non-pathogenic host and avoidance of the native quorum sensing regulation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Yet, downstream processing is a major problem in rhamnolipid production and increases in complexity at low rhamnolipid titers and when using chemical foam control. This leaves the necessity of a simple concentrating and purification method. Foam fractionation is an elegant method for in situ product removal when producing microbial surfactants. However, up to now in situ foam fractionation is nearly exclusively reported for the production of surfactin with Bacillus subtilis. So far no cultivation integrated foam fractionation process for rhamnolipid production has been reported. This is probably due to excessive bacterial foam enrichment in that system. In this article a simple integrated foam fractionation process is reported for heterologous rhamnolipid production in a bioreactor with easily manageable bacterial foam enrichments. Rhamnolipids were highly concentrated in the foam during the cultivation process with enrichment factors up to 200. The described process was evaluated at different pH, media compositions and temperatures. Foam fractionation processes were characterized by calculating procedural parameter including rhamnolipid and bacterial enrichment, rhamnolipid recovery, YX/S, YP/X, and specific as well as volumetric productivities. Comparing foam fractionation parameters of the rhamnolipid process with the surfactin process a high effectiveness of the integrated foam fractionation for rhamnolipid production was demonstrated.",

When cultured in bioreactors with glucose as the sole carbon source C. podzolicus yielded 31.8% lipid per dry biomass at 20°C, while T. porosum yielded 34.1% at 25°C and P. segobiensis 24.6% at 25°C. These amounts correspond to lipid concentrations of 17.97 g/L, 17.02 g/L and 12.7 g/L and volumetric productivities of 0.09 g/Lh, 0.1 g/Lh and 0.07 g/Lh, respectively. During the culture of C. podzolicus 30 g/l gluconic acid was detected as by-product in the culture broth and 12 g/L gluconic acid in T. porosum culture. The production of gluconic acid was eliminated for both strains when glucose was substituted by xylose as the carbon source. Using xylose lipid yields were 11.1 g/L and 13.9 g/L, corresponding to 26.8% and 33.4% lipid per dry biomass and a volumetric productivity of 0.07 g/Lh and 0.09 g/Lh, for C. podzolicus and T. porosum respectively. The fatty acid profile analysis showed that oleic acid was the main component (39.6 to 59.4%) in all three strains and could be applicable for biodiesel production. Palmitic acid (18.4 to 21.1%) and linolenic acid (7.5 to 18.7%) are valuable for cosmetic applications. P. segobiensis had a considerable amount of palmitoleic acid (16% content) and may be suitable for medical applications.",

    "abstract": "Polypores have been applied in traditional Chinese medicine up to the present day, and are becoming more and more popular worldwide. They show a wide range of bioactivities including anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, antiviral and immuno-enhancing effects. Their secondary metabolites have been the focus of many studies, but the importance of fungal strain for bioactivity and metabolite production has not been investigated so far for these Basidiomycetes. Therefore, we screened several strains from three medicinal polypore species from traditional European medicine: Fomes fomentarius, Fomitopsis pinicola and Piptoporus betulinus. A total of 22 strains were compared concerning their growth rates, optimum growth temperatures, as well as antimicrobial and antifungal properties of ethanolic fruit body extracts. The morphological identification of strains was confirmed based on rDNA ITS phylogenetic analyses. Our results showed that species delimitation is critical due to the presence of several distinct lineages, e.g. within the Fomes fomentarius species complex. Fungal strains within one lineage showed distinct differences in optimum growth temperatures, in secondary metabolite production, and accordingly, in their bioactivities. In general, F. pinicola and P. betulinus extracts exerted distinct antibiotic activities against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus at minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 31-125 μg mL-1; The antifungal activities of all three polypores against Aspergillus flavus, A. fumigatus, Absidia orchidis and Candida krusei were often strain-specific, ranging from 125-1000 μg mL-1. Our results highlight that a reliable species identification, followed by an extensive screening for a 'best strain' is an essential prerequisite for the proper identification of bioactive material.",

    "abstract": "There is an increasing interest in the development and use of inoculants carrying plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) in crops of agronomic interest. The great majority of the inoculants commercialized worldwide contain rhizobia for legume crops, but the use of PGPB as Azospirillum spp. for non-legume is expanding, as well as of inoculants combining microorganisms and microbial metabolites. In this study we evaluated the effects of inoculants containing Azospirillum brasilense with or without metabolites of Rhizobium tropici strain CIAT 899 highly enriched in lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs) in six field experiments performed for three summer crop seasons in Brazil with maize (Zea mays L.). Inoculants and metabolites were applied either at sowing by seed inoculation, or by leaf spray at the V3 stage of plant growth. Improvement in shoot dry weight (SDW) and total N accumulated in shoots (TNS) by single, but especially by dual inoculation was observed in some of the experiments. Statistically significant increases in grain yield in relation to the non-inoculated control were observed in five out of six experiments when maize was inoculated with Azospirillum supplied with enriched metabolites of R. tropici applied by seed or leaf spray inoculation. The results give strength to the development of a new generation of inoculants carrying microorganisms and microbial molecules.",

    "abstract": "Microbial bioprocessing of lignocellulose to bioethanol still poses challenges in terms of substrate catabolism. The most important challenge is to overcome substrate recalcitrance and to thus reduce the number of steps needed to biorefine lignocellulose. Conventionally, conversion involves chemical pretreatment of lignocellulose, followed by hydrolysis of biomass to monomer sugars that are subsequently fermented into bioethanol. Consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) has been suggested as an efficient and economical method of manufacturing bioethanol from lignocellulose. CBP integrates the hydrolysis and fermentation steps into a single process, thereby significantly reducing the amount of steps in the biorefining process. Filamentous fungi are remarkable organisms that are naturally specialised in deconstructing plant biomass and thus they have tremendous potential as components of CBP. The fungus Fusarium oxysporum has potential for CBP of lignocellulose to bioethanol. Here we discuss the complexity and potential of CBP, the bottlenecks in the process, and the potential influence of fungal genetic diversity, substrate complexity and new technologies on the efficacy of CPB of lignocellulose, with a focus on F. oxysporum.",

Use of probiotics is a promising approach for prevention of Vibrio infections in aquaculture. A probiotic anti-Vibrio strain, Bacillus pumilus H2, was characterized, and the mechanism of its effect was investigated. All 29 Vibrio strains tested were growth-inhibited by H2. The anti-Vibrio substance present in cell-free supernatant of H2 was purified and characterized by reversed-phase HPLC. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of the purified substance, determined in liquid media for various Vibrio strains, ranged from 0.5 to 64 µg/ml. Addition of the purified substance to Vibrio vulnificus culture inhibited cell growth (estimated by OD600). Confocal microscopy and scanning electron microscopy analyses showed that surface structure of V. vulnificus cells was damaged by the purified substance, as reflected by presence of membrane holes, disappearance of cellular contents, and formation of cell cavities. The major mechanism of this anti-Vibrio activity appeared to involve disruption of cell membranes, and consequent cell lysis. The purified anti-Vibrio substance was shown to be structurally identical to amicoumacin A by MS and NMR analysis. Our findings indicate that B. pumilus H2 has strong potential for prevention or treatment of fish vibriosis in the aquaculture industry.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Diagnosing Zika virus (ZIKV) infections has been challenging due to the cross-reactivity of induced antibodies with other flavivirus. The concomitant occurrence of ZIKV and Dengue virus (DENV) in endemic regions requires diagnostic tools with the ability to distinguish these two viral infections. Recent studies demonstrated that immunoassays using the C-terminal fragment of ZIKV NS1 antigen (ΔNS1) can be used to discriminate ZIKV from DENV infections. In order to be used in serological tests, the expression/solubility of ΔNS1 and growth of recombinant E. coli strain were optimized by Response Surface Methodology. Temperature, time and IPTG concentration were evaluated. According to the model, the best condition determined in small scale cultures was 21 °C for 20 h with 0.7 mM of IPTG, which predicted 7.5 g/L of biomass and 962 mg/L of ΔNS1. These conditions were validated and used in a 6-L batch in the bioreactor, which produced 6.4 g/L of biomass and 500 mg/L of ΔNS1 in 12 h of induction. The serological ELISA test performed with purified ΔNS1 showed low cross-reactivity with antibodies from DENV-infected human subjects. Denaturation of ΔNS1 decreased the detection of anti-ZIKV antibodies, thus indicating the contribution of conformational epitopes and confirming the importance of properly folded ΔNS1 for the specificity of the serological analyses. Obtaining high yields of soluble ΔNS1 supports the viability of an effective serologic diagnostic test capable of differentiating ZIKV from other flavivirus infections.",

Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 125 to 500 mg/ml were determined against tested strains. The observed biological activity of 5-HCC could be due to two novel peptides, identified by capillary RP-HPLC/nESI-MS/MS, which present the common chemical-physical characteristics of antimicrobial peptides. Such peptides were chemically synthesized and their antimicrobial activity was tested. The synthetic peptides showed broad-spectrum activity at 12.5 mg/ml against the majority of the tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains, and they were also able to inhibit biofilm formation in a significant percentage at a concentration of 3.1 mg/ml against staphylococcal and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains.The immune mediators in H. tubulosa are a source of novel antimicrobial peptides for the development of new agents against biofilm bacterial communities that are often intrinsically resistant to conventional antibiotics.",

Degradation of poly(butylene succinate-co-adipate) (PBSA) film was evaluated in soil samples from different cultivated fields in Japan for 4 weeks. Both the degradation speed of the PBSA film and the esterase activity were found to be correlated with the ratio of colonies that produced clear zone on fungal minimum medium-agarose plate with emulsified PBSA to the total number colonies counted. Time-dependent change in viable counts of the PBSA-degrading fungi and esterase activities were monitored in soils where buried films showed the most and the least degree of degradation. During the degradation of PBSA film, the viable counts of the PBSA-degrading fungi and the esterase activities in soils, which adhered to the PBSA film, increased with time. The soil, where the film was degraded the fastest, recorded large PBSA-degrading fungal population and showed high esterase activity compared with the other soil samples throughout the incubation period. Meanwhile, esterase activity and viable counts of PBSA-degrading fungi were found to be stable in soils without PBSA film. These results suggest that the higher the distribution ratio of native PBSA-degrading fungi in the soil, the faster the film degradation is. This could be due to the rapid accumulation of secreted esterases in these soils.",

In addition, both LEO and citral showed an immediate killing effect against SRB in liquid medium, suggesting that citral is responsible for the antimicrobial activity of LEO against SRB. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the MIC of LEO caused discernible cell membrane alterations and formed electron-dense inclusions. Neither biofilm formation nor corrosion was observed on carbon steel coupons after LEO treatment. LEO was effective for the control of the planktonic and sessile SRB growth and for the protection of carbon steel coupons against biocorrosion.

    "abstract": "Soil amended with single biochar or nitrogen (N) fertilizer has frequently been reported to alter soil nitrification process due to its impact on soil properties. However, little is known about the dynamic response of nitrification and ammonia-oxidizers to the combined application of biochar and N fertilizer in intensive vegetable soil. In this study, an incubation experiment was designed to evaluate the effects of biochar and N fertilizer application on soil nitrification, abundance and community shifts of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) in Hangzhou greenhouse vegetable soil. Results showed that single application of biochar had no significant effect on soil net nitrification rates and ammonia-oxidizers. Conversely, the application of only N fertilizer and N fertilizer + biochar significantly increased net nitrification rate and the abundance of AOB rather than AOA, and only AOB abundance was significantly correlated with soil net nitrification rate. Moreover, the combined application of N fertilizer and biochar had greater effect on AOB communities than that of the only N fertilizers, and the relative abundance of 156 bp T-RF (Nitrosospira cluster 3c) decreased but 60 bp T-RF (Nitrosospira cluster 3a and cluster 0) increased to become a single predominant group. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that all the AOB sequences were grouped into Nitrosospira cluster, and most of AOA sequences were clustered within group 1.1b. We concluded that soil nitrification was stimulated by the combined application of N fertilizer and biochar via enhancing the abundance and shifting the community composition of AOB rather than AOA in intensive vegetable soil.",

We focus on the optimization of DHA production using Schizochytrium sp. using different media supplements; glucose, fructose and glycerol as carbon variants, proteose peptone and tryptone as nitrogen variants. The highest biomass (5.61 g/L) and total fatty acid yield (1.74 g/L) were obtained in proteose peptone medium which was used as the alternative nitrogen source instead of yeast extract. The highest DHA yield (0.40 g/L) was achieved with glycerol as the carbon source although it had the second lowest biomass production after ethanol containing medium. Ethanol, as an alternative carbon source and a precursor for acetyl-CoA, increased DHA percentage in total lipid content from 29.94 to 40.04% but decreasing the biomass drastically. Considering different carbon and nitrogen sources during cultivation of Schizochytrium sp. will improve DHA production. Combination of proteose peptone and glycerol as nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively, and addition of ethanol with a proper timing will be useful to have higher DHA yield.",

In this regard, the ability of phosphofungi to dissolve insoluble phosphorus compounds is greater than that of phosphate-solubilizing bacteria. The aim of the current study was to identify efficient phosphofungi that could be developed as commercial microbial agents. Among several phosphate-solubilizing fungal isolates screened, strain CS-1 showed the highest phosphorus-solubilization ability. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region sequence, it was identified as Aspergillus niger. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed that the mechanism of phosphorus solubilization by CS-1 involved the synthesis and secretion of organic acids, mainly oxalic, tartaric, and citric acids. Furthermore, strain CS-1 exhibited other growth-promoting abilities, including efficient potassium release and degradation of crop straw cellulose. These properties help to returning crop residues to the soil, thereby increasing nutrient availability and sustaining organic matter concentration therein. A pot experiment revealed that CS-1 apparently increased the assessed biometric parameters of wheat seedlings, implying the potential of this strain to be developed as a commercial microbial agent. We used Illumina MiSeq sequencing to investigate the microbial community composition in the rhizosphere of uninoculated wheat plants and wheat plants inoculated with the CS-1 strain to obtain insight into the effect of the CS-1 strain inoculation. The data clearly demonstrated that CS-1 significantly reduced the content of pathogenic fungi, including Gibberella, Fusarium, Monographella, Bipolaris, and Volutella, which cause soil-borne diseases in various crops.

    "abstract": "The detrimental effects of synthetic fungicides have increased the emphasis for biological control as an effective and safe sustainable alternative method. In the present work, a potent rhizospheric actinobacterium MR14 showed broad spectrum antifungal and plant growth promoting activities indicating the potential to fulfill the need. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the isolate could be assigned as new species of the Streptomyces, coded as Streptomyces sp. MR14. It formed clade with Streptomyces daghestanicus but with very low bootstrap value (14%). The MR14 supernatant showed potent antagonistic activity against 13 different tested fungal phytopathogens. The most and least sensitive fungal phytopathogens were found to be Pyricularia oryzae and Fusarium oxysporum with inhibition zones of 31 mm and 11 mm, respectively. The antifungal metabolites produced by strain MR14 were thermostable, photostable, and remained active at extreme acidic and neutral pH. In pot experiments, the Streptomyces sp. MR14 cells, supernatant and extract significantly suppressed Fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium moniliforme in tomato plants. Various growth parameters such as shoot and root lengths, and plant fresh and dry weights were significantly enhanced by 19.65 to 321.62% over the pathogen infested plants only. The treatment with culture cells/supernatant/extract in the rhizosphere soil also reduced the microbial count as compared to control. In addition, the strain also possessed plant growth promoting potential which was indicated by the increase in various agronomic traits from 3.64 to 116.88%. This study provided a scientific validation that the new rhizobacterium Streptomyces sp. MR14 could be further developed as bioformulation, exhibiting biocontrol and plant growth promoting capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Rice husk (RH) is the major agricultural waste obtained during rice hulling process, which can be a sustainable source of xylooligosaccharide (XOS). The current study deals with the production of XOS from Thai rice husk using alkaline pretreatment and enzyme hydrolysis method. The response surface methodology consisted of central composite design and Box-Behnken design was employed to achieve the maximum response in alkaline pretreatment and XOS production, respectively. The optimum conditions for alkaline pretreatment to recover maximum xylan yield were 12-18% of alkaline concentration, the temperature at 110-120 °C, and steaming time for 37.5-40 min. The FTIR results suggested that the extracted sample was the xylan fraction. The maximum XOS production of 17.35 ± 0.31 mg XOS per mL xylan was observed in the run conditions of 6.25 mg enzyme per g xylan, 9 h of incubation time, and 5% of xylan. The results revealed that the xylan extracted from RH by using an effective base couple with the steam application and the enzymatic hydrolysis help to maximize the yield of XOS, which can be further used in functional foods and dietary supplements.",

    "abstract": "The phyllosphere supports a tremendous diversity of microbes, which have the potential to influence plant biogeography and ecosystem function. Although biocontrol agents (BCAs) have been used extensively for controlling plant diseases, the ecological effects of BCAs on phyllosphere bacteria and the relationships between phyllosphere community and plant health are poorly understood. In this study, we explored the control efficiency of two BCA communities on bacterial wildfire disease by repeatedly spraying BCAs on tobacco leaves. The results of field tests showed that BCAs used in our study, especially BCA_B, had remarkable control effects against tobacco wildfire disease. The higher control efficiency of BCA_B might be attributed to a highly diverse and complex community in the phyllosphere. By 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, we found that phyllosphere microbial community, including community diversity, taxonomic composition and microbial interactions, changed significantly by application of BCAs. According to the correlation analysis, it showed that wildfire disease infection of plants was negatively related to phyllosphere microbial diversity, indicating a highly diverse community in the phyllosphere might prevent pathogens invasion and colonization. In addition, we inferred that a more complex network in the phyllosphere might be beneficial for decreasing the chances of bacterial wildfire outbreak, and the genera of Pantoea and Sphingomonas might play important roles in wildfire disease suppression. These correlations between phyllosphere community and plant health will improve our understanding on the ecological function of phyllosphere community on plants.",

Commonly, the well-established Cooper medium, a glucose-based mineral salt medium, is utilized for the microbial production of Surfactin. The current study investigated the enhancement of Surfactin yields by analyzing the effects of different glucose concentrations, next to the introduction of an alternative chelating agent and nitrogen source. The utilization of 8 g/L glucose, 0.008 mM Na3citrate and 50 mM (NH4)2SO4 increased Surfactin yields from 0.7 to 1.1 g/L during shake flask experiments applying Bacillus subtilis DSM10(T). Consequentially conducted shake flask experiments, employing five other Surfactin producer strains during cultivation in the former and enhanced version of the Cooper medium, suggest a general enhancement of Surfactin yields during application of the enhanced version of the Cooper medium. The enhancement of the medium composition is therefore most likely independent from the employed producer strain. The following utilization of the enhanced medium composition during fed-batch fermentation with integrated foam fractionation yielded 30 % more Surfactin in comparison to batch fermentations with integrated foam fractionation employing the former version of the Cooper medium.",

These economic disparities are amplified among low and middle-income where sanitation and hygiene are challenged by the increasing demand for quality sources of animal protein. With a view to investigating the prevalence of virulence genes and QACs resistance genes as well as monitoring the antibiogram of E. coli strains, a total of 368 specimens were collected from diseased broiler chickens (n = 226) and environmental sources (n = 142) at large-scale poultry farms in Ismailia Governorate, Egypt. The bacteriological examination proved that E. coli prevalence was 26.76% and 50.44% in the farm environment and diseased broilers, respectively. In tandem, the isolated E. coli strains were serogrouped, determining the most common serotypes were O78, O1:H7, O91:H21 and O126. Isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility against 12 antibiotics, screened for 4 virulence genes (iss, papC, eaeA, and cfaI), and screened for 3 QACs resistance genes (qacEΔ1, qacA/B, and qacC/D). All the tested strains were positive for iss and papC genes, only 20.3% of the tested strains were positive for eaeA gene, moreover, the examined strains were negative to CFAI gene. Furthermore, all the tested strains were positive for qacEΔ1, qacA/B, and qacC/D genes. In conclusion; virulence genes (iss, papC) as well as QACs resistance genes are common in avian Pathogenic E. coli and environmental strains and are mainly associated with multi-drug resistance phenomena.",

The medium components and culture conditions were optimized to enhance keratinase production through shake flask culture.

These enzymes play important roles in cellular metabolism, CO2 transport, ion transport, and internal pH regulation. Understanding the metabolic role of CAs in the chemolithoautotropic bacterium Ralstonia eutropha is important for the development of high performance fermentation processes based on the bacterium's capability to fix carbon using the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle. Analysis of the R. eutropha H16 genome sequence revealed the presence of four CA genes: can, can2, caa and cag. We evaluated the importance of each of the CAs in the metabolism of R. eutropha by examination of growth and enzyme activity in gene deletion, complementation, and overexpression strains. All four purified CAs were capable of performing the interconversion of CO2 and HCO3-, although the equilibrium towards the formation of CO2 or HCO3- differs with each CA. Deletion of can, encoding a β-CA, affected the growth of R. eutropha; however the growth defect could be compensated by adding CO2 to the culture. Deletion of the caa, encoding an α-CA, had the strongest deleterious influence on cell growth. Strains with deletion or overexpression of can2 or cag genes exhibited similar behavior to wild type under most of the conditions tested. In this work, Caa was studied in greater detail using microscopy and complementation experiments, which helped confirm its periplasmic localization and determine its importance for robust growth of R. eutropha. A hypothesis for the coordinated role of these four enzymes in the metabolism of R. eutropha is proposed.",

However, limited effort has been put into investigation of specific primer sets for analysis of the bacterial diversity of aging flue-cured tobaccos (AFTs), as well as prediction of the function of the bacterial community. In this study, the performance of four primer pairs in determining bacterial community structure based on 16S rRNA gene sequences in AFTs was assessed, and the functions of genes were predicted using Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt). Results revealed that the primer set 799F–1193R covering the amplification region V5V6V7 gave a more accurate picture of the bacterial community structure of AFTs, with lower co-amplification levels of chloroplast and mitochondrial genes, and more genera covered than when using the other primers. In addition, functional gene prediction suggested that the microbiome of AFTs was involved in kinds of interested pathways. A high abundance of functional genes involved in nitrogen metabolism was detected in AFTs, reflecting a high level of bacteria involved in degrading harmful nitrogen compounds and generating nitrogenous nutrients for others. Additionally, the functional genes involved in biosynthesis of valuable metabolites and degradation of toxic compounds provided information that the AFTs possess a huge library of microorganisms and genes that could be applied to further studies. All of these findings provide a significance reference for researchers working on the bacterial diversity assessment of tobacco-related samples.",

However, the recombinant yeast fermented xylose slowly. In this study, an evolutionary engineering strategy was applied to improve xylose fermentation by the xylA-expressing yeast strain, which involved sequential batch cultivation on xylose. The resulting yeast strain co-fermented glucose and xylose rapidly and almost simultaneously, exhibiting improved ethanol production and productivity. It was also observed that when cells were grown in a medium containing higher glucose concentrations before being transferred to fermentation medium, higher rates of xylose consumption and ethanol production were obtained, demonstrating that xylose utilization was not regulated by catabolic repression. Results obtained by qPCR demonstrate that the efficiency in xylose fermentation showed by the evolved strain is associated, to the increase in the expression of genes HXT2 and TAL1, which code for a low-affinity hexose transporter and transaldolase, respectively. The ethanol productivity obtained after the introduction of only one genetic modification and the submission to a one-stage process of evolutionary engineering was equivalent to those of strains submitted to extensive metabolic and evolutionary engineering, providing solid basis for future applications of this strategy in industrial strains.",

S. cerevisiae is frequently challenged by bacterial contamination and a combination of lignocellulosic inhibitors formed during the pre-treatment, in terms of growth, ethanol yield and productivity. We investigated the phenotypic robustness of a brewing yeast strain TMB3500 and its ability to adapt to low pH thereby preventing bacterial contamination along with lignocellulosic inhibitors by short-term adaptation and adaptive lab evolution (ALE). The short-term adaptation strategy was used to investigate the inherent ability of strain TMB3500 to activate a robust phenotype involving pre-culturing yeast cells in defined medium with lignocellulosic inhibitors at pH 5.0 until late exponential phase prior to inoculating them in defined media with the same inhibitor cocktail at pH 3.7. Adapted cells were able to grow aerobically, ferment anaerobically (glucose exhaustion by 19 ± 5 h to yield 0.45 ± 0.01 g ethanol g glucose−1) and portray significant detoxification of inhibitors at pH 3.7, when compared to non-adapted cells. ALE was performed to investigate whether a stable strain could be developed to grow and ferment at low pH with lignocellulosic inhibitors in a continuous suspension culture. Though a robust population was obtained after 3600 h with an ability to grow and ferment at pH 3.7 with inhibitors, inhibitor robustness was not stable as indicated by the characterisation of the evolved culture possibly due to phenotypic plasticity. With further research, this short-term adaptation and low pH strategy could be successfully applied in lignocellulosic ethanol plants to prevent bacterial contamination.",

    "abstract": "Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has been successfully used to image biofilms because of its high resolution and magnification. However, conventional SEM requires dehydration and metal coating of biological samples before observation, and because biofilms consist mainly of water, sample dehydration may influence the biofilm structure. When coated with an ionic liquid, which is a kind of salt that exists in the liquid state at room temperature, biological samples for SEM observation do not require dehydration or metal coating because ionic liquids do not evaporate under vacuum conditions and are electrically conductive. This study investigates the ability of ionic liquids to allow SEM observation of Streptococcus mutans biofilms compared with conventional coating methods. Two hydrophilic and two hydrophobic ionic liquids, all of which are electronic conductors, are used. Compared with samples prepared by the conventional method, the ionic-liquid-treated samples do not exhibit a fibrous extracellular matrix structure and cracking on the biofilm surface. The hydrophilic ionic liquids give clearer images of the biofilm structure than those of the hydrophobic ionic liquids. This study finds that ionic liquids are useful for allowing the observation of biofilms by SEM without preparation by dehydration and metal coating.",

    "abstract": "Chinese Mongolian sheep are an important ruminant raised for wool and meat production. However, little is known about the microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of Chinese Mongolian sheep. To increase our understanding of the microbial community composition in the GIT of Chinese Mongolian sheep, microbiota of five sheep is investigate for the first time using the Illumina MiSeq platform. High microbial diversity was obtained from the GIT, and the microbiota exhibited a higher biodiversity in the stomach and large intestine than in the small intestine. Firmicutes (44.62%), Bacteroidetes (38.49%), and Proteobacteria (4.11%) were the three most abundant phyla present in the GIT of the sheep. The present study also revealed the core genera of Prevotella, Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, Oscillospira, Treponema, and Desulfovibrio in the GIT. Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States indicated that the metabolic pathway related to carbohydrate metabolism was the richest in the sheep GIT. In addition, a series of metabolic pathways related to plant secondary metabolism was most abundant in the stomach and large intestine than in the small intestine. Overall, the present study provides insight into the microbial community composition in GIT of the Chinese Mongolian sheep which is highly diverse and needs to be studied further to exploit the complex interactions with the host.",

The results showed that the optimum temperature and pH of immobilized cellulase was 40 °C and 3.0, respectively. After 1 month of storage at 4 °C, the enzyme activity of immobilized cellulase dropped to 71.2% of the baseline. Immobilized cellulase was proved to be reusable and maintained ~ 70% of its activity after 7 cycles of repeated use. Versus free cellulase, the immobilized cellulase showed good thermal stability, pH resistance, storage stability and reusability, which could be beneficial in large-scale industrial manufacturing processes.",

The dominant genera were Clostridium, Chloroflexus and Meiothermus at Jakrem (water temperature 46 °C, pH 9) and Thiobacillus, Sulfuritalea at Yumthang (water temperature 39 °C, pH 8) hot springs. The four Euryarchaeota taxa that were observed in both the hot springs were Methanoculleus, Methanosaeta, Methanosarcina and Methanocorposculum. Elstera litoralis, Thiovirga sp., Turneriella sp. were observed for the first time in association with hot springs along with Tepidibacter sp., Ignavibacterium sp., Teribacillus sp. and Dechloromonas sp. Individual bacterial phyla were found to be specifically correlated with certain physico-chemical factors such as temperature, dissolved SiO2, elemental S, total sulphide, calcium concentrations in hot spring water. Bacterial reads involved in sulfur cycle were identified in both16S rRNA gene library and sulfur metabolism may play key physiological functions in this hot spring. Members within Desulfobacterales and Thermodesulfovibrionaceae were identified and hypothesized their role in regulating sulfur cycle. The presence of many taxonomically unsolved sequences in the 16S rRNA gene tag datasets from these hot springs could be a sign of novel microbe richness in these less known hot water bodies of Northeastern India.",

The gut bacterial community of diseased shrimp was distinct from the healthy one and temporally less stable, characterized by decreased alpha-diversity and dispersive structure. And its dominant ecological process experienced a transition with disease onset time, although deterministic process mainly governed the healthy gut bacterial assembly. In addition, the core microbiota of healthy shrimp gut harbored more diverse bacterial taxa with more cooperative interactions, while the diseased core microbiota showed opposite pattern with significantly higher abundance of opportunistic pathogens as well. These findings indicate that shrimp heath is highly relevant to the homeostasis of its gut bacterial community.

During bioethanol production from cellulosic biomass composed mainly of d-glucose and d-xylose, the PPP is also involved in xylose metabolism by engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although the activities and thermostabilities of the four PPP enzymes (transaldolase: TAL1, transketolase: TKL1, ribose-5-phosphate ketol-isomerase: RKI1 and d-ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase: RPE1) can affect the efficiency of cellulosic ethanol production at high temperatures, little is known about the suitable expression levels of these PPP genes. Here, we overexpressed PPP genes from S. cerevisiae and the thermotolerant yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus either singly or in combination in recombinant yeast strains harboring a mutant of xylose isomerase (XI) and evaluated xylose consumption and ethanol production of these yeast transformants in glucose/xylose mixed media at 36 °C. Among the PPP genes examined, we found that: (1) strains that overexpressed S. cerevisiae TKL1 exhibited the highest rate of xylose consumption relative to strains that overexpressed other PPP genes alone; (2) overexpression of RKI1 and TAL1 derived from K. marxianus with S. cerevisiae TKL1 increased the xylose consumption rate by 1.87-fold at 24 h relative to the control strain (from 0.55 to 1.03 g/L/h); (3) the strains with XI showed higher ethanol yield than strains with xylose reductase and xylitol dehydrogenase and (4) PHO13 disruption did not improve xylose assimilation under the experimental conditions. Together these results indicated that optimization of PPP activity improves xylose metabolism in genetically engineered yeast strains, which could be useful for commercial production of ethanol from cellulosic material.",

Molecular detection of pathogens by using PCR-based methods usually requires a well-equipped laboratory. Rapid detection tools that can be applied as point-of-care diagnostics are highly desirable, especially to intercept quarantine plant pathogens such as Xylella fastidiosa, Ceratocystis platani and Phytophthora ramorum, three of the most devastating pathogens of trees and ornamental plants in Europe and North America. To this aim, in this study we developed three different loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays able to detect each target pathogen both in DNA extracted from axenic culture and in infected plant tissues. By using the portable instrument Genie® II, the LAMP assay was able to recognize X. fastidiosa, C. platani and P. ramorum DNA within 30 min of isothermal amplification reaction, with high levels of specificity and sensitivity (up to 0.02 pg µL-1 of DNA). These new LAMP-based tools, allowing an on-site rapid detection of pathogens, are especially suited for being used at ports of entry, but they can be also profitably used to monitor and prevent the possible spread of invasive pathogens in natural ecosystems.",

Due to the ban on the use of antibiotics in 2006 as antimicrobial growth promoters have led to the reemergence of the disease. Worldwide numerous studies have been carried out to investigate the alternatives to antibiotics for the prevention of SNE. Possible alternatives to control SNE include probiotics, prebiotics, bacteriophages, essential oils, organic acids, secondary metabolites and other microbial products. Currently, probiotics are most extensively used in poultry production as an alternative to antibiotics. This review summarizes recent insights and experimental evidence on the use of different microorganisms like Bacillus, Lactic acid bacteria, Bifidobacteria, Enterococcus, yeast, etc. as valuable probiotics for prevention of SNE and potential molecular mechanisms responsible for ameliorating effects of probiotics against SNE.",

Probiotics are beneficial for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD. Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis V9 (V9) is a newly isolated strain with favorable probiotic properties. The study aims to evaluate the effects and mechanisms of V9 on the hepatic steatosis and inflammatory responses in a rat model of NAFLD induced by high-fat diets (HFD). Our results showed that administration of V9 significantly attenuated the HFD-induced increases in alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, resulting in alleviated hepatic steatosis. V9 supplementation reduced the accumulation of hepatic triglyceride and free fatty acid,while increasing the levels of glycogen. Serum levels of glucose were also decreased in HFD rats administrated with V9. Meanwhile, the transcription of SREBP-1c and FAS was reduced, and the hepatic expression of phosphorylated-AMPK and PPAR-α was restored after V9 administration. V9 suppressed the production of inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α) in HFD-fed rats. The anti-inflammatory effects of V9 was found to be associated with the inhibition of hepatic expression of TLR4, TLR9, NLRP3, and ASC mRNA. Furthermore, the activation of ERK, JNK, AKT and NF-κB were suppressed by V9 treatment. These results indicate that Bifidobacterium lactis V9 improves NAFLD by regulating de novo lipid synthesis and suppressing inflammation through AMPK and TLR-NF-κB pathways, respectively.",

In this study, we report for the first time the growth of filamentous ascomycete fungus, Neurospora intermedia in its mycelial pellet form. In submerged culture, the growth morphology of the fungus was successfully manipulated into growing as pellets by modifying various cultivation conditions. Factors such as pH (2.0-10.0), agitation rate (100-150 rpm), carbon source (glucose, arabinose, sucrose, and galactose), the presence of additive agents (glycerol and calcium chloride) and trace metals were investigated for their effect on the pellet formation. Of the various factors screened, uniform pellets were formed only at pH range 3.0-4.0, signifying it as the most influential factor for N. intermedia pellet formation. The average pellet size ranged from 2.38 ± 0.12 to 2.86 ± 0.38 mm. The pellet formation remained unaffected by the inoculum type used and its size showed an inverse correlation with the agitation rate of the culture. Efficient glucose utilization was observed with fungal pellets, as opposed to the freely suspended mycelium, proving its viability for fast-fermentation processes.

In vivo assays showed that B. velezensis 83 was able to control anthracnose (Kent mangoes) as efficiently as chemical treatment with Captan 50 PH™ or Cupravit hidro™. The inoculation of B. velezensis 83 to the roots of maize seedlings yielded an increase of 12% in height and 45% of root biomass, as compared with uninoculated seedlings. In vitro co-culture assays showed that B. velezensis 83 promoted Arabidopsis thaliana growth (root and shoot biomass) while, under the same experimental conditions, B. velezensis FZB42 (reference strain) had a suppressive effect on plant growth. In order to characterize the isolated strain, the complete genome sequence of B. velezensis 83 is reported. Its circular genome consists of 3,997,902 bp coding to 3949 predicted genes. The assembly and annotation of this genome revealed gene clusters related with plant-bacteria interaction and sporulation, as well as ten secondary metabolites biosynthetic gene clusters implicated in the biological control of phytopathogens. Despite the high genomic identity (> 98%) between B. velezensis 83 and B. velezensis FZB42, they are phenotypically different.

Eighty pigs with an average body weight (BW) of 30 kg were randomly divided into eight groups: A control group, a group that received antibiotic treatment, and six groups fed diets supplemented with 100, 250, and 500 g/t XOS, of which three groups were in the growing period (GP, 30–65 kg BW) and three groups in the growing and fattening period (GFP, 30–100 kg BW). At the end of the experiment, the intestinal contents were sampled for analyses of gut microbiota and bacterial metabolites including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bioamines. The results showed that 100 g/t XOS supplementation during the GFP significantly reduced the relative abundances of presumably pathogenic bacteria (Proteobacteria and Citrobacter), but enhanced the relative abundances of likely beneficial bacteria (Firmicutes and Lactobacillus). However, XOS supplementation during the GP showed little effect on the gut microbiota when pigs were killed at 100 kg BW. Meanwhile, 100 g/t XOS supplementation during the GFP decreased the level of 1,7-heptane diamine and increased the acetic acid, straight-chain fatty acids, and total SCFAs concentrations in the intestinal contents. Statistical analysis showed that both the dose and exposure time to XOS supplementation affected the microbial communities. In summary, 100 g/t XOS supplementation during the GFP modified the gut microbiota composition and metabolic activity. Possible consequences of such changes for the host are discussed.",

At present, there have been no reports on the composition and functional analysis of intestinal microbiota in Yunlong Grouper (Epinephelus moara♀ × Epinephelus lanceolatus♂). In this study we analyzed and compared the intestinal microbiota composition of healthy and diseased pond-reared fish to discern the functional profile of a healthy status. The richness and diversity of the intestinal microbiota did not differ significantly between diseased and healthy fish, yet the abundance of predominant phyla like the Proteobacteria were upregulated in the diseased Yunlong Grouper. At the genus level, a significant reduction of Cetobacterium was observed in the intestinal tracts of diseased fish, as Pseudomonas became the most dominant bacterium. To compare the intestinal microorganism abundances between the two health groups of fish, we first screened the gut bacteria and discerned 4 phyla and 12 genera to designate a healthy status in Yunlong Grouper. The environmental bacterial community influenced composition of the intestinal microbiota in Yunlong Grouper, and the intestinal microbiota of diseased fish was more susceptible to the influence of the culture water. In addition, the prediction of functional genes by phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt) indicated that the intestinal microbiota of Yunlong Grouper is related mainly to the terms \"metabolism, environmental information processing, genetic information processing, human diseases, and cellular processing; moreover, the functions of the intestinal microbiota differed between the different health states of this fish. The overall results indicate that the occurrence of disease can affect the composition and function of the intestinal microbiota in a cultured fish.",

Virulence analysis and molecular typing as powerful approaches can provide relevant information on K. pneumoniae infection. In the current study, antibiotic resistance, virulence-associated genes analysis, as well as molecular typing of K. pneumoniae strains were investigated. Out of 505 clinical samples collected from hospitalized patients, 100 K. pneumoniae strains were isolated by standard microbiological methods and subjected to the phenotypic and genotyping analysis. The highest prevalence of resistance was observed against ciprofloxacin (75%), trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (73%) and nitrofurantoin (68%). Virulence associated genes including entB , traT , ybts, magA, iucC, htrA and rmpA were found in 80%, 62%, 75%, 5%, 30%, 72% and 48%, of the isolates, respectively. The prevalence of biofilm-associated genes including mrkA, fimH , and mrkD were equally 88% for all tested isolates. Moreover, the efflux pump genes including AcrAB, TolC and mdtK were observed in 41 (41%), 33 (33%) and 26 (26%) of the strains respectively. A significant statistical association was observed between MDR strains and high expression of efflux pump and biofilm genes. The K. pneumoniae strains were differentiated into 11 different genetic patterns using the repetitive element sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) technique. High prevalence of resistance, presence of various virulence factors, high level of efflux pump, and biofilm gene expression in diverse clones of K. pneumoniae strains pose an important health issue in clinical settings.",

However, the Saudi Origanum contains carvacrol as the major component and is, thus, characterized as a carvacrol chemotype, while the Jordanian Origanum contains thymol as the major component, and, thus, it is classified as a thymol chemotype. In addition, the antimicrobial activities of the studied EOs and their major components, including carvacrol and thymol, were evaluated against various Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms. All the tested compounds exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against all the tested bacteria.

Our results indicated that oral administration of MG136-pMG36e-GLP-1 significantly reduced lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced memory impairment and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced motor dysfunction through the toll-like receptor4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) and protein kinase B (AKT)/Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) signaling pathway. High-throughput sequencing results showed that MG1363-pMG36e-GLP-1 reduced the abundance of the pathogens Enterococcus , Proteus , and increased the abundance of the probiotics Akkermansia muciniphila .

AMPs are essential components of the innate immune system and exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. P5 is a Cecropin A-Magainin 2 hybrid analog peptide with antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. In the present study, truncated peptides were designed to reduction length, retainment their antimicrobial activity and low toxicity at high concentrations compared with that of the parent peptide P5. The truncated peptides P5-CT1 and P5-NT1 exhibited antibacterial activities against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. In contrast, P5-CT2, P5-CT3, P5-NT2, and P5-NT3 showed higher antibacterial activities against gram-positive bacteria compared to Gram-negative bacteria at low concentration of peptides. The truncated peptides showed lower hemolytic activity and toxic effects against mammalian cells compared with those of the parent peptide P5. The levels of several truncated peptides were maintained in the presence of physiological concentrations of salts, indicating their high stability. The results of flow cytometry, propidium iodide uptake, n-phenyl-1-naphthylamine uptake, and 3,3′-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide assays showed that these truncated peptides killed microbial cells by increasing membrane permeability, thereby causing membrane damage. The results suggested that truncated peptides of P5 have good potential for use as novel antimicrobial agents.",

Only few studies were about the anti-inflammatory effects of sulforaphane in ulcerative colitis. In this study, our purpose is to explore the effects of sulforaphane on the intestinal microbial community of UC mice. The severity of mice colitis were measured by colon length, survial rate, body weight and disease activity index (DAI) score. Histological and morphological evaluation of colon tissues were performed by HE. 16S rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing was used to analyza the changes of mouse flora. The variety of flora expression were explored using quantitative PCR. Sulforaphane treated mice had larger body weight and longer colon length than DSS-induced mice. The colon tissues of DSS group showed congestion and edema. Meanwhile, treatment with sulforaphane effectively reducted the damage scores and MPO activity. Sulforaphane reversed DSS-induced gut dysbiosis. Sulforaphane would shift the balance to Butyricicoccus on inflammation. The possible anti-inflammatory mechanism of sulforaphane is to coordinate with the probiotics such as Butyricicoccus . In summary, these findings proved that sulforaphane might be a useful content and serve as a potential therapy in the treatment of UC.",

This study assessed the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) on alfalfa growth under different phosphorus application levels. In this experiment, a complete randomized block design was used. The following four bacterial applications were used: inoculation of Funneliformis mosseae (Fm), inoculation of Bacillus megaterium (Bm), inoculation of mixed species (Fm × Bm) and noninoculation treatment (CK). Phosphorus (P) treatment was applied at the following four levels: 0 mg kg-1 (P0), 50 mg kg-1 (P1), 100 mg kg-1 (P2) and 150 mg P kg-1 (P3). The results showed that with the increase in phosphorus application, each index increased first and then decreased. The J2 treatment was significantly greater than the J0 treatment (P < 0.05) under the same bacterial treatment. In each cropping period the difference in each index to alfalfa was extremely significant under J, P treatment and J × P interactive treatment (P < 0.01). The indexes were compared by membership function. The priority order was as follows: J3P2 > J1P2 > J3P1 treatment. Therefore, when phosphorus was applied at 100 mg kg-1, the mixed inoculation of Fm × Bm was optimal, benefitting mycorrhiza growth and the production performance of alfalfa.",

Three dietary treatments including: basic diet, basic diet plus organic acids (OAs) in drinking water, and basic diet plus OAs in the feed with and without coccidial challenge. The OAs in water or feed improved (P < 0.01) average body weight (ABW), average body weight gain (ABWG), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) as compared with the control diet during starter, grower, and whole experimental period. Coccidial challenge decreased BW, ABWG, and average feed intake (AFI), as well as resulted in poor FCR during the starter and whole experimental period (P < 0.05). Though there was no interaction between OAs supplementation and coccidial challenge, the OAs supplementation improved the overall performance with and without coccidial challenge birds on 21 d and 35 d. IgG was found higher (P = 0.03) in broilers fed OAs in feed without the coccidial challenge group. On 18 d, OAs supplementation in feed increased TNF-γ (P = 0.006), whereas the coccidial challenge decreases TNF-γ (P = 0.01) and IL-10 (P = < .0001), and increases IgM (P = 0.03), IgG (P = 0.04) and IgA (P = 0.02). On 29 d, the coccidial challenge increases IgM and IgA.

The results showed that the soil microbial biomass carbon and phosphorus were altered significantly by CK and L treatments. Moreover, the indexes of soil bacterial richness and diversity in the sugarcane field could be significantly improved by L. At the genus level, SC-I-84 , Mycobacterium , Micropepsaceae , Saccharimonadales , Subgroup_2 and Acetobacteraceae were the unique dominant bacteria in the soil with the H treatment. JG30-KF-CM45 and Jatrophihabitans were the unique dominant genera in the M treatment. Subgroup_6 , HSB_OF53-F07 , Streptomyces , 67–14 , SBR1031 and KD4-96 were the unique dominant genera in the L treatment.

Moreover, even though soil bacterial richness could be significantly promoted by the M and H treatments, but soil bacterial diversity could not be significantly improved. On the contrary, soil bacterial diversity and richness all could be improved by L treatment. In addition, higher abundance of unique soil dominant bacteria could be only found in L treatment which compared to the CK, M and H treatments.

Identification of the obtained products was based on gas chromatography (GC), infrared spectroscopy (FTIR/ATR), gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and the analysis of 13 C-NMR and 1 H-NMR spectra. The antioxidative capacity of the derivatives obtained was determined by the DPPH free radical reduction method, while the octanol/water partition coefficient ( shake-flask method) was tested to determine the lipophilicity of these compounds. In the next stage of testing EDChA and ETChA–(compounds characterized by the highest degree of free radical scavenging), the penetration of DPPH through pig skin and its accumulation in the skin were evaluated. For comparison, penetration studies of eugenol alone as well as dichloroacetic acid (DChAA) and trichloroacetic acid (TChAA) were also carried out. The antioxidant activity (DPPH, ABTS, and Folin–Ciocalteu methods) of the fluid that penetrated through pig skin was also evaluated. The in vitro pig skin penetration study showed that eugenol derivatives are particularly relevant for topical application. The obtained derivatives were characterized by a high level of antioxidant activity estimated after 24 h of conducting the experiment, which indicates long-term protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the deeper layers of the skin.",

Synergistic interaction was assessed by checkerboard method. Sessile MIC (SMIC) of eugenol was equivalent to the planktonic MIC (PMIC) against C. albicans and S. mutans mixed biofilms. SMIC of fluconazole and azithromycin was increased upto 1000-folds over PMIC. Eradication of single or mixed biofilms was evident from the viability assay and SEM. At 1 × MIC of eugenol, log 10 CFU count of C. albicans cells were decreased from 6.3 to 4.2 and 3.8 ( p &lt; 0.05) in single and mixed biofilms, respectively. SEM studies revealed the eradication of C. albicans and S. mutans cells from glass surface at 800 µg/mL concentration of eugenol. Time dependent killing assay showed dose dependent effect of eugenol on pre-formed CAJ-01, CAJ-12 and S. mutans biofilm cells. Eugenol was highly synergistic with fluconazole (FICI = 0.156) against CAJ-12 single biofilms. However, the combination of eugenol and azithromycin showed maximum synergy (FICI = 0.140) against pre-formed C. albicans and S. mutans mixed biofilms. These findings highlighted the promising efficacy of eugenol in the eradication of biofilms of two oral pathogens ( C. albicans and S. mutans ) in vitro and could also be exploited in synergy with fluconazole and azithromycin in controlling oral infections.",

Additionally, produced lipopeptides display great physicochemical properties of surface tension reduction value (SFT = 28.8 mN/m), significant oil displacement activity (ODA = 4.9 cm), excessive emulsification ability (E24 = 69.8%), and attains critical micelle concentration (CMC) value at 0.58 mg/mL. Furthermore, biosurfactants produced exhibit excellent stability over an extensive range of pH (1-11), salinity (1-8%), temperature (20-121°C), and even after autoclaving. Subsequently, produced lipopeptides are proved suitable for bioremediation of crude oil (86%) and as potent plant growth-promoting agent that significantly (P < 0.05) increase seed germination and plant growth promotion of chili pepper, lettuce, tomato, and pea maximum at a concentration of (0.7 g/100 mL), showed as a potential agent for agriculture and bioremediation processes by lowering economic and environmental stress.",

Compared with the traditional methods, biodegradation is a useful one to completely remove the harmful pollutants from the environment. Here, an engineered strain was first constructed by introducing PNP biodegradation pathway via the hydroquinone (HQ) pathway into Escherichia coli . In the engineered strain BL-PNP, PNP was completely degraded to β-ketoadipate and subsequently enter the metabolites of multiple anabolic pathways. The high tolerance and rapid degradation ability to PNP enable the engineered strain to have the potential to degrade toxic substances. The engineered strain created in this study can be used as a functional strain for bioremediation of PNP and potential toxic intermediates, and the method of assembling aromatic hydrocarbons metabolic pathway can be used to eradicate nitroaromatic pollutants in the environment.",

In the present study biomass of five marine microalgae were screened to find strains with high capacity for the production of sulfated exopolysaccharides. The anticoagulant and antioxidant activities of extracted sulfated polysaccharides were evaluated using activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), DPPH and ABTS assays, respectively. The sulfated polysaccharides extracted from Picochlorum sp. showed a strong DPPH scavenging effect with 85% antioxidant activity. The sulfated polysaccharides of Chlorella sorokiniana, Chlorella sp.

The dual anticoagulant-antioxidant activities in Chlorella sorokiniana could be explained by the combination of various factors including sulfate content and their binding site, monosaccharide residue and glycoside bond which are involved in the polysaccharide's bioactivity.",

The PsPs had a total sugar content of 97.48% and a monosaccharide composition comprising mannose, rhamnose, galacturonic acid, glucose, xylose, and arabinose, with molar ratios of 6.6:15.4:4.5:8.8:40.7:24, respectively. The effects of PsPs on intestinal microflora in mice were also studied, with 16S sequencing results showing an increase in the relative abundance of Firmicutes and a decrease in Bacteroidetes at the phylum level. The abundance of Lactobacillus increased, while those of Lachnospiraceae and Bacteroides reduced (at the genus level) by PsPs treatment. The composition of microbes changed. Levels of SCFAs in the PsPs group were significantly increased compared with control mice, including acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid. These results suggest that PsPs can act as prebiotics, regulating the intestinal tract probiotics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The enzymatic recycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) can be a promising approach to tackle the problem of plastic waste. The thermostability and activity of PET-hydrolyzing enzymes are still insufficient for practical application. Pretreatment of PET waste is needed for bio-recycling. Here, we analyzed the degradation of PET films, packages, and bottles using the newly engineered cutinase Cut190. Using gel permeation chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography, the degradation of PET films by the Cut190 variant was shown to proceed via a repeating two-step hydrolysis process; initial endo-type scission of a surface polymer chain, followed by exo-type hydrolysis to produce mono/bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate and terephthalate from the ends of fragmented polymer molecules. Amorphous PET powders were degraded more than twofold higher than amorphous PET film with the same weight. Moreover, homogenization of post-consumer PET products, such as packages and bottles, increased their degradability, indicating the importance of surface area for the enzymatic hydrolysis of PET. In addition, it was required to maintain an alkaline pH to enable continuous enzymatic hydrolysis, by increasing the buffer concentration (HEPES, pH 9.0) depending on the level of the acidic products formed. The cationic surfactant dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride promoted PET degradation via adsorption on the PET surface and binding to the anionic surface of the Cut190 variant. The Cut190 variant also hydrolyzed polyethylene furanoate. Using the best performing Cut190 variant (L136F/Q138A/S226P/R228S/D250C-E296C/Q123H/N202H/K305del/L306del/N307del) and amorphous PET powders, more than 90 mM degradation products were obtained in 3 days and approximately 80 mM in 1 day.

    "abstract": "The Tol-Pal system of Gram-negative bacteria is necessary for maintaining outer membrane integrity. It is a multiprotein complex of five envelope proteins, TolQ, TolR, TolA, TolB, and Pal. These proteins were first investigated in E. coli, and subsequently been identified in many other bacterial genera. However, the function of the Tol-Pal system in Salmonella Choleraesuis pathogenesis is still unclear. Here, we reported the role of three of these proteins in the phenotype and biology of S. Choleraesuis. We found that mutations in tolA, tolB, and tolR caused severe damage to the cell wall, which was supported by observing the microstructure of spherical forms, long chains, flagella defects, and membrane blebbing. We confirmed that all the mutants significantly decreased S. Choleraesuis survival when exposed to sodium deoxycholate and exhibited a high sensitivity to vancomycin, which may be explained by the disruption of envelope integrity. In addition, tolA, tolB, and tolR mutants displayed attenuated virulence in a mouse infection model. This could be interpreted as a series of defective phenotypes in the mutants, such as severe defects in envelope integrity, growth, and motility. Further investigation showed that all the genes participate in outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) biogenesis. Interestingly, immunization with OMVs from ΔtolB efficiently enhanced murine viability in contrast to OMVs from the wild-type S. Choleraesuis, suggesting its potential use in vaccination strategies. Collectively, this study provides an insight into the biological role of the S. Choleraesuis Tol-Pal system.",

With this view, this paper was conducted for the isolation, identification, and biological evaluation of fungal endophytes of eleven different plant species. A total of 69 endophytic strains were isolated and tested for the presence of bioactive metabolites with antifungal, antibacterial, anticancer, and antioxidant properties in their extracts. Upon screening, two promising strains were found to have all the before-mentioned activities. These strains were Aspergillus sydowii isolated from the bark of Ricinus communis and Aspergillus flavus isolated from the twigs of Psidium guajava . Major compounds present in extracts of the two strains were identified by GC-Mass analyses. Several well-known bioactive compounds as well as unreported ones were identified in the fungal extracts of the two strains. Furthermore, gamma irradiation (at 1000 Gy) of the fungal cultures resulted in improved bioactivities of extracts from the two strains. These findings recommend the two fungal strains as sources of antimicrobial, anticancer, and antioxidant compounds which may aid in the development of novel drugs. The presented research also explains the high-value of fungal endophytes as untapped sources of bioactive metabolites.",

XRD pattern revealed a highly crystalline and pure phase with crystallite size of ~ 7.5 nm, whereas, the W-H plot revealed crystallite size of 11 nm. FTIR spectra revealed characteristic Er-O atomic vibrations in the fingerprint region. Bandgap was obtained as 5.25 eV using K-M function. The physicochemical and morphological nature was established using Raman spectroscopy, reflectance spectroscopy, SAED and HR-TEM. HT-Er2O3 NPS were further evaluated for antidiabetic potential in mice using in-vivo and in-vitro bioassays. The synthesized HT-Er2O3 NPS were screened for in vitro anti-diabetic potentials against α-glucosidase enzyme and α-amylase enzyme and their antioxidant potential was evaluated using DPPH free radical assay. A dose dependent inhibition was obtained against α-glucosidase (IC50 12 μg/mL) and α-amylase (IC50 78 μg/mL) while good DPPH free radical scavenging potential (IC50 78 μg mL-1) is reported. At 1000 μg/mL, the HT-Er2O3 NPS revealed 90.30% and 92.30% inhibition of α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes. HT-Er2O3 NPs treated groups were observed to have better glycemic control in diabetic animals (503.66 ± 5.92*** on day 0 and 185.66 ± 2.60*** on day 21) when compared with positive control glibenclamide treated group. Further, HT-Er2O3 NPS therapy for 21 days caused a considerable effect on serum total lipids, cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL and LDL as compared to untreated diabetic group. In conclusion, our preliminary findings on HT-Er2O3 NPS revealed considerable antidiabetic potential and thus can be an effective candidate for controlling the post-prandial hyperglycemia.

We investigated the dynamics of metabolite profiles, bacterial and fungal communities and their interactions during fermentation using cigar leaves from three geographic regions. The results showed that the contents of total sugar, reducing sugar, starch, cellulose, lignin, pectin, polyphenol and protein in cigar tobacco leaves was significantly decreased during fermentation. Notably, the furfural, neophytadiene, pyridine, benzyl alcohol, geranylacetone, 3-hydroxy-2-butanone, N-hexanal, 3-Methyl-1-butanol and 2,3-pentanedione were important features volatile aroma compounds during fermentation. The α-diversity of fungi and bacteria initially increased and then decreased during fermentation. An analysis of variance showed that microbial diversity was influenced by fermentation stages and growing locations, in which the all stages had greater impacts on α- and β-diversity than all regions. Microbiome profiling had identified several core bacteria including Sphingomonas, Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Ralstonia, Massilia and Fibrobacter. Fungal biomarkers included Aspergillus, Penicillium, Fusarium, Cladosporium and Trichomonascus. Interestingly, the molecular ecological networks showed that the core taxa had significant correlations with metabolic enzymes and physicochemical properties; bacteria and fungi jointly participated in the carbohydrate and nitrogen compound degrading and volatile aroma compound chemosynthesis processes during fermentation.

BDNF variant (V66M) as a target structure was selected, and Vitamin D, Curcumin, Vitamin C, and Quercetin as ligands structures were taken from PubChem database. Multiple tools like AUTODOCK VINA, BIOVIA discovery studio, PyMOL, CB-dock, IMOD server, Swiss ADEMT, and Swiss predict ligands target were used to analyze binding energy, interaction, stability, toxicity, and visualize BDNF -ligand complexes. Compounds Vitamin D3, Curcumin, Vitamin C, and Quercetin with binding energies values of − 5.5, − 6.1, − 4.5, and − 6.7 kj/mol, respectively, were selected. The ligands bind to the active sites of the BDNF variant (V66M) via hydrophobic bonds, hydrogen bonds, and electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, ADMET analysis of the ligands revealed they exhibited sound pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles. In addition, an MD simulation study showed that the most active ligand bound favorably and dynamically to the target protein, and protein–ligand complex stability was determined. The finding of this research could provide an excellent platform for discovering and rationalizing novel drugs against stress related to BDNF (V66M). Docking, preclinical drug testing and MD simulation results suggest Quercetin as a more potent BDNF variant (V66M) inhibitor and forming a more structurally stable complex.",

It is important to understand that the gut microbiota induced metabolic disease mechanisms and inflammations. Thus it is imperative to have an insight into the state of all chronic subclinical inflammations influencing disease outcomes. However, from the emerging studies, there still exist inconsistencies in the findings of such studies. While making the best out of the reasons for inconsistencies of the findings, this review is designed to make a clear spell out as to the inconsistence of gut microbiota with respect to diabetes. It considered gut-virome alterations and diabetes and gut-bacteriome-gut-virome-alterations and diabetes as confounding factors. The review further explained some study design strategies that will spontaneously eliminate any potential confounding factors to lead to a more evidence based diabetic-gut microbiota medicine. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) pro-inflammatory, metabolic endotoxemia and diet/gut microbiota insulin-resistance and low-grade systemic inflammation induced by gut microbiota can trigger pro-inflammatory cytokines in insulin-resistance, consequently, leading to the diabetic condition. While diet influences the gut microbiota, the consequences are mainly the constant high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the circulatory system. Of recent, dietary natural products have been shown to be anti-diabetic. The effects of resveratrol on the gut showed an improved lipid profile, anti-inflammatory properties and ameliorated the endotoxemia, tight junction and glucose intolerance.",

    "abstract": "The operative mechanisms and advantageous synergies existing between the rhizobiome and the wild plant species Abutilon fruticosum were studied. Within the purview of this scientific study, the reservoir of genes in the rhizobiome, encoding the most highly enriched enzymes, was dominantly constituted by members of phylum Thaumarchaeota within the archaeal kingdom, phylum Proteobacteria within the bacterial kingdom, and the phylum Streptophyta within the eukaryotic kingdom. The ensemble of enzymes encoded through plant exudation exhibited affiliations with 15 crosstalking KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways. The ultimate goal underlying root exudation, as surmised from the present investigation, was the biosynthesis of saccharides, amino acids, and nucleic acids, which are imperative for the sustenance, propagation, or reproduction of microbial consortia. The symbiotic companionship existing between the wild plant and its associated rhizobiome amplifies the resilience of the microbial community against adverse abiotic stresses, achieved through the orchestration of ABA (abscisic acid) signaling and its cascading downstream effects. Emergent from the process of exudation are pivotal bioactive compounds including ATP, D-ribose, pyruvate, glucose, glutamine, and thiamine diphosphate. In conclusion, we hypothesize that future efforts to enhance the growth and productivity of commercially important crop plants under both favorable and unfavorable environmental conditions may focus on manipulating plant rhizobiomes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The genus Enterobacter belongs to the ESKAPE group, which includes Enterococcus faecium , Staphylococcus aureus , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Acinetobacter baumannii , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and Enterobacter spp . This group is characterized by the development of resistance to various antibiotics. In recent years, Enterobacter cloacae ( E. cloacae ) has emerged as a clinically important pathogen responsible for a wide range of healthcare-associated illnesses. Identifying Enterobacter species can be challenging due to their similar phenotypic characteristics. The emergence of multidrug-resistant E. cloacae is also a significant problem in healthcare settings. Therefore, our study aimed to identify and differentiate E. cloacae using Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) as a fast and precise proteomic analytical technique. We also tested hospital-acquired E. cloacae isolates that produce Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) against commonly used antibiotics for treating urinary tract infections (UTIs). We used a total of 189 E. cloacae isolates from 2300 urine samples of patients with UTIs in our investigation. We employed culturing techniques, as well as the BD Phoenix™ automated identification system (Becton, Dickinson) and Analytical Profile Index (API) system for the biochemical identification of E. cloacae isolates. We used the MALDI Biotyper (MBT) device for peptide mass fingerprinting analysis of all isolates. We utilized the single peak intensities and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) created by MBT Compass software to discriminate and cluster the E. cloacae isolates. Additionally, we evaluated the sensitivity and resistance of ESBL- E. cloacae isolates using the Kirby Bauer method. Out of the 189 E. cloacae isolates, the BD Phoenix system correctly identified 180 (95.24%) isolates, while the API system correctly identified 165 (87.30%) isolates. However, the MBT accurately identified 185 (98.95%) isolates with a score of 2.00 or higher. PCA positively discriminated the identified E. cloacae isolates into one group, and prominent peaks were noticed between 4230 mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and 8500 m/z. The ESBL- E. cloacae isolates exhibited a higher degree of resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalothin, cefuroxime, and cefoxitin. Several isolates were susceptible to carbapenems (meropenem, imipenem, and ertapenem); however, potential future resistance against carbapenems should be taken into consideration. In conclusion, MALDI-TOF MS is a powerful and precise technology that can be routinely used to recognize and differentiate various pathogens in clinical samples. Additionally, the growing antimicrobial resistance of this bacterium may pose a significant risk to human health.",

The PDPE influenced pathogenic microorganisms, with inhibition zone diameters (IZDs) ranging from 10.0 to 35.0 mm. Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 5638 had the highest IZD, while Salmonella typhi DSM 17058 and Shigella sonnei DSM 5570 had the lowest. The antifungal effect observed only in spore failure or conidia formation. PDPE showed a 100% antibacterial spectrum against bacteria, with MIC values between 250 and 1000 µg/ml. MIC was only indicated with S. aureus of 500 µg/ml. MBC values ranged from 500 to 1000 g/ml, with MBC values of 500 g/ml for B. cereus , E. faecalis , S. typhi , and S. sonnei . The activity was 66.7% at 500 µg/ml, further concentrations of 125–250 g/ml had no antibacterial effect. PDPE biofilm inhibition % had the highest percentage of inhibition (98.59%) with S. aureus , B. cereus (94.12%), and E. coli (74.46%). With 50% (CC 50 ) viral activity, the highest non-toxic PDPE dose was found to be at 123.0 µg/ml.",

Therefore, biosynthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles (nFe) was prepared from the leaves of some vegetables, such as cabbage (C) and turnips (T), as well as moringa leaves (M). Alcoholic extracts of these nanoparticles were also tested on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli to evaluate their antibacterial activity. The results revealed that the particle sizes of the biosynthesis nanomaterials studied ranged from 12.99 to 22.72 nm, and the particles were spherical, irregular, and surrounded by black color. It also contains many functional groups and minerals. Iron nanoparticles modified with Moringa oleifera extract at a concentration of 200 ppm had the highest phenol content compared to other biosynthesis nanoparticles studied. TnFe and MnFe at 200 ppm had a maximum zone of inhibition of 25 mm and 24 mm against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli , respectively. While the minimum inhibition zone of 8.0 mm was observed at 25 ppm for nFe against Escherichia coli . Therefore, it is recommended to use these extracts of biosynthesis iron oxide nanoparticles as antibacterial agents for stored foods.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Evidence of fungal coexistence in humans points towards fungal adaptation to the host environment, like the skin. The human commensal Malassezia has evolved, especially residing in sebum-rich areas of the mammalian body where it can get the necessary nutrition for its survival. This fungus is primarily responsible for skin diseases like Pityriasis versicolor (PV), characterized by hypo or hyperpigmented skin discoloration and erythematous macules. In this manuscript, we report a 19-year-old healthy female who presented with a one-year history of reddish, hypopigmented, asymptomatic lesions over the chest and a raised erythematous lesion over the face. Upon clinical observation, the patient displayed multiple erythematous macules and erythematous papules over the bilateral malar area of the face, along with multiple hypopigmented scaly macules present on the chest and back. Based on the above clinical findings, a diagnosis of PV and Acne vulgaris (AV) was made. Interestingly, the patient was immunocompetent and didn’t have any comorbidities. Upon isolation of skin scrapings and post-culturing, we found the existence of three fungal genera in the same region of the patient’s body. We further went on to confirm the identity of the particular species and found it to represent Malassezia, Rhodotorula , and Candida . We report how Malassezia , the predominant microbial resident skin fungus, coexists with other fungal members of the skin mycobiome. This study on an applied aspect of microbiology also shows how important it is to identify the fungal organism associated with skin infections so that appropriate therapeutics can be advised to avoid cases of relapse.",

However, there are still needs to identify more efficient and effective fungal stain for biomass valorization. In this study, lignin degrading fungi from birch forest were screened for sustainable degradation of waste agricultural straws. The most effective strain was identified as Cerrena unicolor GC.u01 using 18 S rDNA gene-sequencing technology. Three different crop straws (corn stalk, rice and wheat straws) were used for the biotreatment studies. The activities of lignin degrading enzymes, laccase (Lac), cellulase and xylanase, secreted by C. unicolor were also determined. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thermal gravimetric analyzer (TGA) were further used to monitor the effects of the biotreatment process. The results showed that C. unicolor degraded 34.3% rice straw lignin, a percentage which was higher than other isolated strains after 15 d straw liquid fermentation. The highest Lac activity (8.396 U•mL − 1 ) was observed with corn stalk on the 7 d. Cellulase and xylanase activities, in the same biomass, were higher than those of wheat and rice straws after 15 d. Furthermore, SEM, FTIR and TGA analyses showed that C. unicolor pretreatment process had significant effects on corn stalk, rice and wheat straws’ structures. The newly isolated stain of C. unicolor demonstrated high lignin degradation potential that can provide effective, ecofriendly means of valorizing biomass to industrial useable raw-material.",

In response, various scientific communities are seeking safe alternatives to antibiotics. This study comprehensively investigates the antibacterial effects of red dye derived from Monascus purpureus against three bacterial pathogens: Salmonella typhimurium ATCC14028, Escherichia coli ATCC8739, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC25923. The dye was extracted from the Monascus purpureus ATCC16436 strain, using 1 mg of red dye in 1 ml of DMSO to achieve a concentration of 1000 µg/ml. The chemical profile of the red dye extract was analyzed using GC–MS analysis, confirming the presence of several bioactive antimicrobial compounds, including aspidospermidin-17-ol, 1-acetyl-16-methoxy, octanoic acid, and hexadecanoic acid methyl ester. The extract was tested against the bacterial strains at varying concentrations to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC). The results demonstrated significant antibacterial activity, with the highest MIC and MBC values of 6.25/12.5 µg/ml against S. typhimurium . The antibacterial activity of the red dye was compared to five conventional antibiotics using the disc diffusion method, revealing superior effectiveness, particularly against S. typhimurium , with an inhibition zone measuring 20 ± 0.22 mm. Scanning electron microscopy was employed to explore the mechanism of action of the red dye extract, highlighting its impact on bacterial plasma membrane permeability and its interference with cellular energy production. These findings suggest that the Monascus purpureus -derived red dye extract represents a promising natural alternative to conventional antibiotics, demonstrating potent antibacterial activity and potential as a novel therapeutic agent in combating antimicrobial resistance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cryptosporidium sp. is an obligatory intracellular apicomplexan protozoan parasite that causes a disease called cryptosporidiosis with substantial veterinary and medical importance. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate an early diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis using the anti- Cryptosporidium parvum oocyst immunoglobulin IgG polyclonal antibodies (anti- C. parvum IgG PAbs)-based sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of Cryptosporidium oocyst antigens in fecal samples of farm animals in Egypt. Further molecular identification and sequencing were performed for the detected isolates. Eight hundred and twenty fecal samples of farm animals; 102 buffalo calves, 120 cattle calves, 100 lambs and 98 goat kids, 80 buffaloes, 60 cattle, 160 sheep and 100 goats, collected from different small-scale farms and local holders were examined for cryptosporidiosis by Modified Ziehl-Neelsen (MZN) technique. The percentage of positivity was 45.1%, 50%, 20%, 18.4%, 31.25%, 38.3%, 18.8%, and 11% in buffalo calves, cattle calves, lambs, goat kids, adult buffaloes, adult cattle, sheep, and goats, respectively. Molecular identification of Cryptosporidium samples was performed based on COWP gene, revealing the isolates: GenBank: OQ121955.1, OR029973.1 and PP316107.1 which were identical to the C. parvum and GenBank: PP316108.1 and OR029972.1 which were identical to C. hominis and C. andersoni , respectively. Then, C. parvum oocysts were used for preparation of antigens and rabbit immunization. Anti- C. parvum IgG PAbs were purified and characterized by SDS-PAGE and then labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Anti- C. parvum IgG PAbs in-house sandwich ELISA was prepared, then tested this ELISA on 820 samples and compared results with MZN microscopical examination and a commercial sandwich ELISA kit. In this study, in-house sandwich ELISA scored higher sensitivity of 98%, 100% specificity, validity 99% and relative agreement 98.6% than (92%, 90%, 91% and 91.4%) of MZN and (96%, 95%, 95.5% and 95.7%) of coproantigen commercial sandwich ELISA kit, respectively. Moreover, we used PCR to evaluate the positivity of in-house sandwich ELISA results, and the total PCR positive samples were 263 out of 268 sandwich ELISA positive samples (98.13%). In conclusion , the prepared Anti- C. parvum IgG PAbs based sandwich ELISA offered a simple and accurate diagnostic method for cryptosporidiosis in the fecal samples of different species of farm animals in Egypt with high sensitivity (98%) and specificity (100%). Further studies on this Anti- C. parvum IgG PAbs may help also in the protection against cryptosporidiosis.",

L. plantarum solid-state fermentation was employed to solve the problem of releasing the active components of A. membranaceus. The effect of L. plantarum on astragalus was examined by measuring the contents of protein, carbohydrate, calycoflavone, and formononetin in A. membranaceus before and after fermentation. The effect of A. membranaceus on L. plantarum was demonstrated by detecting the changes in galactosidase in L. plantarum before and after fermentation. Fermented A. membranaceus was fed to broiler chickens, and the indices of growth performance, antioxidants, immune function, and intestinal short-chain fatty acids were recorded. The results showed that the cellulose and pectin on the surface of A. membranaceus were decomposed by L. plantarum solid-state fermentation, and the macromolecular proteins were degraded into small molecules. A. membranaceus increased the content of galactosidase in L. plantarum. Solid-state fermentation increased the contents of functional sugars, calycosin, and formononetin in A. membranaceus. Fermentation of A. membranaceus significantly improved the production performance of broilers as well as the antioxidant index, immune index, intestinal morphology, and intestinal short-chain fatty acid content.",

In this review, we highlight and discuss the up-to-date antimicrobial resistance of A. baumannii , the use of phages, their limitations, and future perspectives in treating A. baumannii infections. In addition, the combination of phages with antimicrobials, preclinical and clinical studies including pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics properties have been discussed.",

Incubation periods at 25, 37, and 52.5°C, were 61, 41, and 28 days respectively. Results were used to develop models for predicting E. coli inactivation and survival in anaerobic digestion. For modeling we used the decay of E. coli at each temperature to calculate the first-order inactivation rate coefficients, and these rates were used to formulate the time - temperature - E. coli survival relationships. We found the inactivation rate coefficient at 52.5°C was 17 and 15 times larger than the inactivation rate coefficients at 25 and 37°C, respectively. Decimal reduction times (D10; time to achieve one log removal) at 25, 37, and 52.5°C, were 9 -10, 7 - 8 days, and < 1 day, respectively. The Arrhenius correlation between inactivation rate coefficients and temperatures over the range 25 -52.5°C was developed to understand the impacts of temperature on E. coli inactivation rate. Using this correlation, the time - temperature - E. coli survival relationships were derived. Besides E. coli inactivation, impacts of temperature on biogas production, methane content, pH change, ORP, and solid reduction were also studied. At higher temperatures, biogas production and methane content was greater than that at low temperatures. While at thermophilic temperature pH was increased, at mesophilic and moderate temperatures pH were reduced over the incubation period. These results can be used to understand pathogen inactivation during anaerobic digestion of dairy manure, and impacts of temperatures on performance of anaerobic digesters treating dairy manure.",

The utilization of sodium gluconate resulted in higher levels of PHAs and RLs production than when glucose was used as sole carbon source. The initial phosphate concentration (as PO4 3-) influences both PHAs and RLs productions that were increased during cultivation time. PHAs accumulation was enhanced (> 300 mg/L) after 72 h of cultivation in an initial [PO4 3-] of 25 mM, while RLs production (> 200 mg/L) was started after 35 h and continued until 72 h of cultivation, in a phosphate-limited medium containing initially 5 mM of [PO4 3-]. In addition, the combine effect of initial [PO4 3-] and cultivation time on biomass, PHAs and RLs production was evaluated from 2D contour plots. The results revealed that low initial phosphate concentrations (up to 5 mM) and long incubation time (72 h) promoted RLs biosynthesis while higher initial phosphate concentrations (up to 25 mM) where favorable for biomass and PHAs production. The molecular composition of the produced bio-products was identified. The accumulated PHAs were co-polymers which mainly consisted of 3-hydroxydecanoate (3HD) as resulted by gas chromatography (GC) analysis. The secreted RLs were extracted and their total mixture contained both mono- and di- RLs identified by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Moreover, the molecular composition of the produced RLs characterized in details by LC-MS analysis showed a plethora of diversity including mono-, and di-RLs, di-rhamno-monolipidic congeners differing in the length of the lipidic chain, which additionally were found to be saturated or unsaturated in some cases.",

Electrode materials and microbial synergy determines biocathode MFCs performance. In this study, four materials, granular activated carbon (GAC), granular semicoke (GS), granular graphite (GG) and carbon felt cube (CFC) were used as packed cathodic materials. The microbial composition on each material and its correlation with the electricity generation performance of MFCs were investigated. Results showed that different biocathode materials had an important effect on the type of microbial species in biocathode MFCs. The microbes belonging to Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria were the dominant phyla in the four materials packed biocathode MFCs. Comamonas of Betaproteobacteria might play significant roles in electron transfer process of GAC, GS and CFC packed biocathode MFCs, while in GG packed MFC Acidovorax may be correlated with power generation. The biocathode materials also had influence on the microbial diversity and evenness, but the differences in them were not positively related to the power production.",

    "abstract": "Abstract pH control has been essential for butanol production with Clostridium acetobutylicum . However, it is not very clear at what pH level the acid crash will occur, at what pH level butanol production will be dominant, and at what pH level butyric acid production will be prevailing. Furthermore, contradictory results have been reported about required acidic conditions for initiation of solventogenesis. In this study, with the aim of further understanding the role of undissociated butyric acid in butanol production, we investigated the correlation between undissociated butyric acid concentration and specific butanol production rate in batch fermentation of Clostridium acetobutylicum by comparing three pH control approaches: NaOH neutralization (at 12, 24 or 36 h), CaCO 3 supplementation (2, 5, or 8 g/l) and NaOAc buffering (pH 4.6, 5.0 or 5.6). By neutralizing the fermentation pH to ~5.0 at different time, we observed that neutralization should take place at the beginning of exponential phase (12 h), and otherwise resulting in lower concentrations of undissociated butyric acid, cell biomass and final butanol. CaCO 3 supplementation extended cell growth to 36 h and resulted in higher butyrate yield under 8 g/L of CaCO 3 . In the NaOAc buffering, the highest specific butanol rate (0.58 h −1 ) was associated with the highest undissociated butyric acid (1.92 g/L). The linear correlation of the undissociated butyric acid with the specific butanol production rates suggested the undissociated butyric acid could be the major driving force for butanol production.",

Recombinant clones were screened for functional protease activity on skim milk agar plates. Upon screening 70,000 clones, a clone carrying recombinant plasmid pSP1 exhibited protease activity. In vitro transposon mutagenesis and sequencing of the insert DNA in this clone revealed an ORF of 1890 bp encoding a protein with 630 amino acids which showed significant sequence homology to the peptidase S8 and S53 subtilisin kexin sedolisin of Shewanella sp. This ORF was cloned in pET30b and expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Although the cloned Alkaline Serine protease (AS-protease) was overexpressed, it was inactive as a result of forming inclusion bodies. After solubilisation, the protease was purified using Ni-NTA chromatography and then refolded properly to retain protease activity. The purified AS-protease with a molecular mass of ~63 kDa required a divalent cation (Co 2+ or Mn 2+ ) for its improved activity. The pH and temperature optima for this protease were 10.5 and 42°C respectively.",

To enhance GABA production further by increasing the intracellular concentration of its precursor glutamate, we focused on engineering pknG (encoding serine/threonine protein kinase G), which controls the activity of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (Odh) in the tricarboxylic acid cycle branch point leading to glutamate synthesis.

In the present study, single-chamber MFCs were inoculated with rice paddy-field soil and continuously supplied with an acetate medium containing different concentrations of NaCl (0-1.8 M). Polarization analyses showed that power output increased as the NaCl concentration increased to 0.1 M, while it was markedly diminished over 0.3 M. The increase in power output was associated with an increased abundance of anode microbes as assessed by protein assays. Notably, the power increase was also accompanied by an increase in the abundance ratio of Geobacter bacteria to total anode bacteria as assessed by pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons and specific quantitative PCR. Although most Geobacter species are known to exhibit high growth rates in freshwater media without NaCl, the present study shows that 0.1 M NaCl facilitates the growth of Geobacter in MFC anode biofilms. This result suggests that the optimum salt concentration in MFC is determined by the balance of two factors, namely, the solution conductivity and salt tolerance of exoelectrogens.",

In recent years there has been an increasing interest in elucidating the biological role of thermophilic fungi and in characterization of their industrially useful enzymes. In the present study we investigated the cellulolytic potential of 16 thermophilic fungi from the three ascomycete orders Sordariales, Eurotiales and Onygenales and from the zygomycete order Mucorales thus covering all fungal orders that include thermophiles. Thermophilic fungi are the only described eukaryotes that can grow at temperatures above 45 ºC. All 16 fungi were able to grow on crystalline cellulose but their secreted enzymes showed widely different cellulolytic activities, pH optima and thermostabilities. Interestingly, in contrast to previous reports, we found that some fungi such as Melanocarpus albomyces readily grew on crystalline cellulose and produced cellulases. These results indicate that there are large differences in the cellulolytic potential of different isolates of the same species. Furthermore, all the selected species were able to degrade cellulose but the differences in cellulolytic potential and thermostability of the secretome did not correlate to the taxonomic position. PCR amplification and sequencing of 22 cellulase genes from the fungi showed that the level of thermostability of the cellulose-degrading activity could not be inferred from the phylogenetic relationship of the cellulases.",

In this work we determined the degradation of n-alkanes in Rhodococcus opacus R7 in presence of n-dodecane (C12), n-hexadecane (C16), n-eicosane (C20), n-tetracosane (C24) and the metabolic pathway in presence of C12. The consumption rate of C12 was 88%, of C16 was 69%, of C20 was 51% and of C24 it was 78%. The decrement of the degradation rate seems to be correlated to the length of the aliphatic chain of these hydrocarbons. On the basis of the metabolic intermediates determined by the R7 growth on C12, our data indicated that R. opacus R7 metabolizes medium-chain n-alkanes by the primary alcohol formation. This represents a difference in comparison with other Rhodococcus strains, in which a mixture of the two alcohols was observed. By GC-MSD analysis we also identified the monocarboxylic acid, confirming the terminal oxidation. Moreover, the alkB gene cluster from R. opacus R7 was isolated and its involvement in the n-alkane degradation system was investigated by the cloning of this genomic region into a shuttle-vector E. coli-Rhodococcus to evaluate the alkane hydroxylase activity. Our results showed an increased biodegradation of C12 in the recombinant strain R. erythropolis AP (pTipQT1-alkR7) in comparison with the wild type strain R. erythropolis AP. These data supported the involvement of the alkB gene cluster in the n-alkane degradation in the R7 strain.",

The fusarium wilt disease incidence of spinach cultivated in the BSD- and CP-treated plots was reduced as compared with that in the untreated control plots, showing effectiveness of both methods to suppress the disease. The clone library analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that members of the Firmicutes became dominant in the soil bacterial community after the BSD-treatment. Clone groups related to the species in the class Clostridia , such as Clostridium saccharobutylicum , Clostridium tetanomorphum , Clostridium cylindrosporum , Oxobacter pfennigii , etc., as well as Bacillus niacini in the class Bacilli were recognized as the most dominant members in the community.

Five lignin degrading organisms were selected (Bjerkandera sp., Phanerochaete (P.) chrysosporium, Physisporinus (P.) rivulosus, Phlebia (P.) radiata and Phlebia sp. Nf b19) and studied for MnP production in small-scale. Extracellular MnP activity was followed and cultivations were harvested at proximity of the peak activity. The production of MnPs varied in different organisms but was clearly regulated by inducing liquid media components (Mn2+, veratryl alcohol and malonate). In total 8 different MnP isoforms were purified. Results of this study reinforce the conception that MnPs from distinct organisms differ substantially in their properties. Production of the extracellular enzyme in general did not reach a substantial level. This further suggests that these native producers are not suitable for industrial scale production of the enzyme. The highest specific activities were observed with MnPs from P. chrysosporium (200 U mg-1), Phlebia sp. Nf b19 (55 U mg-1) and P. rivulosus (89 U mg-1) and these MnPs are considered as the most potential candidates for further studies.

In this report, we show the characterization of an indigenous surfactant-producing crude-oil-eating microbe isolated from petroleum-sludge in Zhoushan islands, China, where one of the national strategic petroleum reservoirs is located. We examined biosurfactant activities using surface tension analysis on mixed culture originated from oil-sludge microbes. In parallel, dynamics of individual microbial populations in cultures were monitored using the terminal fluorescence labeled (TFL)-RFLP method. Biosurfactant activity was found to be associated with a dominant microbial species designated as ZS1 (Zhou-Shan isolate 1). Cell-free supernatant from the ZS1 culture exhibited 100% emulsification index against crude oil and reduces surface tension to 26.5 mN/m. Sequence-based analysis suggested that the ZS1 belongs to the group of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. LC–MS/MS analysis indicated that the rhamnolipids produced by the ZS1 consisted of 7 monorhamnolipid and 11 dirhamnolipid homologues (RL7-11), two of which were novel. Maximum yield of rhamnolipids in shake-flask ZS1 culture could reach 44 g/l. Furthermore, we showed that ZS1 was capable of growing in MS medium supplemented with 1% crude oil as sole carbon source, in which cell mass increase coincided with the formation of crude-oil emulsion. Half of the crude oil was consumed by the ZS1 in 12 days. Taken together, our results show that ZS1 produces high level of rhamnolipids that effectively emulsify crude oil accelerating its uptake and degradation. Hence, it is suitable for bioremediation of petroleum pollutants in Zhoushan coastal areas.",

In the present work, the microbial sludge from a refinery WWTP was enriched for phenol, cloned into fosmid vectors and pyrosequenced. The fosmid libraries yielded 13,200 clones and a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of the sequence data set revealed a complex and diverse bacterial community in the phenol degrading sludge. The phylogenetic analyses using MEGAN in combination with RDP classifier showed a massive predominance of Proteobacteria, represented mostly by the genera Diaphorobacter, Pseudomonas, Thauera and Comamonas. The functional classification of phenol degrading sludge sequence data set generated by MG-RAST showed the wide metabolic diversity of the microbial sludge, with a high percentage of genes involved in the aerobic and anaerobic degradation of phenol and derivatives. In addition, genes related to the metabolism of many other organic and xenobiotic compounds, such as toluene, biphenyl, naphthalene and benzoate, were found. Results gathered herein demonstrated that the phenol degrading sludge has complex phylogenetic and functional diversities, showing the potential of such community to degrade several pollutant compounds.

This was suggested for the reason that the over-expression of PAD1 resulted in increased tolerance toward cinnamic acid, up to 0.6 mM. We show that by over-expression of the PAD1 together with the FDC1 the cinnamic acid decarboxylase activity can be increased significantly. The strain over-expressing PAD1 and FDC1 tolerated cinnamic acid concentrations up to 10 mM. The cooperation of Pad1p and Fdc1p is surprising since the PAD1 has a mitochondrial targeting sequence and the FDC1 codes for a cytosolic protein. The cinnamic acid decarboxylase activity was also seen in the cell free extract. The activity was 0.019 μmol per minute and mg of extracted protein. The overexpression of PAD1 and FDC1 resulted also in increased activity with the hydroxycinnamic acids ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid and caffeinic acid. This activity was not seen when FDC1 was overexpressed alone. An efficient cinnamic acid decarboxylase is valuable for the genetic engineering of yeast strains producing styrene. Styrene can be produced from endogenously produced L-phenylalanine which is converted by a phenylalanine ammonia lyase to cinnamic acid and then by a decarboxylase to styrene.",

    "abstract": "Granulation of activated sludge is an increasingly important area within the field of wastewater treatment. Granulation is usually achieved by high hydraulic selection pressure, which results in the wash-out of slow settling particles. The effect of the harsh wash-out conditions on the granular sludge ecosystem is not yet fully understood, but different bacterial groups may be affected to varying degrees. In this study, we used high-throughput amplicon sequencing to follow the community composition in granular sludge reactors for 12 weeks, both in the granular phase and the suspended phase (effluent). The microbiome of the washed out biomass was similar but not identical to the microbiome of the granular biomass. Certain taxa (e.g. Flavobacterium spp. and Bdellovibrio spp.) had significantly (p < 0.05) higher relative abundance in the granules compared to the effluent. Fluorescence in situ hybridization images indicated that these taxa were mainly located in the interior of granules and therefore protected from erosion. Other taxa (e.g. Meganema sp. and Zooglea sp.) had significantly lower relative abundance in the granules compared to the effluent, and appeared to be mainly located on the surface of granules and therefore subject to erosion. Despite being washed out, these taxa were among the most abundant members of the granular sludge communities and were likely growing fast in the reactors. The ratio between relative abundance in the granular biomass and in the effluent did not predict temporal variation of the taxa in the reactors, but it did appear to predict the spatial location of the taxa in the granules.",

In this study, we report that the biofilm cells of S. mutans and S. aureus can be effectively killed by low-level direct current (DC) and through synergy in concurrent treatment with DC and chlorhexidine (CHX) at low concentrations. For example, after treatment with 28 µA/cm2 DC and 50 µg/mL CHX for 1 h, the viability of biofilm cells was reduced by approximately 4 and 5 logs for S. mutans and S. aureus, respectively. These results are useful for developing more effective approaches to control pathogenic biofilms.",

    "abstract": "The mangroves are among the most productive and biologically important environments. The possible presence of cellulolytic enzymes and microorganisms useful for biomass degradation as well as taxonomic and functional aspects of two Brazilian mangroves were evaluated using cultivation and metagenomic approaches. From a total of 296 microorganisms with visual differences in colony morphology and growth (including bacteria, yeast and filamentous fungus), 179 (60.5%) and 117 (39.5%) were isolated from the Rio de Janeiro (RJ) and Bahia (BA) samples, respectively. RJ metagenome showed the higher number of microbial isolates, which is consistent with its most conserved state and higher diversity. The metagenomic sequencing data showed similar predominant bacterial phyla in the BA and RJ mangroves with an abundance of Proteobacteria (57.8% and 44.6%), Firmicutes (11% and 12.3%) and Actinobacteria (8.4% and 7.5%). A higher number of enzymes involved in the degradation of polycyclic aromatic compounds were found in the BA mangrove. Specific sequences involved in the cellulolytic degradation, belonging to cellulases, hemicellulases, carbohydrate binding domains, dockerins and cohesins were identified, and it was possible to isolate cultivable fungi and bacteria related to biomass decomposition and with potential applications for the production of biofuels. These results showed that the mangroves possess all fundamental molecular tools required for building the cellulosome, which is required for the efficient degradation of cellulose material and sugar release.",

The cysteine-rich antifungal proteins from filamentous ascomycetes provide a feasible base for protection against molds due to their potent antifungal activity on them. In contrast to this, they show no or weak activity on yeasts, hence their applicability against this group of fungi is questionable. In the present study a 5.6 kDa anti-yeast protein (NFAP2) is isolated, identified and characterized from the ferment broth of Neosartorya fischeri NRRL 181. Based on a phylogenetic analysis, NFAP2 and its putative homologs represent a new group of ascomycetous cysteine-rich antifungal proteins. NFAP2 proved to be highly effective against tested yeasts involving clinically relevant Candida species. NFAP2 did not cause metabolic inactivity and apoptosis induction, but its plasma membrane disruption ability was observed on Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The antifungal activity was maintained after high temperature treatment presumably due to the in silico predicted stable tertiary structure. The disulfide bond-stabilized, heat-resistant folded structure of NFAP2 was experimentally proved. After further investigations of antifungal mechanism, structure and toxicity, NFAP2 could be applicable as a potent antifungal agent against yeasts.",

Employing a hybrid statistical media optimization strategy of Plackett–Burman and Box-Behnken experimental designs in shake-flasks gave an increased phytase activity from an initial 66 IU/mL in 216 h to 160 IU/mL in a reduced time of 132 h. Productivity, thus increased by 3.97 times from 7.3 to 29 IU/mL/day. Using the optimized media, the production was successfully scaled-up further and improved up to 164 IU/mL in 96 h by studies carried out employing 2 and 10-L fermenters. The enzyme supernatant was recovered using centrifugal separation of biomass and the stability of the produced phytase was tested for animal feed applications under gastric conditions. In vitro degradation studies of water soluble monocrotophos, methyl parathion and water insoluble chlorpyrifos, pesticides used extensively in agriculture was carried out. It was observed by HPLC analysis that phytase could degrade 72% of chlorpyrifos at pH 7.0, 35 °C. Comparable results were obtained with monocrotophos and methyl parathion. With chlorpyrifos at higher temperature 50 °C as much as 91% degradation could be obtained. The degradation of chlorpyrifos was further validated by spraying phytase on harvested green chilli (Capsicum annuum L) under normal conditions of pH 7.0, 35 °C and the degradation products obtained analyzed by LCMS. Thus, the present study brings out a potentially novel application of phytase for biodegradation of organophosphorus pesticides.",

Clostridium termitidis is able to breakdown cellulose into glucose and produce hydrogen. On the other hand, Clostridium beijerinckii is not able to degrade cellulose but is adept at hydrogen production from glucose; therefore, it was chosen to potentially enhance hydrogen production when co-cultured with C. termitidis on cellulose. In this study, batch fermentation tests were conducted to investigate the direct hydrogen production enhancement of mesophilic cellulolytic bacteria C. termitidis co-cultured with mesophilic hydrogen producer C. beijerinckii on cellulose at 2 g l-1 compared to C. termitidis mono-culture. Microbial kinetics parameters were determined by modeling in MATLAB. The achieved highest hydrogen yield was 1.92 mol hydrogen mol-1 hexose equivalentadded in the co-culture compared to 1.45 mol hydrogen mol-1 hexose equivalentadded in the mono-culture. The maximum hydrogen production rate of 26 ml d-1 was achieved in the co-culture. Co-culture exhibited an overall 32 % enhancement of hydrogen yield based on hexose equivalent added and 15 % more substrate utilization. The main metabolites were acetate, ethanol, lactate, and formate in the mono-culture, with also butyrate in the co-culture. Additionally, the hydrogen yield of C. beijerinckii only in glucose was 2.54 mol hydrogen mol-1 hexose equivalent. This study has proved the viability of co-culture of C. termitidis with C. beijerinckii for hydrogen production directly from a complex substrate like cellulose under mesophilic conditions.",

The objective of this work was to determine the role of nitrite versus nitrate as terminal electron acceptor on the competition between DNRA and denitrification. Initially, a mixed culture chemostat was operated under nitrate limitation and performed DNRA. Stepwise, the influent nitrate was replaced with nitrite until nitrite was the sole electron acceptor and N-source present. Despite changing the electron acceptor from nitrate to nitrite, the dominant process remained DNRA and the same dominant organism closely related to Geobacter lovleyi was identified. Contrary to previous studies conducted with a complex substrate in marine microbial communities, the conclusion of this work is that nitrate versus nitrite as electron acceptor does not generally control the competition between DNRA and denitrification. Our results show that the effect of this ratio must be interpreted in combination with other environmental factors, such as the type and complexity of the electron donor, pH, or sulfide concentrations.",

The activities of antioxidants, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) were activated by 25% HRW treatment, and the expression levels of these genes were also induced.

    "abstract": "Abstract Folate has gained significant attention due to its vital role in biological methylation and epigenetic machinery. Folate, or vitamin (B 9 ), is only produced through a de novo mechanism by plants and micro-organisms in the rumen of mature animals. Although limited research has been conducted on folate in ruminants, it has been noted that ruminal synthesis could not maintain folate levels in high yielding dairy animals. Folate has an essential role in one-carbon metabolism and is a strong antiproliferative agent. Folate increases DNA stability, being crucial for DNA synthesis and repair, the methylation cycle, and preventing oxidation of DNA by free radicals. Folate is also critical for cell division, metabolism of proteins, synthesis of purine and pyrimidine, and increasing the de novo delivery of methyl groups and S -adenosylmethionine. However, in ruminants, metabolism of B 12 and B 9 vitamins are closely connected and utilization of folate by cells is significantly affected by B 12 vitamin concentration. Supplementation of folate through diet, particularly in early lactation, enhanced metabolic efficiency, lactational performance, and nutritional quality of milk. Impaired absorption, oxidative degradation, or deficient supply of folate in ruminants affects DNA stability, cell division, homocysteine remethylation to methionine, de novo synthesis of S -adenosylmethionine, and increases DNA hypomethylation, uracil misincorporation into DNA, chromosomal damage, abnormal cell growth, oxidative species, premature birth, low calf weight, placental tube defects, and decreases production and reproduction of ruminant animals. However, more studies are needed to overcome these problems and reduce enormous dietary supplement waste and impaired absorption of folate in ruminants. This review was aimed to highlight the vital role of folic acid in ruminants performance.",

Here we describe the oxygenation of the unactivated aromatic ring of benzene with hydrogen peroxide as co-substrate. The optimum pH of the reaction was around 7 and it proceeded via an initial epoxide intermediate that re-aromatized in aqueous solution to form phenol. Identity of the epoxide intermediate as benzene oxide was proved by a freshly prepared authentic standard using GC-MS and LC-MS analyses. Second and third [per]oxygenation was also observed and resulted in the formation of further hydroxylation and following [per]oxidation products: hydroquinone and p-benzoquinone, catechol and o-benzoquinone as well as 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene and hydroxy-p-benzoquinone, respectively. Using H2 18O2 as co-substrate and ascorbic acid as radical scavenger, inhibiting the formation of peroxidation products (e.g., p-benzoquinone), the origin of the oxygen atom incorporated into benzene or phenol was proved to be the peroxide. Apparent enzyme kinetic constants (kcat, Km) for the peroxygenation of benzene were estimated to be around 8 s-1 and 3.6 mM. These results raise the possibility that peroxygenases may be useful for enzymatic syntheses of hydroxylated benzene derivatives under mild conditions.",

In the present study, we developed a gene disruption method for A. cellulolyticus, which needs a longer homologous region length. We cloned a putative A. cellulolyticus creA gene that is highly similar to the creA genes derived from other filamentous fungi, and isolated a creA disruptant strain by using the disruption method. Growth of the creA disruptant on agar plates was slower than that of the control strain. In the wild-type strain, the CreA protein was localized in the nucleus, suggesting that the cloned gene encodes the CreA transcription factor. Cellulase and xylanase production by the creA disruptant were higher than that of the control strain at the enzyme and transcription levels. Furthermore, the creA disruptant produced cellulase and xylanase in the presence of glucose. These data suggest both that the CreA protein functions as a catabolite repressor protein, and that disruption of creA is effective for enhancing enzyme production by A. cellulolyticus.",

The PHB-containing biomass was enriched on acetate under non-sterile conditions. Alkaline treatment (0.2 M NaOH) together with surfactant SDS (0.2 w/v% SDS) could reach 99% purity, with more than 90% recovery. The lost PHB could be mostly attributed to PHB hydrolysis during the alkaline treatment. PHB hydrolysis could be moderated by increasing the crystallinity of the PHB granules, for example, by biomass pretreatment (e.g. freezing or lyophilization) or by effective cell lysis (e.g. adjusting alkali concentration). The suitability of the purified PHB by alkaline treatment for polymer applications was evaluated by molecular weight and thermal stability. A solvent based purification method was also performed for comparison purposes. As result, PHB produced by mixed enriched cultures was found suitable for thermoplastic applications when purified by the solvent method. While the alkaline method resulted in purity, recovery yield and molecular weight comparable to values reported in literature for PHB produced by pure cultures, it was found unsuitable for thermoplastic applications. Given the potential low cost and favorable environmental impact of this method, it is expected that PHB purified by alkaline method may be suitable for other non-thermal polymer applications, and as a platform chemical.",

However, their effects on ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) across different soil pH levels are still unclear. In the present work, vegetable soils at four pH levels were tested to determine the impacts of nitrification and urease inhibitors on the nitrification activities, abundances and diversities of ammonia oxidizers at different pHs by real-time PCR, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and clone sequence analysis. The analyses of the abundance of ammonia oxidizers and net nitrification rate suggested that AOA was the dominate ammonia oxidizer and the key driver of nitrification in acidic soil. The relationships between pH and ammonia oxidizer abundance indicated that soil pH dominantly controlled the abundance of AOA but not that of AOB. The T-RFLP results suggested that soil pH could significantly affect the AOA and AOB community structure. Nitrapyrin decreased the net nitrification rate and inhibited the abundance of bacterial amoA genes in this vegetable soil, but exhibited no effect on that of the archaeal amoA genes. In contrast, NBPT just lagged the hydrolysis of urea and kept low NH4 +-N levels in the soil at the early stage. It exhibited no or slight effects on the abundance and community structure of ammonia oxidizers. These results indicated that soil pH, rather than the application of urea, nitrapyrin and NBPT, was a critical factor influencing the abundance and community structure of AOA and AOB.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the use of phototrophs for wastewater treatment has been revisited because of new approaches to separate them from effluent streams. One manifestation uses oxygenic photogranules (OPGs) which are dense, easily-settleable granular biofilms of cyanobacteria, which surrounding populations of heterotrophs, autotrophs, and microalgae. OPGs can remove COD and nitrogenous compounds without external aeration. To better grow and maintain biomass in the proposed wastewater process, this study seeks to understand the factors that contribute to successful granulation. Availability of initial inorganic nitrogen, particularly ammonium, was associated with successful cultivation of OPGs. In the first days of granulation, a decrease in ammonium coupled with an increase in a cyanobacterial-specific 16S rRNA gene, may suggest that ammonium was assimilated in cyanobacteria offering a competitive environment for growth. Though both successful and unsuccessful OPG formation demonstrated a shift from non-phototrophic bacterial dominated communities on day 0 to cyanobacterial dominated communities on day 42, the successful community had a greater relative abundance (46%) of OTUs associated with genera Oscillatoria and Geitlernema than the unsuccessful community (27%), supporting that filamentous cyanobacteria are essential for successful OPG formation. A greater concentration of chlorophyll b in the unsuccessful OPG formation suggested a greater abundance of algal species. This study offers indicators of granulation success, notably availability of inorganic nitrogen and chlorophyll a and b concentrations for monitoring the health and growth of biomass for a potential OPG process.",

    "abstract": "There is an increasing demand for cost-effective and ecologically-friendly methods for valorization of poultry feather waste, in which keratinolytic bacteria present a great potential. Feather-degrading bacteria were isolated from living poultry and a single strain, identified as Kocuria rhizophila p3-3, exhibited significant keratinolytic properties. The bacterial strain effectively degraded up to 52% of chicken feathers during 4 days of culture at 25 °C. Zymographic analysis revealed the presence of two dominating proteolytic enzymes in the culture fluid. Culture conditions were optimized in order to maximize the liberation of soluble proteins and free amino acids. A two-step procedure was used, comprising a Plackett-Burman screening design, followed by a Box-Behnken design. Concentration of feather substrate, MgSO4 and KH2PO4 were the most influential parameters for the accumulation of soluble proteins in culture K. rhizophila p3-3, while feathers and MgSO4 also affected the concentration of amino acids. The resultant raw hydrolysate supernatant, prior to and after additional treatments, was rich in phenylalanine, histidine, arginine and aspartic acid. Additionally the hydrolysate exhibited radical-scavenging activity and ferric reducing power.",

    "abstract": "Genes encoding the key transcription factors (TF) XlnR, ClrA and ClrB were deleted from Aspergillus niger and the resulting strains were assessed for growth on glucose and wheat straw, transcription of genes encoding glycosyl hydrolases and saccharification activity. Growth of all mutant strains, based in straw on measurement of pH and assay of glucosamine, was impaired in relation to the wild-type (WT) strain although deletion of clrA had less effect than deletion of xlnR or clrB. Release of sugars from wheat straw was also lowered when culture filtrates from TF deletion strains were compared with WT culture filtrates. Transcript levels of cbhA, eglC and xynA were measured in all strains in glucose and wheat straw media in batch culture with and without pH control. Transcript levels from cbhA and eglC were lowered in all mutant strains compared to WT although the impact of deleting clrA was not pronounced with expression of eglC and had no effect on xynA. The impact on transcription was not related to changes in pH. In addition to impaired growth on wheat straw, the ΔxlnR strain was sensitive to oxidative stress and displayed cell wall defects in the glucose condition suggesting additional roles for XlnR. The characterisation of TFs, such as ClrB, provides new areas of improvement for industrial processes for production of second generation biofuels.",

There is a need to develop safe, efficient and economical methods to remove them from the environment, often by biodegradation. Atrazine is such herbicide. White-rot fungi have the ability to degrade herbicides of potential utility. This study formulated a novel pelletized support to immobilize the white-rot fungus Anthracophyllum discolor to improve its capability to degrade the atrazine using a biopurification system (BS). Different proportions of sawdust, starch, corn meal and flaxseed were used to generate three pelletized supports (F1, F2 and F3). In addition, immobilization with coated and uncoated pelletized supports (CPS and UPS, respectively) was assessed. UPS-F1 was determined as the most effective system as it provided high level of manganese peroxidase activity and fungal viability. The half-life (t1/2) of atrazine decreased from 14 to 6 days for the control and inoculated samples respectively. Inoculation with immobilized A. discolor produced an increase in the fungal taxa assessed by DGGE and on phenoloxidase activity determined. The treatment improves atrazine degradation and reduces migration to surface and groundwater.",

In this study, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens N2-4 and N3-8 were isolated from soil and their metabolites could kill Burkholderia pseudomallei, a Gram-negative pathogenic bacterium also found in soil in its endemic areas. Moreover, the metabolites were able to kill drug resistant isolates of B. pseudomallei and also inhibit other pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii but not the non-pathogenic Burkholderia thailandensis, which is closely related to B. pseudomallei. Since the antimicrobial activity of N3-8 was not partially decreased or abolished when treated with proteolytic enzymes or autoclaved, but N2-4 was, these two strains should have produced different compounds. The N3-8 metabolites with antimicrobial activity consisted of both protein and non-protein compounds. The inhibition spectrum of the precipitated proteins compared to the culture supernatant indicated a possible synergistic effect of the non-protein and peptide compounds of N3-8 isolates against other pathogens. When either N2-4 or N3-8 isolates was co-cultured with B. pseudomallei the numbers of the bacteria decreased by 5 log10 within 72 h. Further purification and characterization of the metabolites is required for future use of the bacteria or their metabolites as biological controls of B. pseudomallei in the environment or for development as new drugs for problematic pathogenic bacteria.",

Our results indicated that the community richness of the midgut is higher than in the foregut or the hindgut, although the bacterial diversity in the hindgut is higher. The predominant phyla were Tenericutes and Firmicutes in the foregut, Tenericutes and Proteobacteria in the midgut and Proteobacteria, Tenericutes and Bacteroidetes in the hindgut. When compared with the midgut, the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) were significantly elevated in the hindgut (P < 0.05), and the gene expression of EsRelish (IMD pathway) was higher than the Toll signaling pathway genes. Actinobacteria and Lactobacillus had negative correlationship with the expression of AMPs, although Acinetobacter, Bacteroides, Flavobacterium can up-regulate the expression of AMP genes. Collectively, our data indicate that microbiota are site-specific within the digestive tracts of crabs and the bacterial community and intestinal immunity have a close relationship in E. sinensis.",

    "abstract": "The blowout of the Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 occurred at a depth of 1500 m, corresponding to a hydrostatic pressure of 15 MPa. Up to now, knowledge about the impact of high pressure on oil-degrading bacteria has been scarce. To investigate how the biodegradation of crude oil and its components is influenced by high pressures, like those in deep-sea environments, hydrocarbon degradation and growth of two model strains were studied in high-pressure reactors. The alkane-degrading strain Rhodococcus qingshengii TUHH-12 grew well on n-hexadecane at 15 MPa at a rate of 0.16 h(-1), although slightly slower than at ambient pressure (0.36 h(-1)). In contrast, the growth of the aromatic hydrocarbon degrading strain Sphingobium yanoikuyae B1 was highly affected by elevated pressures. Pressures of up to 8.8 MPa had little effect on growth of this strain. However, above this pressure growth decreased and at 12 MPa or more no more growth was observed. Nevertheless, S. yanoikuyae continued to convert naphthalene at pressure >12 MPa, although at a lower rate than at 0.1 MPa. This suggests that certain metabolic functions of this bacterium were inhibited by pressure to a greater extent than the enzymes responsible for naphthalene degradation. These results show that high pressure has a strong influence on the biodegradation of crude oil components and that, contrary to previous assumptions, the role of pressure cannot be discounted when estimating the biodegradation and ultimate fate of deep-sea oil releases such as the Deepwater Horizon event.",

    "abstract": "Deep RNA-Seq profiling, a revolutionary method used for quantifying transcriptional levels, often includes non-specific transcripts from other co-existing organisms in spite of stringent protocols. Using the recently published walnut genome sequence as a filter, we present a broad analysis of the RNA-Seq derived transcriptome profiles obtained from twenty different tissues to extract the biodiversity and possible plant–microbe interactions in the walnut ecosystem in California. Since the residual nature of the transcripts being analyzed does not provide sufficient information to identify the exact strain, inferences made are constrained to the genus level. The presence of the pathogenic oomycete Phytophthora was detected in the root through the presence of a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Cryptococcus, the causal agent of cryptococcosis, was found in the catkins and vegetative buds, corroborating previous work indicating that the plant surface supported the sexual cycle of this human pathogen. The RNA-Seq profile revealed several species of the endophytic nitrogen fixing Actinobacteria. Another bacterial species implicated in aerobic biodegradation of methyl tert-butyl ether (Methylibium petroleiphilum) is also found in the root. RNA encoding proteins from the pea aphid were found in the leaves and vegetative buds, while a serine protease from mosquito with significant homology to a female reproductive tract protease from Drosophila mojavensis in the vegetative bud suggests egg-laying activities. The comprehensive analysis of RNA-seq data present also unraveled detailed, tissue-specific information of ~400 transcripts encoded by the largest family of resistance (R) genes (NBS-LRR), which possibly rationalizes the resistance of the specific walnut plant to the pathogens detected. Thus, we elucidate the biodiversity and possible plant–microbe interactions in several walnut (Juglans regia) tissues in California using deep RNA-Seq profiling.",

    "abstract": "Classical field retting and controlled fungal retting of hemp using Phlebia radiata Cel 26 (a mutant with low cellulose degrading ability) were compared with pure pectinase treatment with regard to mechanical properties of the produced fibre/epoxy composites. For field retting a classification of the microbial evolution (by gene sequencing) and enzyme profiles were conducted. By phylogenetic frequency mapping, different types of fungi, many belonging to the Ascomycota phylum were found on the fibres during the first 2 weeks of field retting, and thereafter, different types of bacteria, notably Proteobacteria, also proliferated on the field retted fibres. Extracts from field retted fibres exhibited high glucanase activities, while extracts from P. radiata Cel 26 retted fibres showed high polygalacturonase and laccase activities. As a result, fungal retting gave a significantly higher glucan content in the fibres than field retting (77 vs. 67%) and caused a higher removal of pectin as indicated by lower galacturonan content of fibres (1.6%) after fibres were retted for 20 days with P. radiata Cel 26 compared to a galacturonan content of 3.6% for field retted fibres. Effective fibre stiffness increased slightly after retting with P. radiata Cel 26 from 65 to 67 GPa, while it decreased after field retting to 52 GPa. Effective fibre strength could not be determined similarly due to variations in fibre fracture strain and fibre-matrix adhesion. A maximum composite strength with 50 vol% fibres of 307 MPa was obtained using P. radiata Cel 26 compared to 248 MPa with field retting.",

    "abstract": "For acceleration of removing toxic metals from acid mine drainage (AMD), the effects of hydraulic retention time (HRT) and pH on the reactor performance and microbial community structure in the depth direction of a laboratory-scale packed-bed bioreactor containing rice bran as waste organic material were investigated. The HRT was shortened stepwise from 25 to 12 h, 8 h, and 6 to 5 h under the neutral condition using AMD neutralized with limestone (pH 6.3), and from 25 to 20 h, 12 h, and 8 to 7 h under the acid condition using AMD (pH 3.0). Under the neutral condition, the bioreactor stably operated up to 6 h HRT, which was shorter than under the acid condition (up to 20 h HRT). During stable sulfate reduction, both the organic matter-remaining condition and the low oxidation-reduction potential condition in lower parts of the reactor were observed. Principal coordinate analysis of Illumina sequencing data of 16S rRNA genes revealed a dynamic transition of the microbial communities at the boundary between stable and unstable operation in response to reductions in HRT. During stable operation under both the neutral and acid conditions, several fermentative operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes dominated in lower parts of the bioreactor, suggesting that co-existence of these OTUs might lead to metabolic activation of sulfate-reducing bacteria. In contrast, during unstable operation at shorter HRTs, an OTU from the candidate phylum OP11 were found under both conditions. This study demonstrated that these microorganisms can be used to monitor the treatment of AMD, which suggests stable or deteriorated performance of the system.",

In our study, the microbial community structure and diversity were examined by Illumina MiSeq sequencing. A significant differences was observed in α diversity and community structure among three disease severity groups. The phyllosphere microbiota was observed to be dominated by bacterial populations from Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes, as well as fungal species from Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. In addition, some plant-specific microbe such as Sphingomonas, Methylobacterium, Pseudomonas, and Alternaria showed significant changes in their relative abundance of population. The LCR was correlated negatively with Sphingomonas, Methylobacterium, Quadrisphaera, and Lactobacillus, whereas correlated positively with Pseudomonas and Kineococcus (p < 0.05). The LCR was negatively correlated with Alternaria and Arthrinium of the fungal communities (p < 0.05). Molecular ecological networks of the microbial communities were constructed to show the interactions among the OTUs. Our current results indicated that the competitive relationships among species were broken with the development of angular leaf-spot of cucumber. The microbial community composition changed over the development of angular leaf-spot of cucumber. The result of molecular ecological networks indicated that the overall bacterial community tends toward mutualism from the competition.

Majority of these communal microorganisms are difficult to grow in vitro. DNA fingerprinting methods such as polymerase chain reaction-denaturation gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) facilitate the microbial profiling of complex ecosystems including infected chronic wounds. Six different DNA extraction methods were compared for profiling of the microbial community associated with chronic wound infections using PCR-DGGE. Tissue debris obtained from chronic wound ulcers of ten patients were used for DNA extraction. Total nucleic acid was extracted from each specimen using six DNA extraction methods. The yield, purity and quality of DNA was measured and used for PCR amplification targeting V2–V3 region of eubacterial 16S rRNA gene. QIAGEN DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (K method) produced good quality genomic DNA compared to the other five DNA extraction methods and gave a broad diversity of bacterial communities in chronic wounds. Among the five conventional methods, bead beater/phenol–chloroform based DNA extraction method with STES buffer (BP1 method) gave a yield of DNA with a high purity and resulted in a higher DGGE band diversity. Although DNA extraction using heat and NaOH had the lowest purity, DGGE revealed a higher bacterial diversity. The findings suggest that the quality and the yield of genomic DNA are influenced by the DNA extraction protocol, thus a method should be carefully selected in profiling a complex microbial community.",

Surfactin is a potential alternative to antibiotics and antibacterial agents. However, the antibacterial activity of Bacillus species-derived surfactin on Brachyspira hyodysenteriae and Clostridium perfringens are still poorly understood. In the current study, the antibacterial effects of surfactin produced from Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus licheniformis on B. hyodysenteriae and C. perfringens were evaluated. Results showed that multiple surfactin isoforms were detected in B. subtilis, while only one surfactin isoform was detected in B. licheniformis fermented products. The surfactin produced from B. subtilis exhibited significant antibacterial activity against B. hyodysenteriae compared with surfactin produced from B. licheniformis. B. subtilis-derived surfactin could inhibit bacterial growth and disrupt the morphology of B. hyodysenteriae. Furthermore, the surfactin produced from B. subtilis have the highest activity against C. perfringens growth. In contrast, B. licheniformis fermented product-derived surfactin had a strong bacterial killing activity against C. perfringens compared with surfactin produced from B. subtilis. These results together suggest that Bacillus species-derived surfactin have potential for development as feed additives and use as a possible substitute for antibiotics to prevent B. hyodysenteriae and C. perfringens-associated disease in the animal industry.",

    "abstract": "Phosphoketolases catalyze an energy-and redox-independent cleavage of certain sugar phosphates. Hereby, the two-carbon (C2) compound acetyl-phosphate is formed, which enzymatically can be converted into acetyl-CoA-a key precursor in central carbon metabolism. Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not demonstrate efficient phosphoketolase activity naturally. In this study, we aimed to compare and identify efficient heterologous phosphoketolase enzyme candidates that in yeast have the potential to reduce carbon loss compared to the native acetyl-CoA producing pathway by redirecting carbon flux directly from C5 and C6 sugars towards C2-synthesis. Nine phosphoketolase candidates were expressed in S. cerevisiae of which seven produced significant amounts of acetyl-phosphate after provision of sugar phosphate substrates in vitro. The candidates showed differing substrate specificities, and some demonstrated activity levels significantly exceeding those of candidates previously expressed in yeast. The conducted studies also revealed that S. cerevisiae contains endogenous enzymes capable of breaking down acetyl-phosphate, likely into acetate, and that removal of the phosphatases Gpp1 and Gpp2 could largely prevent this breakdown. An evaluation of in vivo function of a subset of phosphoketolases was conducted by monitoring acetate levels during growth, confirming that candidates showing high activity in vitro indeed showed increased acetate accumulation, but expression also decreased cellular fitness. The study shows that expression of several bacterial phosphoketolase candidates in S. cerevisiae can efficiently divert intracellular carbon flux toward C2-synthesis, thus showing potential to be used in metabolic engineering strategies aimed to increase yields of acetyl-CoA derived compounds.",

The potential use of this leftover as a substrate ingredient for Flammulina velutipes (F. velutipe) cultivation was evaluated. The degradation and utilization of ramie stalk by F. velutipes was evaluated through mushroom production, lignocelluloses degradation and lignocellulolytic enzymes activity. The best substrate mixture for F. velutipes cultivation comprised 50% ramie stalk, 20% cottonseed hulls, 25% wheat bran, 4% cornstarch and 2% CaCO3. The highest biological efficiency of fruiting bodies was reached 119.7%. F. velutipes appears to degrade 12.7-32.0% lignin, 14.4-30.2% cellulose and 9.3-25.7% hemicellulose during cultivation on the different substrates. The results of enzymes activities showed that laccase and peroxidase were higher before fruiting; while cellulase and hemicellulase showed higher activities after fruiting. The biological efficiency of fruiting bodies was positively correlated with the activities of cellulase, hemicellulase and ligninolytic enzyme. The results of this study demonstrate that ramie stalk can be used as an effective supplement for increasing mushroom yield in F. velutipes.",

    "abstract": "The study was carried out to investigate the effect of dietary selenium (Se) and vitamin E (VE) supplementation on mRNA level of heat shock proteins, selenoproteins, and antioxidant enzyme activities in the breast meat of broilers under summer heat stress conditions. A total of 200 male broilers (Ross 308) of 1 day age were randomly separated into 4 groups in a complete randomized design and were given a basal diet (Control, 0.08 mg Se/kg diet) or basal diet supplemented with VE (250 mg/kg VE), sodium selenite (0.2 mg/kg Se), or Se + VE (0.2 mg/kg Se + 250 mg/kg VE) to investigate the expression of key antioxidant and heat shock protein (HSP) genes under high temperature stress. Dietary Se, VE and Se + VE significantly enhanced the activities and mRNA levels of catalase as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD) but decreased the mRNA levels of HSP70 and HSP90. Se alone or combined with VE increased the concentration of selenoprotein P and selenoproteins mRNA level and decreased the expression of HSP60. In addition, Se and Se + VE significantly enhanced the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity and the expression of GPx1 and GPx4 in breast muscle tissues. It is noteworthy that all the treatments significantly decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) level in the breast meat. Overall results showed that Se in combination with VE has maximal effects to mitigate heat stress. Based on given results it can be recommended that Se + VE are a suitable dietary supplement for broilers to ameliorate the negative effects of summer heat stress conditions.",

    "abstract": "Biosurfactants offer environmental as well as health benefits over traditionally used chemical surfactants and heterologous production from engineered microorganisms has been demonstrated, offering containable as well as scalable production of these alternative chemicals. Low product titers and cost intensive downstream processing are the main hurdles for economical biosurfactant production at industrial scales. Increased biosurfactant concentrations are found in the liquid fraction of the foam formed during fermentation of producing microbes. Adsorption of biosurfactants from foam fractions in cultivations may offer a simple concentration and purification method which could enable their cost-effective production. Here, foam adsorption was applied as an in situ method for separation of the rhamnolipid biosurfactants during fermentation of Pseudomonas putida EM383. An integrated process was designed to capture the produced rhamnolipids on hydrophobic adsorbent in packed bed units while minimizing the impact of adsorption on the productivity of the system by recirculating cell-containing collapsed foam flow-through back into the reactor vessel. A stable rhamnolipid production by P. putida EM383 on glucose was performed coupled to this adsorption strategy for 82 h, after which no remaining rhamnolipids were found in the cultivation broth and 15.5 g of rhamnolipids could be eluted from the adsorbent. Rhamnolipid yield from glucose feed was 0.05 g g−1, when up to 2 g L−1 glucose pulse feeding was applied. After solvent evaporation, a product purity of 96% was obtained. The results indicate that the integrated adsorption method can be efficient for simultaneous production and recovery of rhamnolipid biosurfactants from microbial fermentations.",

The zeta potential is reported as - 5.21 mV. FTIR indicated Bi-O and V-O vibrations at 640 cm-1 and 700 cm-1/1120 cm-1. Characteristic Raman modes were observed at 166 cm-1, 325 cm-1 and 787 cm-1. High resolution scanning and transmission electron micrographs revealed a rod like morphology of the BiVO4. Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumonia, Fusarium solani indicated highest susceptibility to the different doses of BiVO4 nanorods. Significant protein kinase inhibition is reported for BiVO4 nanorods which suggests their potential anticancer properties. The nanorods revealed good DPPH free radical scavenging potential (48%) at 400 µg/mL while total antioxidant capacity of 59.8 µg AAE/mg was revealed at 400 µg/mL. No antiviral activity is reported on sabin like polio virus. Overall excellent biological properties are reported. We have shown that green synthesis can replace well established processes for synthesizing BiVO4 nanorods.",

    "abstract": "Surfactin is one of the most popular biosurfactants due to its numerous potential applications. The usually aerobic production via fermentation of Bacillus subtilis is accompanied by vigorous foaming which leads to complex constructions and great expense. Therefore it is reasonable to search for alternative foam-free production processes. The current study introduces a novel approach to produce Surfactin in a foam-free process applying a strictly anaerobic bioreactor cultivation. The process was performed several times with different glucose concentrations in mineral salt medium. The fermentations were analyzed regarding specific (qSurfactin, vol. qSurfactin) and overall product yields (YP/X, YP/S) as well as substrate utilization (YX/S). Fermentations in which 2.5 g/L glucose were employed proofed to be the most effective, reaching product yields of YP/X = 0.278 g/g. Most interesting, the product yields exceeded classical aerobic fermentations, in which foam fractionation was applied. Additionally, values for specific production rate qSurfactin (0.005 g/(g∙h)) and product yield per consumed substrate (YP/S = 0.033 g/g) surpass results of comparable foam-free processes. The current study introduces an alternative to produce a biosurfactant that overcomes the challenges of severe foaming and need for additional constructions.",

    "abstract": "Gene therapy and viral vaccine are becoming attractive therapeutic options for the treatment of different malignant diseases. Viral vector productions are often using static culture vessels and small volume stainless steel bioreactors (SSB). However, the yield of each vessel can be relatively low and multiple vessels often need to be operated simultaneously. This significantly increases labor intensity, production costs, contamination risks, and limits its ability to be scaled up, thus, creating challenges to meet the quantities required once the gene therapy or viral vaccine medicine goes into clinical phases or to market. Single-use bioreactor combining with microcarrier provides a good option for viral vector and vaccine production. The goal of the present studies was to develop the microcarrier bead-to-bead expansion and transfer process for HEK293T cells and Vero cells and scale-up the cultures to 50-200 l single-use bioreactors. Following microcarrier bead-to-bead transfer, the peak cell concentration of HEK293T cells reached 1.5 × 106 cells/ml in XDR-50 bioreactor, whereas Vero cells reached 3.1 × 106 cells/ml and 3.3 × 106 cells/ml in XDR-50 bioreactor and XDR-200 bioreactor, respectively. The average growth rates reached 0.61-0.68/day. The successful microcarrier-based scaleup of these two cell lines in single-use bioreactors demonstrates potential large-scale production capabilities of viral vaccine and vector for current and future vaccines and gene therapy.",

In DPMM, dominant bacteria were Comamonas (44.6%), Rhodopseudomonas (19.5%) and Pseudomonas (17.2%). The bacterial community of DPME mainly consisted of bacteria related to Rhodopseudomonas (72.2%). Hydrogen oxidizing bacteria were identified in both purple-colored samples: Hydrogenophaga and Sphaerochaeta in the DPMM, and Arcobacter , unclassified Ignavibacteriaceae , Acinetobacter, Desulfovibrio and Wolinella in the DPME. The methanogenic community of both purple-colored samples was dominated by hydrogenotrophic methanogens including Methanobacterium, Methanobrevibacter and Methanocorpusculum with significantly lower numbers of Methanosarcina . These results suggeste that hydrogen is actively produced by Rhodopseudomonas that leads to the dominance of hydrogen consuming microorganisms in both purple-colored samples. The syntrophic relationship between Rhodopseudomonas and hydrogenotrophic microbes might be important for producing high power density in the acetate-fed MFC under light conditions.",

Therefore, PAHs degradation by halotolerant/halophilic bacteria has received increasing attention. In this study, the metabolic pathway of phenanthrene degradation by halophilic consortium CY-1 was first studied which showed a single upstream pathway initiated by dioxygenation at the C1 and C2 positions, and at several downstream pathways, including the catechol pathway, gentisic acid pathway and protocatechuic acid pathway. The effects of salinity on the community structure and expression of catabolic genes were further studied by a combination of high-throughput sequencing, catabolic gene clone library and real-time PCR. Pure cultures were also isolated from consortium CY-1 to investigate the contribution made by different microbes in the PAH-degrading process. Marinobacter is the dominant genus that contributed to the upstream degradation of phenanthrene especially in high salt content. Genus Halomonas made a great contribution in transforming intermediates in the subsequent degradation of catechol by using catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (C12O). Other microbes were predicted to be mediating bacteria that were able to utilize intermediates via different downstream pathways. Salinity was investigated to have negative effects on both microbial diversity and activity of consortium CY-1 and consortium CY-1 was found with a high degree of functional redundancy in saline environments.",

Silver nanoparticles are known for antibacterial properties. In this study, AgNPs were synthesized using the callus extract of F. indica as a reducing agent. Characterization through different techniques suggests that the AgNPs absorbed light and gave SPR peaks at 414 nm while in case of ciprofloxacin supplemented callus mediated AgNPs the peak were recorded at 419 nm. Furthermore, FTIR analysis revealed the role of amides, acyl group, nitro group of callus extract of F. indica, and some functional groups of the ciprofloxacin in the reduction process as well as the capping and stabilization of AgNPs. Similarly, X-Ray Diffraction analysis indicate the structure of AgNPs as face-centered cubic crystalline particles. The antibacterial activity of AgNPs and ciprofloxacin and callus extract as control against resistant bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Citrobacter amalonaticus, Shigella sonnei, and Salmonella typhi was studied. The combination of AgNPs and antibiotic showed better antibacterial activity as compared to AgNPs alone and ciprofloxacin alone. Maximum inhibition zone of E. coli, C. amalonaticus, S. sonnei, and S. typhi in response to AgNPs and ciprofloxacin was 38.5 mm, 35.5 mm, 33 mm, and 35.5 mm, respectively.

    "abstract": "An earlier electrochemical mechanism of DNA detection was adapted and specified for the detection of Vibrio parahaemolyticus in real samples. The reader, based on a screen printed carbon electrode, was modified with polylactide-stabilized gold nanoparticles and methylene blue was employed as the redox indicator. Detection was assessed using a microprocessor to measure current response under controlled potential. The fabricated sensor was able to specifically distinguish complementary, non-complementary and mismatched oligonucleotides. DNA was measured in the range of 2.0 × 10-8-2.0 × 10-13 M with a detection limit of 2.16 pM. The relative standard deviation for 6 replications of differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) measurement of 0.2 µM complementary DNA was 4.33%. Additionally, cross-reactivity studies against various other food-borne pathogens showed a reliably sensitive detection of the target pathogen. Successful identification of Vibrio parahaemolyticus (spiked and unspiked) in fresh cockles, combined with its simplicity and portability demonstrate the potential of the device as a practical screening tool.",

The therapeutic effect of Inonotus obliquus polysaccharide (IOP) on chronic pancreatitis (CP) in mice has been validated in our previous study. However, it is not clear whether IOP is conducive to maintaining the homeostasis between gut microbiota and host. The aim of this study is to testify the potential effects of IOP on gut microbiota composition and diversity in mice with CP. The changes in glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), total antioxidant capacity (TAOC), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), lipase and trypsin levels were measured by commercial assay kits, meanwhile the gut microbiota composition and diversity were analyzed by high throughput sequencing. The IOP treatment increased GSH-PX and TAOC levels, and decreased TNF-α, TGF-β, lipase and trypsin levels in CP mice. It was also observed that gut microbiota in IOP treated groups were less diverse than others in terms of lower Shannon diversity index and Chao 1 estimator. IOP increased the proportion of Bacteroidetes and decreased that of Firmicutes at phylum level. Bacteroidetes was found positively correlated with GSH-PX and TAOC, and Firmicutes correlated with TNF-α, TGF-β, and lipase. In conclusion, administration of IOP could regulate gut microbiota composition and diversity to a healthy profile in mice with CP, and some bacterial phylum significantly correlated with characteristic parameters.",

The bacterial communities in the house fly larvae were dominated by the phyla Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Enterobacteriaceae and Providencia were the predominant bacteria at the family and genus levels, respectively. Some bacteria in the phyla Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes may be transferred from the gut of house flies to the wheat bran during feeding and may be involved in degrading and utilizing polysaccharides in the cell wall of wheat bran. The significance of the gut microbiota of house fly larvae, their transferring and roles in degradation of wheat bran is discussed. These findings regarding the gut microbiota of house fly larvae will provide opportunities for research on the impact of microbial communities on poultry and fish.",

The results showed that the changes of the growth conditions promoted changes in the zeta potential, hydrophobicity, electron donor/acceptor character of the studied cell populations. Biofilm-detached cells showed a greater adhesion to stainless steel and polycarbonate compared with planktonic cells. Compared with planktonic cells, sessile ones showed higher cytotoxic effect against HeLa cells, DNase activity, and siderophore levels. The higher cytotoxic effect and production of DNase and siderophore increased with the increase of temperature and duration of incubations.

Thus, demulsification is necessary to separate this residual oil from the aqueous phase for oil processing and water treatment/disposal. Most used chemical demulsifiers, although effective, are environmental contaminants and do not meet the desired levels of biodegradation. We investigated the application of microbial biosurfactants as potential natural demulsifiers of petroleum derivatives in water emulsions. Biosurfactants crude extracts, produced by yeasts (Candida guilliermondii, Candida lipolytica and Candida sphaerica) and bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia and Bacillus sp.) grown in industrial residues, were tested for demulsification capacity in their crude and pure forms. The best results obtained were for bacterial biosurfactants, which were able to recover about 65% of the seawater emulsified with motor oil compared to 35–40% only for yeasts products. Biosurfactants were also tested with oil-in-water (O/W) and water-in-oil (W/O) kerosene model emulsions. No relationship between interfacial tension, cell hydrophobicity and demulsification ratios was observed with all the biosurfactants tested. Microscopic illustrations of the emulsions in the presence of the biosurfactants showed the aspects of the emulsion and demulsification process. The results obtained demonstrate the potential of these agents as demulsifiers in marine environments.",

    "abstract": "Irpex lacteus F17 is well-known for its ability to degrade recalcitrant aromatic pollutants, which mainly results from the action of the manganese peroxidase (MnP) that it is able to produce. Recently, the genome sequencing and annotation of this strain provided comprehensive picture of the ligninolytic peroxidase gene family. In addition to revealing the presence of 13 MnPs, genes for five dye-decolorizing peroxidases (DyPs) were also discovered in the I. lacteus F17 genome, which are unrelated to the fungal class II peroxidases. In the present study, amino acid sequences of five DyPs and 13 MnPs, representing two different families of heme peroxidases, were analyzed. Of these, two enzymes, a DyP (Il-DyP4) and a MnP (Il-MnP6) were expressed respectively in Escherichia coli, and were characterized by comparing their molecular models, substrate specificities, and catalytic features. The results showed that Il-DyP4 possessed a higher catalytic efficiency for some representative substrates, and a stronger decolorizing ability to a wide range of synthetic dyes in acidic conditions. Based on electrochemical measurements, Il-DyP4 was found to have a high redox potential of 27 mV at pH 3.5, which was superior to that of Il-MnP6 (− 75 mV), thereby contributing to its ability to oxidize high redox potential substrates, such as veratryl alcohol and polymeric dye Poly R-478. The results highlighted the potential of Il-DyP4 for use in industrial and environmental applications.",

    "abstract": "Stress, including both psychological and physical stimulation, can cause changes in the microbiota and mucosal function of the gastrointestinal system. There are few research studies available about the faecal microbiota changes after stress, such as water immersion restraint stress (WIRS). Therefore, in this study, we focused on analysing the composition changes of faecal microbiota in WIRS mice. The WIRS model, in which Blab/c mice were immersed in 21 ± 2 °C water for 4 h each day for 14 days, was established. Behavioural changes, the serum levels of corticosterone, IFN-γ and IL-17 and gastric mucosal injury were also assessed. Ten faecal microbiota samples were detected by Illumina Miseq sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes from 367205 characterised sequences. Finally, we find significant differences in the faecal microbiota composition between the control and the WIRS groups. There was an obvious increase in Lachnospiraceae in the WIRS mice (p = 0.0286, p < 0.05), which is associated with human diseases, such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's and celiac disease. Our research indicates that stress changes in the faecal microbiota. These results suggest that observing shifts of the intestinal microbiota is a promising method to explore the mechanism of the stress associated with gastrointestinal diseases and to provide us with a better understanding of the relationship between the microbiota and disease.",

The aim of this study was to identify the Lactobacillus spp. isolated from Iranian raw milk Motal cheese and to detect the presence of bacteriocin genes in the isolated Lactobacillus strains exhibiting antimicrobial activity. For this purpose, 6 Motal cheese samples from Dasht-e-Moghan region, Iran, were subjected to microbial characterization. Nineteen Lactobacillus spp. were isolated and subsequently identified based on biochemical and molecular methods. According to the sequencing of isolates, Lactobacillus spp. consisted primarily of Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus buchneri. The identified isolates were then evaluated for antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Listeria innocua ATCC 33090 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. The results of PCR analysis using specific primers of genes encoding Bacteriocin, revealed the presence of Plantaricin A and Plantaricin EF in all Lactobacillus plantarum isolates and Brevicin 174A in 5 of Lactobacillus brevis isolates, whereas the gene encoding Pediocin PA-1 was not observed in any of examined isolates. It is therefore concluded that bacteriocinogenic isolates could be recommended as suitable candidates to be used as starter, adjunct-starter or antimicrobial agents for production of fermented and non-fermented products.",

However, little information regarding the interplay between HMs and the gut microbiota is available.

The fecal contents of 14-week-old hens were collected for DNA extraction, and then the V3 and V4 hyper-variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene were amplified and analyzed using high-throughput sequencing technology. A distinctive difference in microbial diversity was observed between the two groups. The microbial composition of hens fed a diet supplemented with Astragalus was greater than that of the control group. At the genus level, Lactobacillus was more abundant in group A than group B (p < 0.05). Importantly, this study is the first to report the observation of a novel Romboutsia sp. in the feces of hens. However, Romboutsia was less abundant in group A than group B (17.94 vs. 33.98%, respectively, p < 0.05). The microbial community differed significantly between the two groups at the genus level, suggesting that Astragalus modulates the composition of the fecal microbiota. Based on these differences, these findings provide fresh insights into the application of Astragalus in the poultry industry, as well as a better understanding of the interplay between HMs and the gut microbiota.",

A total of 225 calves; 55 apparently healthy and 170 diseased; were sampled. Bacteriological examination, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and PCR based detection of some virulence genes were performed. In addition, the serotyping of E. coli was performed using the slide agglutination test. The most predominant bacterial pathogens retrieved from apparently healthy calves were E. coli (16.4%) and S. aureus (10.9%), and in pneumonic calves were E. coli (23.5%), P. vulgaris (12.4%) and S. aureus (11.8%). The most prevalent virulence gene in E. coli was the fim H gene (100%), followed by eae A gene (24.5%) and hly gene (20.4%). All the examined S. aureus strains harbored spa and coa genes; likewise, all P. multocida strains harbored tox A gene. The majority of the isolated strains displayed remarkable sensitivity to norfloxacin and enrofloxacin; furthermore, the retrieved E. coli strains exhibited multidrug-resistance to gentamicin, erythromycin, streptomycin and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, in addition, the isolated S. aureus and P. aeruginosa strains showed multidrug-resistance to amoxicillin, ampicillin and tetracycline. E. coli serogroups including O18, O143, O1, and O6 were retrieved from pneumonic calves as the first report in Egypt. In conclusion, the synergism between the conventional and genotypic analysis is an effective gadget for the characterization of bacterial pathogens causing BRD. Continuous surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility is essential to select the drug of choice due to the development of multidrug-resistant strains.",

In the present work, floridoside accumulation by the red microalgae Galdieria sulphuraria under different conditions was investigated in order to optimize the production of this glycoside in this microalgae. G. sulphuraria shows consider advantages over other red algae as potential industrial producer of floridoside due to its unicellular nature, its ability to grow heterotrophically in complete darkness and its acidophilic lifestyle. The main compatible solute accumulated by G. sulphuraria under salt stress was purified, identified as floridoside by (1)H-NMR and used as standard for quantification. Our results showed that applying the osmotic stress after the cells had grown first in medium with no salt resulted in higher floridoside yields compared to those obtained in cells growing under osmotic stress from the beginning. Among several parameters tested, the use of glycerol as carbon source for cell growth showed the most significant impact on floridoside accumulation, which reached a maximum of 56.8 mg/g dry biomass.",

Under the optimized condition, strain WZN-1 could degrade 55.15% of 65 μg/L BDE 209 under aerobic condition within 30 day incubation. Moreover, BDE 209 degradation kinetics was fitted to a first-order kinetics model. The biodegradation mechanism of BDE 209 by strain WZN-1 were supposed to be three possible metabolic pathways: debromination, hydroxylation, and ring opening processes. Four BDE 209 degradation genes, including one hydrolase, one dioxygenase and two dehalogenases, were identified based on the complete genome sequencing of strain WZN-1. The real-time qPCR demonstrated that the expression level of four identified genes were significantly induced by BDE 209, and they played an important role in the degradation process. This study is the first to demonstrate that the newly isolated Stenotrophomonas strain has an efficient BDE 209 degradation ability and would provide new insights for the microbial degradation of PBDEs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Wolves ( Canis lupus ) and their domesticated and close relatives, dogs ( Canis lupus familiaris ), have great differences in their diets and living environments. To the best of our knowledge, the fundamental question of how the abundance and function of the gut microbiota of domestic dogs evolved to adapt to the changes in host feeding habits has yet to be addressed. In this study, our comparative analyses of gut metagenomes showed that the abundance of gut microbiota between the two species have some significant differences. Furthermore, a number of taxa observed in higher numbers in domestic dogs are related to carbohydrate metabolism, which may be because that there were more complicated polysaccharides in dogs diets than that in wolves diets. A significant difference in the abundance of genes encoding glycosyltransferase family 34 (GT34), carbohydrate-binding module family 25 (CBM25), and glycoside hydrolase family 13 (GH13) between the gut microbiota metagenomes of domestic dogs and gray wolves also supported this observation. Furthermore, the domestic dog gut microbiota has greater valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis and nitrogen metabolism. This result showed that compared with wolves, the domestic dog diet contains a smaller amount of animal protein, which is consistent with the dietary composition of wolves and dogs. Our results indicate that the function and abundance of gut microbiota of domestic dogs has been adapted to domestication, which is of great significance for the ability of domestic dogs to adapt to changes in food composition.",

The comparative genomic and phylogenetic analysis revealed that L. brevis CD0817 was not very conserved with low GABA-producing L. brevis strains. A significant divergence was that CD0817 harbors only the gadCA operon whereas the low GABA-producing L. brevis strains contain the operon and gadB. The gadB seemed to only marginally contribute to the accumulation of GABA. The high GABA production ability of CD0817 may be associated with its extraordinary genome.",

In this study, rhamnolipids extracted from P. aeruginosa P6 were characterized to determine their potential fields of application. Thin-layer chromatographic analysis of the produced rhamnolipids indicated the production of two homologues: mono- and di-rhamnolipids, whose structures were verified by 1 H and 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Additionally, high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry identified seven different rhamnolipid congeners, of which a significantly high proportion was di-rhamnolipids reaching 80.16%. Rha-Rha-C10-C10 was confirmed as the principal compound of the rhamnolipid mixture (24.30%). The rhamnolipids were capable of lowering surface tension of water to 36 mN/m at a critical micelle concentration of 0.2 g/L, and exhibited a great emulsifying activity (E24 = 63%). In addition, they showed excellent stability at pH ranges 4–8, NaCl concentrations up to 9% (w/v) and temperatures ranging from 20 to 100 °C and even after autoclaving. These results suggest that rhamnolipids, produced by P. aeruginosa P6 using the cheap substrate glycerol, are propitious for biotechnology use in extreme and complex environments, like oil reservoirs and hydrocarbon contaminated soil. Moreover, P. aeruginosa P6 may be considered, in its wild type form, as a promising industrial producer of di-RLs, which have superior characteristics for potential applications and offer outstanding commercial benefits.",

The plan of the present research was to evaluate the influence of the biologically produced GNPs on some rat organs. GNPs were produced using Fusarium oxysporum and their presence was confirmed using spectrophotometer, transmission electron microscope (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses. The non-toxic and toxic doses of GNPs were determined using MTT assay and were injected intraperitoneally into rats in 3 continuous days and their effects on the kidney, liver and testis were analyzed using microscopic technique. Results revealed that GNPs that were produced had 525 nm absorbance peak and average sizes of about 50 nm, with round and hexagonal shapes. Results from the XRD analysis showed the presence of GNPs in the reaction mixture. MTT assay results revealed that GNPs had somehow toxic effects which depend on their doses. Histological examinations indicated that based on the tested organ, the distribution and effects of GNPs were different which in the testis, the non-toxic dose had no effects and in some parts of the liver and kidney, it induced mild changes. The toxic dose of the GNPs in all the three tested organs induced mild changes. In conclusion, the in vitro and in vivo behaviors of the produced GNPs were different and GNPs even in high concentration induced low changes in the rat organs. This may be due to the short exposure and the use of the biologically produced GNPs.",

Different tip materials have different chemical and physical characteristics which might influence the specimen collection and release. We investigated properties of various types of swabs used in clinical diagnostics with focusing on two kinds of analytes, DNA and proteins, which are most often used targets in POCT. As the model samples we used diphtheria toxoid NIBSC 69/017 for investigating recovery of protein analytes such as antigens and bacterial strains of Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, diphtheria toxin-producing Corynebacterium diphtheriae NCTC 10648, and the clinical isolate nontoxigenic C. diphtheriae 5820/15 for investigating the recovery of nucleic acids. We investigated four types of swabs most commonly used in clinical diagnostics in terms of absorption capacity and efficiency of release of nucleic acids and proteins. Volume uptake was measured in milligrams. For DNA release various washing out buffers were used and the amount of released DNA was measured spectrophotometrically. The amount of protein released from the swabs were examined using the Lowry assay. We observed statistically significant differences ( p &lt; 0.05) in the mean weights of absorbed liquid, in the DNA recovery and protein recovery by the four variety of swab examined. However, the efficiency of DNA and protein release was not correlated to the absorbed volume of a sample, but rather to the properties of swabs. The swab composition and structure can have a significant impact on the collection and release efficiency of a sample. Therefore, validation of POCT in relation to the used swabs for sampling is really important. The use of inappropriate swabs could lead to false negative or misleading analysis results.",

The current options to treat Acanthamoeba infections have limited success. Silver nanoparticles show antimicrobial effects and enhance the efficacy of their payload at the specific biological targets. Natural folk plants have been widely used for treating diseases as the phytochemicals from several plants have been shown to exhibit amoebicidal effects. Herein, we used natural products of plant or commercial sources including quercetin (QT), kolavenic acid (PGEA) isolated from plant extracts of Polyalthia longifolia var pendula and crude plant methanolic extract of Caesalpinia pulcherrima (CPFLM) as antiacanthamoebic agents. Furthermore, these plant-based materials were conjugated with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) to determine the effects of the natural compounds and their nanoconjugates against a clinical isolate of A. castellanii from a keratitis patient (ATCC 50492) belonging to the T4 genotype. The compounds were conjugated with AgNPs and characterized by using ultraviolet visible spectrophotometry and atomic force microscopy. Quercetin coated silver nanoparticles (QT-AgNPs) showed characteristic surface plasmon resonance band at 443 nm and the average size distribution was found to be around 45 nm. The natural compounds alone and their nanoconjugates were tested for the viability of amoebae, encystation and excystation activity against A. castellanii. The natural compounds showed significant growth inhibition of A. castellanii while QT-AgNPs specifically exhibited enhanced antiamoebic effects as well as interrupted the encystation and excystation activity of the amoebae. Interestingly, these compounds and nanoconjugates did not exhibit in vitro cytotoxic effects against human cells. Plant-based compounds and extracts could be an interesting strategy in development of alternative therapeutics against Acanthamoeba infections.",

To confirm the effects of the probiotics on development and microbial community of L. vannamei larvae during different development stages, five kinds of probiotics (108 ~ 109 CFU/g) were added into the rearing environment of shrimp larvae, and the effects of probiotics on bacterial community and water quality, larval growth and immune index were determined from nauplius larval stage to post larval stage. Results suggested that probiotics treated groups showed larger survival rate than the control groups from Z1 stage to P5 stage. Lactobacillus could improve the larvae's survival ability, especially in the larval stages M2, M3, P1, P5 stage. It was confirmed that probiotics could promote the growth and development of shrimp larvae and prevent the incomplete molting in their growing process, particularly for EM-treated group. Results suggested that all the probiotics-treated groups had shown significant decreasing trend in the quantity of vibrios, except for the SA-treated group. And different probiotics could inhibit vibrios during different life periods. Among these probiotics, LA, EM and PB had shown the best effects, including improving survival rate of the larvae, promoting the larval metamorphosis, reducing the quantity of vibrios and NH4-N and NO2-N levels, and increasing bacterial diversity.",

The \"Aquamimicry system\", mimicking the nature of aquatic ecosystems for the well-being of aquatic animals, has effectively increased shrimp production and been adapted in many countries. However, the microbial communities in the shrimp intestine and surrounding environment that act as an essential component in Aquamimicry remain largely unknown. In this study, the microbial composition and diversity alteration in shrimp intestine, surrounding water and sediment at different culture stages were investigated by high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene, obtaining 13,562 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Results showed that the microbial communities in shrimp intestine and surrounding environment were significantly distinct from each other, and 23 distinguished taxa for each habitat were further characterized. The microbial communities differed significantly at different culture stages, confirmed by a great number of OTUs dramatically altered during the culture period. A small part of these altered OTUs were shared between shrimp intestine and surrounding environment, suggesting that the microbial alteration of intestine was not consistent with that of water and sediment. Regarding the high production of Aquamimicry farm used as a case in this study, the dissimilarity between intestinal and surrounding microbiota might be considered as a potential indicator for healthy status of shrimp farming, which provided hints on the appropriate culture practices to improve shrimp production.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Bacillus velezensis is widely used for agricultural biocontrol, due to its ability to enhance plant growth while suppressing the growth of microbial pathogens. However, there are few reports on its application in fermented feed. Here, a two-stage solid-state fermentation process using Bacillus velezensis followed by Lactobacillus plantarum was developed to degrade antinutritional factors (ANFs) and improve soybean meal (SBM) nutrition for animal feed. The process was evaluated for performance in degrading SBM antinutritional factors, dynamic changes in physicochemical characteristics, microorganisms and metabolites. After two-stage fermentation, degradation rates of glycinin and β-conglycinin contents reached 78.60% and 72.89%, respectively. The pH of fermented SBM (FSBM) decreased to 4.78 ± 0.04 and lactic acid content reached 183.38 ± 4.86 mmol/kg. NSP-degrading enzymes (Non-starch polysaccharide, NSPases) and protease were detected from the fermented product, which caused the changed microstructure of SBM. Compared to uninoculated SBM, FSBM exhibited increased proportions of crude protein (51.97 ± 0.44% vs. 47.28 ± 0.34%), Ca, total phosphorus (P), and trichloroacetic acid-soluble protein (11.79 ± 0.13% vs. 5.07 ± 0.06%). Additionally, cellulose and hemicellulose proportions declined by 22.10% and 39.15%, respectively. Total amino acid content increased by 5.05%, while the difference of AA content between the 24 h, 48 h and 72 h of fermentation was not significant ( P &gt; 0.05). Furthermore, FSBM also showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli . These results demonstrated that two-stage SBM fermentation process based on Bacillus velezensis 157 and Lactobacillus plantarum BLCC2-0015 is an effective approach to reduce ANFs content and improve the quality of SBM feed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Dunaliella salina ( D. salina ) has been exploited as a novel expression system for the field of genetic engineering. However, owing to the low or inconsistent expression of target proteins, it has been greatly restricted to practical production of recombinant proteins. Since the accurate gene editing function of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas system, β-carotene hydroxylase gene was chosen as an example to explore D. salina application with the purpose of improving expression level of foreign genes. In this paper, based on pKSE401 backbone, three CRISPR/Cas9 binary vectors were constructed to targeting exon 1 and 3 of the β-carotene hydroxylase of D. salina CCAP19/18 (Dschyb). D. salina mutants were obtained by salt gradient transformation method, and the expression of Dschyb gene were identified through real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR. Moreover, carotenoids content was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography at different time points after high intensity treatment. Compared with wild type strains, the β-carotene levels of mutants showed a significant increase, nearly up to 1.4 μg/ml, and the levels of zeaxanthin decreased to various degrees in mutants. All the results provide a compelling evidence for targeted gene editing in D. salina . This study gave a first successful gene editing of D. salina which has a very important practical significance for increasing carotene yield and meeting realistic industry demand. Furthermore, it provides an approach to overcome the current obstacles of D. salina , and then gives a strong tool to facilitates the development and application of D. salina system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Gas fermentation is one of the promising bioprocesses to convert CO 2 or syngas to important chemicals. Thermophilic gas fermentation of volatile chemicals has the potential for the development of consolidated bioprocesses that can simultaneously separate products during fermentation. This study reports the production of acetone from CO 2 and H 2 , CO, or syngas by introducing the acetone production pathway using acetyl–coenzyme A (Ac-CoA) and acetate produced via the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway in Moorella thermoacetica . Reducing the carbon flux from Ac-CoA to acetate through genetic engineering successfully enhanced acetone productivity, which varied on the basis of the gas composition. The highest acetone productivity was obtained with CO–H 2 , while autotrophic growth collapsed with CO 2 –H 2 . By adding H 2 to CO, the acetone productivity from the same amount of carbon source increased compared to CO gas only, and the maximum specific acetone production rate also increased from 0.04 to 0.09 g-acetone/g-dry cell/h. Our development of the engineered thermophilic acetogen M. thermoacetica , which grows at a temperature higher than the boiling point of acetone (58 °C), would pave the way for developing a consolidated process with simplified and cost-effective recovery via condensation following gas fermentation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Soil microbes perform important functions in nitrogen and carbon cycling in the biosphere. Microbial communities in the rhizosphere enhance plants’ health and promote nutrient turnover and cycling in the soil. In this study, we evaluated the effects of soil fertilization with organic and inorganic fertilizers on the abundances and distribution of carbon and nitrogen cycling genes within the rhizosphere of maize plants. Our result showed that maize plants through rhizosphere effects selected and enriched the same functional genes glnA, gltB , gudB involved in nitrogen cycle as do high compost and low inorganic fertilizer treatments. This observation was significantly different from those of high doses of inorganic fertilizer and low compost manure treated soil. Only alpha amylase encoding genes were selectively enriched by low compost and high inorganic fertilized soil. The other treatments only selected xynB (in Cp8), lacZ (Cp4), bglA , pldB , trpA (N2), uidA (N1) and glgC , vanA (Cn0) carbon cycling genes in the rhizosphere of maize. Also Actinomycetales are selected by high compost, low inorganic fertilizer and control. The control was without any fertilization and the soil was planted with maize. Bacillales are also promoted by low compost and high inorganic fertilizer. This indicated that only microbes capable of tolerating the stress of high dose of inorganic fertilizer will thrive under such condition. Therefore, soil fertilization lowers nitrogen gas emission as seen with the high abundance of nitrogen assimilation genes or microbial anabolic genes, but increases carbon dioxide evolution in the agricultural soil by promoting the abundance of catabolic genes involve in carbon cycling.",

To develop improved seed pre-sowing treatment technologies, it is crucial to improve the salt tolerance of seed germination. Here, we isolated and identified the strain Bacillus sp. MGW9 and developed the seed biostimulant MGW9. The effects of seed biopriming with the seed biostimulant MGW9 in maize ( Zea mays L.) under saline conditions were studied. The results show that the strain Bacillus sp. MGW9 has characteristics such as salt tolerance, nitrogen fixation, phosphorus dissolution, and indole-3-acetic acid production. Seed biopriming with the seed biostimulant MGW9 enhanced the performance of maize during seed germination under salinity stress, improving the germination energy, germination percentage, shoot/seedling length, primary root length, shoot/seedling fresh weight, shoot/seedling dry weight, root fresh weight and root dry weight. Seed biostimulant MGW9 biopriming also alleviated the salinity damage to maize by improving the relative water content, chlorophyll content, proline content, soluble sugar content, root activity, and activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase, while decreasing the malondialdehyde content. In particular, the field seedling emergence of maize seeds in saline-alkali soil can be improved by biopriming with the seed biostimulant MGW9. Therefore, maize seed biopriming with the seed biostimulant MGW9 could be an effective approach to overcoming the inhibitory effects of salinity stress and promoting seed germination and seedling growth.",

Laccase production in the co-fermentation of pomelo peel and wheat bran reached the enzyme activity by 10,690 U/L after 5 days with a 13.58-time increase. After three steps of purification, laccase increased the specific activity from 30.78 to 188.79 U/mg protein with an activity recovery of 45.64%. The purified C. gallica laccase (CGLac) showed a molecular mass of about 57 kDa. CGLac had a yellow color and no absorption peaks at 610 nm and 330 nm, suggesting that it's a yellow laccase. CGLac exhibited stability towards temperature (40-60 °C) and neutral pH (6.0-8.0). Fe3+ and Mn2+ strongly stimulated CGLac activity by 162.56% and 226.05%, respectively. CGLac remained high activities when exposed to organic reagents and putative inhibitors. Additionally, CGLac contributed to 90.78%, 93.26%, and 99.66% removal of phenol, p-chlorophenol and bisphenol A after 120 min, respectively. In conclusion, a green efficient production strategy was introduced for fungal laccase, and the obtained CGLac presented great enzymatic properties and catalytic potential in the removal of phenolic pollutants.",

Water absorption levels were significantly reduced in bacterial-treated mortar specimens compared to control at 7 and 28-day curing. Calcium carbonate precipitation was higher in live-treated cells than in UV-treated S. pevalekii cells. Calcium carbonate precipitation by S. pevalekii cells was confirmed with SEM-EDS, XRD, and TGA analysis.

In the present study, we investigated the potential of the housekeeping gene gyrA as a molecular marker for determining the diversity of Bacillus species. The amplification efficiency for Bacillus species diversity could be greatly improved by primer design. Therefore, we designed a novel primer pair gyrA3 that can detect at least 92 Bacillus species and related species. For B. amyloliquefaciens, B. pumilus, and B. megaterium, we observed that the high variability of the gyrA gene allows for more detailed clustering at the subspecies level that cannot be achieved by the 16S rRNA gene. Since gyrA provides better phylogenetic resolution than 16S rRNA and informs on the diversity of the Bacillus community, we propose that the gyrA gene may have broad application prospects in the study of Bacillus ecology.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the present era, nanomaterials are emerging as a powerful tool for management of plant disease and improving crop production to meet the growing global need for food. Thus, this paper was conducted to explore the effectiveness of five different types of nanoparticles (NPs) viz., Co 3 O 4 NPs, CuONPs, Fe 3 O 4 NPs, NiONPs, and ZnONPs as treatments for Fusarium wilt as well as their role in promoting growth of the common bean plant. The five types of NPs were applied as a treatment for wilt in two ways, therapeutic and protective plans under greenhouse conditions. In vivo experiments showed that all types of NPs significantly increased disease control and diminished the symptoms of Fusarium wilt for both incidence and severity. The recorded values for disease control using the respective NPs during the protective plan were 82.77, 60.17, 49.67, 38.23, and 70.59%. Meanwhile these values were 92.84, 64.67, 51.33, 45.61, 73.84% during the therapeutic plan. Moreover, CuONPs during the protective plan were the best among the five types of NPs employed in terms of wilt disease management. Regarding the use of these NPs as growth promoters, the obtained results confirmed the effectiveness of the five types of NPs in enhancing vegetative growth of the plant under greenhouse conditions, in comparison with control. Among the five NPs, CuONPs improved the plant vegetative growth and particularly increased the content of the photosynthetic pigments; chlorophyll-a (2.96 mg/g), -b (1.93 mg/g), and total carotenoids (1.16 mg/g). These findings suggest the successful and potential exploitation of nanomaterials in agriculture deployed as nano-based products including nano-fungicides and nano-fertilizers. In terms of sustainability, this promising and exceptional multifunctional role of these nanomaterials will surely exert positive impacts on both the environment and sustainable agriculture.",

The aim of this analysis was to construct a pDNA-CPG C274-adjuvant nano-vaccine and investigate its immunogenicity and protection in BALB/c mice. The CPG ODN C274 adjuvant was chemically synthesized and cloned into pcDNA3.1( +), and the cloning was verified using PCR and BamHI/EcoRV restriction enzyme digestion. Then, utilizing a complex coacervation approach, pDNA-CPG C274 was encapsulated by chitosan (CS) nanoparticles (NPs). TEM and DLS are used to explore the properties of the pDNA/CSNP complex. TLR-9 pathway activation was investigated in human HEK-293 and RAW 264.7 mouse cells. The vaccine's immunogenicity and immune-protective effectiveness were investigated in BALB/c mice. The pDNA-CPG C274/CSNPs were small (mean size 79.21 ± 0.23 nm), positively charged (+ 38.87 mV), and appeared to be spherical. A continuous slow release pattern was achieved. TLR-9 activation was greatest in the mouse model with CpG ODN (C274) at concentrations of 5 and 10 μg/ml with 56% and 55%, respectively (**P < 0.01). However, in HEK-293 human cells, by increasing the concentration of CpG ODN (C274) from 1 to 50 μg/ml, the activation rate of TLR-9 also increased, so that the highest activation rate (81%) was obtained at the concentration of 50 μg/ml (***P < 0.001). pDNA-CPG C274/CSNPs immunized BALB/c mice produced increased amounts of total-IgG, as well as IFN-γ and IL-1B in serum samples, compared to non-encapsulated pDNA-CPG C274. Furthermore, liver and lung injuries, as well as bacterial loads in the liver, lung, and blood, were reduced, and BALB/c mice immunized with pDNA-CPG C274/CSNPs showed potent protection (50-75%) against acute fatal Intraperitoneal A. baumannii challenge. pDNA-CPG C274/CSNPs evoked total-IgG antibodies, Th1 cellular immunity, and the TLR-9 pathway, as well as protection against an acute fatal A. baumannii challenge.

Consequently, 450 samples (cloacal swabs, liver, and spleen) were collected from 150 diseased birds from different farms in Giza Governorate, Egypt. Subsequently, the bacteriological examination was done. Afterward, the obtained Salmonella isolates were tested for serogrouping, antibiogram, PCR monitoring of virulence (invA, stn, hilA, and pefA), and antimicrobial resistance genes (blaTEM, blaCTX-M, blaNDM, ermA, sul1, tetA, and aadA1). The total prevalence of Salmonella in the examined diseased broilers was 9.3%, and the highest prevalence was noticed in cloacal swabs. Among the recovered Salmonella isolates (n = 35), 20 serovars were recognized as S. Enteritidis and 15 serovars were identified as S. Typhimurium. Almost 60% of the retrieved S. Enteritidis serovars were extensively drug-resistant (XDR) to seven antimicrobial classes and inherited sul1, blaTEM, tetA, blaCTX-M, ereA, and aadA1 genes. Likewise, 25% of the recovered S.

The computational analysis of phage vB_EfKS5 genome confirmed that it does not contain any lysogenic, toxic, or virulent genes. Phage vB_EfKS5 exhibited lytic activity against most E. faecalis isolates with different multiplicities of infections and it infected 75.5% (22/29) of E. faecalis isolates and 42.3% (3/7) of E. faecium isolates. It was also able to destroy the biofilm formed by E. faecalis with different MOIs. Phage vB_EfKS5 alone or in combination with nisin could control the growth of E. faecalis in broth and milk. Based on its high productivity, stability, short latent period, and large burst size, phage vB_EfKS5 has a high potential for applications both in food and medical applications.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains and the consequent surge in infections caused by them have become major public health concerns. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) exhibit antibacterial properties and have wide applications in biomedical sciences. In this study, AgNPs were synthesized in the presence of antibiotics: Ceftazidime (Cft), Cefotaxime (Cef), Ceftriaxone (Cfx), and Cefepime (Cpm), along with the extract of Mentha longifolia. Mentha longifolia-based AgNPs were kept as the control for all experiments. The associated metabolites, structural properties, surface charges, and antibacterial activity of the AgNPs were also evaluated. Overall, a blue-shift of SPR peaks was observed for control AgNPs (λmax = 421 nm, 422 nm, 426 nm, and 406 nm for Cft-AgNPs, Cef-AgNPs, Cfx-AgNPs, and Cpm-AgNPs, respectively), compared to the control (λmax = 438 nm). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy showed that antibiotic-based AgNPs had distinct peaks that corresponded to the respective antibiotics, which were not observed in the control. XRD analysis showed that there were observed changes in crystallinity in antibiotic-based AgNPs compared to the control. TEM images revealed that all samples had spherical nanoparticles with different sizes and distributions compared to the control. The Zeta potential for extract-based AgNPs was - 33.6 mV, compared to -19.6 mV for Cft-AgNPs, -2 mV for Cef-AgNPs, -21.1 mV for Cfx-AgNPs, and - 24.2 mV for Cpm-AgNPs. The increase in the PDI value for antibiotic-based AgNPs also showed a highly polydisperse distribution. However, the antibiotic-AgNPs conjugates showed significantly higher activity against pathogenic bacteria. The addition of antibiotics to AgNPs brought significant changes in structural properties and antibacterial activities.",

The present study aimed to investigate the safety and antibacterial properties of postbiotic components of Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus (Lra) and Limosilactobacillus reuteri (Lre) for their potential applications in food products. The freeze dried postbiotic metabolites (FD-P) from Lra and Lre were extensively analyzed for their physico-chemical properties and antibacterial actions against common food borne pathogens. Higher levels of total flavonoids (1971.79 ± 20 mg Qu/ g), total short-chain fatty acid (23 µg/g), sugar contents, CAT, and SOD anti-oxidative enzymes were detected in the Lra postbiotic, while GSH-px levels and riboflavin were higher in Lre postbiotics (P < 0.01). No significant differences were recorded in the total phenolic (2501 and 2518 mg GAE/ L) and crude protein contents (305. 58 and 296.23 µg/g) of the postbiotics (p ≥ 0.05), respectively. Both FD-P samples showed enhanced activities against Gram-Positive pathogens compared to Gram-Negative pathogens (p < 0.05), while combining the two postbiotics further potentiated the antibacterial actions. Both FD-P samples were non-hemolytic to human erythrocyte cells, and exhibited low cytotoxicity in MRC 5 and IPEC-J2 cell lines at the highest used concentrations (150 mg/ml). In summary, the postbiotics derived from Lra and Lre are safe bioactive ingredients with enhanced antibacterial and antioxidant capabilities, having potential applications as a natural preservatives in food system, potentially enhancing safety and extending the shelf life of food products.",

The doxorubicin fermentation yield of the wild-type strain was very low, so it could not be produced directly by fermentation at an industrial scale due to the high cost. In the present study, S. peucetius SIPI-7-14 was obtained from SIPI-14 through several rounds of doxorubicin resistance screening. Then, the ketoreductase gene dnrU was knocked out to reduce (13 S )-13-dihydrodaunorubicin production, and the resistance gene drrC was overexpressed to further enhance resistance to doxorubicin. The resulting engineered strain S. peucetius △U1/ drrC produced 1128 mg/L doxorubicin, a 102.1% increase compared to that of SIPI-14. Then, fermentation medium was optimized using the response surface method. In the optimized fermentation medium, the yield of doxorubicin was increased to 1406 mg/L in shake flask on the 7th day. Furthermore, batch culture was carried out in a 10 L fermenter, and the concentration of doxorubicin reached 1461 mg/L after 7 days of culture, which was the highest yield reported to date, indicating the potential for industrial production of doxorubicin by fermentation.",

In this context, we aimed to use the metagenomic nanopore sequence analysis of soil microbiota coupled with the conventional phenotypic screening and genomic analysis for identifying the antimicrobial metabolites produced by promising soil isolate(s). In this study, whole metagenome analysis of the soil sample(s) was performed using MinION™ (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Aligning and analysis of sequences for probable secondary metabolite gene clusters were extracted and analyzed using the antiSMASH version 2 and DeepBGC. Results of the metagenomic analysis showed the most abundant taxa were Bifidobacterium, Burkholderia , and Nocardiaceae (99.21%, followed by Sphingomonadaceae (82.03%) and B. haynesii (34%). Phenotypic screening of the respective soil samples has resulted in a promising Bacillus isolate that exhibited broad-spectrum antibacterial activities against various MDR pathogens. It was identified using microscopical, cultural, and molecular methods as Bacillus (B.) haynesii isolate MZ922052. The secondary metabolite gene analysis revealed the conservation of seven biosynthetic gene clusters of antibacterial metabolites namely, siderophore lichenicidin VK21-A1/A2 (95% identity), lichenysin (100%), fengycin (53%), terpenes (100%), bacteriocin (100%), Lasso peptide (95%) and bacillibactin (53%). In conclusion, metagenomic nanopore sequence analysis of soil samples coupled with conventional screening helped identify B. haynesii isolate MZ922052 harboring seven biosynthetic gene clusters of promising antimicrobial metabolites.

According to the World Health Organization's report, tuberculosis ranks among the ten deadliest diseases worldwide. The presence of an extensive array of genes and diverse proteins within the cellular structure of this bacterium has provided us with a potent tool for diagnosis. While the culture method remains the gold standard for tuberculosis diagnosis, it is possible that molecular diagnostic methods, emphasis on the identification of mutation genes (e.g., rpoB and gyrA) and single nucleotide polymorphisms, could offer a safe and reliable alternative. Over the past few decades, as our understanding of molecular genetics has expanded, methods have been developed based on gene expansion and detection. These methods typically commence with DNA amplification through nucleic acid targeted techniques such as polymerase chain reaction. Various molecular compounds and diverse approaches have been employed in molecular assays. In this review, we endeavor to provide an overview of molecular assays for the diagnosis of tuberculosis with their properties (utilization, challenges, and functions). The ultimate goal is to explore the potential of replacing traditional bacterial methods with these advanced molecular diagnostic techniques.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Resistance to antibiotics is a critical growing public health problem that desires urgent action to combat. To avoid the stress on bacterial growth that evokes the resistance development, anti-virulence agents can be an attractive strategy as they do not target bacterial growth. Quorum sensing (QS) systems play main roles in controlling the production of diverse virulence factors and biofilm formation in bacteria. Thus, interfering with QS systems could result in mitigation of the bacterial virulence. Cilostazol is an antiplatelet and a vasodilator FDA approved drug. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-virulence activities of cilostazol in the light of its possible interference with QS systems in Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Additionally, the study examines cilostazol’s impact on the bacterium’s ability to induce infection in vivo, using sub-inhibitory concentrations to minimize the risk of resistance development. In this context, the biofilm formation, the production of virulence factors and influence on the in vivo ability to induce infection were assessed in the presence of cilostazol at sub-inhibitory concentration. Furthermore, the outcome of combination with antibiotics was evaluated. Cilostazol interfered with biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa . Moreover, swarming motility, biofilm formation and production of virulence factors were significantly diminished. Histopathological investigation revealed that liver, spleen and kidney tissues damage was abolished in mice injected with cilostazol-treated bacteria. Cilostazol exhibited a synergistic outcome when used in combination with antibiotics. At the molecular level, cilostazol downregulated the QS genes and showed considerable affinity to QS receptors. In conclusion, Cilostazol could be used as adjunct therapy with antibiotics for treating Pseudomonal infections. This research highlights cilostazol’s potential to combat bacterial infections by targeting virulence mechanisms, reducing the risk of antibiotic resistance, and enhancing treatment efficacy against P. aeruginosa . These findings open avenues for repurposing existing drugs, offering new, safer, and more effective infection control strategies.",

The produced chitosan was characterized, and its antifungal activity was investigated against Fusarium oxysporum . The purified recombinant SpsCDA appeared as a single band on SDS-PAGE at approximately 60 kDa, and its specific activity was 92 U/mg. The optimum temperature and pH of SpsCDA were 15 °C and 8.0, respectively, and the enzyme activity was significantly enhanced in the presence of NaCl. The bioconversion of chitin to chitosan by SpsCDA was accomplished in 72 h, and the chitosan yield was 69.2%. The solubility of chitosan was estimated to be 73.4%, and the degree of deacetylation was 78.1%. The estimated molecular weight of the produced chitosan was 224.7 ± 8.4 kDa with a crystallinity index (CrI) value of 18.75. Moreover, FTIR and XRD spectra revealed the characteristic peaks for enzymatically produced chitosan compared with standard chitosan, indicating their structural similarity. The produced chitosan inhibited spore germination of F. oxysporum with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1.56 mg/mL. The potential antifungal effect of chitosan is attributed to the inhibition of spore germination accompanied by ultrastructural damage of membranes and leakage of cellular components, as evidenced by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. This study shed light on the cold-active chitin deacetylase from S. psychrophila and provides a candidate enzyme for the green preparation of chitosan.",

This study was conducted to investigate the toxicity of NP and the mitigating effects of RES and NG on NP toxicity in rats. Thirty male rats were classified into 5 groups as follows: 1- Normal control (NC), 2- Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) group, 3- NP group, 4- NP + RES and 5- NP + NG. Results revealed that NP treatment significantly decreased the activities of superoxide dismutase, Catalase, Glutathione peroxidase and Glutathione content in blood, liver and kidney compared to NC and DMSO groups. Conversely, activity of Glutathione-s-transferase was significantly elevated in blood and decreased in liver and kidney. Moreover, significant escalation was observed in the levels of Malondialdehyde. Also, NP treatment led to a significant decrease in serum total testosterone and testis weight, accompanied with concurrent elevation in estradiol level compared to NC and DMSO groups. All the recorded effects induced by NP treatment were effectively countered by co-treatment with RES or NG. In addition, molecular docking studies were carried out to reveal the interactions between NP, RES, NG and estrogen receptor beta which provide a possible mechanism for their potential estrogenic activity. Overall, our study gives a deeper understanding of the toxic effect of NP on antioxidant capacity and endocrine functions as well as the potential therapeutic utility of RES and NG in alleviating these adverse effects.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Valorization of poultry waste is a significant challenge addressed in this study, which aimed to produce cost-effective and sustainable peptones from poultry waste. The isolation process yielded the highly potent proteolytic B.subtilis isolate P6, identified through 16S rRNA gene sequencing to share 94% similarity with the B.subtilis strain KEMET024 (GenBank accession number PP694485.1) and deposited in MIRCEN culture collection, Cairo, Egypt as EMCC 998871. It reached optimal production levels during 24 h of incubation, with biomass at 2.5 g/L, protease activity at 455 U/mL, and total amino acid (TAA) concentration at 208 mg/mL. For screening the most significant factors for peptone production, the Plackett–Burman design identified meat and bone meal concentration as the main significant factor influencing total amino acid reaching 420 mg/mL. BOX-Behnken design optimized peptone production increasing its production level by twofold to reach 2850 U/mL of protease activity and 580 mg/mL of total amino acids. The produced peptone demonstrated a superior amino acid profile compared to commercial peptones, with a remarkably higher total amino acid content of 621.556 mg/g and elevated levels of essential amino acids like aspartic acid (37.745%), glutamic acid (90.876%), glycine (117.272%), and alanine (50.373%). Characterization revealed optimal pH and temperature conditions of around pH 8 and 50–60°C, respectively, for the proteolytic activity. The Michaelis–Menten and Lineweaver–Burk plots determined a Km of 0.5 mg/mL and Vmax of 174.08 U/mL suggesting cooperative substrate binding and providing insights into the enzyme’s maximum rate and affinity. The produced peptone exhibited minimal cytotoxicity at lower concentrations (≤ 1 mg/mL), with cell viability exceeding 94% against normal human skin fibroblast (HSF) cells. However, higher concentrations (≥ 3 mg/mL) displayed increased cytotoxic effects. Moreover, the results strongly indicate that the produced peptone, particularly at 0.5% concentration, is an effective nitrogen source for B. subtilis cultivation, demonstrating its potential for biotechnological applications. This study successfully valorized poultry waste by developing a sustainable and cost-effective alternative to commercial peptones, contributing to waste valorization and sustainable biotechnological processes.

    "abstract": "Chemotherapeutic therapies for cancer are frequently associated with cytotoxic side effects that can be harmful to human health, including the development of intestinal mucositis (IM). It mostly affects the gastrointestinal tract, causing ulceration, inflammation, and the formation of lesions in the colon. Surprisingly, despite the frequency of IM, therapeutic choices remain restricted. In our search for new intestinal mucositis therapies, we wanted to see how Lentinan (LT), derived from Lentinus edodes, would fare in mouse models of intestinal mucositis. To create the intestinal mucositis model in mice, we gave them intra-peritoneal doses of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (50 mg/kg) and then tested the effects of Lentinan on intestinal mucositis. This examination required constant monitoring of several factors, such as body weight fluctuations, food consumption, and diarrhea. In addition, we measured the levels of certain inflammatory cytokines (Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), Interleukin-1 (IL-1), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and Interleukin-10 (IL-10), looked at the expression of tight junction proteins (Zonula Occludens-1(ZO-1), Claudin-1), measured mucin-2 levels, and looked into changes in the gut flora. In the mouse model of intestinal mucositis, our findings showed that LT effectively reduced weight loss, increased food intake, and relieved diarrhea. Concurrently, we saw a decrease in the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6, as well as a considerable increase in the concentration of IL-10. Furthermore, LT reduced intestinal mucositis by increasing the length and structural integrity of the colon. Furthermore, increased expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, Claudin-1), mucin-2, and an increase in the number of goblet cells all confirmed our previous findings. Notably, the makeup of beneficial bacteria in the stomach increased as well. Finally, our findings suggest that LT can effectively prevent 5-fluorouracil-induced intestinal mucositis in mice by improving immune function, restoring intestinal barrier integrity, and rebalancing gut microbial flora.",

    "abstract": "Candida albicans is a commensal fungus that naturally inhabits the vagina. However, overgrowth of C. albicans can result in vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), one of the most prevalent fungal infections affecting women. The rapid emergence of azole resistance in C. albicans, in addition to the limited available antifungal agents, complicates the treatment and emphasizes the urgent need for novel therapeutic options. Efflux-mediated azole resistance is a common resistance mechanism in fluconazole (FLZ)-resistant C. albicans. Combination therapy using natural compounds is a potential approach that can restore fluconazole's antifungal activity in azole-resistant isolates via efflux pump inhibition. This study aimed to evaluate the ability of celastrol, a natural triterpene, to retrieve FLZ antifungal activity against azole-resistant C. albicans in vitro and in vivo. Celastrol did not exhibit antifungal activity against the tested clinical isolates; however, the sub-MIC of celastrol inhibited rhodamine 6G (R6G) efflux and increased R6G accumulation inside celastrol-treated C. albicans cells. Synergy was spotted between celastrol and FLZ via a checkerboard assay. Quantification of m-RNA levels of efflux-mediated azole resistance genes within azole-resistant C. albicans demonstrated CDR1 overexpression. Upon celastrol treatment, a significant decline in ABC transporters transcript levels were detected. Moreover, molecular docking demonstrated that celastrol is a potential ABC efflux transporters blocker that successfully fits into target binding pockets. A negligible hemolytic effect of celastrol against human erythrocytes was observed. In the in vivo model of VVC, the combination of FLZ and celastrol in vaginal gel revealed a drastic reduction in the fungal burden with apparently normal vaginal tissue. Celastrol promising in vitro and in vivo findings strengthen its future use for the treatment of azole-resistant C. albicans.",

Therefore, this study aimed to optimize agitation, yeast extract, and di-sodium phosphate (Na2HPO4) concentration to improve the survival under gastric conditions of a multistrain consortium produced in a laboratory bioreactor. Viability, survival low pH (3.00), bile salt tolerance, and antagonistic activity against the pathogen Streptococcus agalactiae were evaluated. As the main result, a high concentration of di-sodium phosphate (2.63% w/v) increased the viability of L. lactis A12 (9.05 to 9.46 Log10 CFU/mL) and Priestia species (0.00 to 6.88 Log10 CFU/mL), survival to pH 3.00 (60 to 93%), survival of bile salts (58– 93%) antagonistic activity (8.74 to 15.56 mm), and final pH of culture medium (4.34 to 6.95). Optimal conditions that improved probiotics characteristics were 150 RPM, 0.83% w/v yeast extract, and 2.63% w/v Na2HPO4. Co-culture of L. lactis A12 with Priestia species improved significantly (p < 0.05) the antagonistic activity (10.41 mm) against S. agalactiae compared to mono-culture (7.70 mm). Our results suggested that was possible to produce a potential multistrain preparation in a lab bioreactor with high viability of L. lactis A12 (9.33 Log10 CFU/mL), high survival to gastric conditions (> 85%), and with antagonistic activity against fish pathogen. This preparation could be used as a feed additive intended for fish nutrition.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study investigates the effect of Paracoccus sp. EGY7 carotenoids on the triple-negative breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231). The bacterial strain was isolated, and its carotenoids profile was analyzed via HPLC-DAD-MS. Cytotoxicity, migration tests and the expression of BAX and BCL-2 at the gene and protein levels were carried out to evaluate the therapeutic efficiency of the produced carotenoids. Molecular docking analysis estimated the binding affinity between zeaxanthin and BCL-2 protein. Chromatographic analysis revealed zeaxanthin as the major carotenoid (48.3%). The extract exhibited significant cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-231 cells with an IC 50 of 1200 µg. It notably reduced cell migration, with wound closure percentages of 37.50% and 79.17% for the 600 µg group, while the percentages were 12.50% and 53.50% for the 1200 µg group, compared to 71.67% and 95.67% for the control at 24 and 48 h post-treatment, respectively. The extract induced apoptosis, as evidenced by significantly increased BAX/BCL-2 gene expression ratios at 600 and 1200 µg ( p &lt; 0.05). Western blotting showed increased BAX protein expression at 600 and 1200 µg compared to the control group ( p &lt; 0.001), and significantly lower BCL-2 protein expression ( p = 0.000005 for 1200 µg and p = 0.0001 for 600 µg). Docking analysis indicated a strong affinity of zeaxanthin to BCL-2 (ΔG = -9.773241 kcal/mol) compared to obatoclax (ΔG = -7.419345 kcal/mol). Paracoccus sp. EGY7 carotenoids are a promising anticancer agent against MDA-MB-231 cells. They effectively promote apoptosis and prevent metastasis, crucial for disease advancement in cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis, induced by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), continues to pose a significant global public health challenge. Ferroptosis has emerged as a pivotal factor in tuberculosis pathogenesis, however, the mechanism has not yet been fully clarified. Therefore, the aim of this study was to hypothesize and validate potential ferroptosis-related genes in Mtb infection through bioinformatics analysis, thereby offering insights for further investigation. The mRNA microarray expression profile datasets were sourced from the Gene Expression Omnibus. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were derived using GEO2R. Subsequently, the shared DEGs between the GSE174566 and GSE227851 datasets were intersected with the genes in the ferroptosis database. The ferroptosis-associated shared DEGs (Ferr-sDEGs) were validated in the GSE20050 dataset. They were subjected to PPI, Cytoscape and Friends analysis, the infiltration correlation of immune cells and qRT-PCR. A total of 11 Ferr-sDEGs were identified, and 9 genes were validated. These analyses revealed that the key Ferr-sDEGs contributed to ferroptosis during Mtb infection and these key Ferr-sDEGs were relatively independent, implying that ferroptosis may be triggered by various mechanisms. Concurrently, the infiltration and correlation analysis demonstrated that multiple types of immune cells could be activated by the key Ferr-sDEGs. Ultimately, qRT-PCR validated that the expression levels of key Ferr-sDEGs. In conclusion, ferroptosis serves a pivotal function in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis. IL1B, PTGS2, TNFAIP3, HMOX1, SOCS1, CD82, and NUPR1 may be vital genes associated with the ferroptosis induced by Mtb infection.",

Recent research suggests that modulation of the gut microbiome can have therapeutic benefits and that Angiotensin-II Type 1 Receptor (AT1R) can stimulate cell growth, angiogenesis, and resistance to apoptosis in various cancers. In this study, the adjunctive administration of Lactobacillus spp. and telmisartan, an AT1R blocker, was explored in the treatment of CRC. The effect of telmisartan and a mixture of probiotic species, Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Lactobacillus fermentum, was assessed on key biomarkers and selected gut microbiota taxa in 1,2-dimethylhydrazine-induced CRC in rats. Angiogenesis, inflammation, and apoptosis were assessed by measuring vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), Interleukin 6 (IL-6), and Annexin V levels, respectively. The relative abundance of selected gut microbial taxa, including Bacteroides spp., Clostridium spp., Clostridium coccoides, Ruminococcus spp., and Lactobacillus spp. was analyzed to determine the change in the microbial composition in the different experimental groups of the animal model. This study demonstrated that the unique combination therapy using a Lactobacillus mixture and telmisartan effectively reduced VEGF and IL-6 levels, indicating decreased angiogenesis and inflammation. Lactobacillus spp. co-administration with telmisartan boosted programmed cell death, reversed dysbiosis, improved histopathological outcomes, and reduced CEA levels. These findings offer a new perspective on the role of Lactobacillus spp. and telmisartan in CRC treatment. Further research on their adjunctive use and therapeutic potential are needed to enhance clinical efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that presents a serious risk to public health. Glycosyltransferase-related genes (GTRGs) are instrumental in assessing the risk of latent tuberculosis infection progressing to active TB. This study aims to develop novel, accurate, and effective diagnostic markers to enhance the early diagnosis and precision treatment of TB. We employed Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to explore key genes that are notably linked toTB. In addition, we employed single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) to examine the differences in immune cell infiltration between normal tissues and those affected by TB. The effectiveness of the potential biomarkers was evaluated through Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and their expression patterns. We also conducted single-gene enrichment analysis to explore the biological functions and pathway activities linked to the characteristic genes. Finally, we constructed a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network to elucidate the potential regulatory mechanisms governing these genes. Through the screening of hub genes and differentially expressed genes from the GTRGs, we identified two potential biomarkers: B4GALT5 and KCNJ2. Evaluation results indicated that these characteristic genes displayed strong diagnostic performance in both the training and validation cohorts. Moreover, single-gene enrichment analysis revealed that these genes were primarily enriched in apoptosis pathways closely associated with TB treatment. Additionally, the construction of the mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA network identified 82 miRNAs and 65 lncRNAs. This study elucidates the roles of GTRGs in TB, identifies biomarkers associated with these groups, and establishes the lncRNA expression profile of characteristic genes. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for the early diagnosis of TB.",

Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is an opportunistic periodontopathogen known for its ability to form biofilms. The objective of this in vitro study was to determine the anti-virulence effect of nano-quercetin (N-QT)-mediated PDT on the expression of a gene associated with biofilm formation of A. actinomycetemcomitans. After synthesis and characterization of N-QT by transmission electron microscopes (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential analysis, and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis, the effects of different concentrations of N-QT and energy densities of diode laser alone on cell viability of A. actinomycetemcomitans were evaluated. A. actinomycetemcomitans was then treated by sub-lethal doses of diode laser emitting light in the presence of sub-lethal doses of N-QT. Ultimately, the sub-lethal dose of PDT was used to investigate the metabolic activity of A. actinomycetemcomitans, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and changes in rcpA, qseB, and qseC genes expression using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) method. According to the results, TEM, DLS, zeta potential, and FTIR confirmed the synthesis of N-QT. PDT with concentrations of 16 to 512 µg/mL of N-QT alone and irradiation for 6 min with an energy density of 154.8 J/cm2 alone caused a significant decrease in bacterial count (P < 0.05). PDT with 8 µg/mL N-QT and 5-min irradiation achieved the highest metabolic activity reduction (42.9%), while 2 µg/mL N-QT and 4-min irradiation yielded the lowest reduction (12.3%). Using 8 µg/mL of N-QT with light exposure for 4 and 5 min at energy densities of 103.9 and 129 J/cm² led to ROS levels that were 2.67- and 2.83-fold higher than those in the control cells, respectively (P < 0.05). Additionally, the sub-lethal dose of PDT with 5 min of irradiation in the presence of 2 µg/mL of N-QT resulted in a 2.62-, 2.85-, and 3.21-fold decrease in the expression levels of the rcpA, qseB, and qseC genes, respectively (P < 0.05). PDT utilizing N-QT and diode laser shows promise in suppressing cellular survival and emerges as a viable strategy for targeting A. actinomycetemcomitans virulence.",

Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 (BB-12) is a widely studied probiotic strain; however, its specific effects in this context remain unexplored. In this study, we aimed to investigate the prophylactic and therapeutic effects of BB-12 in AP. Our findings revealed that BB-12 administration via gavage significantly reduced pathological pancreatic damage and serum amylase activity. Microbiome analysis showed that BB-12 treatment significantly increased the relative abundance of Ligilactobacillus and decreased that of Bilophila in the gut microbiota of mice with AP. Transcriptome analysis revealed that BB-12 mitigated the AP-induced dysregulation of several pathways, specifically attenuating the upregulation of the pancreatic secretion and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism pathways while reversing the downregulation of the ribosome, oxidative phosphorylation, and thermogenesis pathways. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between the abundances of Bilophila and ASF356 and serum amylase activity. Furthermore, the abundances of Bilophila and ASF356 were significantly correlated with BB-12-regulated pancreatic genes and were predominantly enriched in the ribosome pathway. In conclusion, BB-12 pretreatment alleviated AP, likely by regulating the abundance of intestinal Lactobacillus, Bilophila, and ASF356, as well as the pancreatic secretion, ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, ribosome, and thermogenesis pathways.",

    "abstract": "Although some studies have reported a possible association between lipid and the development and progression of syphilis, the overall causal relationship between lipid and syphilis remains unclear. Data abstracted from extensive genome-wide association studies were utilized to pinpoint genetic variations linked to 179 distinct lipid species. Subsequently, these variations served as instrumental variables in Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses, aimed at evaluating the causal impact of these lipid species on the occurrence of syphilis. A range of methods, including Weighted Mode, Weighted Median, Simple Mode, MR Egger, and Inverse Variance Weighted, were employed to determine the causal influence. For the purpose of sensitivity analysis, techniques such as Inverse Variance Weighted, MR-Egger, the MR Steiger test, the MR-Egger Intercept Test, and MR-PRESSO were applied. Additionally, Multivariate Mendelian Randomization (MVMR) analyses were conducted to directly assess the causal effect of lipid species on the risk of syphilis. Sterol ester (SE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) could potentially impact syphilis risk. Specifically, SE (27:1/16:0), SE (27:1/18:2), SE (27:1/18:3), SE (27:1/20:3), and SE (27:1/22:6) were linked to an elevated risk of syphilis. PC (18:2_0:0) was linked to an elevated risk of syphilis. In contrast, PC (16:1_18:0) exhibited a protective role against syphilis. No heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy was detected. SE (27:1/16:0), SE (27:1/18:2), SE(27:1/18:3), SE (27:1/20:3), and SE (27:1/22:6) were no longer significantly associated with syphilis in the MVMR analysis (P>0.05). In addition, the previously observed effect of PC (18:2_0:0) on syphilis in univariate MR Was no longer significant in MVMR analysis. However, genetically predicted PC (16:1_18:0) was still significantly negatively associated with syphilis, consistent with univariate MR analysis. We observed that hereditary SE and PC levels appear to be associated with syphilis susceptibility. Future research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind this supposed causation and to develop corresponding treatment strategies.",

These infections in the ICU lead to significant morbidity, mortality, increased costs, and prolonged hospital stays. Therefore, the present study investigated this condition's prevalence and risk factors. This cross-sectional study was conducted on patients with neurological and nephrological issues admitted to general ICUs and trauma patients in two large hospitals in southeastern Iran. Bacteremia prevalence and mortality effects in ICU patients were analyzed from March 2020 to September 2022 during the COVID period. The results identified 127 patients with positive blood cultures, including 59 from the general ICU and 68 from the trauma ICU, yielding prevalences of 3.02% and 1.93%, respectively. The most common comorbidities included drug addiction (36.2%), chronic hypertension (35.4%), and type 2 diabetes (25.2%). Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated organism, followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Acinetobacter. The mortality rate was 93.2% in the general ICU and 60.3% in the trauma ICU. Risk factors associated with mortality included diabetes, hypertension, renal failure, drug addiction, a history of surgery in the last 30 days, ineffective experimental antibiotic treatment, and the administration of vasopressors. The prevalence of multiple drug resistance (MDR) was 33%, while Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus (VRE) was found in 9.4% of cases. These findings suggest that identifying and controlling risk factors associated with bacteremia in ICU patients is essential for reducing mortality.",

The antimicrobial activity of the two oil forms was evaluated against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus niger. The protein denaturation assay was used to assess anti-inflammatory properties, while the DPPH assay was employed to evaluate antioxidant activity. Cytotoxicity was tested using normal human fibroblast cells (WI-38) and colon cancer cells. The results revealed that exposure to ozone altered the chemical composition of the oil, increasing the number of identifiable molecules from 10 in the crude oil to 29 in the ozonized form. A significant enhancement in the antimicrobial activity of the crude oil was observed after ozonization. Moreover, ozonization notably increased the oil's antioxidant capacity with IC50 13.06 ± 0.6 µg/mL, while crude oil provide IC50 23.37 ± 0.3 µg/mL compared to IC50 standard ascorbic acid (3.08 ± 0.4 µg/mL) as well as its anticancer (IC50 was 7.31 ± 0.21 and 15.09 ± 0.37 µg/mL against colon carcinoma cells, IC50 was 29.49 ± 2.03 and 24.68 ± 1.44 µg/mL against lung fibroblast normal cells employing crude oil and ozonized oil, respectively) anti-inflammatory potential.",

Accordingly, it was recently shown how to obtain a superhydrophobic surface using a simple and cost-effective method on a polymer named poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA). To evaluate the ability of such material as a substrate for bacterial colonization, this work assessed the capability of different bacteria to colonize a biomimetic rough superhydrophobic (SH) PLLA surface and also a smooth hydrophobic (H) one. The interaction between these surfaces and bacteria with different morphologies and cell walls was studied using one strain of Staphylococcus aureus and one of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Results showed that both bacterial strains colonized the surfaces tested, although significantly higher numbers of S. aureus cells were found on SH surfaces comparing to H ones. Moreover, scanning electron microscopy images showed an extracellular matrix produced by P. aeruginosa on SH PLLA surfaces, indicating that this bacterium is able to form a biofilm on such substratum. Bacterial removal through lotus leaf effect was also tested, being more efficient on H coupons than on SH PLLA ones. Overall, the results showed that SH PLLA surfaces can be used as a substrate for bacterial colonization and, thus, have an exceptional potential for biotechnology applications.",

Clostridium pasteurianum can utilize glycerol as sole carbon source and converts it into 1,3-propanediol, ethanol, butanol, and CO 2 . Reduced growth and productivities on crude glycerol as compared to technical grade glycerol have previously been observed. In this study, we applied random mutagenesis mediated by ethane methyl sulfonate (EMS) to develop a mutant strain of C. pasteurianum tolerating high concentrations of crude glycerol. At an initial crude glycerol concentration of 25 g/l the amount of dry cell mass produced by the mutant strain was six times higher than the amount produced by the wild type. Growth of the mutant strain was even detected at an initial crude glycerol concentration of 105 g/l. A pH controlled reactor with in situ removal of butanol by gas-stripping was used to evaluate the performance of the mutant strain. Utilizing stored crude glycerol, the mutant strain showed significantly increased rates compared to the wild type. A maximum glycerol utilization rate of 7.59 g/l/h was observed along with productivities of 1.80 g/l/h and 1.21 g/l/h of butanol and 1,3-PDO, respectively. These rates are higher than what previously has been published for C. pasteurianum growing on technical grade glycerol in fed batch reactors. In addition, high yields of the main products (butanol and 1,3-PDO) were detected and these two products were efficiently separated in two steams using gas-stripping.",

The laccase was purified 4.64-fold as measured by specific activity from crude culture filtrate by ultrafiltration concentration, Q-Sepharose FF and Sephacryl™ S-200 column chromatography. The overall yield of the purified enzyme was 7.49%. The molecular mass of purified enzyme as estimated by SDS-PAGE and by gel filtration on Sephacryl™ S-200 was found to be 73.3 kDa and 24.7 kDa, respectively, indicating that the laccase from T. fusca BCRC 19214 is a trimer. The internal amino acid sequences of the purified laccase, as determined by LC-MS/MS, had high homology with a superoxide dismutase from T. fusca YX. Approximately 95% of the original activity remained after treatment at 50°C for 3 h. and approximately 75% of the original activity remained after treatment at pH 10.0 for 24 h. This laccase could oxidize dye intermediates, especially 2,6-dimethylphenylalanine and p -aminophenol, to produce coloring. This is the first report on laccase properties from thermophilic actinomycetes. These properties suggest that this newly isolated laccase has potential for specific industrial applications.",

The lipopeptide was purified using silica gel chromatography, size exclusion chromatography and reverse phase- HPLC. The MS/MS analysis of the lipopeptide revealed that it has amino acid sequence as Ala-Thr-Gly-Ser-His-Gln and a long chain fatty acid tail with six times repeated the molecular mass of 161 Da which is corresponding to -C12H19. Based on the molecular mass (878.5 Da) and amino acid composition, the lipopeptide was identified as a novel lipopeptide.

Although there are many reports describing consolidation of hydrolysis and fermentation steps using recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae that express cellulolytic enzymes, the efficiency of cellulose degradation has not been sufficiently improved. Although the yeast S. cerevisiae cannot take up cellooligosaccharide, some fungi can take up and assimilate cellooligosaccharide through a cellodextrin transporter. In this study, a S. cerevisiae strain co-expressing genes for several cell surface display cellulases and the cellodextrin transporter was constructed for the purpose of improving the efficiency of direct ethanol fermentation from phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC). The cellulase/cellodextrin transporter-coexpressing strain produced 1.7-fold more ethanol (4.3 g/L) from PASC during a 72-h fermentation than did a strain expressing cellulase only (2.5 g/L). Direct ethanol production from PASC by the recombinant S. cerevisiae strain was improved by co-expression of cellulase display and cellodextrin transporter genes. These results suggest that cellulase- and cellodextrin transporter-co-expressing S. cerevisiae could be a promising technology for efficient direct ethanol production from cellulose.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Several studies suggest that petroleum biodegradation can be achieved by either aerobic or anaerobic microorganisms, depending on oxygen input or other electron acceptors and appropriate nutrients. Evidence from in vitro experiments with samples of petroleum formation water and oils from Pampo Field indicate that petroleum biodegradation is more likely to be a joint achievement of both aerobic and anaerobic bacterial consortium, refining our previous observations of aerobic degradation. The aerobic consortium depleted, in decreasing order, hydrocarbons &gt; hopanes &gt; steranes &gt; tricyclic terpanes while the anaerobic consortium depleted hydrocarbons &gt; steranes &gt; hopanes &gt; tricyclic terpanes. The oxygen content of the mixed consortia was measured from time to time revealing alternating periods of microaerobicity (O 2 ~0.8 mg.L -1 ) and of aerobicity (O 2 ~6.0 mg.L -1 ). In this experiment, the petroleum biodegradation changed from time to time, alternating periods of biodegradation similar to the aerobic process and periods of biodegradation similar to the anaerobic process. The consortia showed preferences for metabolizing hydrocarbons &gt; hopanes &gt; steranes &gt; tricyclic terpanes during a 90-day period, after which this trend changed and steranes were more biodegraded than hopanes. The analysis of aerobic oil degrading microbiota by the 16S rRNA gene clone library detected the presence of Bacillus , Brevibacterium , Mesorhizobium and Achromobacter , and the analysis of the anaerobic oil degrading microbiota using the same technique detected the presence of Bacillus and Acinetobacter (facultative strains). In the mixed consortia Stenotrophomonas , Brevibacterium , Bacillus , Rhizobium , Achromobacter and 5% uncultured bacteria were detected. This is certainly a new contribution to the study of reservoir biodegradation processes, combining two of the more important accepted hypotheses.",

    "abstract": "Agaricus bisporus mushrooms are commercially produced on a microbe rich compost. Here, fungal and bacterial biomass was quantified in compost with and without colonization by A. bisporus. Chitin content, indicative of total fungal biomass, increased during a 26-day period from 576 to 779 nmol N-acetylglucosamine g−1 compost in the absence of A. bisporus (negative control). A similar increase was found in the presence of this mushroom forming fungus. The fungal phospholipid-derived fatty acid (PLFA) marker C18:2ω6, indicative of the living fraction of the fungal biomass, decreased from 575 to 280 nmol g−1 compost in the negative control. In contrast, it increased to 1200 nmol g−1 compost in the presence of A. bisporus. Laccase activity was absent throughout culturing in the negative control, while it correlated with the fungal PLFA marker in the presence of A. bisporus. PLFA was also used to quantify living bacterial biomass. In the negative control, the bacterial markers remained constant at 3000–3200 nmol PLFA g−1 compost. In contrast, they decreased to 850 nmol g−1 compost during vegetative growth of A. bisporus, implying that bacterial biomass decreased from 17.7 to 4.7 mg g−1 compost. The relative amount of the Gram positive associated PLFA markers a15:0 and a17:0 and the Gram negative PLFA associated markers cy17:0 and cy19:0 increased and decreased, respectively, suggesting that Gram negative bacteria are more suppressed by A. bisporus. Together, these data indicate that fungal biomass can make up 6.8% of the compost after A. bisporus colonization, 57% of which being dead. Moreover, results show that A. bisporus impacts biomass and composition of bacteria in compost.",

With the exception of the normal group, SNE infection was treated for the remaining experimental period after the chicks were fed with normal diet 14 days. Results showed that BS15 notably suppressed the SNE-induced loss of average daily gain and liver functional abnormality. Additionally, BS15 facilitated lipid metabolism of SNE boilers when the contents of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ and adipose triglyceride lipase in adipose tissue and serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased. BS15 also attenuated the hepatic lipid accumulation of stricken chicks by suppressing the genes expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase and sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c as well as stimulating the genes expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1. Moreover, BS15 enhanced the development of SNE gut by improving the intestinal development and digestion as well as adjusting the gut microflora. Therefore, BS15 may provide a promising natural preventative strategy against SNE, which may be contributed to the amelioration of lipid metabolism and intestinal microflora.",

In this study, submerged fermentation of Monascus yellow pigments by Monascus ruber CGMCC 10910 under high glucose stress was investigated. The increase of lipid content was the major contributor to the increase of dry cell weight (DCW), and the lipid-free DCW was only slightly changed under high glucose stress, which benefited the accumulation of intracellular hydrophobic pigments. The fatty acid composition analysis in Monascus cell membranes showed that high glucose stress significantly increased the ratio of unsaturated/saturated fatty acid and the index of unsaturated fatty acid (IUFA) value, which would improve the fluidity and permeability of the cell membrane. As a consequence, high glucose stress increased extracellular yellow pigments production by enhancing secretion and trans-membrane conversion of intracellular pigments to the broth. The total yield of extracellular and intracellular yellow pigments per unit of lipid-free DCW increased by 94.86 and 26.31% under high glucose stress compared to conventional fermentation, respectively. A real-time quantitative PCR analysis revealed that the expression of the pigment biosynthetic gene cluster was up-regulated under high glucose stress. The gene mppE, which is associated with yellow pigment biosynthesis, was significantly up-regulated. These results indicated that high glucose stress can shift the Monascus pigment biosynthesis pathway to accumulate yellow pigments and lead to a high yield of both extracellular and intracellular yellow pigments. These findings have potential application in commercial Monascus yellow pigment production.",

In this study, Illumina high-throughput sequencing was applied to reveal the effects of different operational conditions on bacterial community distribution of three continuous operated poly(butylene succinate) biological denitrification reactors used for recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) wastewater treatment. The results indicated that salinity decreased OTU numbers and diversity while dissolved oxygen (DO) had no obvious influence on OTU numbers. Significant microbial community composition differences were observed among and between three denitrification reactors under varied operation conditions. This result was also demonstrated by cluster analysis (CA) and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA). Hierarchical clustering and redundancy analysis (RDA) was performed to test the relationship between environmental factors and bacterial community compositions and result indicated that salinity, DO and hydraulic retention time (HRT) were the three key factors in microbial community formation. Besides, Simplicispira was detected under all operational conditions, which worth drawing more attention for nitrate removal. Moreover, the abundance of nosZ gene and 16S rRNA were analyzed by real-time PCR, which suggested that salinity decreased the proportion of denitrifiers among whole bacterial community while DO had little influence on marine reactors. This study provides an overview of microbial community shift dynamics in solid-phase denitrification reactors when operation parameters changed and proved the feasibility to apply interval aeration for denitrification process based on microbial level, which may shed light on improving the performance of RAS treatment units.",

However, the biochemical characteristics were only studied in term of peroxidase because similar experiments in term of polyphenol oxidase have been reported in our pervious publication. The optimal pH of the purified peroxidase was 5.0 and its activity was retained at pH values between 5.0–10.0. The enzyme was heat stable over a wide range of temperatures (0–60°C), and less than 50% of its activity was lost at 70°C after incubation for 30 min. The enzyme was completely inhibited by β-mercaptoethanol and strongly inhibited by NaN 3 ; in addition, its properties indicated that it was a heme containing glycoprotein. This peroxidase could decolorize many dyes; aniline blue, bromocresol purple, brilliant green, crystal violet, fuchsin, malachite green, methyl green, methyl violet and water blue. The stability against high temperature and extreme pH supported that the enzyme could be a potential peroxidase source for special industrial applications.",

We designed and constructed a plasmid (pGAPZA-WZ) containing both the β-carotene ketolase (crtW) and β-carotene hydroxylase (crtZ) genes from Agrobacterium aurantiacum, under the control of the GAP promoter and containing an AOX-1 terminator. The plasmid was then integrated into the P. pastoris Pp-EBIL strain genomic DNA, producing clone Pp-EBILWZ. The recombinant P. pastoris (Pp-EBILWZ) cells exhibited a strong reddish carotenoid coloration and were confirmed, by HPLC, to produce not only the previous described carotenoids lycopene and β-carotene, but also de novo synthesized astaxanthin.",

This study investigated the metabolic responses of L. panis PM1 to oxidative stress under aerobic conditions. Growth under aerobic culture triggered an early entrance of L. panis PM1 into the stationary phase along with marked changes in end-product profiles. A ten-fold higher concentration of hydrogen peroxide was accumulated during aerobic culture compared to microaerobic culture. This H2O2 level was sufficient for the complete inhibition of L. panis PM1 cell growth, along with a significant reduction in end-products typically found during anaerobic growth. In silico analysis revealed that L. panis possessed two genes for NADH oxidase and NADH peroxidase, but their expression levels were not significantly affected by the presence of oxygen. Specific activities for these two enzymes were observed in crude extracts from L. panis PM1. Enzyme assays demonstrated that the majority of the H2O2 in the culture media was the product of NADH: H2O2 oxidase which was constitutively-active under both aerobic and microaerobic conditions; whereas, NADH peroxidase was positively-activated by the presence of oxygen and had a long induction time in contrast to NADH oxidase. These observations indicated that a coupled NADH oxidase - NADH peroxidase system was the main oxidative stress resistance mechanism in L. panis PM1, and was regulated by oxygen availability. Under aerobic conditions, NADH is mainly reoxidized by the NADH oxidase - peroxidase system rather than through the production of ethanol (or 1,3-propanediol or succinic acid production if glycerol or citric acid is available). This system helped L. panis PM1 directly use oxygen in its energy metabolism by producing extra ATP in contrast to homofermentative lactobacilli.",

After exposure to a shared atmosphere with the 23 individual VOCs for 72 hrs, seeds were assayed for rate of germination and seedling formation; vegetative plants were assayed for fresh weight and chlorophyll concentration. All but five of the VOCs tested (1-decene, 2-n-heptylfuran, nonanal, geosmin and -limonene) had a significant effect in inhibiting either germination, seedling formation or both. Seedling formation was entirely inhibited by exposure to 1-octen-3-one, 2-ethylhexanal, 3-methylbutanal, and butanal. As assayed by a combination of fresh weight and chlorophyll concentration, 2-ethylhexanal had a negative impact on two-week-old vegetative plants. Three other compounds (1-octen-3-ol, 2-ethylhexanal, and 2-heptylfuran) decreased fresh weight alone. Most of the VOCs tested did not change the fresh weight or chlorophyll concentration of vegetative plants. In summary, when tested as single compounds, fungal VOCs affected A. thaliana in positive, negative or neutral ways.",

    "abstract": "The basidiospores of most Agaricomycetes are ballistospores. They are propelled off from their basidia at maturity when Buller's drop develops at high humidity at the hilar spore appendix and fuses with a liquid film formed on the adaxial side of the spore. Spores are catapulted into the free air space between hymenia and fall then out of the mushroom's cap by gravity. Here we show for 66 different species that ballistospores from mushrooms can be attracted against gravity to electrostatic charged plastic surfaces. Charges on basidiospores can influence this effect. We used this feature to selectively collect basidiospores in sterile plastic Petri-dish lids from mushrooms which were positioned upside-down onto wet paper tissues for spore release into the air. Bulks of 104 to >107 spores were obtained overnight in the plastic lids above the reversed fruiting bodies, between 104 and 106 spores already after 2-4 h incubation. In plating tests on agar medium, we rarely observed in the harvested spore solutions contaminations by other fungi (mostly none to up to in 10% of samples in different test series) and infrequently by bacteria (in between 0 and 22% of samples of test series) which could mostly be suppressed by bactericides. We thus show that it is possible to obtain clean basidiospore samples from wild mushrooms. The technique of spore collection through electrostatic attraction in plastic lids is applicable to fresh lamellate and poroid fruiting bodies from the wild, to short-lived deliquescent mushrooms, to older and dehydrating fleshy fruiting bodies, even to animal-infested mushrooms and also to dry specimens of long-lasting tough species such as Schizophyllum commune.",

Each treatment had three replications of ten pigs per pen. Results showed that Ba replacement significantly increased the daily weight gain of piglets. Moreover, improved antioxidant status in serum and jejunum was noted in Ba-fed groups as compared with aureomycin group. Increased gene expression of antioxidant enzymes and elevated nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) in jejunum was also observed in Ba-fed groups. Besides, Ba replacement significantly decreased jejunal c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation compared with antibiotic group. Western blotting results also revealed that replacing all antibiotics with Ba initiated autophagy in the jejunum as evidenced by increased microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 II (LC3-II) abundance. Taken together, these results indicate that replacing aureomycin with Ba can improve growth performance and antioxidant status of piglets via increasing antioxidant capacity and intestinal autophagy, suggesting a good potential for Ba as an alternative to antibiotics in feed.",

Therefore, we studied the colonization and detoxification potential of a chlorothalonil degrading Stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila probiotic strain BJ1 in the soil under green conditions. The results from polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis demonstrated that probiotic strain BJ1 successfully colonized the soil by competing with the native biota. Moreover, the bacterial inoculation stimulated some members of indigenous soil microbial communities. Meantime, the degradation half-life of chlorothalonil decreased from 9.0 to 4.9 days in the soil environment. Moreover, the results from enzymatic activities and micronucleus test of Vicia faba root tips showed that the probiotic strain BJ1 reduced the ecotoxicity and genotoxicity of chlorothalonil in the soil.

Corynebacterium glutamicum that expresses exogenous GAD gene, gadB2 or gadB1, can synthesize GABA from its own produced Glu. To enhance GABA production in C. glutamicum, ribosomal binding site (RBS) sequence and promoter were searched and optimized for increasing the expression efficiency of gadB2. R4 exhibited the highest strength among RBS sequences tested, with 6 nt the optimal aligned spacing (AS) between RBS and start codon. This combination of RBS sequence and AS contributed to gadB2 expression, increased GAD activity by 156% and GABA production by 82% compared to normal strong RBS and AS combination. Then, a series of native promoters were selected for transcribing gadB2 under optimal RBS and AS combination. P dnaK , P dtsR , P odhI and P clgR expressed gadB2 and produced GABA as effectively as widely applied P tuf and P cspB promoters and more effectively than P sod promoter. However, each native promoter did not work as well as the synthetic strong promoter P tacM , which produced 20.2 ± 0.3 g/L GABA. Even with prolonged length and bicistronic architecture, the strength of P dnaK did not enhance. Finally, gadB2 and mutant gadB1 were co-expressed under the optimal promoter and RBS combination, thus converted Glu into GABA completely and improved GABA production to more than 25 g/L. This study provides useful promoters and RBS sequences for gene expression in C. glutamicum.",

Regarding the economic evaluation, we applied the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. PAC had the best performance in pH 7 and in optimal dose of 400 mg/L; so that removal efficiency of wastewater turbidity, TSS, COD and color were 99.63%, 99.7%, 47.5% and 50.38%, respectively. The best removal efficiency for wastewater turbidity, TSS, COD and color were 99.87%, 99.89%, 87.5% and 93.02%, respectively which were obtained by combination of anionic polymer (1.5 mg/L) with PAC (300 mg/L). Furthermore, with combination of PAC + anionic + non-ionic polymers, the removal efficiency for wastewater turbidity, TSS, COD and color were 99.93%, 99.94%, 88% and 94.57%, respectively. The imposed cost for treating one cubic meter of ceramic-tile wastewater treatment by PAC + anionic and PAC + anionic and non-ionic polymers in comparison with PAC alone was reduced to 22.96% and therefore economically more affordable for the tile industry wastewater treatment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the last few years, synthesis of carrier-free immobilized biocatalysts by cross-linking of enzyme aggregates has appeared as a promising technique. Cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs) present several interesting advantages over carrier-bound immobilized enzymes, such as highly concentrated enzymatic activity, high stability of the produced superstructure, important production costs savings by the absence of a support, and the fact that no previous purification of the enzyme is needed. However, the published literature evidences that a) much specific non-systematic exploratory work is being done and, b) recovered activity calculations in CLEAs still need to be optimized. In this context, this contribution presents results of an optimized procedure for the calculation of the activity retained by CLEAs, based on the comparison of their specific activity relative to their free enzyme counterparts. The protocol implies determination of precipitable protein content in commercial enzyme preparations through precipitation with ammonium sulphate and a protein co-feeder. The identification of linear ranges of activity versus concentration/amount of protein in the test reaction is also required for proper specific activity determinations. By use of mass balances that involve the protein initially added to the synthesis medium, and the protein remaining in the supernatant and washing solutions (these last derived from activity measurements), the precipitable protein present in CLEAs is obtained, and their specific activity can be calculated. In the current contribution the described protocol was applied to CLEAs of Thermomyces lanuginosa lipase, which showed a recovered specific activity of 11.1% relative to native lipase. The approach described is simple and can easily be extended to other CLEAs and also to carrier-bound immobilized enzymes for accurate determination of their retained activity.",

One marine algicidal bacterium, Ponticoccus sp. PD-2, was isolated from the microalga Prorocentrum donghaiense, and its N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL)-mediated QS system was verified. In this study, we analyzed the AHLs profile of strain PD-2. Two AHLs, 3-oxo-C8-HSL and 3-oxo-C10-HSL, were detected using a biosensor overlay assay and GC-MS methods. Two complete AHL-QS systems (designated zlaI/R and zlbI/R) were identified in the genome of strain PD-2. When expressed in Escherichia coli, both zlaI and zlbI genes could each produce 3-oxo-C8-HSL and 3-oxo-C10-HSL. Algicidal activity was investigated by evaluating the inhibitory rate (IR) of microalgae growth by measuring the fluorescence of viable cells. We found that the metabolites of strain PD-2 had algicidal activity against its host P. donghaiense (IR 84.81%) and two other red tide microalgae, Phaeocystis globosa (IR 78.91%) and Alexandrium tamarense (IR 67.14%). β-cyclodextrin which binds to AHLs and inhibits the QS system reduced the algicidal activity more than 50%. This indicates that inhibiting the QS system may affect the algicidal metabolites production of strain PD-2. Our study indicated that a QS-regulated algicidal system may play a potential role in the process of red tides disintegration. QS might be a potential way to control red tides.",

These polymers are of much interest, both from a fundamental and applied point of view, finding potential application in biomedicine, nanotechnology and as materials. The successful employment of such polymers in such diverse fields, however, requires the ready availability of a variety of different forms with novel enhanced properties and which can be simply prepared in large quantities on an industrial scale. In an attempt to create new polymer designs with improved properties and applicability, we have developed four novel SELPs wherein the elastomer forming sequence poly(VPGVG) is replaced with a plastic-like forming sequence, poly(VPAVG), and combined in varying proportions with the silk motif. Furthermore, we optimised a simplified production procedure for these, making use of an autoinduction medium to reduce process intervention and with the production level obtained being 6-fold higher than previously reported for other SELPs, with volumetric productivities above 150 mg/L. Finally, we took advantage of the known enhanced stability of these polymers in developing an abridged, non-chromatographic downstream processing and purification protocol. A simple acid treatment allowed for cell disruption and the obtention of relative pure SELP in one-step, with ammonium sulphate precipitation being subsequently used to enable improved purity. These simplified production and purification procedures improve process efficiency and reduce costs in the preparation of these novel polymers and enhances their potential for application.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial lipids have relevant applications in the production of renewable fuels and biobased oleochemicals. The genus Rhodococcus is one of the most relevant lipid producers due to its capability to accumulate those compounds, mainly triacylglycerols (TAG), when cultivated on different defined substrates, namely sugars, organic acids and hydrocarbons but also on complex carbon sources present in industrial wastes. In this work, the production of storage lipids by Rhodococcus opacus B4 using glucose, acetate and hexadecane is reported for the first time and its productivity compared with Rhodococcus opacus PD630, the best TAG producer bacterium reported. Both strains accumulated mainly TAG from all carbon sources, being influenced by the carbon source itself and by the duration of the accumulation period. R. opacus B4 produced 0.09 and 0.14 g L(-1) at 24 and 72 h, with hexadecane as carbon source, which was 2 and 3.3 fold higher than the volumetric production obtained by R. opacus PD630. Both strains presented similar fatty acids (FA) profiles in intact cells while in TAG produced fraction, R. opacus B4 revealed a higher variability in fatty acid composition than R. opacus PD630, when both strains were cultivated on hexadecane. The obtained results open new perspectives for the use of R. opacus B4 to produce TAG, in particular using oily (alkane-contaminated) waste and wastewater as cheap raw-materials. Combining TAG production with hydrocarbons degradation is a promising strategy to achieve environmental remediation while producing added value compounds.",

With an aim to develop a recombinant system for economical polymer production, PHB biosynthesis genes from Bacillus aryabhattai PHB10 were cloned in E. coli. The recombinant cells accumulated a maximum level of 6.22 g/L biopolymer utilizing glycerol in shake flasks. The extracted polymer was confirmed as PHB by GC–MS and NMR analyses. The polymer showed melting point at 171 °C, thermal stability in a temperature range of 0–140 °C and no weight loss up to 200 °C. PHB extracted from sodium hypochlorite lysed cells had average molecular weight of 143.108 kDa, polydispersity index (PDI) 1.81, tensile strength of 14.2 MPa and an elongation at break of 7.65%. This is the first report on high level polymer accumulation in recombinant E. coli solely expressing PHB biosynthesis genes from a Bacillus sp. As an alternative to sodium hypochlorite cell lysis mediated polymer extraction, the effect of combined treatment with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and microwave was studied which attained 93.75% yield. The polymer recovered through this method was 97.21% pure, showed 2.9-fold improvement in molecular weight and better PDI. The procedure is simple, with minimum polymer damage and more eco-friendly than the sodium hypochlorite lysis method.",

This method provides a possible way to observe biomineralization process and the morphology of biomineralized deposits within biofilms. We use this method to show calcite biominerals produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms which extremely change biofilm structures. The distribution of calcite precipitation produced in situ biomineralization is highly heterogeneous in biofilms and also to occur primarily on the bottom of biofilms. It is distinct from those usual expectations that mineral started to precipitate from surface of biofilm. Our results reveal that biomineralization plays a comprehensive regulation function on biofilm architecture and properties.",

Out of 623 identified proteins, 119 proteins were differentially expressed when treatment (SQR-21 inoculation) and control (no bacterial inoculation) were compared. Among those, 57 and 62 proteins were up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively. These differentially expressed proteins were identified to be involved in signal transduction (ADP-ribosylation factor, phospholipase D), transport (aspartate amino-transferase), carbohydratemetabolic (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase), defense and response to stress (glutathione S-transferase, Ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1), and oxidation–reduction process (thioredoxin peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase).

    "abstract": "In plants, hydrogen gas (H2) enhances tolerance to several abiotic stresses, including salinity and heavy metals. However, the effect of H2 on fungal growth under different stresses remains largely unclear. In this study, hydrogen-rich water (HRW) was employed to characterize physiological roles and molecular mechanisms of H2 in the alleviation of three different stresses in basidiomycete Hypsizygus marmoreus. Our results showed that HRW treatment, of which the H2 concentration was 0.8 mM, significantly reduced the toxicities of CdCl2, NaCl and H2O2, leading to significantly improved mycelial growth and biomass. These beneficial effects could be attributed to a significantly decreased formation of malondialdehyde (MDA). Besides, HRW treatment significantly increased the activities of antioxidants (SOD, CAT and GR) as well as the gene expressions of these antioxidants (SOD, CAT, and GR) at the mRNA level. In vivo detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including H2O2 and O2 −, as well as lipid peroxidation provided further evidence that HRW could significantly improve tolerances of CdCl2, NaCl and H2O2. Furthermore, pyruvate kinase was activated in the mycelia treated with HRW, along with its induced gene expression, suggesting that HRW treatment enhanced the glucose metabolism. Taken together, our findings suggested that the usage of HRW could be an effective approach for contaminant detoxification in H. marmoreus, which was similar with the effects of HRW in plants, and such effects could be also beneficial in entire agricultural system.",

To this end, L-arginine biosynthesis was derepressed by deletion of the arginine repressor gene argR and conversion of L-citrulline towards L-arginine was avoided by deletion of the argininosuccinate synthetase gene argG. Moreover, to facilitate L-citrulline production the gene encoding a feedback resistant N-acetyl L-glutamate kinase argB (fbr) as well as the gene encoding L-ornithine carbamoylphosphate transferase argF were overexpressed.

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the effects of a trehalolipid biosurfactant produced by Rhodococcus ruber IEGM 231 on the bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation on the surface of polystyrene microplates. The adhesion of Gram-positive (Arthrobacter simplex, Bacillus subtilis, Brevibacterium linens, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Micrococcus luteus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas fluorescencens) bacteria correlated differently with the cell hydrophobicity and surface charge. In particular, exponentially growing bacterial cells with increased hydrophobicities adhered stronger to polystyrene compared to more hydrophilic stationary phase cells. Also, a moderate correlation (0.56) was found between zeta potential and adhesion values of actively growing bacteria, suggesting that less negatively charged cells adhered stronger to polystyrene. Efficient biosurfactant concentrations (10-100 mg/L) were determined, which selectively inhibited (up to 76 %) the adhesion of tested bacterial cultures, however without inhibiting their growth. The biosurfactant was more active against growing bacteria rather than resting cells, thus showing high biofilm-preventing properties. Contact angle measurements revealed more hydrophilic surface of the biosurfactant-covered polystyrene compared to bare polystyrene, which allowed less adhesion of hydrophobic bacteria. Furthermore, surface free-energy calculations showed a decrease in the Wan der Waals (γ(LW)) component and an increase in the acid-based (γ(AB)) component caused by the biosurfactant coating of polysterene. However, our results suggested that the biosurfactant inhibited the adhesion of bacteria independently on their surface charges. AFM scanning revealed three-type biosurfactant structures (micelles, cord-like assemblies and large vesicles) formed on glass, depending on concentrations used, that could lead to diverse anti-adhesive effects against different bacterial species.",

    "abstract": "P-limitation in enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) systems fed with acetate, has generally been considered as a condition leading to enrichment of organisms of the genotype' Candidatus Competibacter phosphatis' expressing the glycogen-accumulating organisms (GAO) phenotype. Recent studies have demonstrated in short-term experiments that organisms of the genotype 'Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis' clade I and II, known to express the polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAO) phenotype can switch to the GAO phenotype when poly-P is absent, but are performing the HAc-uptake at lower kinetic rates, where clade I showed the lowest rates. The objective of this study was to verify whether organisms of the genotype 'Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis' can also be enriched under P-limiting conditions while expressing a GAO phenotype and more specifically to see which specific clade prevails. A sequencing batch reactor was inoculated with activated sludge to enrich an EBPR culture for a cultivation period of 128 days (16 times the solids retention time) under P-limiting conditions. A mixed culture was obtained comprising of 49 % 'Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis' clade II and 46 % 'Candidatus Competibacter phosphatis'. The culture performed a full GAO metabolism for anaerobic HAc-uptake, but was still able to switch to a PAO metabolism, taking up excessive amounts of phosphate during the aerobic phase when it became available in the influent. These findings show that P-limitation, often used as strategy for enrichment of 'Candidatus Competibacter phosphatis', does not always lead to enrichment of only 'Candidatus Competibacter phosphatis'. Furthermore, it demonstrates that 'Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis' are able to proliferate in activated sludge systems for periods of up to 128 days or longer when the influent phosphate concentrations are just enough for assimilation purposes and no poly-P is formed. The 'Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis' retain the ability to switch to the PAO phenotype, taking up phosphate from the influent as soon as it becomes available.",

The neutral protease from Aspergillus oryzae Y1 was purified using ammonium sulphate precipitation and DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow chromatography, which resulted in a 10.0-fold increase in the specific activity (2264.3 U/mg) and a recovery rate of 21%. The estimated molecular mass of the purified protease was approximately 45 kDa. The optimal pH and temperature of the purified protease were 7.0 and 55 °C, respectively. The heat resistance of the purified protease was significantly higher than the commercial protease. The effect of metal ions on the activity of the purified protease approximated that of commercial neutral protease. Furthermore, the maximum hydrolysis rate (Vmax) and apparent Michaelis–Menten constant (Km) values of the purified protease were 256.4103 μg/mL min and 20.0769 mg/mL, respectively. The purified protease had a higher affinity for the substrate than the commercial neutral protease.

The effects of PGPR in promoting plant growth, activating soil nutrients, reducing fertilizer application, and improving the resistance of plant inducible system have been widely investigated. However, few studies have investigated PGPR as elicitors of tolerance to abiotic stresses, especially drought stress. In this study, the effects of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus X128 on the photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs), intracellular CO2 concentration (Ci), and total chlorophyll content [Chl(a+b)] of Sambucus williamsii Hance seedling leaves under moderate drought stress and drought-rewatering conditions were determined. Compared with those of uninoculated seedlings, the average Pn values during the entire drought stress of inoculated seedlings increased by 12.99%. As the drought duration was lengthened, Ci of uninoculated leaves continued to increase after rapidly declining, whereas Gs continuously decreased. Furthermore, their photosynthetic properties were simultaneously restricted by stomatal and non-stomatal factors. After X128 inoculation, Ci and Gs of S. williamsii Hance leaves continued to decrease, and their photosynthetic properties were mainly restricted by stomatal factors. At the end of the drought stress, water stress reduced [Chl(a + b)] of S. williamsii Hance leaves by 13.49%. However, X128 inoculation decreased this deficit to only 7.39%. After water supply was recovered, Pn, Gs, and [Chl(a+b)] in uninoculated leaves were reduced by 14.23%, 12.02%, and 5.86%, respectively, relative to those under well-watered conditions. However, Ci increased by 6.48%. Compared with those of uninoculated seedlings, Pn, Gs, and [Chl(a+b)] in X128-inoculated seedlings were increased by 9.83%, 9.30%, and 6.85%, respectively. Therefore, the inoculation of X128 under arid environments can mitigate the reduction of chlorophyll, delay the restriction caused by non-stomatal factors to Pn in plant leaves under water stress, and can be more conducive to the recovery of photosynthetic functions of leaves after water supply is recovered.",

Encased in extracellular polymeric substances, pathogens within biofilms are significantly more resistant to chlorine and other disinfectants. Recent studies suggest that compounds capable of manipulating nitric oxide-mediated signaling in bacteria could induce dispersal of sessile bacteria and provide a foundation for novel approaches to controlling biofilms formed by some microorganisms. In this work, we compared the ability of five nitric oxide donors (molsidomine, MAHMA NONOate, diethylamine NONOate, diethylamine NONOate diethylammonium salt, spermine NONOate) to dislodge biofilms formed by non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica and pathogenic E. coli on plastic and stainless steel surfaces at different temperatures. All five nitric oxide donors induced significant (35-80%) dispersal of biofilms, however, the degree of dispersal and the optimal dispersal conditions varied. MAHMA NONOate and molsidomine were strong dispersants of the Salmonella biofilms formed on polystyrene. Importantly, molsidomine induced dispersal of up to 50% of the pre-formed Salmonella biofilm at 4°C, suggesting that it could be effective even under refrigerated conditions. Biofilms formed by E. coli O157:H7 were also significantly dispersed. Nitric oxide donor molecules were highly active within 6 hours of application. To better understand mode of action of these compounds, we identified Salmonella genomic region recA-hydN, deletion of which led to an insensitivity to the nitric oxide donors.",

Steady-state kinetic studies revealed that rAaBGL1 showed high catalytic efficiency towards β-linked glucooligosaccharides.

This result suggested that there were different formation for subsites in the catalytic cleft of AaBGL1 between β-1,3 and β-1,4 glucooligosaccharides, therefore rAaBGL1 preferred short chain of laminarioligosaccharides and long chain of cellooligosaccharides on hydrolysis. rAaBGL1 was more insensitive to glucose inhibition and more efficient to hydrolyze the one of major transglycosylation product, gentiobiose than AnBGL, resulting that rAaBGL1 completely hydrolyzed 5% cellobiose to glucose faster than AnBGL.

Quantitative analysis of the lipopeptides iturin and surfactin and their homologues produced by Bacillus natto NT-6 subjected to different culture media, shaking speed of rotary shaker, and liquid and solid fermentation methods was conducted using LC-MS. For iturins, liquid-state fermentation in Landy medium at a shaking speed of 160 r min-1 was the most suitable for maximal homologue production. Addition of 0.4% attapulgite powder increased production by 1.92-fold; activated carbon significantly reduced production. For surfactin homologues, solid-state fermentation in potato dextrose broth medium at shaking speed > 160 r min-1 was the best. Addition of 0.4% attapulgite powder increased production by 1.96-fold; activated carbon had no effect. Thus it is clear that fermentation conditions can be manipulated to maximize iturin and surfactin production.",

    "abstract": "Ferulic acid (4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid, FA) is a lignin-derived phenolic compound abundant in plant biomass. The utilization of FA and its conversion to valuable compounds is desired. Protocatechuic acid (3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, PCA) is a precursor of polymers and plastics and a constituent of food. A microbial conversion system to produce PCA from FA was developed in this study using a PCA-producing strain of Corynebacterium glutamicum F (ATCC 21420). C. glutamicum strain F grown at 30 °C for 48 h utilized 2 mM each of FA and vanillic acid (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoic acid, VA) to produce PCA, which was secreted into the medium. FA may be catabolized by C. glutamicum through proposed (I) non-β-oxidative, CoA-dependent or (II) β-oxidative, CoA-dependent phenylpropanoid pathways. The conversion of VA to PCA is the last step in each pathway. Therefore, the vanillate O-demethylase gene (vanAB) from Corynebacterium efficiens NBRC 100395 was expressed in C. glutamicum F (designated strain FVan) cultured at 30 °C in AF medium containing FA. Strain C. glutamicum FVan converted 4.57 ± 0.07 mM of FA into 2.87 ± 0.01 mM PCA after 48 h with yields of 62.8% (mol/mol), and 6.91 mM (1064 mg/L) of PCA was produced from 16.0 mM of FA after 12 h of fed-batch biotransformation. Genomic analysis of C. glutamicum ATCC 21420 revealed that the PCA-utilization genes (pca cluster) were conserved in strain ATCC 21420 and that mutations were present in the PCA importer gene pcaK.",

However, little is known on the possible legacy effects on soil microbial community composition with continuous fumigation over different years. In this report, we used high throughput Illumina sequencing and Biolog ECO microplates to determine the bacterial community and microbial metabolic activity in ginger harvest fields of non-fumigation (NF), chloropicrin-fumigation for 1 year (F_1) and continuous chloropicrin-fumigation for 3 years (F_3). The results showed that microbial richness and diversity in F_3 were the lowest, while the metabolic activity had no significant difference. With the increase of fumigation years, the incidence of bacterial wilt was decreased, the relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Saccharibacteria were gradually increased. Using LEfSe analyses, we found that Saccharibacteria was the most prominent biomarker in F_3. Eight genera associated with antibiotic production in F_3 were screened out, of which seven belonged to Actinobacteria, and one belonged to Bacteroidetes. The study indicated that with the increase of fumigation years, soil antibacterial capacity may be increased (possible reason for reduced the incidence of bacterial wilt), and Saccharibacteria played a potential role in evaluating the biological effects of continuous fumigation.",

Fresh culture of E. faecium SROD at different inclusion rates (0, 0.1%, 0.5%, and 1.0%) were investigated using in vitro rumen fermentation system. Addition of E. faecium SROD had a significant effect on total gas production with the greatest effect observed with 0.1% supplementation; however, there was no significant influence on pH. Supplementation of 0.1% E. faecium SROD resulted in the highest propionate (P = 0.005) but the lowest methane concentration (P = 0.001). In addition, acetate, butyrate, and total VFA concentrations in treatments were comparatively higher than control. Bioinformatics analysis revealed the predominance of the bacterial phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes and the archaeal phylum Euryarchaeota. At the genus level, Prevotella (15–17%) and Methanobrevibacter (96%) dominated the bacterial and archaeal communities of the in vitro rumen fermenta, respectively.

Pichia pastoris, Pp), Hansenula polymorpha (Hp), Candida boidinii (Cb) and Pichia methanolica (Pm) are widely used protein production platforms. Typically, strong, tightly regulated promoters of genes coding for their methanol utilization (MUT) pathways are used to drive heterologous gene expression. Despite highly similar open reading frames in the MUT pathways of the four yeasts, the regulation of the respective promoters varies strongly between species. While most endogenous Pp MUT promoters remain tightly repressed after depletion of a repressing carbon, Hp, Cb and Pm MUT promoters are derepressed to up to 70% of methanol induced levels, enabling methanol free production processes in their respective host background. Here, we have tested a series of orthologous promoters from Hp, Cb and Pm in Pp. Unexpectedly, when induced with methanol, the promoter of the HpMOX gene reached very similar expression levels as the strong methanol, inducible, and most frequently used promoter of the Pp alcohol oxidase 1 gene (PPpAOX1). The HpFMD promoter even surpassed PPpAOX1 up to three-fold, when induced with methanol, and reached under methanol-free/derepressed conditions similar expression as the methanol induced PPpAOX1. These results demonstrate that orthologous promoters from related yeast species can give access to otherwise unobtainable regulatory profiles and may even considerably surpass endogenous promoters in P. pastoris.",

A high-efficiency PSB strain from the pine tree rhizosphere, Burkholderia multivorans WS-FJ9, was screened in our laboratory. In this study, using a Bio Screener fully automatic microbial growth curve meter to determine the growth of the WS-FJ9 strain in phosphate-removing medium, the growth and mineral phosphate solubilization of WS-FJ9 were measured by Mo-Sb colorimetry and organophosphate-solubilization plate assays. Second-generation sequencing technology was used to obtain genomic information and to analyze possible phosphate decomposition genes. The related expression levels of these genes under different soluble phosphate levels were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. The results showed that WS-FJ9 had strong adaptability and capacity for mineral phosphate solubilization at low soluble phosphate levels, which is characterized by its low soluble phosphate induction and high soluble phosphate inhibition. The amount of solubilized mineral phosphate could exceed 140 mg/L. The total length of the WS-FJ9 genome was 7,497,552 bp after splicing, and the GC content was 67.37%. Eight phosphate-related genes were selected to determine their expression patterns at different soluble phosphate levels. Among them, AP - 2 , GspE and GspF were only related to organic phosphate, HlyB was only related to inorganic phosphate, and PhoR , PhoA , AP - 1 and AP - 3 were related to both. The WS-FJ9 strain utilizes multiple pathways for mineral phosphate solubilization, and the solubilization processes of different phosphate sources are interrelated and independent, indicating that the WS-FJ9 strain can adapt to different phosphate source environments and has good potential for future applications.",

In the present study, Trichoderma asperellum (T. asperellum) M45a was shown to be an effective biocontrol agent against FW. In a pot experiment, the application of 105 cfu/g of T. asperellum M45a granules had an improved control effect on FW during the blooming period (up to 67.44%) in soils subjected to five years of continuous cropping with watermelon, while the average length of watermelon vines was also significantly improved (P < 0.05). Additionally, the acid phosphatase (ACP), cellulase (CL), catalase (CAT), and sucrase (SC) activities in the M45a-inoculation group were significantly higher than those in the control (CK) group, and transformation of the soil nutrients (total N, NO3-N, and available P) was significantly increased. Moreover, T. asperellum M45a inoculation reduced fungal diversity, increased bacterial diversity and especially enhanced the relative abundance of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), such as Trichoderma, Sphingomonas, Pseudomonas, Actinomadura, and Rhodanobacter. Through functional prediction, the relative abundance of ectomycorrhiza, endophytes, animal pathotrophs, and saprotrophs in the fungal community was determined to be significantly lower than that observed in the M45a-treated soil. Correlation analysis revealed that Sphingomonas, Pseudomonas, and Trichoderma had the most differences in terms of microorganism abundance, and these differences were positively correlated with ACP, CL, CAT, and SC. These findings provide guidance for the use of fungicides to achieve microecological control of FW in continuously cropped watermelon plots.",

Nearly 200 papers have been published that use CV026 as an indicator for quorum sensing activity in many Gram negative bacteria, but the inability of C. violaceum strains to complement the quorum sensing mutation in CV026 has called the taxonomic placement of the parent strain into question.

All the three substrates supported growth and PHB production by C. necator, with polymer accumulation ranging from 9 to 84 % cell dry weight (cdw), depending on the carbon source. To help understand these differences, proteomic analysis indicated that although C. necator H16 was able to accumulate PHB during growth on all three biodiesel by-products, no changes in the levels of PHB synthesis enzymes were observed. However, significant changes in the levels of expression were observed for two Phasin proteins involved with PHB accumulation, and for a number of gene products in the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway, the Glyoxylate Shunt, and the hydrogen (H2) synthesis pathways in C. necator cells cultured with different substrates. The glycerol transport protein (GlpF) was induced in REG-GB and REG-80 glycerol cultures only. Cupriavidus necator cells cultured with REG-GB and REG-FFA showed up-regulation of β-oxidation and Glyoxylate Shunt pathways proteins at 24 h pi, but H2 synthesis pathways enzymes were significantly down-regulated, compared with cells cultured with waste glycerol. Our data confirmed earlier observations of constitutive expression of PHB synthesis proteins, but further suggested that C. necator H16 cells growing on biodiesel-derived glycerol were under oxidative stress.",

Bioinformatic analyses revealed an open reading frame of 1551 bp corresponding to a primary translation product of 516 amino acids. The DyP-type peroxidase was heterologously produced in Trichoderma reesei with an activity of 55,000 U L-1. The enzyme was purified from the culture supernatant, biochemically characterized and the kinetic parameters were determined. The enzyme has an N-terminal signal peptide composed of 62 amino acids. Analysis by Blue Native PAGE and activity staining with ABTS, as well as gel filtration chromatography showed the native dimeric state of the enzyme (115 kDa). Analysis of the substrate range revealed that the recombinant enzyme catalyzes, in addition to the conversion of some classic peroxidase substrates such as 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylthiazoline-6-sulfonate) and substituted phenols like 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, also the decolorization of the anthraquinonic dye Reactive Blue 5. The enzyme also catalyzes bleaching of natural colorants such as β-carotene and annatto. Surprisingly, β-carotene was transformed in the presence and absence of H2O2 by rPsaDyP, however enzyme activity was increased by the addition of H2O2. This indicates that the rPsaDyP has an oxidase function in addition to a peroxidase activity. As a consequence of the high affinity to the characteristic substrate Reactive Blue 5 the rPsaDyP belongs functionally to the dyp-type peroxidase family.",

In addition, brain heart infusion (BHI) promoted (p < 0.05) the growth of Bacteroidetes, especially Bacteroides after 48 h, GMM resulted in a significant increase (p < 0.05) in Actinobacteria and increased the beneficial genus Bifidobacterium, fastidious anaerobe broth (FAB) increased Firmicutes population, and BGM promoted the growth of Escherichia-Shigella and Akkermansia. The results suggest that four media had different effects on the human intestinal microbiota metabolism and composition in vitro. These results may facilitate the culture of bacteria from the human intestinal microbiota.",

In this study, antibacterial potential of Jatropha curcas crude seed extracts, seed oil, commercially available antibiotics, and their combinations were investigated for their synergistic effect against clinical, MDR and ATCC bacterial strains by agar well diffusion assay. Methanolic extracts remained more active against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC), with zone of inhibition (ZOI) of 21 mm, than clinical and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains (ZOI range ~ 15.0-17.0 mm). Molecular docking demonstrated that beta-monolaurin from methanolic extract exhibited greater affinity conformation for UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-tripeptide-D-alanyl-D-alanine (MurF) ligase's active pocket with binding energy of -7.3 kcal/mol. Moxifloxacin exhibited greater activity against Escherichia coli (ATCC) (ZOI ~ 50.0 mm), followed by ofloxacin against Pseudomonas chlororaphis (47.3 mm), moxifloxacin against P. monteilii (47 mm), P. aeruginosa (46.3 mm) and MRSA2 (46 mm) and ofloxacin against S. aureus (ATCC) strains (45.7 mm). Methanolic extract in combination with rifampicin showed the highest synergism against MRSA strains, A. baumannii, E. coli, E. faecalis, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii (MDR strain), P. chlororaphis, E. coli ATCC25922 and S. aureus ATCC25923. In combinations, moxifloxacin exhibited the highest antagonism. The methanolic, n-hexane, aqueous extracts and seed oil in various combinations with antibiotics showed 44.71, 32.94, 9.41 and 25.88% synergism, respectively.

    "abstract": "Drug-resistant bacteria are a serious threat to global public health. Gram-positive bacterial endolysin preparations have been successfully used to fight Gram-positive bacteria as a novel antimicrobial replacement strategy. However, Gram-negative bacterial phage endolysins cannot be applied directly to destroy Gram-negative strains due to the externally inaccessible peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall; this has seriously hampered the development of endolysin-like antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria. In this study, 3-12 hydrophobic amino acids were successively added to the C-terminus of Escherichia coli phage endolysin Lysep3 to create five different hydrophobic-modified endolysins. Compared with endogenous Lysep3, endolysins modified with hydrophobic amino acids surprisingly could kill E. coli from outside of the cell at the appropriate pH and endolysin concentration. The lysis ability of modified endolysins were enhanced with increasing numbers of hydrophobic amino acids at the C-terminus of endolysin. Thus, these findings demonstrate that the enhancement of hydrophobicity at the C-terminus enables the endolysin to act upon E. coli from the outside, representing a novel method of lysing Gram-negative antibiotic-resistant bacteria.",

The isolate was an obligate oligotrophic bacterium, Hymenobacter latericoloratus CGMCC 16346, which degraded imidacloprid via hydroxylation by co-metabolism in pure culture. Resting cells degraded 64.4% of 100 mg/L imidacloprid in 6 days in the presence of co-substrate maltose, and growing culture degraded 40.8% of imidacloprid in 10 days. H. latericoloratus CGMCC 16346 degraded imidacloprid in surface water without co-substrate supplementation and retained imidacloprid-degrading activity after 30 days. The half-life of imidacloprid in surface water was decreased from 173.3 days in the control to 57.8 days by CGMCC 16346 inoculation. Genome sequencing and COG analysis indicated that carbohydrate metabolism and transport, cell wall/membrane biogenesis, and defense mechanisms are enriched in H. latericoloratus CGMCC 16346 compared with the copiotrophic imidacloprid-degrading Pseudoxanthomonas indica CGMCC 6648, indicating that H. latericoloratus CGMCC 16346 is adapted to live in oligotrophic water environments and biofilms. H. latericoloratus CGMCC 16346 is a promising bioremediation agent for elimination of imidacloprid contamination from surface water.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins that play vital roles in many biological processes. In this study, lectins from three Egyptian cultivars (fava bean, lentil, and pea) were isolated by precipitation with different concentrations of ammonium sulfate. The purification process was performed by affinity chromatography using mannose agarose. The highest concentration of purified lectins (1.48 mg/g) was recorded in pea at 90% saturation. SDS-PAGE of the purified lectins revealed bands of low molecular weights (14 to 18 kDa). The complete amino acid sequences of purified lectins were assessed using mass spectrometry (MS), which indicated the presence of the peptides favin, p54, and psl in fava bean, lentil, and pea, respectively. The lectins showed antimicrobial activity. The highest inhibition zone (35 mm) was measured with lectin purified from lentil against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, followed by pea lectin (33.4 mm) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145. To the best of our knowledge, the legume lectins in this study are the first lectins to exhibit antifungal activity against Candida albicans , with the maximum inhibition zone (25.1 mm) observed with purified lectins of fava bean. Additionally, the first scanning electron microscope (SEM) images showing agglutination and clumping of microbial cells exposed to tested lectins are provided. These findings proved that Egyptian legume lectins are distinct from other lectins reported in previous studies and demonstrated their potential as antimicrobial agents against human pathogenic microorganisms.",

Recent research demonstrated that disruption of the alkaline phosphatase gene, PHO13, enhances ethanol production from xylose by a strain expressing the xylose reductase (XR) and xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) genes; however, the yield of ethanol is poor. In this study, PHO13 was disrupted in a recombinant strain harboring multiple copies of the xylose isomerase (XI) gene derived from Orpinomyces sp., coupled with overexpression of the endogenous xylulokinase (XK) gene and disruption of GRE3, which encodes aldose reductase. The resulting YΔGP/XK/XI strain consumed 2.08 g/L/h of xylose and produced 0.88 g/L/h of volumetric ethanol, for an 86.8 % theoretical ethanol yield, and only YΔGP/XK/XI demonstrated increase in cell concentration. Transcriptome analysis indicated that expression of genes involved in the pentose phosphate pathway (GND1, SOL3, TAL1, RKI1, and TKL1) and TCA cycle and respiratory chain (NDE1, ACO1, ACO2, SDH2, IDH1, IDH2, ATP7, ATP19, SDH4, SDH3, CMC2, and ATP15) was upregulated in the YΔGP/XK/XI strain.

All over the world attempts are being made to exploit these microbes for their biotechnological potential to produce, bioactive compounds and antimicrobial peptides. However, the majority of the studies are focussed on the marine sponges and studies on the freshwater sponges have been neglected so far. To increase our understanding of the microbial community structure of freshwater sponges, microbiota of two fresh water sponges namely, Eunapius carteri and Corvospongilla lapidosa is explored for the first time using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology. Overall the microbial composition of these sponges comprises of 14 phyla and on an average, more than 2900 OTUs were obtained from C. lapidosa while E. carteri showed 980 OTUs which is higher than OTUs obtained in the marine sponges. Thus, our study showed that, fresh water sponges also posses highly diverse microbial community than previously thought and it is distinct from the marine sponge microbiota. The present study also revealed that microbial community structure of both the sponges is significantly different from each other and their respective water samples. In the present study, we have detected many bacterial lineages belonging to Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, etc. that are known to produce compounds of biotechnological importance. Overall, this study gives insight into the microbial composition of the freshwater sponges which is highly diverse and needs to be studied further to exploit their biotechnological capabilities.",

We initially explored the mechanism by which the Methanogen 166 strain facilitates caproic acid accumulation, revealing its ability to convert accumulated H2 that is produced by C. kluyveri H068 into methane, thereby eliminating the hydrogen-mediated feedback inhibition that normally constrains C. kluyveri H068 and thus enhancing caproic acid production. In addition, laboratory experiments were conducted to optimize this binary fermentation system, allowing us to determine that the optimum conditions for caproic acid production are a mixed inoculum size of 10% with a C. kluyveri H588/Methanogen 166 inoculation ratio of 2:1 (v/v), a sodium acetate concentration of 20 g/L, a 4% ethanol content (v/v), and a yeast extract concentration of 10 g/L. We further scaled this optimized condition up to use in a 1000 L fermenter and the obtained caproic acid broth was subjected to pit-entry fermentation. Our results demonstrated that this pit-entry fermentation approach was an efficient means of improving the quality of Chinese strong flavor liquor.",

The present study aimed at investigating the antimicrobial activity of Origanum vulgare (OV) essential oil (EO) through illustrating its biostatic, biocidal and the dynamics of the biocidal activity against 11 different microorganisms. GC/MS of OV EO allowed the identification of 32 compounds representing 99.94% of the oil. The two major identified compounds were terpinen-4-ol (38.35%) and trans-sabinene hydrate (10.06%). Different methods were employed to illustrate the biostatic activity of OV EO. Results of the biostatic studies on OV EO using agar and broth dilution methods showed that Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) was the most sensitive organism; with a Minimum inhibitor concentration (MIC) 1.18 mg/ml. Agar diffusion method showed that the highest activity was observed against Bordetella bronchiseptica (Br. bronchiseptica), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae), Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilus) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) with inhibition zones 38 ± 1.5, 29.5 ± 0.8, 26.9 ± 0.9 and 26.9 ± 1.1 mm, respectively. Studying the dynamics of 1% v/v OV essential oil emulsion over a period of 6 h revealed that Escherichia coli (E. coli), B. subtilis, S. epidermidis and S. cerevisiae had the fastest response. Also increasing concentrations of OV oil emulsion increased the rate of cell killing and the duration of growth lag phase increased correspondingly. These data indicated that OV EO produces a concentration and time-dependent antimicrobial activity.",

To investigate the fruiting body formation mechanisms, we sequenced the transcriptomes of Morchella importuna at the mycelial and young fruiting body stages. Among the 12,561 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 9215 were upregulated, and 3346 were downregulated. DEG enrichment analysis showed that these genes were enriched in the \"generation of precursor metabolites and energy\", \"carbohydrate catabolic process\", and \"oxidoreductase activity\" Gene Ontology (GO) functional categories. Enzyme activity assay results indicated that the activity levels of CAZymes (carbohydrate-active enzymes), oxidoreductases (SOD (superoxide dismutase), CAT (catalase)) and mitochondrial complex (complex I, II, III) proteins were significantly increased from the mycelial stage to the young fruiting body stage. In addition, the genes encoding CAZymes, mitochondrial proteins, oxidoreductases and heat shock proteins had higher expression levels in the young fruiting body stage than in the mycelial stage, and the qRT-PCR results showed similar trends to the RNA-Seq results. In summary, these results suggest that carbohydrate catabolism and energy metabolism are significantly enhanced in the young fruiting body stage and that growth environment temperature changes affect the formation of fruiting bodies.",

Although blue-light treatment has been applied for the production of oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus), the blue-light response mechanisms of P. ostreatus still remain unclear. In the present study, we exposed the primordium of P. ostreatus to blue-light, red-light, and dark conditions for 7 days. Subsequently, comparative transcriptomics analysis of the stipe, pileus, and gill under the three light conditions was performed to reveal the gene expression response mechanism of P. ostreatus to blue light and red light. The results showed that blue light enhanced the growth and development of all the three organs of P. ostreatus, especially the pileus. In contrast, red light slightly (non-significantly) inhibited pileus growth. When compared with red-light and dark treatments, blue-light treatment significantly upregulated gene expression involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, the pentose phosphate pathway and the peroxisome in the pileus, but not in the gill or stipe. Most of the glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway genes were upregulated in the pileus by blue light. When compared with dark treatment, red-light treatment downregulated the expression of many respiration metabolism genes in the pileus. These results revealed that blue light enhanced the activation of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, whereas red light weakened glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway activation. The conclusion can be drawn that blue light improved P. ostreatus fruiting body (particularly, the pileus) growth rate via enhancement of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to investigate the impact of culture pH (4.5-6.5) and temperature (32-37 °C) on the stress resilience of Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 during freeze-drying and post freeze-drying exposure to low pH (pH 2) and bile salts. Response-surface methodology analysis revealed that freeze-drying survival rates [Formula: see text] were linearly related to pH with the highest survival rate of 80% when cells were cultured at pH 6.5 and the lowest was 40% when cells were cultured at pH 4.5. The analysis further revealed that within the chosen temperature range the culture temperature did not significantly affect the freeze-drying survival rate. However, fermentation at pH 4.5 led to better survival rates when rehydrated cells were exposed to low pH shock or bile salts. Thus, the effect of pH on freeze-drying survival was in contrast to effects on low pH and bile salts stress tolerance. The rationale behind this irreconcilability is based on the responses being dissimilar and are not tuned to each other. Culturing strain DSM 17938 at pH values higher than 5.5 could be a useful option to improve the survivability and increase viable cell numbers in the final freeze-dried product. However, the dissimilar responses for the process- and application parameters tested here suggest that an optimal compromise has to be found in order to obtain the most functional probiotic product possible.",

In this study, we have designed the CD59sp-conjugated miRNA-1284/cisplatin(CDDP)-loaded liposomes for the enhanced therapeutic effect against cervical cancers. Compared with miRNA-1284/CDDP-loaded liposomes (LP-miCDDP), CD59 antibody-conjugated LP-miCDDP (CD/LP-miCDDP) showed a significantly higher cytotoxicity in HeLa cells. Notably, MiR-1284 showed a typical concentration-dependent cell killing effect in the cervical cancer cells owing to the downregulation of HMGB1. Flow cytometer analysis showed that CD/LP-miCDDP resulted in maximum apoptosis effect (~ 60%) compared to CDDP (~ 20%) or miR-1284 (~ 12%) treated cells indicating the superior anticancer effect in the cancer cells. Importantly, CD/LP-miCDDP significantly prolonged the blood circulation of encapsulated drug in rats with AUC (o-t) of CD/LP-miCDDP showed a 6.9 fold higher value than that of free CDDP. Similarly, CD/LP-miCDDP showed an eightfold decrease in the clearance (CL) and 3.6-fold higher t 1/2 compared to that of free CDDP. Overall, results demonstrated that targeted and synergistic co-delivery of therapeutic components could be promising in cervical cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) produced by the microorganisms provides protection and stability to them when they are encased within biofilms. Heterogeneous polysaccharides form a major constituent of the EPS and are crucial for the formation and integrity of the biofilms / slime. Thus, breakdown of polysaccharides might help in dispersion of biofilms from abiotic surfaces. In the present study we isolated a fungus, Aspergillus niger APS, capable of concurrently producing a cocktail of carbohydrases and optimized the conditions for higher yields of all the enzymes by one variable at a time (OVAT) approach. The optimization studies resulted in 1.5 to 12 fold augmentation in the enzyme yields using biodegradable waste. Further, keeping in view the heterogeneous nature of polysaccharides in biofilm matrix, the in-house produced enzyme cocktail was used for the dispersal of biofilms formed by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus . Treatment with enzyme preparation caused 90.23 ± 4.0, 82.64 ± 5.0 and 76.32 ± 5.0% reduction of the biofilms formed by these organisms respectively which was also evidenced by Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) revealing the loss of biofilm architecture. Interestingly, the enzyme cocktail could also remove viscous slime formed under natural conditions in the kitchen drainage pipe (KDP). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on biotreatment of abiotic surfaces for removal of biofilms/slime formed under natural conditions. The study thus indicates the prospects of using multiple carbohydrases as an anti-biofouling agent on abiotic surfaces like equipments as well as implants/prostheses and pipelines.",

Its effects have been assessed on laying performance, egg quality, antioxidant and immunological status, and intestinal microbiota, and are compared to the control group, to the Astragalus group containing 3‰ unfermented Astragalus, and to the L. plantarum group containing 2% L. plantarum [5 × 108 colony-forming unit (CFU) per milliliter (mL)]. During the second half of the experimental period (15 to 28 days), the egg production rate was considerably higher in the fermented Astragalus group than that in the other groups, with the fermented Astragalus group having the lowest feed conversion ratio. No significant difference (P > 0.05) was noted among treatments on egg quality. Fermented Astragalus-treated hens exhibited significantly increased catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in serum, and reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) in serum. Furthermore, fermented Astragalus supplementation resulted in a significant increase in ileal microbiota abundance relative to control. In conclusion, feeding laying hens with L. plantarum fermented Astragalus has beneficial effects on production, antioxidant potential, immunity, and ileal microbiota. L. plantarum fermented Astragalus is expected to be a novel feed additive used in poultry production.",

Here we conducted a high-throughput screening of isolates recovered from 886 plant rhizosphere samples taken from the three main cotton-producing areas of China. Fifteen isolates distributed in different genera of bacteria that showed inhibitory activity against V. dahliae were screened out. Of these, two Pseudomonas strains, P. protegens XY2F4 and P. donghuensis 22G5, showed significant inhibitory action against V. dahliae . Additional comparative genomic analyses and phenotypical assays confirmed that P. protegens XY2F4 and P. donghuensis 22G5 were the strains most efficient at protecting cotton plants against VW due to specific biological control products they produced. Importantly, we identified a significant efficacy of the natural tropolone compound 7-hydroxytropolone (7-HT) against VW. By phenotypical assay using the wild-type 22G5 and its mutant strain in 7-HT production, we revealed that the 7-HT produced by P. donghuensis is the major substance protecting cotton against VW. This study reveals that Pseudomonas specifically has gene clusters that allow the production of effective antipathogenic metabolites that can now be used as new agents in the biocontrol of VW.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Human oral microbes play a vital role maintaining host metabolic homeostasis. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is mainly characterized by a high altitude, dry, cold, and hypoxic environment. The oral microbiota is subject to selective pressure from the plateau environment, which affects oral health. Only a few studies have focused on the characteristics of oral microbiota in high-altitude humans. We collected saliva samples from 167 Tibetans at four altitudes (2800 to 4500 m) in Tibet to explore the relationship between the high altitude environment and oral microbiota. We conducted a two (high- and ultra-high-altitude) group analysis based on altitude, and adopted the 16S rRNA strategy for high-throughput sequencing. The results show that the alpha diversity of the oral microbiota decreased with altitude, whereas beta diversity increased with altitude. A LEfSe analysis revealed that the oral microbial biomarker of the high-altitude group (&lt; 3650 m) was Streptococcus , and the biomarker of the ultra-high-altitude group (&gt; 4000 m) was Prevotella . The relative abundance of Prevotella increased with altitude, whereas the relative abundance of Streptococcus decreased with altitude. A network analysis showed that the microbial network structure was more compact and complex, and the interaction between the bacterial genera was more intense in the high altitude group. Gene function prediction results showed that the amino acid and vitamin metabolic pathways were upregulated in the ultra-high-altitude group. These result show that altitude is an important factor affecting the diversity and community structure of the human oral microbiota.",

Bioremediation is one such approach, but is dependent on the availability of microorganisms with the necessary metabolic abilities and environmental adaptability. The aim of this study was to examine the microbial community in a petroleum contaminated site, and isolate organisms potentially able to degrade hydrocarbons. Through successive enrichment of soil microorganisms from samples of an historic petroleum contaminated site in Wietze, Germany, we isolated a bacterial consortium using diesel fuel hydrocarbons as sole carbon and energy source. The 16S rRNA gene analysis revealed the dominance of Alphaproteobacteria. We further reconstructed a total of 18 genomes from both the original soil sample and the isolated consortium. The analysis of both the metagenome of the consortium and the reconstructed metagenome-assembled genomes show that the most abundant bacterial genus in the consortium, Acidocella, possess many of the genes required for the degradation of diesel fuel aromatic hydrocarbons, which are often the most toxic component. This can explain why this genus proliferated in all the enrichment cultures. Therefore, this study reveals that the microbial consortium isolated in this study and its dominant genus, Acidocella, could potentially serve as an effective inoculum for the bioremediation of sites polluted with diesel fuel or other organic contaminants.",

The Rh-PLGA-NPs@NH 4 are prepared along with Rh-PLGA-NPs as a control by double emulsion method. Rh-PLGA-NPs@NH 4 was characterized for their size, shape, morphology and encapsulation efficiency (EE). The effect of pH on release of Rh from Rh-PLGA-NPs@NH 4 was studied at different pH. Further, the cytotoxicity effect of Rh-PLGA-NPs@NH 4 on THP-1 cells were evaluated. Anti-inflammatory efficacy was evaluated on LPS stimulated THP-1 cells and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines was evaluated and compared with control. The size of Rh-PLGA-NPs@NH 4 and Rh-PLGA-NPs was found to be 190.7 ± 1.2 nm and 134.6 ± 2.4 nm respectively with poly dispersity (PDI) 0.14 and 0.15.

Rh-PLGA-NPs@NH 4 release the Rh more effectively in the low pH of synovial fluid environment (SFE). Rh-PLGA-NPs@NH 4 also significantly affect inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β and reduced their release in LPS stimulated THP-1 cells. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), a mediator responsible for the cartilage collapse was also found to be reduced.

NE is caused by Clostridium perfringens , a pathogenic bacterium, and normal resident of the intestinal microflora of healthy broiler chickens. Gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of broiler chicken is considered as the most integral part of pathogen’s entrance, their production and disease prevention. Interaction between C. perfringens and other pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella present in the small intestine may contribute to the development of NE in broiler chickens. The antibiotic therapy was used to treat the NE; however European Union has imposed a strict ban due to the negative implications of drug resistance. Moreover, antibiotic growth promoters cause adverse effects on human health as results of withdrawal of antibiotic residues in the chicken meat. After restriction on use of antibiotics, numerous studies have been carried out to investigate the alternatives to antibiotics for controlling NE. Thus, possible alternatives to prevent NE are bio-therapeutic agents (Probiotics), prebiotics, organic acids and essential oils which help in nutrients digestion, immunity enhancement and overall broiler performance. Recently, probiotics are extensively used alternatives to antibiotics for improving host health status and making them efficient in production. The aim of review is to describe a replacement to antibiotics by using different microbial strains as probiotics such as bacteria and yeasts etc. having bacteriostatic properties which inhibit growth of pathogens and neutralize the toxins by different modes of action.",

This study aimed to describe the inhibitory activity of cell-free supernatants (CFS), planktonic cells, and biofilm form of lactobacilus strains (L. rhamnosus and L. plantarum) against food pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Listeria monocytogenes. Anti-bacterial activities of the CFS of lactobacillus strains were assessed by the microplate method and via violet staining. Evaluation of the antagonistic activity of planktonic cells and biofilm of LAB were performed by the spread plate method. The results showed the incubation time of 48 h was the best time to produce biofilm. Although the planktonic states reduce the pathogens bacterial about 1 -1.5 log, but in biofilm forms, decreased L. monocytogenes about 4.5 log compared to the control, and in the case of P. aeruginosa, a growth reduction of about 2.13 log was observed. Furthermore, biofilm formation of L. monocytogenes in the presence of L. rhamnosus cell-free supernatant was more weakly than L. plantarum CFS, but their CFS effect on reducing the bacterial population of P. aeruginosa was the same. According to the study, biofilm produced by probiotic strains can be considered a new approach for biological control. Also, cell-free supernatant can be used as postbiotic in the food and pharmaceutical industries.",

There are still many challenges for treatment using traditional antibiotics. In this study, a mutant peptide of innate defense regulator (IDR-)1018 named 1018M was designed based on molecular docking and amino acid substitution technology. The antibacterial/biofilm activity and mechanisms against MRSA of 1018M were investigated for the first time. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1018M was reduced 1 time (MIC = 2 μg/mL) compared to IDR-1018. After treatment with 32 μg/mL 1018M for 24 h, the percentage of biofilm decreased by 78.9%, which was more effective than the parental peptide. The results of mechanisms exploration showed that 1018M was more potent than IDR-1018 at destructing bacterial cell wall, permeating cell membrane (20.4%–50.1% vs 1.45%–10.6%) and binding to stringent response signaling molecule ppGpp (increased 27.9%). Additionally, the peptides could also exert their activity by disrupting genomic DNA, regulating the expression of ppGpp metabolism and biofilm forming related genes ( RSH , relP , relQ , rsbU , sigB , spA , codY , agrA and icaD ). Moreover, the higher temperature, pH and pepsase stabilities provide 1018M better processing, storage and internal environmental tolerance. These data indicated that 1018M may be a potential candidate peptide for the treatment of MRSA and its biofilm infections.",

    "abstract": "In total, 16 yeast were isolated from Chinese strong flavour Daqu samples and underwent RAPD analysis and identification. Totally, 11 different species were identified among these isolates including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Hanseniaspora vineae, Pichia kluyveri, Trichosporon asahii, Wickerhamomyces anomalus, Kluyveromyces lactis, Yarrowia lipolytica, Wickerhamomyces mori, Galactomyces geotrichum, Dabaryomyces hansenii, and Saccharomyces kudriavzevii. To understand the impact of these yeast strains on the quality and flavour of Daqu, we then assessed volatile compounds associated with Daqu samples fermented with corresponding strains. These analyses revealed strain YE006 exhibited the most robust ability to produce ethanol via fermentation but yielded relatively low quantities of volatile compounds, whereas strain YE010 exhibited relatively poor fermentation efficiency but produced the greatest quantity of volatile compounds. These two yeast strains were then utilized in a mixed culture to produce fortified Daqu, with the optimal inoculum size being assessed experimentally. These analyses revealed that maximal fermentation, saccharifying, liquefying, and esterifying power as well as high levels of volatile compounds were achieved when using a 2% inoculum composed of YE006/YE010 at a 1:2 (v/v) ratio. When the liquor prepared using this optimized fortified Daqu was compared to unfortified control Daqu, the former was found to exhibit significantly higher levels of flavour compounds and better sensory scores. Overall, our findings may provide a reliable approach to ensuring Daqu quality and improving the consistency and flavour of Chinese strong-flavour liquor through bioaugmentation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The negative effects of lignocellulose-derived inhibitors such as acetic acid and furaldehydes on microbial metabolism constitute a significant drawback to the usage of biomass feedstocks for the production of fuels and chemicals. The yeast Pichia pastoris has shown a great biotechnological potential for producing heterologous proteins and renewable chemicals. Despite its relevance, the performance of P. pastoris in presence of lignocellulose-derived inhibitors remains unclear. In this work, our results show for the first time the dose-dependent response of P. pastoris to acetic acid, furaldehydes (HMF and furfural), and sugarcane biomass hydrolysate, both at physiological and transcriptional levels. The yeast was able to grow in synthetic media with up to 6 g.L −1 acetic acid, 1.75 g.L −1 furaldehydes or hydrolysate diluted to 10% (v/v). However, its metabolism was completely hindered in presence of hydrolysate diluted to 30% (v/v). Additionally, the yeast was capable to co-consume acetic acid and glucose. At the transcriptional level, P. pastoris response to lignocellulose-derived inhibitors relays on the up-regulation of genes related to transmembrane transport, oxidoreductase activities, RNA processing, and the repression of pathways related to biosynthetic processes and central carbon metabolism. These results demonstrate a polygenetic response that involves detoxification activities, and maintenance of energy and cellular homeostasis. In this context, ALD4, OYE3, QOR2, NTL100, YCT1, and PPR1 were identified as target genes to improve P. pastoris tolerance. Altogether, this work provides valuable insights into the P. pastoris stress tolerance, which can be useful to expand its use in different bioprocesses.",

An endophytic isolate Sch1 (isolated from Aloe vera) , identified to be Schizophyllum commune Fr. on molecular basis, exhibiting more than 90% α-glucosidase inhibitiory activity was selected for further studies. Detailed in-vivo investigations for antidiabetic potential of ethyl acetate extract of S. commune (Sch1), at two different doses, were carried out in streptozotocin induced diabetic Wistar rats. Treatment of diabetic rats with S. commune extract caused significant decrease in blood glucose level and increase in body weight after 14 days experimental period. It significantly restored renal parameters including creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, fractional excretion of sodium, and potassium level in diabetic rats. Improvement in lipid profile and level of antioxidant parameters viz . reduced glutathione, thiobarbituric acid reactive species, and superoxide anion generation was also observed after treatment. Liver enzymes (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminases, and alkaline phosphatase) homeostasis was found to be markedly improved in diabetic rats administered with S. commune extract. The effects were more pronounced at higher concentration and comparable to acarbose which was used as positive control. Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of phenolics and terpenoids in the ethyl acetate extract. This is the first report highlighting the therapeutic potential of an endophytic S. commune in the management of diabetes.",

The viable Bacillus count increased within 6 h of being exposed to the magnetic field, reaching its peak after 36 h. Firstly, fifteen ponds (250,000 PL/acre) were investigated, then 360 water samples were collected from the same corresponding pond for 8 weeks, and subjected to T1: control; T2: Probiotic A (0.007 g/m 3 /2 weeks); T3: Probiotic B (0.03 g/m 3 /2 weeks). Both probiotics with TVC and NH 3 demonstrated a negative correlation, on the other hand, they showed a significant (P ≤ 0.01) improvement in DO and pH.

A total of 5291 coding genes, 9 5s-rRNA, and 79 tRNA were predicted bioinformatically. 3586 genes annotated to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database that can be involved in 173 metabolic pathways, including various microbial metabolic pathways that degrade exogenous chemicals, especially those that degrade aromatic compounds, and also produce a variety of bioactive substances. Fifty genes related to pyrethroid degradation were identified in the C. freundii CD-9 genome, including 9 dioxygenase, 25 hydrolase, and 16 esterase genes.

Obesity is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by chronic inflammation, gut dysbiosis, and hyperpermeability of the colon. Here, we prove that mushrooms Morchella esculenta polysaccharide (MEP) effects on HFD-induced obesity, colonic inflammation, and gut microbiota dysbiosis. Our findings demonstrate MEP supplementation attenuates obesity parameters and reduces inflammation in the colon via regulation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and inactivation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). Furthermore, MEP administration restores gut microbiota dysregulation by ameliorating Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes proportion as well as enhancing beneficial bacteria, like Lactobacillus, and inhibiting pathogenic bacteria like Enterococcus. MEP improves gut integrity by increasing tight junction proteins (TJs) and reducing endotoxin levels by controlling Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in HFD-induced obese mice. These results demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of MEP in attenuating HFD-induced obesity via regulating inflammatory cascades, ameliorating the gut microbiome, and modulating gut integrity.",

    "abstract": "Melia azedarach L. is a valuable source of antioxidants and secondary metabolites. This study is a first extensive report about the effect of different serialization protocols and plant growth regulators (PGRs) on explant disinfection efficiency, callus induction and secondary metabolites production and accumulation in callus cultures of M. azedarach L. In this regard, the effect of plant growth regulators on callus induction and secondary metabolites production were examined. In addition, different sterilization agents were evaluated for disinfection of chinaberry leaf explants. The results showed that the lowest percentage of explant contamination and browning with the highest percentage of callus induction and callus growth obtained with explants pretreated with benomyl (2 g/L) for 2 h and sterilized with 7% H2O2 for 10 min and NaOCl 2% (without pH adjustment) for 12 min. Although adjusting the pH of NaOCl to pH = 7 and 10 significantly reduced the microbial contamination and increased the percentage of contamination-free cultures of M. azedarach L., adversely influenced the explant viability and callus induction and growth. The highest percentage of callus induction obtained on the MS medium containing 3 mg/L NAA/2,4-D and 1 or 3 mg/L Kin/BAP, and the highest callus yield (1804.833 mg/explant) belonged to the MS medium supplemented with 5 mg/L 2,4-D and 5 mg/L Kin. The callus cultures grown on the MS medium supplemented with 3 mg/L NAA and 1 mg/L Kin produced the highest amount of Quercetin (2.06 mg/g fresh weight), Rutin (5.56 mg/g fresh weight) and Kaempferol (1.84 mg/g fresh weight).",

The effect of the initial pH of cow manure and the fermentation time of the AD on the microbial composition, VFAs, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and gibberellic acid (GA3) production was evaluated. The cow manure (7% solids) was adjusted to initial pH values of 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5, and the AD products were analyzed every four days until day 20. The initial pH and the fermentation time had an important effect on the production of metabolites. During AD, only the hydrolytic and acidogenic stages were identified, and the bacteria found were from the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Spirochaetes. The most abundant genera produced in the four AD were Caproiciproducens, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Romboutsia, Paeniclostridium, Turicibacter, Peptostreptococcaceae, Ruminococcaceae and Fonticella. The highest amount of VFAs was obtained at pH 8.5, and the production of the acids was butyric > acetic > propionic. The maximum production of GA3 and IAA was at an initial pH of 6.5 on day 20 and a pH of 5.5 on day 4, respectively. There was a strong correlation (> 0.8) between the most abundant microorganisms and the production of VFAs and GA3. The anaerobic digestion of cow manure is a good alternative for the production of VFAs, GA3 and IAA.",

Their antibacterial and antifungal activities against food spoilage microorganisms including Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Aspergillus flavus, and Aspergillus niger were evaluated by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion and microdilution.

This extract contained guaiacol and syringol, which were predicted as the main antimicrobial components in fungus comb. n-Hexane extract only inhibited Gram-positive bacteria. S. aureus ATCC 25923 was the most sensitive to all the extracts, and A. flavus was more sensitive than A. niger. All these fungus comb extracts exhibited antimicrobial activity against E. coli ATCC 25922, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, S. aureus ATCC 25923, A. flavus, and A. niger.

Since drought stress tolerance of bacteria has earlier been associated to biofilm formation, we aimed to investigate the role of bacterial biofilm formation in their PGPR activity upon drought stress. To this end, a biofilm-forming bacterial collection was isolated from the rhizospheres of native arid grassland plants, and characterized by their drought tolerance and evaluated on their plant growth promoting properties. Most bacterial strains formed biofilm in vitro. Most isolates were drought tolerant, produced auxins, showed 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase activity and solubilized mineral phosphate and potassium, but at considerably different levels. Greenhouse experiments with the most promising isolates, B1, B2 and B3, under three levels of water deficit and two wheat varieties led to an increased relative water content and increased harvest index at both moderate and severe water deficit. However, the bacteria did not affect these plant parameters upon regular watering. In addition, decreased hydrogen peroxide levels and increased glutathione S-transferase activity occurred under water deficit. Based on these results, we conclude that by improving root traits and antioxidant defensive system of wheat, arid grassland rhizospheric biofilm forming bacilli may promote plant growth under water scarcity.",

    "abstract": "The Gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium Serratia marcescens is an opportunistic pathogen of many organisms, including insects. We report the identification and optimal in vitro chitinase production conditions of a novel chitinolytic S. marcescens strain TC-1 isolated from a naturally infected white grub (Anomala corpulenta) collected from a peanut field at Nanyang city, Henan province, China. Strain identification was conducted by morphological, physiological, biochemical and molecular analyses. The amplified 16S rRNA gene of TC-1 showed a similarity greater than 99% with multiple strains of S. marcescens. Based on Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences, TC-1 formed a clade with S. marcescens, clearly separated from other Serratia spp. The strain TC-1 showed larvicidal activities against five insect species (A. corpulenta, Plutella xylostella, Spodoptera exigua, Helicoverpa armigera, Bombyx mori) and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, but not against S. litura. The operating parameters of chitinase production by TC-1 were optimized by response surface methodology using a three-factor, three-level Box-Behnken experimental design. The effects of three independent variables i.e. colloidal chitin concentration (7-13 g l-1), incubation time (24-72 h) and incubation temperature (24-32 °C) on chitinase production by TC-1 were investigated. A regression model was proposed to correlate the independent variables for an optimal chitinase activity predicted as 20.946 U ml-1, using a combination of colloidal chitin concentration, incubation time and incubation temperature of 9.06 g l-1, 63.83 h and 28.12 °C, respectively. The latter agreed well with a mean chitinase activity of 20.761 ± 0.102 U ml-1 measured in the culture supernatants of TC-1 grown under similar conditions with a colloidal chitin concentration, incubation time and incubation temperature of 9 g l-1, 64 h and 28 °C, respectively. Our study revealed the S. marcescens strain TC-1 with potential as a biocontrol agent of insect pests and nematodes and demonstrated the proposed regression model's potential to guide chitinase production by this strain.",

There are many studies regarding isolated bacteria capable of degrading λ-cyhalothrin in vitro. However, limited work has been done examining the microbial degradation of λ-cyhalothrin together with plant growth promotion under greenhouse conditions. In this study, 43 bacterial strains were isolated from heavily polluted soil with λ-cyhalothrin by the enrichment technique. The plant growth promotion characteristics of all isolates were evaluated. The results revealed that five isolates were potential in λ-cyhalothrin biodegradation at high concentration (1200 mg/L) within only 24 h together with their high plant growth promotion abilities. The morphological, biochemical and 16S rDNA sequence analyses identified the isolates as Bacillus subtilis strains. The GC/MS analysis revealed that the selected isolates reached high levels of degradation after only two days, the degradation percentage ranged from 95.72 to 99.52% after 48 h of incubation. Furthermore, the degradation pathway for complete detoxification and metabolism of λ-cyhalothrin was established. Moreover, greenhouse experiment was conducted, the results indicate that the application of seed coat significantly enhanced Vicia faba seedling growth and caused an increase from 38.4 to 40.2% percentage of fresh and dry weight, respectively compared to untreated control. All isolates were effective to remove the pesticide residues in Vicia faba seedlings and recorded the highest degradation percentage of 83.79 under greenhouse conditions. Therefore, it can be concluded that the Bacillus subtilis strains isolated in this study have a dual potential role in complete mineralization of λ-cyhalothrin residues in vivo as well as effective biofertilization for future use in sustainable agriculture.",

Eight Murrah buffalo calves (3–5 days old; 32.52 ± 0.43 kg average body weight (BW)) were randomly allocated into two groups as follows; 1) Group I (n = 4) fed basal diet alone (CON); 2) Group II (n = 4) supplemented with a lyophilized probiotic formulation at a dose rate of 1 g/day/head (1 × 10 9 CFU/g) having Limosilactobacillus reuteri BF-E7 and Ligilactobacillus salivarius BF-17 along with basal diet (PF) for 30 days. Results revealed that final BW (kg), average daily gain (g/day), average dry matter intake (g/day), and structural growth measurements were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increased in the probiotics supplemented group (PF) compared to the control (CON). Fecal pH, fecal moisture, and fecal score were reduced (P &lt; 0.05) in PF than in CON. Moreover, levels of fecal propionate, lactate, and ammonia altered positively in PF compared with CON. The relative abundance of Firmicutes tended to be higher (P = 0.10) in the probiotics fed group than CON. However, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria was significantly lower (P = 0.03) for calves fed probiotics on day 15. A trend was observed in Bacteroides (P = 0.07) and Lactobacillus (P = 0.08) abundances in the feces of the PF than in CON. Overall, it can be concluded that the administration of probiotic formulations significantly improved the performance and gut health of buffalo calves via modulating the gut microbiota composition.

The abundance of the Lactobacillus genus was positively correlated with levels of ethyl lactate, 1-butanol, and 2,3-butanediol. Limnochorda pilosa was closely associated with ethyl acetate levels. Additionally, the correlations between bacterial communities and chemical properties also investigated, and the results demonstrated PO43-, total carbon, K+, humus, NH4+-N, and Mg2+ levels significantly affected the bacterial community structure of pit mud, and they were positively correlated with the relative abundance of Clostridium.

We previously isolated Saccharibacillus brassicae strain ATSA2 T from surface-sterilized seeds of kimchi cabbage and represented a novel species of the genus Saccharibacillus . In this study, we evaluated the plant growth-promoting (PGP) effect of strain ATSA2 T in kimchi cabbage, bok choy, and pepper plants grown in soils. We found a significant effect on the shoot and root biomass, and chlorophyll contents following strain ATSA2 T treatment. Strain ATSA2 T displayed PGP traits such as indole acetic acid (IAA, 62.9 μg/mL) and siderophore production, and phosphate solubilization activity. Furthermore, genome analysis of this strain suggested the presence of gene clusters involved in iron acquisition ( fhuABD , afuABC , fbpABC , and fepCDG ) and phosphate solubilization ( pstABCHS , phoABHLU , and phnCDEP ) and other phytohormone biosynthesis genes, including indole-3-acetic acid ( trpABCDEFG ), in the genome. Interestingly, the secondary metabolites cerecidin, carotenoid, siderophore (staphylobactin), and bacillaene underlying plant growth promotion were found in the whole genome via antiSMASH analysis. Overall, physiological testing and genome analysis data provide comprehensive insights into plant growth-promoting mechanisms, suggesting the relevance of strain ATSA2 T in agricultural biotechnology.",

Bacterial biofilms are highly resistant and render bacterial treatment very difficult, therefore necessitates alternative antibacterial strategies. Phage therapy has been recently regarded as a potential therapeutic option for treatment of bacterial infections. In the current study, a novel podovirus vB_PaeP_PS28 has been isolated from sewage with higher lytic activity against P. aeruginosa . Isolated phage exhibits a short latent period, large burst size and higher stability over a wide range of temperatures and pH. The genome of vB_PaeP_PS28 consists of 72,283 bp circular double-stranded DNA, with G + C content of 54.75%. The phage genome contains 94 open reading frames (ORFs); 32 for known functional proteins and 62 for hypothetical proteins and no tRNA genes. The phage vB_PaeP_PS28 effectively inhibited the growth of P. aeruginosa planktonic cells and displayed a higher biofilm degrading capability. Moreover, therapeutic efficacy of isolated phage was evaluated in vivo using mice infection model. Interestingly, survival of mice infected with P. aeruginosa was significantly enhanced upon treatment with vB_PaeP_PS28. Furthermore, the bacterial load in liver and kidney isolated from mice infected with P. aeruginosa and treated with phage markedly decreased as compared with phage-untreated P. aeruginosa -infected mice. These findings support the efficacy of isolated phage vB_PaeP_PS28 in reducing P. aeruginosa colonization and pathogenesis in host. Importantly, the isolated phage vB_PaeP_PS28 could be applied alone or as combination therapy with other lytic phages as phage cocktail therapy or with antibiotics to limit infections caused by P. aeruginosa .",

We tested the potential protective effects of probiotic BL21 and LRa05 on gut microbiota in type 2 diabetes mellitus mice and determined whether these effects were related to the modulation of gut microbiota.Thirty specific pathogen-free C57BL/6J mice were randomly allocated to three groups-the (CTL) control group, HFD/STZ model (T2DM) group, and HFD/STZ-probiotic intervention (PRO) group-and intragastrically administered strains BL21 and LRa05 for 11 weeks. The administration of strains BL21 and LRa05 significantly regulated blood glucose levels, accompanied by ameliorated oxidative stress in mice. The BL21/LRa05-treated mice were protected from liver, cecal, and colon damage. Microbiota analysis showed that the cecal and fecal microbiota of the mice presented significantly different spatial distributions from one another. Principal coordinate analysis results indicated that both T2DM and the BL21/LRa05 intervention had significant effects on the cecal contents and fecal microbiota structure. In terms of the fecal microbiota, an abundance of Akkermansia and Anaeroplasma was noted in the PRO group. In terms of the cecal content microbiota, enrichment of Akkermansia, Desulfovibrio, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Limosilactobacillus was noted in the PRO group. The probiotics BL21 and LRa05 prevent or ameliorate T2DM by regulating the intestinal flora and reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. Our results suggest that BL21 and LRa05 colonize in the cecum. Thus, BL21/LRa05 combined with probiotics having a strong ability to colonize in the colon may achieve better therapeutic effects in T2DM. Our study illustrated the feasibility and benefits of the combined use of probiotics and implied the importance of intervening at multiple intestinal sites in T2DM mice.",

    "abstract": "Bacillus, an excellent organic-degrading agent, can degrade lignocellulose. Notably, some B. velezensis strains encode lignocellulases. However, their ability to degrade lignocellulose in fermented feed is not much appreciated. This study performed a comparative genomic analysis of twenty-three B. velezensis strains to find common carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) encoding genes and evaluated their potential to degrade lignocellulose. The comparative genomic and CAZyme database-based analyses identified several potential CAZymes genes that degrade cellulose (GH1, GH4, GH5, GH13, GH16, GH32, PL1, and PL9), hemicellulose (GH11, GH26, GH43, GH51, and CE3) and lignin (AA4, AA6, AA7, and AA10). Furthermore, Illumina RNA-seq transcriptome analysis revealed the expression of more than 1794 genes in B. velezensis CL-4 fermented corn germ meal at 48 h (FCGM 48 h). Gene ontology analysis of expressed genes revealed their enrichment in hydrolase activity (breaking the glycosyl bonds during carbohydrate metabolism), indicating the upregulation of CAZymes. In total, 58 differentially upregulated CAZymes-encoding genes were identified in FCGM 48 h compared to FCGM 0 h. The upregulated CAZymes-encoding genes were related to cellulose (6-phospho-β-galactosidase and 6-phospho-α-glucosidase), starch (α-glucosidase and α-amylase), pectin (pectin lyase), and hemicellulose (arabinan endo-1,5-α-L-arabinosidase, xylan 1,4-beta-xylosidase, α-N-arabinofuranosidase, and acetyl xylan esterase). Importantly, arabinoxylan degradation mainly occurred in FCGM 48 h, followed by partial degradation of cellulose, pectin, and starch. This study can support the development of enzymatic cocktails for the solid-state fermented feed (SFF).",

    "abstract": "Abstract Isolation of heavy metals-resistant bacteria from their original habitat is a crucial step in bioremediation. Six lead (Pb) resistant bacterial strains were isolated and identified utilizing 16S rRNA to be Enterobacter ludwigii FACU 4, Shigella flexneri FACU, Microbacterium paraoxydans FACU, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumonia FACU, Raoultella planticola FACU 3 and Staphylococcus xylosus FACU. It was determined that all these strains had their Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to be 2500 ppm except R. planticola FACU 3 has a higher maximum tolerance concentration (MTC) up to 2700 ppm. We evaluated the survival of all six strains on lead stress, the efficiency of biosorption and lead uptake. It was found that R. planticola FACU 3 is the highest MTC and S. xylosus FACU was the lowest MTC in this evaluation. Therefore, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed the difference between the morphological responses of these two strains to lead stress. These findings led to explore more about the genome of R. planticola FACU 3 using illumine Miseq technology. Draft genome sequence analysis revealed the genome size of 5,648,460 bp and G + C content 55.8% and identified 5526 CDS, 75 tRNA and 4 rRNA . Sequencing technology facilitated the identification of about 47 genes related to resistance to many heavy metals including lead, arsenic, zinc, mercury, nickel, silver and chromium of R. planticola FACU 3 strain. Moreover, genome sequencing identified plant growth-promoting genes (PGPGs) including indole acetic acid (IAA) production, phosphate solubilization, phenazine production, trehalose metabolism and 4-hydroxybenzoate production genes and a lot of antibiotic-resistant genes.",

    "abstract": "Rhodosporidium toruloides is an oleaginous yeast under development with promising industrial applications. Since promoters of different strengths have been demonstrated as an efficient strategy to fine-tune gene expression in synthetic biology, a set of constitutive promoters with strengths varying over 2 orders of magnitude were identified in R. toruloides through transcriptome analysis under different growth conditions. Promoter candidates were first cloned and characterized using an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as a reporter under eight conditions, and 31 promoters were identified with strength varied from 0.1 to 19.0 folds of the commonly used strong promoter of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (PGPD1). The resultant promoters were then used to optimize the linoleic acid biosynthetic pathway in R. toruloides in different media, including the use of lignocellulosic hydrolysate as the fermentation substrate, and improved the production of linoleic acid by up to 214.2% in minimal medium, with the highest production of 350.3 mg/L in Yeast Peptone Dextrose medium. This work has enriched the promoter library of R. toruloides, and helped develop R. toruloides as a platform organism for applications in biomanufacturing and synthetic biology.",

In the present study, algae chloroplast expression system was evaluated for the recombinant production of an anti-cancerous therapeutic protein, Interleukin 29 (IL29). The IL29 gene was cloned into algae chloroplast expression vector (pSRSapI). After the transformation, the positive clones were screened for homoplasmy and the presence of the IL29 gene by spot test and PCR analysis, respectively. The expressed SDS-PAGE and western blotting assay characterized IL-29. The algae expressed IL-29 was biologically active in an anti-proliferating bioassay using HepG2 cells.

    "abstract": "Abstract Okara, a renewable biomass resource, is a promising fermentative raw material for the bio-production of value-added chemicals due to its abundance and low-costs. we developed a process for the enzymatic hydrolysis of okara, and then engineered Bacillus subtilis to utilize mixed sugars to produce acetoin in okara hydrolysis without the addition of a supplemental nitrogen source. Okara was initially hydrolyzed with cellulase, β-glucosidase, and pectinase to obtain okara hydrolysate containing mixed sugars (32.78 ± 0.23 g/L glucose, 1.43 ± 0.064 g/L arabinose, 7.74 ± 0.11 g/L galactose) and amino acids. In this study, Bacillus subtilis 168 was used as the acetoin-producing strain, and the key genes bdhA and acoA of the acetoin catabolism pathway were knocked out to improve the fermentation yield of acetoin. In order to utilize the galactose in the hydrolysate, the recombinant strain BS03 ( Bacillus subtilis 168∆ bdhA ∆ acoA ) was used to overexpress the arabinose transporter-encoding gene ( araE ) drive heterologous expression of the Leloir pathway gene ( galKTE ). The corn dry powder concentration was optimized to 29 g/L in the reducing sugar okara hydrolysate. The results show that the recombinant bacterium BS03 could still synthesize 11.79 g/L acetoin without using corn dry powder as a nitrogen source. Finally, using okara enzymatic hydrolysate as the carbon and nitrogen source, 11.11 g/L and 29.7 g/L acetoin were obtained by batch fermentation and fed-batch fermentation, respectively, which was further converted to 5.33 g/L and 13.37 g/L tetramethylpyrazine (TTMP) by reaction with an ammonium salt.",

This study aimed to identify reproducible gut microbial biomarkers across Chinese population for LC and HCC diagnosis. In this study, a group of 21 CHB, 25 LC, 21 HCC and 15 healthy control (HC) were examined, and used as the training data. Four published faecal datasets from different regions of China were collected, totally including 121 CHB, 33 LC, 70 HCC and 96 HC. Beta diversity showed that the distribution of community structure in CHB, LC, HCC was significantly different from HC. Correspondingly, 14 and 10 reproducible differential genera across datasets were identified in LC and HCC, respectively, defined as LC-associated and HCC-associated genera. Two random forest (RF) models based on these reproducible genera distinguished LC or HCC from HC with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.824 and 0.902 in the training dataset, respectively, and achieved cross-region validations. Moreover, AUCs were greatly improved when clinical factors were added. A reconstructed random forest model on eight genera with significant changes between HCC and non-HCC can accurately distinguished HCC from LC. Conclusively, two RF models based on 14 reproducible LC-associated and 10 reproducible HCC-associated genera were constructed for LC and HCC diagnosis, which is of great significance to assist clinical early diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Exosomes, a subpopulation of Extracellular vesicles (EVs), are cell-secreted vesicles found in the majority of biological fluids, including breast milk, tears, sweat, blood and, urine. The density and size of these vesicles depend on a variety of factors, including age, gender and the biological condition of the individual. Researchers are now focusing on the selective extraction of exosomes from bodily fluids due to the unique biomolecule composition of exosomes, which is critical for diagnosis, disease, and regeneration. Furthermore, current approaches for exosome isolation have limitations, necessitating the development of a simpler and more effective technique to achieve this goal. In this study, we investigated a quick and effective strategy for isolating exosomes from serum using a bench-top centrifuge. This was accomplished by raising antibodies against exosome surface tetraspanins (CD9, CD63 & CD81) in Leghorn chickens due to their phylogenetic distance from humans and cost-effectiveness for commercial use. In order to separate exosomes from a complex biological fluid, the antibodies were further coupled with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The findings were validated using ELISA, spectrophotometry, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Using this technique, exosome isolation from serum was achieved rapidly and these were captured by using anti CD63 antibodies bound to AuNPs. To summarize, exosomes were purified from serum using anti-CD63 antibodies conjugated to gold nanoparticles (IgY@AuNPs). Consequently, the approach for exosome isolation from biological fluid could be useful for clinically monitoring the biological state of the patients.",

The use of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) has proven to be a promising method to control this disease. Bacillus velezensis K01 was isolated from the rhizosphere of planting tomatoes. Strain K01 has a range of roles, including the ability to solubilize phytate phosphorus, stimulate resistant response, and produce indoleacetic acid (IAA), protease, cellulase, and antimicrobial substances. Strain K01 was found to inhibit 12 phytopathogenic fungi and 5 phytopathogenic bacteria. Specially, strain K01 demonstrated a biocontrol efficiency of over 78% against gray mold caused by B. cinerea on the leaves and fruits of tomato and pepper. Additionally, K01 was found to promote the growth of maize seedlings. Further genomic analysis revealed that K01 belongs to B. velezensis, which is consistent with phylogenetic analysis, average nucleotide polymorphism (ANI), and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH). The genome of strain K01 had a size of 3,927,799 bp and deduced 3866 predicted genes, with an average guanine-cytosine (GC) content of 46.5%. Based on the analyses of genomic secondary metabolites, over 18.4% of the genome was annotated to 12 gene clusters related to antimicrobial metabolite synthesis. Additionally, genome annotation and comparative genomics identified several genes associated with plant growth promotion and environmental adaption. These findings suggest that B. velezensis K01 has the potential to serve as a new biocontrol agent for management of gray mold on tomato and pepper.",

A rotating attached system was designed to assess the biofilm-forming capacity of different isolated microalgal strains from the Persian Gulf. Four microalgal strains, including two Chlorella sp., one Picochlorum sp. and one filamentous cyanobacterium Desmonostoc sp. were cultivated on four carriers: jute, cotton, yarn and nylon. The carriers' physicochemical surface characteristics and attachment effects, like contact angle, were investigated. The incorporated biomass and exopolysaccharides (EPS) content in the suspended and biofilm system was calculated and compared. The results showed that the cyanobacterium strain had the biofilm formation capability on both jute and cotton in the attached cultivation system. Under the same culture conditions, the biomass productivity on jute and cotton carriers was significantly higher (4.76 and 3.61 g m- 2 respectively) than the growth in aqueous suspension (1.19 g m- 2 d- 1). The greatest incorporated exopolysaccharides amount was observed on jute (43.62 ± 4.47%) and the lowest amount was obtained from the growth on positive charge yarn (18.62 ± 1.88%). This study showed that in comparison with planktonic growth, the colonization of cyanobacterial cells and subsequent production of extracellular matrix and biofilm formation can lead to increased biomass production.",

Computational techniques, including ab initio, comparative, and I-TASSER modeling, were used to evaluate the functional and stability effects of the Val66Met mutation in BDNF. The accuracy and reliability of the models were validated. Sequence alignment and secondary structure analysis compared amino acid residues and structural components. The phylogenetic analysis assessed the conservation of the mutation site. Functional and stability prediction analyses provided mixed results, suggesting potential effects on protein function and stability. Structural models revealed the importance of BDNF in key biological processes. Sequence alignment analysis showed the conservation of amino acid residues across species. Secondary structure analysis indicated minor differences between the wild-type and mutant forms. Phylogenetic analysis supported the evolutionary conservation of the mutation site. This computational study suggests that the Val66Met mutation in BDNF may have implications for protein stability, structural conformation, and function. Further experimental validation is needed to confirm these findings and elucidate the precise effects of this mutation on stress-related disorders.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator (CFTR) is a significant protein that is responsible for the movement of ions across cell membranes. The cystic fibrosis (CF) occur due to the mutations in the CFTR gene as it produces the dysfunctional CFTR protein. The sequence of CFTR protein as a target structure was retrieved from UniProt and PDB database. The ligands selection was performed through virtual screening and top 3 ligands choose out of 65 ligands silibinins, curcumin, demethoxycurcumin were selected with a reference drug Trikafta (R*). According to docking, ADMET analyses, the natural ligands (Silibinins and Curcumin) displayed best binding energy, pharmacokinetic and free toxicity than other natural compounds and reference drug (R*). An MD simulation for 200 ns was also established to ensure that natural ligands (Silibinins and Curcumin) attached to the target protein favorably and dynamically, and that protein–ligand complex stability was maintained. It is concluded that silibinins and curcumins have a better capacity to decrease the effect of mutant CFTR protein through improved trafficking and the restoration of original function. In conclusion, in silico studies demonstrate the potential of silibinins and curcumin as therapeutic agents for cystic fibrosis, particularly for the D614G mutated protein. Their ability to increase CFTR function while reducing cellular stress and inflammation, together with their favorable safety profile and accessibility could make them valuable additions to cystic fibrosis treatment options. Further experimental and clinical validation will be required to fully realize their potential and include them into effective therapy regimens.",

This study utilizes whole-genome sequencing and comprehensive bioinformatics analysis, examining the genomes of 76 PSB strains with the aid of specialized genomic databases and analytical tools. We have identified the pqq gene cluster, particularly the pqqC gene, as a key marker for (P) solubilization capabilities. The pqqC gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of precursors to 2-keto- d -gluconic acid, which significantly enhances P solubilization in soil. This gene’s importance lies not only in its biochemical function but also in its prevalence and effectiveness across various PSB strains, distinguishing it from other potential markers. Our study focuses on Burkholderia cepacia 51-Y1415, known for its potent solubilization activity, and demonstrates a direct correlation between the abundance of the pqqC gene, the quantitative release of P, and the production of 2-keto- d -gluconic acid over a standard 144-h cultivation period under standardized conditions. This research not only underscores the role of the pqqC gene as a universal marker for the rapid screening and functional annotation of PSB strains but also highlights its implications for enhancing soil fertility and crop yields, thereby contributing to more sustainable agricultural practices. Our findings provide a foundation for future research aimed at developing targeted strategies to optimize phosphate solubilization, suggesting areas for further investigation such as the integration of these genomic insights into practical agricultural applications to maximize the effectiveness of PSB strains in real-world soil environments.",

The current study focused on the environmentally friendly synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using Lycopersicon esculentum peel. In addition to studying the intrinsic cytotoxic effectiveness of Le-AgNPs contribute to their antibacterial, and antifungal activities and the effect of nanoparticles on the integrity of their morphological behavior. The initiative biosynthesis of L. esculentum silver nanoparticles (Le-AgNPs) was indicated by the color change of L. esculentum (Le) extract mixed with silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution from faint pink to faint brown. UV–visible spectroscopy, Dynamic light scattering (DLS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), and X-ray diffraction techniques were used to characterize biosynthesized Le-AgNPs. Results of UV–visible spectroscopy recorded surface plasmon resonance at 310 nm for SPR of 2.5. The DLS results showed particles of 186 nm with a polydispersity index of 0.573. The FTIR spectrum indicated the existence of carboxyl, hydroxyl, phenolic, and amide functional groups. The HR-TEM analysis revealed quasi-spherical crystal particles of Le-AgNPs. Le-AgNPs had a negative zeta potential of − 68.44 mV, indicating high stability. Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 and Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 were the most susceptible pathogens to Le-AgNPs inhibition, with inhibition zone diameters (IZDs) of 4.0 and 0.92 cm, respectively. However, Listeria monocytogenes NC 013768 and Shigella sonnei DSM 5570 were the most resistant pathogens, with IZDs of 0.92 and 0.90 cm, respectively.

Such a negative effect on the activity of inulinase, which is the sole enzyme to hydrolyze sucrose, raffinose and inulin, has been demonstrated in K. marxianus without analysis at the gene level. To clarify the utilization capability of sucrose, raffinose and inulin and the glucose effect on inulinase in K. marxianus DMKU 3-1042, its growth and metabolite profiles on these sugars were examined with or without glucose under a static condition, in which glucose repression evidently occurs. Consumption of sucrose was not influenced by glucose or 2-deoxyglucose. On the other hand, raffinose and inulin consumption was hampered by glucose at 30°C but hardly hampered at 45°C. Unlike Saccharomyces cerevisiae , increase in glucose concentration had no effect on sucrose utilization. These sugar-specific glucose effects were consistent with the level of inulinase activity but not with that of the KmINU1 transcript, which was repressed in the presence of glucose via KmMig1p. This inconsistency may be due to sufficient activity of inulinase even when glucose is present. Our results encourage us to apply K. marxianus DMKU 3-1042 to high-temperature ethanol fermentation with biomass containing these sugars with glucose.",

    "abstract": "Accidental oil spills and waste disposal are important sources for environmental pollution. We investigated the biodegradation of alkanes by Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 55925 in relation to a rhamnolipid surfactant produced by the same bacterial strain. Results showed that the linear C11-C21 compounds in a heating oil sample degraded from 6% to 100%, whereas the iso-alkanes tended to be recalcitrant unless they were exposed to the biosurfactant; under such condition total biodegradation was achieved. Only the biodegradation of the commercial C12-C19 alkanes could be demonstrated, ranging from 23% to 100%, depending on the experimental conditions. Pristane (a C19 branched alkane) only biodegraded when present alone with the biosurfactant and when included in an artificial mixture even without the biosurfactant. In all cases the biosurfactant significantly enhanced biodegradation. The electron scanning microscopy showed that cells depicted several adaptations to growth on hydrocarbons, such as biopolymeric spheres with embedded cells distributed over different layers on the spherical surfaces and cells linked to each other by extracellular appendages. Electron transmission microscopy revealed transparent inclusions, which were associated with hydrocarbon based-culture cells. These patterns of hydrocarbon biodegradation and cell adaptations depended on the substrate bioavailability, type and length of hydrocarbon.",

    "abstract": "As alternative microbial hosts for butanol production with organic-solvent tolerant trait are in high demands, a butanol-tolerant bacterium, Bacillus subtilis GRSW2-B1, was thus isolated. Its tolerance covered a range of organic solvents at high concentration (5%v/v), with remarkable tolerance in particular to butanol and alcohol groups. It was susceptible for butanol acclimatization, which resulted in significant tolerance improvement. It has versatility for application in a variety of fermentation process because it has superior tolerance when cells were exposed to butanol either as high-density, late-exponential grown cells (up to 5%v/v) or under growing conditions (up to 2.25%v/v). Genetic transformation procedure was optimized, yielding the highest efficiency at 5.17 × 103 colony forming unit (μg DNA)-1. Gene expression could be effectively driven by several promoters with different levels, where as the highest expression was observed with a xylose promoter. The constructed vector was stably maintained in the transformants, in the presence or absence of butanol stress. Adverse effect of efflux-mediated tetracycline resistance determinant (TetL) to bacterial organic-solvent tolerance property was unexpectedly observed and thus discussed. Overall results indicate that B. subtilis GRSW2-B1 has potential to be engineered and further established as a genetic host for bioproduction of butanol.",

The impact of medium pH on mycotoxin production was studied in the range of pH 3.5 - 8. pH values above 5.5 led to a decreased mycotoxin production or inhibited mycotoxin formation completely whereas an acidic pH in the range of 4.0-4.5 was optimal for mycotoxin production.

However, there is no experimental evidence to show a direct link between these sortases and sorting sequences. To study the role of these two putative sortases on displaying YhcR and YfkN on the cell wall, expression of yhcS and ywpE was analyzed by transcriptional fusions and by Northern blot. It turned out that yhcS gene is expressed at a higher level during the late stationary phase from both experiments, while ywpE expression is not confirmed in the Northern blot analysis. Next, we constructed yhcS and ywpE single and double knockout strains and plasmids that express one or both genes to restore the functions of the knockout strains. It could be shown that display of YhcR and YfkN on the surface depended on the presence of YhcS while YwpE seems not to play a major role if any as a sortase. Finally, the putative sorting motif together with a 123-amino-acid spacer derived from YhcR and YfkN designated YhcR123 and YfkN123, respectively, were fused to an α-amylase reporter enzyme. The fusion protein YhcR123-AmyQ could be displayed on the surface at high amounts, while YfkN123-AmyQ could be hardly detected. We conclude that the sortase YhcS can recognize and anchor YhcR on the cell wall. This result further indicates that the YhcR sorting sequence can be used to display recombinant proteins on the surface of B. subtilis cells.",

We found that higher molecular weight chitosan had superior antimicrobial properties compared to lower molecular weights, and that this activity occurred in a pH dependent manner. Electron and fluorescence microscopy revealed that chitosan forms aggregates and binds to the surface of bacteria, causing shrinkage of the bacterial membrane from the cell wall. Of special relevance, clinical isolates of P. acnes were vulnerable to chitosan, which could be combined with benzoyl peroxide for additive antibacterial effect. Chitosan also demonstrated significantly less cytotoxicity to monocytes than benzoyl peroxide. Overall, chitosan demonstrates many promising qualities for treatment of cutaneous pathogens.",

Optimum conditions for maximizing the product yields were established: glucose as carbon source, an initial pH of 6.0, 6 g/L of ammonium sulphate and addition of micronutrients.

The engineered strain exhibited significantly altered formation rates for the product and other metabolites during the fermentation. An increase in the 1, 3-PD specific productivity of 34% and molar yield by 13% was achieved in the clone, relative to the native strain. A concomitant decrease in the levels of toxic intermediate, 3-HPA, was observed, with the specific productivity levels being 25% lesser than that of the native strain. Interestingly, the recombinant strain exhibited elevated rates of lactate and ethanol formation as well as reduced rate of acetate production, compared to the native strain. The preferential utilization of NADPH by YqhD with a possible decrease in the native 1, 3-PD oxidoreductase (NADH-dependent) activity, could have resulted in the diversion of surplus NADH towards increased lactate and ethanol productivities.",

The plasmid was 71,020 bp in length and contained 75 coding regions. Three mer gene clusters were identified. The first comprised merR-orf4-orf5-merT1-merP1-merF-merA-merB1 , which confers bacterial resistance to mercuric ions and organomercury. The second and third clusters comprised merT2-merP2 , which encodes a mercury transport system, and merB2 , which encodes an organomercurial lyase, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequences for the proteins encoded by each of the mer genes identified in pMR68 bore greater similarity to sequences from Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 than to those from pMR26, a second mercury-resistance plasmid from Pseudomonas strain K-62. Escherichia coli cells carrying pMKY12 (containing merR-orf4-orf5-merT1-merP1-merF-merA-merB1 cloned from pMR68) and cells carrying pMRA114 (containing merR-merT-merP-merA-merG-merB1 cloned from plasmid pMR26) were more resistant to, and volatilized more, mercury from mercuric ions and phenylmercury than the control cells. The present results, together with our earlier findings, indicate that the high phenylmercury resistance noted for Pseudomonas strain K-62 seems to be achieved by multiple genes, particularly by the multiple merB encoding organomercurial lyase and one merG encoding cellular permeability to phenylmercury. The novel mer gene identified in pMR68 may help us to design new strategies aimed at the bioremediation of mercurials.",

Here we present a proof-of-concept immobilization approach that allows exoelectrogenic activity of cells on an electrode based on applying a layer of latex to hold bacteria on surfaces. The effectiveness of this procedure to immobilize particles was first demonstrated using fluorescent microspheres as bacterial analogs. The latex coating was then shown to not substantially affect the exoelectrogenic activity of well-developed anode biofilms in two different systems. A single layer of airbrushed coating did not reduce the voltage produced by a biofilm in a microbial fuel cell (MFC), and more easily applied dip-and-blot coating reduced voltage by only 11% in a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC). This latex immobilization procedure will enable future testing of single cells for exoelectrogenic activity on electrodes in BESs.",

The relevance of this field has also been enhanced by the growing economic interest in methanogen skills, particularly the production of methane from organic substrates. Management attention turned to anaerobic wastes digestion because the volume and environmental impact reductions. Methanogenesis is the biochemically limiting step of the process and the industrially interesting phase because it connects to the amount of biogas production. For this reason, several studies have evaluated the structure of methanogen communities during this process. Currently, it is clear that the methanogen load and diversity depend on the feeding characteristics and the process conditions, but not much data is available. In this study, we apply a Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) method based on mcrA target to evaluate, by specific probes, some subgroups of methanogens during the mesophilic anaerobic digestion process fed wastewater sludge and organic fraction of the municipal solid waste with two different pre-treatments.

Bacterial adhesion and planktonic growth of clinically relevant bacterial strains (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) on Ag-DLC-Ti were compared to untreated Ti by quantification of colony forming units on the adherent surface and in the growth medium as well as semiquantitatively by determining the grade of biofilm formation by scanning electron microscopy.

This may serve as a promising novel approach to close the gap in antimicrobial protection of musculoskeletal implants.",

The antimicrobial activity of the classically- optimized aqueous extract was enhanced up to 1.45 folds, when subjected to statistical optimization using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and was thermostable. Ethyl acetate was found to be the best organic extractant with Klebsiella pneumoniae 1 (31.5 mm) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (25.5 mm) being the most sensitive among Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria, respectively. Among the major group of phytoconstituents detected, tannins were the most abundant followed by flavonoids and phytosterols, while triterpenes were absent. Flavonoids and cardiac glycosides exhibited a broad range of antimicrobial potential, with inhibition zone ranging from 13 to 35 mm, where Candida albicans was the most sensitive organism. Ethyl acetate extract showed better potency with lowest Minimum inhibitory concentration (0.1–1 mg ml−1) than the aqueous extract (1–3 mg ml−1) and all partially purified phytoconstituents (0.1–10 mg ml−1). The ethyl acetate extract and flavonoids were highly potent, as they exhibited a total activity potency ranging from 41.4 to 1045 ml g−1. Time kill studies revealed their microbicidal action, where ethyl acetate extract had a kill time from 0 to 12 h. However, among phytoconstituents, flavonoids were the most effective (0–8 h). The MIC and time kill study was also compared to that of standard antibiotics. These findings indicate that Gymnema sylvestre can be a potential source for development of leading metabolites against pathogens of clinical importance like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus etc. They were neither mutagenic nor cytotoxic, as revealed by Ames and MTT assay.",

The mutant will be used for high ethanol fermentation from glycerol feedstock. Ethanol production from pure (P-) and recovered (R-) glycerol using the stock was evaluated. A six-tube-subculture-generations method was used for developing the mutant. This involved subculturing the organism six consecutive times in tubes containing the same glycerol and ethanol concentrations at the same culture conditions. Then, the glycerol and/or ethanol concentration was increased and the six subculture generations were repeated. A strain capable of growing in 200 g/L glycerol and 30 g/L ethanol was obtained. The ability of this mutant, vis-à-vis the original strain, in utilizing glycerol in a high glycerol containing medium, with the concomitant ethanol yield, was assessed. Tryptic soy broth without dextrose (TSB) was used as the fermentation medium. Fermentation products were analyzed using HPLC.In a 20 g/L glycerol TSB, E. aerogenes ATCC 13048 converted 18.5 g/L P-glycerol and 17.8 g/L R-glycerol into 12 and 12.8 g/L ethanol, respectively. In a 50 g/L P-glycerol TSB, it utilized only 15.6 g/L glycerol; but the new strain used up 39 g/L, yielding 20 g/L ethanol after 120 h, an equivalence of 1.02 mol ethanol/mol-glycerol. This is the highest ethanol yield reported from glycerol bioconversion. The result of this P-glycerol fermentation can be duplicated using the R-glycerol from biodiesel production.",

The variables examined in this study include the species and concentration of salt, the concentrations of the two substrates glucose and yeast extract, the level of dissolved oxygen, the cerulenin treatment, and the stages of BL10 growth. Our results demonstrate that BL10 culture produces maximum biomass when salinity levels are between 0.2 and 3.0%. Decreasing salinity to 0.1% resulted in a considerable decrease in the biomass, lipid content, DHA production, and DHA to palmitic acid (PA) (DHA/PA) ratio, signifying deterioration in the quality of the oil produced. The addition of 0.9% sodium sulfate to replenish salinity from 0.1% to 1.0% successfully recovered biomass, lipid content and DHA production levels; however, this also led to a decrease in DHA/PA ratio. An increase in oxygen and cerulenin levels resulted in a concomitant decrease in the DHA to docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) (DHA/DPA) ratio in BL10 oil. Furthermore, the DHA/DPA and DHA/PA ratios varied considerably before and after the termination of cell division, which occurred around the 24 hour mark. These results could serve as a foundation for elucidating the biochemistry underlying the accumulation of lipids, and a definition of the extrinsic (environmental or nutritional) and intrinsic (cell growth stage) factors that influence lipid quality and the production of DHA by BL10.",

It is possible to prevent and control infections due to these bacteria if their virulence factors are recognized. Eighty isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) including 42 from urine (52.5%), 23 from blood (28.75%), 15 from dialysis bags (18.75%) were studied for biofilm production on Congo red agar (CRA). The virulence genes in S. aureus were investigated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers. Out of 80 isolates studied, 40 isolated (50%) formed black colonies (biofilm-forming strains) on CRA. In 22 of these isolates (25%) reaction was strongly positive; in 12 isolates (15%) reaction was moderately positive, and in the remaining 6 isolates, reaction was weakly positive. In the 22 isolates that had strong positive reaction and produced black colonies on biofilm, all virulent genes (icaC, icaD, icaA icaB, icaR) were expressed. In the 12 isolates that had moderate positive reaction, 8 expressed all genes (icaC, icaD, icaA icaB, icaR) expressed while the remaining 4 expressed only ica A, and ica D genes. Of the 6 isolated which had weak positive reaction, only 1 isolate (2.5%) expressed all the genes, in the other 5 isolates no gene was observed. Urinary isolates more frequently form biofilms than the isolates from other clinical samples. Statistical analysis using Chi square test showed that there was a significant correlation between the type of sample and the biofilm production (P < 0.05). The results of biofilm production on CRA were largely in agreement with microtiter plate assay and PCR assay. The capacity of bacteria to produce biofilm is an important factor in infectivity and happens via expression of ica genes. Recognition of bacteria that produce biofilm is thus important to control infection due to these bacteria.",

Many inocula are powder-based and production includes a drying step. Although S. meliloti survives drying well, the quality of the inocula is reduced during this process. In this study we determined survival during desiccation of the commercial strains 102F84 and 102F85 as well as the model strain USDA1021. The survival of S. meliloti 1021 was estimated during nine weeks at 22% relative humidity. We found that after an initial rapid decline of colony forming units, the decline slowed to a steady 10-fold reduction in colony forming units every 22 days. In spite of the reduction in colony forming units, the fraction of the population identified as viable (42-54%) based on the Baclight live/dead stain did not change significantly over time. This change in the ability of viable cells to form colonies shows (i) an underestimation of the survival of rhizobial cells using plating methods, and that (ii) in a part of the population desiccation induces a Viable But Non Culturable (VBNC)-like state, which has not been reported before. Resuscitation attempts did not lead to a higher recovery of colony forming units indicating the VBNC state is stable under the conditions tested. This observation has important consequences for the use of rhizobia. Finding methods to resuscitate this fraction may increase the quality of powder-based seed inocula.",

Initially, the collected samples were inoculated on yeast extract peptone dextrose agar plates and the colonies so obtained were culturally and morphologically characterized. Commercial probiotic yeast, Saccharomyces boulardii served as the control in these experiments. Of the 15 yeast strains, the isolates that were resistant to antibiotics and worked synergistically with other cultures were considered for further evaluation. Selected isolates were evaluated in vitro for tolerance to simulated gastrointestinal conditions such as temperature, pH, bile and gastric juice. Further the yeast isolates were evaluated for their pathogenicity and adherence to intestinal epithelial cells. The 2 yeast isolates with efficient probiotic properties were finally characterized by sequencing their 5.8 S rRNA and partial sequences of internal transcribed spacer 1 and 2. The sequences were BLAST searched in the National Center for Biotechnology Information, nucleic acid database for sequence similarity of organisms and phylogenetic evolutionary analysis was carried out. Based on maximum similarity of basic local alignment search tool results, organisms were characterized as Pichia kudriavzevii OBS1 (100%) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae OBS2 (96%) and sequences were finally deposited in the GenBank data library. Among these two isolates, S. cerevisiae OBS2 displayed slight/moderate antioxidant and anticancer property. Hence, strain OBS2 can be utilized and explored as a potential probiotic for therapeutic applications.",

The aim of this work was to confirm the hypothesis that the limit of Se tolerance in Chlorella cultures is related to photosynthetic performance, i.e. depends on light intensity. We studied the relation between the dose and irradiance to find the range of Se tolerance in laboratory and outdoor cultures. At low irradiance (250 µmol photons m−2 s−1), the daily dose of Se below 8.5 mg per g of biomass (<20 µM) partially stimulated the photosynthetic activity (relative electron transport rate) and growth of Chlorella cultures (biomass density of ~1.5 g DW L−1) compared to the control (no Se added). It was accompanied by substantial Se incorporation to microalgae biomass (~0.5 mg Se g−1 DW). When the Se daily dose and level of irradiance were doubled (16 mg Se g−1 DW; 500 µmol photons m−2 s−1), the photosynthetic activity and growth were stimulated for several days and ample incorporation of Se to biomass (7.1 mg g−1 DW) was observed. Yet, the same Se daily dose under increased irradiance (750 µmol photons m−2 s−1) caused the synergistic effect manifested by significant inhibition of photosynthesis, growth and lowered Se incorporation to biomass. In the present experiments Chl fluorescence techniques were used to monitor photosynthetic activity for determination of optimal Se doses in order to achieve efficient incorporation without substantial inhibition of microalgae growth when producing Se-enriched biomass.",

Here we use low cost BSG as the raw material for the production of a novel growth media, through a bioconversion process utilizing a food grade fungi to hydrolyze BSG. The novel fermentation media was tested on the yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides, a natural yeast producing carotenoid. The yeast growth was analysed using the growth curve and the production of intracellular fatty acids and carotenoids. Untargeted GCMS based metabolomics was used to analyse the constituents of the different growth media, followed by multivariate data analysis. Growth media prepared using fermented BSG was found to be able to support the growth in R. toruloides (21.4 mg/ml) in comparable levels to YPD media (24.7 mg/ml). Therefore, the fermented BSG media was able to fulfill the requirement as a nitrogen source for R. toruloides growth. This media was able to sustain normal metabolomics activity in yeast, as indicated by the level of fatty acid and carotenoid production. This can be explained by the fact that, in the fermented BSG media metabolites and amino acids were found to be higher than in the unfermented media, and close to the levels in YPD media. Taken together, our study provided evidence of a growth media for yeast using BSG. This should have potential in replacing components in the current yeast culture media in a sustainable and cost effective manner.",

    "abstract": "Sustainable exploitation of agro-industrial by-products has attracted great interest in cereal bran valorization. In this research, a polyphasic approach has been carried out to characterize maize bran at microbiological and chemical level during a sourdough like fermentation process, in order to enhance its technological and nutritional properties. Autochthonous microbiota was isolated at different refreshment steps and subjected to identification and molecular characterization. Fermentation was characterized by a rapid increase in lactic acid bacteria and yeasts, with a co-dominance, at the initial stage, of Weissella spp., Pediococcus spp. and Wickerhamomyces anomalus. At the end of the fermentation, a natural selection was produced, with the prevalence of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis and Kazachstania unispora. This is the first time that a specific association between LAB and yeasts is reported, during the maize bran fermentation process. Enzymatic activities related to this microbial consortium promoted a \"destructuration\" of the fiber fraction, an increase in soluble dietary fiber and a reduction of phytic acid content. Our data also evidenced a noticeable increment in ferulic acid. The results obtained indicate that fermentation processes represent an efficient biotechnological approach to increase nutritional and functional potential of maize bran. Moreover, the characterization of microbiota involved in natural fermentation process will allow the selection of specific biotypes, with appropriate metabolic and enzymatic activities, to conduct \"tailored\" fermentation processes and improve brans or whole-meal flours from both nutritional and technological points of view.",

Although 5-HTP has therapeutic effects in various symptoms, efficient method of producing 5-HTP has not been established. In this study, we developed a novel cofactor regeneration process to achieve enhanced synthesis of 5-HTP by using modified l-phenylalanine 4-hydroxylase of Chromobacterium violaceum. For the synthesis of 5-HTP using Escherichia coli whole cell bioconversion, l-tryptophan and 5-HTP degradation by E. coli endogenous catabolic enzymes should be considered. The tryptophanase gene was disrupted using the λ red recombination system, since tryptophanase is postulated as an initial enzyme for the degradation of l-tryptophan and 5-HTP in E. coli. For regeneration of the cofactor pterin, we screened and investigated several key enzymes, including dihydropteridine reductase from E. coli, glucose dehydrogenase from Bacillus subtilis, and pterin-4α-carbinolamine dehydratase from Pseudomonas syringae. Genes encoding these three enzymes were overexpressed in an E. coli tryptophanase-deficient host, resulting in the synthesis of 0.74 mM 5-HTP in the presence of 0.1 mM pterin and the synthesis of 0.07 mM 5-HTP in the absence of regeneration of pterin. These results clearly indicated the successful regeneration of pterin. Following optimization of the reaction conditions, 2.5 mM 5-HTP was synthesized with cofactor regeneration, while 0.8 mM 5-HTP was recovered without cofactor regeneration under the same reaction conditions, suggesting that the principle described here provides a new method for cofactor regeneration.",

Acetate is an effective agent for the prevention of bacterial contamination, but it negatively affects the fermentation ability of S. cerevisiae. We have proposed that the combined use of organic acids including acetate and lactate and yeast strains tolerant to organic acids may be effective for the elimination of principally lactic acid bacterial (LAB) contamination. In a previous study employing laboratory S. cerevisiae strains, we showed that overexpression of the HAA1 gene, which encodes a transcriptional activator, could be a useful molecular breeding method for acetate-tolerant yeast strains. In the present study, we constructed a HAA1-overexpressing diploid strain (MATa/α, named ER HAA1-OP) derived from the industrial bioethanol strain Ethanol Red (ER). ER HAA1-OP showed tolerance not only to acetate but also to lactate, and this tolerance was dependent on the increased expression of HAA1 gene. The ethanol production ability of ER HAA1-OP was almost equivalent to that of the parent strain during the bioethanol production process from sugarcane molasses in the absence of acetate. The addition of acetate at 0.5% (w/v, pH 4.5) inhibited the fermentation ability of the parent strain, but such an inhibition was not observed in the ethanol production process using ER HAA1-OP.",

Automatic genome annotation of S. proteamaculans made possible the identification of a single endoglucanase encoding gene, designated spr cel8A. The predicted protein, named Spr Cel8A shows high similarity (59–94 %) to endo-1,4-β-d-glucanases (EC 3.2.1.4) from the glycoside hydrolase family 8 (GH8). The gene spr cel8A has an ORF of 1113 bp, encoding a 371 amino acid residue protein (41.2 kDa) with a signal peptide of 23 amino acid residues. Expression of the gene spr cel8A in Escherichia coli yields a mature recombinant endoglucanase 39 kDa. Cel8A displayed optimal activity at pH 7.0 and 40 °C, with a specific activity of 0.85 U/mg. The enzyme was stable at pH from 4 to 8.5, retaining nearly 40–80 % of its original activity, and exhibited a half-life of 8 days at 40 °C.

The final principle products of Spr Cel8A-mediated hydrolysis of CMC were cellobiose, cello oligosaccharides and a small amount of glucose, suggesting that Spr Cel8A is an endo-β-1,4-glucanase manifesting exo-activity. This is the first report regarding the functional biochemical and molecular characterization of an endoglucanase from S. proteamaculans, found in the gut-associated bacteria community of Dendroctonus bark beetles. These results contribute to improved understanding of the functional role played by this bacterium as a symbiont of bark beetles.",

    "abstract": "Twelve white rot fungi (WRF) strains were screened on agar plates for their ability to bleach humic acid (HA). Four fungal strains were selected and tested in liquid media for removal of HA. Bioremediation was investigated by HA color removal and changes in the concentration and molecular size distribution of HA by size exclusion chromatography. Trametes versicolor and Phanerochaete chrysosporium showed the highest HA removal efficiency, reaching about 80%. Laccase and manganese peroxidase were measured as extracellular enzymes and their relation to the HA removal by WRF was investigated. Results indicated that nitrogen limitation could enhance the WRF extracellular enzyme activity, but did not necessarily increase the HA removal by WRF. The mechanism of bioremediation by WRF was shown to involve biosorption of HA by fungal biomass and degradation of HA to smaller molecules. Also, contradicting previous reports, it was shown that the decolorization of HA by WRF could not necessarily be interpreted as degradation of HA. Biosorption experiments revealed that HA removal by fungal biomass is dependent not only on the amount of biomass as the sorbent, but also on the fungal species. The involvement of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes was confirmed by comparing the HA removal capability of fungi with and without the presence of a CYP inhibitor. The ability of purified laccase from WRF to solely degrade HA was proven and the importance of mediators was also demonstrated.",

Laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila was immobilized onto BC membranes and retained up to 88% of residual activity after immobilization. Four compounds belonging to the flavonoids family were chosen to test the in situ polymerase activity of immobilized laccase. All the flavonoids were successfully polymerized by laccase giving rise to yellow, orange and dark brown oligomers which conferred color to the BC support. The optimal bio-coloration conditions were studied for two of the tested flavonoids, catechol and catechin, by varying the concentration and time of incubation. High color depth and resistance to washing were obtained for both compounds. The highly porous bacterial cellulose material demonstrated great performance as a bio-coloration support, in contrast to other materials cited in literature, like cotton or wool. The process developed is presented as an environmentally friendly alternative for bacterial cellulose bio-coloration and will contribute deeply for the development of new fashionable products within this material.",

Dynamic systems, whose hallmark is the presence of continuous flow, have been considered the most appropriate for the study of the last stage of the biofilm lifecycle: biofilm disassembly. However, fed-batch is still the most used system in the biofilm research field. Hence, we have used a fed-batch system to collect cells released from Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms, one of the most important etiological agents of medical device-associated biofilm infections. Herein, we showed that using this model it was possible to collect cells released from biofilms formed by 12 different S. epidermidis clinical and commensal isolates. In addition, our data indicated that biofilm disassembly occurred by both passive and active mechanisms, although the last occurred to a lesser extent. Moreover, it was observed that S. epidermidis biofilm-released cells presented higher tolerance to vancomycin and tetracycline, as well as a particular gene expression phenotype when compared with either biofilm or planktonic cells. Using this model, biofilm-released cells phenotype and their interaction with the host immune system could be studied in more detail, which could help providing significant insights into the pathophysiology of biofilm-related infections.",

However, most yeasts ferment glucose first before consuming pentoses, due to glucose repression. This preferential utilization results in delayed fermentation time and lower productivity. Therefore, co-fermentation of lignocellulosic sugars could achieve cost-effective conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to microbial lipid. Comprehensive screening of oleaginous yeasts capable of simultaneously utilizing glucose, xylose, and L-arabinose was performed by measuring the concentration of sugars remaining in the medium and of lipids accumulated in the cells. We found that of 1189 strains tested, 12 had the ability to co-ferment the sugars. The basidiomycete yeast Pseudozyma hubeiensis IPM1-10, which had the highest sugars consumption rate of 94.1 %, was selected by culturing in a batch culture with the mixed-sugar medium. The strain showed (1) simultaneous utilization of all three sugars, and (2) high lipid-accumulating ability. This study suggests that P. hubeiensis IPM1-10 is a promising candidate for second-generation biodiesel production from hydrolysate of lignocellulosic biomass.",

A small-scale high throughput 96 deep-well micro-culture method was utilised to cultivate the two strains in mineral salt medium (MSM) supplemented with the water miscible (glucose, glycerol, fructose and sucrose) and water immiscible carbon sources (diesel, kerosene and sunflower oil) under the same growth conditions. The biosurfactants produced by the two strains were isolated by acid precipitation followed by an organic solvent extraction. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry was utilised to analyse yields and characterise the biosurfactant variants. For B. amyloliquefaciens ST34, maximum surfactin production was observed in the MSM supplemented with fructose (28 mg L−1). In addition, four surfactin analogues were produced by ST34 using the different substrates, however, the C13–C15 surfactins were dominant in all extracts. For P. aeruginosa ST5, maximum rhamnolipid production was observed in the MSM supplemented with glucose (307 mg L−1). In addition, six rhamnolipid congeners were produced by ST5 using different substrates, however, Rha–Rha–C10–C10 and Rha–C10–C10 were the most abundant in all extracts. This study highlights that the carbon sources utilised influences the yield and analogues/congeners of surfactin and rhamnolipids produced by B. amyloliquefaciens and P. aeruginosa, respectively. Additionally, glucose and fructose were suitable substrates for rhamnolipid and surfactin, produced by P. aeruginosa ST5 and B. amyloliquefaciens ST34, which can be exploited for bioremediation or as antimicrobial agents.",

This study was designed to optimize the black rice bran fermentation conditions for the total anthocyanin (ACN) content, total antioxidant properties, and relative activity of β-glucosidase (BGS) by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The Box-Behnken design and response surface methodology was employed to achieve the maximum response in fermentation. The kinetic analysis of HPLC based phytochemical determination and bioconversion of ACN, and in vitro antioxidant assays were performed during fermentation. The optimum pH, temperature and NaCl concentration to achieve maximum ACN content, antioxidant capacity, and BGS activity were pH 4.0, 40 °C, and 0.5%, respectively. Bioconversion of cyanidin-3-glucoside and peonidin-3-glucoside to cyanidin and peonidin was recorded at a significant level, respectively. The maximum activity of BGS on rice bran was noticed at 24 h of fermentation. The results suggested that phytochemical content was not changed significantly, whereas the antioxidant properties of rice bran were slightly enhanced after 24 h of fermentation. Additional detailed in vivo evaluation is required to explain the impact of submerged fermentation on the bioactivity of rice bran.",

Heterotrophic growth is the dominant step in Phase I (to increase microalgal biomass) and photoautotrophic growth occurs in Phase II (to improve biomass concentration and lipid production). The results show that the addition of the low-cost antioxidant sodium erythorbate (8 g L-1) significantly accelerates the growth of microalgae in the first stage with air aeration. Furthermore, a higher CO2 fixation rate was obtained in the second stage (at least 344.32 mg CO2 L-1 day-1) with 10% CO2 aeration. This approximately corresponds to an increase of 177% over simple photoautotrophic cultivation with 10% CO2 aeration during the whole period. The two-stage cultivation strategy achieved a maximum C. vulgaris biomass concentration of 3.45 g L-1 and lipid productivity of 43.70 mg L-1 day-1, which are 1.85 and 1.64 times those arising due to simple photoautotrophy, respectively. Moreover, an analysis of the product's fatty acid profile indicates that C. vulgaris might be an ideal candidate for two-stage mixotrophic cultivation of a renewable biomass for use in biodiesel applications. Another interesting point to note from the study is that it is an insufficiency of N and CO2 that probably limits the further growth of C. vulgaris.",

MIC of S. cumini was found to be 0.3 mg/ml. Genomic DNA degradation of B. subtilis reveals apoptosis and FE-scanning electron microscope indicates cell wall cracking on several intervals of time. Results of propidium iodide staining showed few bacterial cells were stained in control; however population of stained cells increased after exposing them for varying period of time. Flow cytometric kinetic data analysis on the membrane permeabilization in bacterial cell showed the significant contribution of antimicrobial potential of the seed extract on antimicrobial-induced permeabilization. In silico analysis revealed two components of S. cumini methanolic extract to be active against four enzymes (PDB ID-1W5D, 4OX3, 3MFD and 5E2F) which are crucial for plasma membrane synthesis in B. subtilis. Moreover lupeol showed highest binding energy for macromolecule 1W5D and 4OX3 forming one hydrogen bond each whereas stigmasterol showed the highest binding energy for macromolecule 3MFD and 5E2F forming four hydrogen bonds and alkyl bonds respectively.

The results indicate that in multiple-cycle batch system, the feedstock had a minor impact on the fermentation than in single-cycle batch system, however the rough yeast contamination was more harmful than the bacterial contamination in multiple-cycle batch fermentation. The inoculation of both contaminants did not potentiate the detrimental effect in any substrate. The residual sugar concentration in the fermented broth had a higher concentration of fructose than glucose for all fermentations, but in the presence of the rough yeast, the discrepancy between fructose and glucose concentrations were markedly higher, especially in molasses. The biggest problem associated with incomplete fermentation seemed to be the lower consumption rate of sugar and the reduced fructose preference of the rough yeast rather than the lower invertase activity. Lower ethanol production, acetate production and higher residual sugar concentration are characteristics strongly associated with the rough yeast strain and they were not potentiated with the inoculation of L. fermentum.",

    "abstract": "Azo dyes are complex derivatives of diazene used in food and textile manufacture. They are highly recalcitrant compounds, and account for severe environmental and health problems. Different strains of Pseudomonas species were isolated from textile wastewater effluents. The bioconversion of Remazol black B (a commonly used water soluble dye) by Pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed in static conditions. The bio-decolorization process was optimized by a multi factorial Plackett-Burman experimental design. Decolorization of 200 mg L-1 reached 100% in 32 h. Interestingly, the presence of yeast extract, magnesium and iron in the culture media, highly accelerated the rate of decolorization. Moreover, one of our isolates, P. aeruginosa KY284155, was kept high degradation rates at high pH (pH = 9), which represents the pH of most textile wastewater effluents, and was able to tolerate high concentration of dye up to 500 mg L-1. In bacteria, azo-dye degradation is often initiated by reductive azo compound cleavage catalyzed by azo-reductases. Three genes encoding azo-reductases, paazoR1, paazoR2 and paazoR3, could be identified in the genome of the isolated P. aeruginosa stain (B1). Bioinformatics analyses of the paazoR1, paazoR2 and paazoR3 genes reveal their prevalence and conservation in other P. aeruginosa strains. Chemical oxygen demand dramatically decreased and phyto-detoxification of the azo dye was accomplished by photocatalytic post treatment of the biodegradation products. We suggest applying combined biological photocatalytic post treatment for azo dyes on large scale, for effective, cheap decolorization and detoxification of azo-dyes, rendering them safe enough to be discharged in the environment.",

The EPS of three granular anaerobic sludges of different origins were studied and compared. Particularly, the peptides from the protein fraction were identified by mass spectrometry. Desulfoglaeba and Treponema bacterial genera and Methanosaeta and Methanobacterium archaeal genera were prominent in all three sludges. Methanosaeta concilii proteins were the most represented in EPS of all three sludges studied. Principally, four proteins found in the three sludges, the S-layer protein, the CO-methylating acetyl-CoA synthase, an ABC transporter substrate-binding protein and the methyl-coenzyme M reductase, were expressed by Methanosaeta concilii. Mainly catabolic enzymes were found from the 45 proteins identified in the protein fraction of EPS. This suggests that EPS may have a role in allowing extracellular catabolic reactions.",

    "abstract": "The responses of denitrifiers and denitrification ability to dissolved oxygen (DO) concent in different layers of surface lake sediments are still poorly understood. Here, the optimal denitrification condition was constructed based on response surface methodology (RSM) to analyze the denitrification characteristics of surface sediments. The aerobic zone (AEZ), hypoxic zone (HYZ), up-anoxic zone (ANZ-1) and sub-anoxic zone (ANZ-2) were partitioned based on the oxygen contents, and sediments were collected using a customized-designed sub-millimeter scale sampling device. Integrated real-time quantitative PCR, Illumina Miseq-based sequencing and denitrifying enzyme activities analysis revealed that denitrification characteristics varied among different DO layers. Among the four layers, the DNA abundance and RNA expression levels of norB, nirS and nosZ were the highest at the aerobic layer, hypoxic layer and up-axoic layer, respectively. The hypoxia and up-anaerobic layer were the active nitrogen removal layers, since these two layers displayed the highest DNA abundance, RNA expression level and enzyme activities of denitrification functional genes. The abundance of major denitrifying bacteria showed significant differences among layers, with Azoarcus, Pseudogulbenkiania and Rhizobium identified as the main nirS, nirK and nosZ-based denitrifiers. Pearson's correlation revealed that the response of denitrifiers to environmental factors differed greatly among DO layers. Furthermore, napA showed higher DNA abundance and RNA expression level in the aerobic and hypoxic layers than anaerobic layers, indicating that aerobic denitrifiers might play important roles at these layers.",

Although it is well known the importance of those modules in cell wall degrading process, their function is not yet fully understood. Here, we analyze the cellulose-hydrolysis activity enhancement promoted by the cellobiohydrolase I carbohydrate-binding module from Trichoderma harzianum. It was cloned, expressed, purified and used in combination with either a commercial cellulase preparation, T. reesei cellobiohydrolase I or its separate catalytic domain to hydrolyze filter paper. In all cases the amount of glucose released was increased, reaching up to 30% gain when the carbohydrate-binding module was added to the reaction. We also show that this effect seems to be mediated by a decrease in the recalcitrance of the cellulosic substrate. This effect was observed both for crystalline cellulose samples which underwent incubation with the CBM prior to application of cellulases and for the ones incubated simultaneously. Our studies demonstrate that family 1 carbohydrate-binding modules are able to potentiate the enzymatic degradation of the polysaccharides and their application might contribute to diminishing the currently prohibitive costs of the lignocellulose saccharification process.",

Here we report a simple and sensitive plate assay for screening alginate lyase-excreting microorganisms from brown algae. Brown algae Laminaria japonica, Sargassum horneri and Sargassum siliquatrum were cultured in sterile water. Bacteria growing on the surface of seaweeds were identified and their capacity of excreting alginate lyase was analyzed. A total of 196 strains were recovered from the three different algae samples and 12 different bacterial strains were identified capable of excreting alginate lyases. Sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene revealed that these alginate lyase-excreting strains belong to eight genera: Paenibacillus (4/12), Bacillus (2/12), Leclercia (1/12), Isoptericola (1/12), Planomicrobium (1/12), Pseudomonas (1/12), Lysinibacillus (1/12) and Sphingomonas (1/12). Further analysis showed that the LJ-3 strain (Bacillus halosaccharovorans) had the highest enzyme activity. To our best knowledge, this is the first report regarding alginate lyase-excreting strains in Paenibacillus, Planomicrobium and Leclercia.

    "abstract": "The effect of varying concentrations of the nitrogen source on the growth kinetics, lipid accumulation, lipid and DHA productivity, and fatty acid composition of C. cohnii was elucidated. Growth of C. cohnii was in three distinct growth stages: cell growth, lipid accumulation and a final lipid turnover stage. Most of lipids were accumulated in lipid accumulation stage (48–120 h) though, slow growth rate was observed during this stage. NaNO3 supported significantly higher lipid content (26.9% of DCW), DHA content (0.99 g/L) and DHA yield (44.2 mg/g glucose) which were 2.5 to 3.3-folds higher than other N-sources. The maximum level of C16–C18 content (% TFA) was calculated as 43, 54 and 43% in lipid accumulation stage under low nitrogen (LN, 0.2 g/L), medium nitrogen (MN, 0.8 g/L) and high nitrogen (HN, 1.6 g/L) treatments, respectively. Cultures with LN, by down-regulating cell metabolism, trigger onset of lipogenic enzymes. Conversely, NAD+/NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD+/NADP+-ICDH) were less active in LN than HN treatments which resulted in retardation of Kreb's Cycle and thereby divert citrate into cytoplasm as substrate for ATP-citrate lyase (ACL). Thereby, ACL and fatty acid synthase (FAS) were most active in lipid accumulation stage at LN treatments. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) was more active than malic enzyme (ME) in lipid accumulation stage and showed higher activities in NaNO3 than other N-sources. This represents that G6PDH contributes more NADPH than ME in C. cohnii. However, G6PDH and ME together seems to play a dual role in offering NADPH for lipid biosynthesis. This concept of ME together with G6PD in offering NADPH for lipogenesis might be novel in this alga and needed to be explored.",

    "abstract": "Cysteine is an important amino acid for various industries; however, there is no efficient microbial fermentation-based production method available. Owing to its cytotoxicity, bacterial intracellular levels of cysteine are stringently controlled via several modes of regulation, including cysteine degradation by cysteine desulfhydrases and cysteine desulfidases. In Escherichia coli, several metabolic enzymes are known to exhibit cysteine degradative activities, however, their specificity and physiological significance for cysteine detoxification via degradation are unclear. Relaxing the strict regulation of cysteine is crucial for its overproduction; therefore, identifying and modulating the major degradative activity could facilitate the genetic engineering of a cysteine-producing strain. In the present study, we used genetic screening to identify genes that confer cysteine resistance in E. coli and we identified yhaM, which encodes cysteine desulfidase and decomposes cysteine into hydrogen sulfide, pyruvate, and ammonium. Phenotypic characterization of a yhaM mutant via growth under toxic concentrations of cysteine followed by transcriptional analysis of its response to cysteine showed that yhaM is cysteine-inducible, and its physiological role is associated with resisting the deleterious effects of cysteine in E. coli. In addition, we confirmed the effects of this gene on the fermentative production of cysteine using E. coli-based cysteine-producing strains. We propose that yhaM encodes the major cysteine-degrading enzyme and it has the most significant role in cysteine detoxification among the numerous enzymes reported in E. coli, thereby providing a core target for genetic engineering to improve cysteine production in this bacterium.",

    "abstract": "Vanillin is valuable and popular flavor used in foods and cosmetics. Many bacteria species have the ability to decarboxylate substituted cinnamic acids in order to form vanillin. However, the phenolic biotransformation including vanillin production in a common fungus, the Aspergillus luchuensis, which is used in distilled beverages, has not yet been clarified. This study focused on elucidating the vanillin production due to phenolic biotransformation in A. luchuensis during fermentation. The phenolic metabolites were extracted by a solid phase column and they were determined using on LC/MS and LC/MS/MS in a selective ion mode. As a result, ferulic acid, vanillin and vanillic acid, were detected in the rice koji fermentationed by A. luchuensis and also fermentated with yeast. In addition, the accurate molecular formula of vanillin glucoside (C14H17O8, 313.0927, (M-H)- and its production ions was also determined by HRESI-mass spectrometry. Based on the results including the phenolic metabolites and related genes found in A. luchuensis genome, this study proposed the vanillin production mechanism due to the side chain cleavage of ferulic acid through Coenzyme A (CoA) and feruloyl-CoA hydratase/lyase, to form vanillin and acetyl-COA. In this study, another possible vanillin production pathway also was proposed due to the neutral hexose hydrolysis of vanillin glucoside. The subsequent dehydrogenation of vanillin produced vanillic acid. In addition, vanillin was detected in the distilled alcohol indicating its contribution to the aroma profile of beverages. It has been unknown that the vanillin in the distilled solution is derived from the vanillin produced during rice-koji and/or moromi mash fermentations.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of ultrasound to reduce the estrogen (E1) and 17 beta-estradiol (E2) from municipal wastewater. Hence, a cylindrical batch reactor was designed. The effects of powers, frequency, exposure time and pH on reduction efficiency were investigated. The residual concentration of E1 and E2 hormones was measured in reactor effluent by electrochemiluminescence (ECL) method. The results showed that ultrasound removed 85–96% of both E1 and E2 hormones after 45 min while other parameters changes in the range of their operations. Also, the frequency and power of ultrasound had a significant effect on reduction efficiency of hormones while the exposure had no significant effect. Furthermore, the interaction of power and frequency reduced their efficacy to 64.3% (Pvalue = 0.005). The result also indicated that the ultrasound waves have high ability to reduce Steroid hormones from municipal wastewater. The proposed method can be considered as one of the significant strategies for reduction or destruction of hormones from wastewater due to the non-generation of dangerous by-products and the low energy consumption.",

    "abstract": "The constant growing demand for vegetable oil for biodiesel and food is raising many environmental concerns about the sustainability of its production based on crops. Oleaginous yeasts show great potential to end with those concerns due to their high lipid productivity in small areas. To evaluate their productivity in lipids, an efficient and reproducible extraction process should be used. As no standard extraction process is available for the extraction of yeast lipids, an optimized extraction process is presented. In this work, the lipids extraction process for the yeasts Rhodotorula glutinis and Lipomyces kononenkoae is optimized using bead beating for cell rupture and introducing adaptations of the two most used extraction methods (Bligh and Dyer and Folch). For Rhodotorula g. the optimum extraction conditions are obtained by the Bligh and Dyer method applying 4.8 cycles of 47 s with 0.7 g of glass beads. For Lipomyces k. the optimum extraction conditions make use of the Folch method applying seven cycles of 42 s with 0.54 g of glass beads. These results reinforce the idea that, for each yeast, different extraction processes may be needed to correctly determine the lipid yield. The extraction procedure was further evaluated with less harmful solvents. Toluene was tested as a possible substitute of chloroform, and ethanol as a possible substitute of methanol. With the optimized extraction process, better results for Lipomyces k. were obtained using toluene and ethanol, while for Rhodotorula g. toluene proved to be a valid substitute of chloroform but ethanol is far less effective than methanol.",

These enzymes typically require a set of redox partner proteins, whose number and identities were not described until very recently in the case of guaiacol. In this work we identified two proteins involved in guaiacol demethylation by the actinomycete Rhodococcus rhodochrous. Additionally, we constructed four different polycistronic operons carrying combinations of putative redox partners of this guaiacol demethylation system in an inducible expression plasmid that was introduced into the Gram negative host Pseudomonas putida EM42, and the guaiacol consumption dynamics of each resulting strain were analyzed. All the polycistronic operons, expressing a cytochrome P450 together with a putative ferredoxin reductase from R. rhodochrous and putative ferredoxins from R. rhodochrous or Amycolatopsis ATCC 39116 enabled P. putida EM42 to metabolize and grow on guaiacol as the sole carbon source.",

In this study, we explored the potential of waste canola oil as a low-cost and environmentally friendly substrate for the production of rhamnolipids by P. aeruginosa. Four different 23 full factorial designs were used to assess the effect of three independent factors on rhamnolipid production, including carbon source (canola oil and waste canola oil), nitrogen source [(NH4)2SO4 and NaNO3] and production time (7 and 14 days). The highest observed yield was 3585.31 ± 66.24 mg/L when P. aeruginosa was cultured for 14 days with 3% v/v waste canola oil and 4 g/L of NaNO3. The nitrogen source proved to be a crucial factor, as the use of NaNO3 rather than (NH4)2SO4 led to a 30-fold increase in production yield. The observed yield when waste canola oil was used was similar to, and even slightly higher than, that obtained using canola oil. Our results showed that waste canola oil has great potential for use as a carbon source for rhamnolipid production by P. aeruginosa, thus paving the way for the development of a low-cost, efficient, and environmentally friendly bioprocess for the production of rhamnolipids.",

This genome reduced strain was named IIG-Bs20-5-1 and lacks, amongst others, genes synthesizing the lipopeptide plipastatin, the antibiotic bacilysin, toxins and prophages, as well as genes involved in sporulation. Amongst all temperatures tested, 37 °C was overall superior. In comparison to the reference strain JABs24, a surfactin synthesizing variant of B. subtilis 168, strain IIG-Bs20-5-1 was both aerobically and anaerobically superior with respect to specific growth rates µ and yields YX/S. However, in terms of surfactin production, strain JABs24 reached higher absolute concentrations with up to 1147.03 mg/L and 296.37 mg/L under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively. Concomitant, strain JABs24 reached higher YP/S and YP/X. Here, an outstanding YP/X of 1.541 g/g was obtained under anaerobic conditions at 37 °C. The current study indicates that the employed genome reduced strain IIG-Bs20-5-1 has several advantages over the strain JABs24 such as better conversion from glucose into biomass and higher growth rates. However, regarding surfactin synthesis and yields, the strain was overall inferior at the investigated temperatures and oxygen conditions. Further studies addressing process development and strain engineering should be performed combining the current observed advantages of the genome reduced strain to increase the surfactin yields and to construct a tailor-made genome reduced strain to realize the theoretically expected advantages of such genome reduced strains.",

Hereby a total of five copies of ganA cassettes in which the ganA gene was fused with the glucitol-promoter were inserted in the recipient chromosome wherein hypothetical, sporulation and protease genes were deleted. The strain with five copies of ganA expression cassette showed a β-galactosidase activity similar to the one with the same gene on a pUB110 derived multi-copy plasmid and under the same regulatory control of the glucitol promoter and GutR activator. The production of β-galactosidase in the strain with the multi-copy plasmid decreased rapidly when growth was performed under induced conditions and without antibiotic selection. In contrast, the strain with the five copies of ganA in the chromosome produced β-galactosidase for at least 40 generations. This demonstrates that the CRISPR/Cas9 system is a valuable and easy tool for constructing stable producer strains. The bigger efforts that are needed for the multiple target gene integration into the chromosome compared to cloning in expression vectors were justified by the higher stability of the target genes and the lack of antibiotic resistance genes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Corn grain has a high starch content and is used as main energy source in ruminant diets. Compared with finely ground corn (FGC), steam-flaked corn (SFC) could improve the milk yield of lactating dairy cows and the growth performance of feedlot cattle, but the detailed mechanisms underlying those finding are unknown. The rumen microbiome breaks down feedstuffs into energy substrates for the host animals, and contributes to feed efficiency. Therefore, the current study was conducted to investigate the ruminal bacterial community changes of heifers fed differently processed corn (SFC or FGC) using 16S rRNA sequencing technologies, and to uncover the detailed mechanisms underlying the high performance of ruminants fed the SFC diet. The results revealed that different processing methods changed the rumen characteristics and impacted the composition of the rumen bacteria. The SFC diet resulted in an increased average daily gain in heifers, an increased rumen propionate concentration and a decreased rumen ammonia nitrogen concentration. The relative abundance of the phylum Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were tended to increase or significantly increased in the heifers fed SFC diet compared with FGC diet. In addition, the relative abundance of amylolytic bacteria of the genera Succinivibrio , Roseburia and Blautia were elevated, and the cellulolytic bacteria ( Ruminococcaceae_UCG - 014 and Ruminococcaceae_UCG - 013 ) were decreased by the steam flaking method. Spearman correlation analysis between the ruminal bacteria and the microbial metabolites showed that the rumen propionate concentration was positively correlated with genera Succinivibrio and Blautia abundance, but negatively correlated with genera Ruminococcaceae_UCG - 014 abundance. Evident patterns of efficient improvement in rumen propionate and changes in rumen microbes to further improve feed conversion were identified. This observation uncovers the potential mechanisms underlying the increased efficiency of the SFC processing method for enhancing ruminant performance.",

Tannase is an enzyme used by various industries for degradation of tannin. Biochemical characterization of a specific enzyme from one organism to other is one of the ways to search for enzymes with better traits for industrial applications. Here, tannase encoding gene from Staphylococcus lugdunensis was cloned and suitability of the enzyme in various conditions was analysed to find its application in various industry. The recombinant protein was expressed with 6× His tag and purified using nickel affinity beads. The enzyme was purified up to homogeneity, with approximate molecular weight of 66 kDa. Purified tannase exhibited specific activity of about 716 U/mg. Optimum enzyme activity was found to be 40 °C at pH 7.0. Biochemical characterization revealed; metal ions such as Zn2+, Fe2+, Fe3+ and Mn2+ inhibited tannase activity, and SDS at lower concentration, increased tannase activity. Non polar organic solvents increased the tannase activity and polar solvents inhibited the tannase activity. Tannase immobilization studies show protection of the enzyme under wide range of pH and temperature. Also in this study we report a method for recovery and repeated use of the tannase.",

    "abstract": "Studies proved that addition of nitrate in rumen could lead to reduction of methane emission. The mechanism of this function was involved in the competition effect of nitrate on hydrogen consumption and the inhibitory effect of generated nitrite on methanogen proliferation. The present study investigated an alternative mechanism that denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidizing (DAMO) bacteria, DAMO archaea and anammox bacteria may co-exist in rumen, therefore, more methane can be oxidized when addition of nitrate. Ruminal batch culture model was used to test the effects of addition of 5 mM NaNO3, 4 mM NH4Cl, or both into the culture substrate on methane production, fermentation patterns, and population of methanogens, NC10 and anaerobic methanotrophic-2d (ANME-2d). Our results showed that NC10 in the ruminal culture was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) when using NC10 special primer sets, and addition of nitrate reduced methane production and the relative proportions of methanogen, whereas increased the relative proportion of NC10. A combined addition of ammonia salt and nitrate did not show further inhibitory effect on methane production but accelerated nitrate removal. We did not detect DAMO archaea in ruminal culture by real-time PCR when using ANME-2d special primer sets. The present study may encourage researchers to pay more attention to methane oxidation performed by anaerobic methanotroph when studying the strategies of inhibiting ruminal methane emission.",

Traditional approaches for studying pollen samples are based on microscopic observation which is laborious, time intensive and requires specialized palynological knowledge. Present study compares two composite honey metagenome collected from 20 samples in Mizoram, Northeast India using three gene loci- rbcL, matK and ITS2 that was sequenced using a next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform (Illumina Miseq). Furthermore, a classical palynology study for all 20 samples was carried out to evaluate the NGS approach. NGS based approach and pollen microscopic studies were able to detect the most abundant floral components of honey. We investigated the plants that were frequently used by honey bees by examining the results obtained from both the techniques. Microscopic examination of pollens detected plants with a broad taxonomic range covering 26 families. NGS based multigene approach revealed diverse plant species, which was higher than in any other previously reported techniques using a single locus. Frequently found herbaceous species were from the family Poaceae, Myrtaceae, Fabaceae and Asteraceae. The future NGS based approach using multi-loci target, with the help of an improved and robust plant database, can be a potential replacement technique for tedious microscopic studies to identify the polleniferous plants.",

Its mitigation is conducted by methane oxidizing bacteria that act as a biofilter using methane as their energy and carbon source. Since their first discovery in 1906, methanotrophs have been studied using a complementary array of methods. One of the most used molecular methods involves PCR amplification of the functional gene marker for the diagnostic of copper and iron containing particulate methane monooxygenase. To investigate the diversity of methanotrophs and to extend their possible molecular detection, we designed a new set of degenerate methane monooxygenase primers to target an 850 nucleotide long sequence stretch from pmoC to pmoA. The primers were based on all available full genomic pmoCAB operons. The newly designed primers were tested on various pure cultures, enrichment cultures and environmental samples using PCR. The results demonstrated that this primer set has the ability to correctly amplify the about 850 nucleotide long pmoCA product from Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and the NC10 phyla methanotrophs. The new primer set will thus be a valuable tool to screen ecosystems and can be applied in conjunction with previously used pmoA primers to extend the diversity of currently known methane-oxidizing bacteria.",

Fermentation conditions such as concentration of initial glucose in the culture, concentration of lactic acid accumulated in the culture, types of pH control strategy, types of aeration mode and different agitation speed had influenced the cultivation performance of batch fermentation of Pediococcus acidilactici. The maximum viable cell concentration obtained in constant fed-batch fermentation at a feeding rate of 0.015 L/h was 6.1 times higher with 1.6 times reduction in lactic acid accumulation compared to batch fermentation. Anion exchange resin, IRA 67 was found to have the highest selectivity towards lactic acid compared to other components studied. Fed-batch fermentation of P. acidilactici coupled with lactic acid removal system using IRA 67 resin showed 55.5 and 9.1 times of improvement in maximum viable cell concentration compared to fermentation without resin for batch and fed-batch mode respectively. The improvement of the P. acidilactici growth in the constant fed-batch fermentation indicated the use of minimal and simple process control equipment is an effective approach for reducing by-product inhibition. Further improvement in the cultivation performance of P. acidilactici in fed-bath fermentation with in situ addition of anion-exchange resin significantly helped to enhance the growth of P. acidilactici by reducing the inhibitory effect of lactic acid and thus increasing probiotic production.",

    "abstract": "In many cases in industrial biotechnology, substrate costs make up a major part of the overall production costs. One strategy to achieve more cost-efficient processes in general is to exploit cheaper sources of substrate. Small organic acids derived from fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass represent a significant proportion of microbially accessible carbon in bio-oil. However, using bio-oil for microbial cultivation is a highly challenging task due to its strong adverse effects on microbial growth as well as its complex composition. In this study, the suitability of bio-oil as a substrate for industrial biotechnology was investigated with special focus on organic acids. For this purpose, using the example of the genetically engineered, non-pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas putida KT2440 producing mono-rhamnolipids, cultivation on small organic acids derived from fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass, as well as on bio-oil fractions, was investigated and evaluated. As biosurfactants, rhamnolipids represent a potential bulk product of industrial biotechnology where substitution of traditional carbon sources is of conceivable interest. Results suggest that maximum achievable productivities as well as substrate-to-biomass yields are in a comparable range for glucose, acetate, as well as the mixture of acetate, formate and propionate. Similar yields were obtained for a pretreated bio-oil fraction, which was used as reference real raw material, although with significantly lower titers. As such, the reported process constitutes a proof-of-principle for using bio-oil as a potential cost-effective alternative carbon source in a future bio-based economy.",

    "abstract": "The \"replacing wood by grass\" project can partially resolve the conflict between mushroom production and balancing the ecosystem, while promoting agricultural economic sustainability. Pleurotus pulmonarius is an economically important edible and medicinal mushroom, which is traditionally produced using a substrate consisting of sawdust and cottonseed hulls, supplemented with wheat bran. A simplex lattice design was applied to systemically optimize the cultivation of P. pulmonarius using agro-residues as the main substrate to replace sawdust and cottonseed hulls. The effects of differing amounts of wheat straw, corn straw, and soybean straw on the variables of yield, mycelial growth rate, stipe length, pileus length, pileus width, and time to harvest were demonstrated. Results indicated that a mix of wheat straw, corn straw, and soybean straw may have significantly positive effects on each of these variables. The high yield comprehensive formula was then optimized to include 40.4% wheat straw, 20.3% corn straw, 18.3% soybean straw, combined with 20.0% wheat bran, and 1.0% light CaCO3 (C/N = 42.50). The biological efficiency was 15.2% greater than that of the control. Most encouraging was the indication that the high yield comprehensive formula may shorten the time to reach the reproductive stage by 6 days, compared with the control. Based on the results of this study, agro-residues may be used as a suitable substitution for sawdust and cottonseed hulls as the main cultivation substrates of P. pulmonarius. These results provide a theoretical basis for the \"replacing wood by grass\" project on edible mushroom cultivation.",

    "abstract": "Fermented pork fat (sa-um) is traditionally and extensively consumed in Northeast Indian region for several decades. However, no scientific reports are available regarding its nutritional value as well as its potential health risks. The objective of this work was essentially the characterization of sa-um using a polyphasic approach, viz., physicochemical, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI+-MS) and metagenomic analysis in order to gain an understanding of the nutrient contents and microbial population diversity. On a dry weight basis, about 91% fat, 2% carbohydrate and 0.70% protein were present. ESI+-MS analysis of sa-um revealed the presence of various polar and neutral lipids corresponding to monoacylglyceride, diacylglyceride and triacylglyceride species. The dominant bacterial phyla were Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. A total of 72 bacterial genera were identified, largely abundant with Clostridium species including C. butyricum, C. citroniae, C. methylpentosum, C. perfringens, C. saccharogumia and C. tetani. The imputed functional profiles of bacterial communities were predominantly involved in energy, carbohydrate and amino acid metabolisms. Furthermore, this study deduces the presence of pro-inflammatory molecules as well as antibiotic resistance genes associated with the bacterial families such as Bacillaceae, Bacteroidaceae, Clostridiaceae, Corynebacteriaceae and Enterobacteriaceae which might be a major health concern for the sa-um consuming population.",

Here, we report the expression and characterization of a predicted laccase (LAC_2.9) from the thermophilic bacterial strain Thermus sp. 2.9 and investigate its capacity to delignify lignocellulosic biomass. The purified enzyme displayed a blue color typical of laccases, showed strict copper dependence and retained 80% of its activity after 16 h at 70 °C. At 60 °C, the enzyme oxidized 2,2′-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate) (ABTS) and 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (DMP) at optimal pH of 5 and 6, respectively. LAC_2.9 had higher substrate specificity (kcat/KM) for DMP with a calculated value that accounts for one of the highest reported for laccases. Further, the enzyme oxidized a phenolic lignin model dimer. The incubation of steam-exploded eucalyptus biomass with LAC_2.9 and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT) as mediator changed the structural properties of the lignocellulose as evidenced by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA). However, this did not increase the yield of sugars released by enzymatic saccharification. In conclusion, LAC_2.9 is a thermostable laccase with potential application in the delignification of lignocellulosic biomass.",

Deconstruction of biomass by enzymes is perceived as recalcitrant while an inclusive breakdown mechanism remains to be discovered. Fungi such as Myceliophthora thermophila M77 appear to decompose natural biomass sources quite well. This work reports on this fungus fermentation property while producing cellulolytic enzymes using natural biomass substrates. Little hydrolytic activity was detected, insufficient to explain the large amount of biomass depleted in the process. Furthermore, this work makes a comprehensive account of extracellular proteins and describes how secretomes redirect their qualitative protein content based on the nature and chemistry of the nutritional source. Fungus grown on purified cellulose or on natural biomass produced secretomes constituted by: cellobiohydrolases, cellobiose dehydrogenase, β-1,3 glucanase, β-glucosidases, aldose epimerase, glyoxal oxidase, GH74 xyloglucanase, galactosidase, aldolactonase and polysaccharide monooxygenases. Fungus grown on a mixture of purified hemicellulose fractions (xylans, arabinans and arabinoxylans) produced many enzymes, some of which are listed here: xylosidase, mixed β-1,3(4) glucanase, β-1,3 glucanases, β-glucosidases, β-mannosidase, β-glucosidases, galactosidase, chitinases, polysaccharide lyase, endo β-1,6 galactanase and aldose epimerase. Secretomes produced on natural biomass displayed a comprehensive set of enzymes involved in hydrolysis and oxidation of cellulose, hemicellulose-pectin and lignin. The participation of oxidation reactions coupled to lignin decomposition in the breakdown of natural biomass may explain the discrepancy observed for cellulose decomposition in relation to natural biomass fermentation experiments.",

    "abstract": "The need for a broad spectrum antimicrobial mouthwash is highly desirable to reduce, control and prevent various types of dental diseases. Hence, research into the production of herbal toothpaste to suppress the incidence of dental diseases is pertinent. The present study formulated herbal toothpastes from edible and medicinal plants namely; Syzygium aromaticum, Dennettia tripetala, and Jatropha curcas latex. The antimicrobial activity of the toothpastes was assessed against some oral pathogenic microorganisms using agar well diffusion. Phytochemical analysis of S. aromaticum and D. tripetala revealed the presence of phenols, flavonoids, alkaloid, and saponins. The major constituent of the plants from gas chromatography mass spectrometer (GC/MS) analysis are eugenol (83.58%), caryophyllene (4.35%) and phenol, 2-methoxy-4-(2-propenyl)-, acetate (12.07%) from S. aromaticum, while D. tripetala had glutaric acid (57.57%), eugenol (2.9%), caryophyllene (1.12%), and 1,6,10-dodecatrien-3-ol, 3,7,11-trimethyl-,(E)- (3.36%). The pH and specific gravity of the formulated toothpastes respectively ranged from 8.57 to 9.67 and 1.08 to 1.10, while the pH and specific gravity of commercial toothpastes were from 5.39 to 8.55 and 0.97 to 1. 11 respectively. The formulated toothpastes have better and significant (P < 0.05) antimicrobial effect when compared to commercial toothpastes. The zones of inhibition of formulated toothpastes against the tested microorganisms ranged from 4.0 to 18.30 mm, while MIC ranged from 2.5 to 20.0 mg/mL. The formulated toothpastes exhibited potent antimicrobial property against the tested pathogens as a result of bioactive compounds in them. Hence, these biomolecules can be extracted for the production of safe and effective herbal-based toothpaste.",

Therefore, sewage containing to dyes must be purified before being discharged into the environment. The current study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of Alcea rosea root extract in Disperse red 60 and Reactive blue 19 dyes removal from synthetic sewage. In this study, the effect of different indices including pH (5–11), Alcea rosea concentration (50–300 mg/L) and initial dye concentration (10–80 mg/L) was investigated. During the tests, the coagulant was stirred with rapid mixing at a speed of 250 rpm for 2 min. In the following, the speed (30–60 rpm) and the time (10–25 min) were used for slow mixing and after mixing the effect of settling time (10–60 min) and temperature (20–70) on removal efficiency of Disperse and Reactive dyes was investigated. The results showed that the maximum of removal efficiency of Disperse and Reactive dyes in optimum conditions including (pH = 11, coagulant concentration = 200 and 250 mg/L, dye concentration 40 and 20 mg/L, speed 60 rpm, during 15 min with settling time 60 min and temperature 60 °C obtained 86% and 68%, respectively. According to the result, the Alcea rosea coagulant has the best ability in removing dyes from aqueous solutions and sewage, especially Disperse dyes. Disperse dye is much eliminated in the coagulation process due to its lower solubility, higher suspending materials and less required solved chemical oxygen demand to the total chemical oxygen demand (SCOD/TCOD).",

It is reported that the laboratory-grown H. sinensis mycelium has similar clinical efficacy and less associated toxicity compared to the wild O. sinensis. The research of the H. sinensis is becoming more and more important and urgent. To gain deeper insight into the biological and pharmacological mechanisms, we sequenced the genome of H. sinensis. The genome of H. sinensis (102.72 Mb) was obtained for the first time, with > 99% coverage. 10,200 protein-encoding genes were predicted based on the genome sequence. A detailed secondary metabolism analysis and structure verification of the main ingredients were performed, and the biosynthesis pathways of seven ingredients (mannitol, cordycepin, purine nucleotides, pyrimidine nucleotides, unsaturated fatty acid, cordyceps polysaccharide and sphingolipid) were predicted and drawn. Furthermore, infection process and mechanism of H. sinensis were studied and elaborated in this article. The enzymes involved in the infection mechanism were also predicted, cloned and expressed to verify the mechanism. The genes and proteins were predicted and annotated based on the genome sequence. The pathways of several active components in H. sinensis were predicted and key enzymes were confirmed. The work presented here would improve the understanding of the genetic basis of this organism, and contribute to further research, production and application of H. sinensis.",

In the classical optimization yeast peptone dextrose medium, inoculum size of two discs, incubation period of 6 days, production temperature of 25 ºC and pH 7 was best supportive for optimal growth and antimicrobial activity whereas maltose and ammonium nitrate were the best carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. The statistical optimization resulted in up to 1.33 fold increase in antimicrobial activity. Chloroform was found to be the best extractant. The chloroformic extract showed minimum inhibitory concentration ranging from 0.05 to 5 mg/ml and its microbicidal nature was established by viable cell count studies. The efficacy of the extract was also established in terms of post antibiotic effect which ranged from 2 to 20 h. The chloroformic extract exhibited the good antibiofilm potential and was also found to be biosafe.

    "abstract": "Colistin resistance in Enterobacteriaceae especially Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli is driving the evolution of pan drug resistant strains. Screening a library of 13 plant nutraceuticals led to the identification of acetyl shikonin and ursolic acid, which exhibited synergy with colistin against extremely drug resistant (XDR) clinical strains of E. coli (U3790) and K. pneumoniae (BC936). Ursolic acid caused a significant colistin MIC reversal of 16-fold in U3790 and 4-fold in BC936 strains. Ursolic acid also potentiated the bactericidal effect of colistin against both U3790 and BC936 by causing ~ 4 to 4.5 log fold decline in CFU of both clinical isolates in a time kill assay. At 2× minimum effective concentration, ursolic acid was non-toxic to zebrafish as evidenced by brain and liver enzyme profiles and by histopathology studies. In combination with colistin, ursolic acid reduced bacterial bioburden of U3790/BC936 by 1-1.58 log fold from the infected muscle tissue of zebrafish. Mechanistic explorations via studies on real time efflux, membrane potential and intracellular accumulation of dansyl chloride tagged colistin revealed that colistin efflux is inhibited by ursolic acid. In addition, ursolic acid also enhanced outer membrane permeability which probably facilitates colistin's attack on outer and inner membranes. Our study shows that ursolic acid synergizes with colistin by inhibiting colistin efflux in Enterobacteriaceae that helps to curtail colistin resistant Enterobacteriaceae.",

This isolate produces the two types of bacterial L-asparaginases, the intracellular type I and the extracellular type II. The catalytic activity of type II enzyme was much higher than that of type I and reached about 5.5 IU/ml/h. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that L-asparaginases of Bacillus licheniformis is clustered with those of Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus haloterans, Bacillus mojavensis and Bacillus tequilensis while it exhibits distant relatedness to L-asparaginases of other Bacillus subtilis species as well as to those of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Bacillus velezensis species. Upon comparison of Bacillus licheniformis L-asparaginase to those of the two FDA approved L-asparaginases of E. coli (marketed as Elspar) and Erwinia chrysanthemi (marketed as Erwinaze), it observed in a cluster distinct from- and with validly predicted antigenic regions number comparable to those of the two mentioned reference strains. It exhibited maximum activity at 40 °C, pH 8.6, 40 mM asparagine, 10 mM zinc sulphate and could withstand 500 mM NaCl and retain 70% of its activity at 70 °C for 30 min exposure time. Isolate enzyme productivity was improved by gamma irradiation and optimized by RSM experimental design (Box-Behnken central composite design). The optimum conditions for maximum L-asparaginase production by the improved mutant were 39.57 °C, 7.39 pH, 20.74 h, 196.40 rpm, 0.5% glucose, 0.1% ammonium chloride, and 10 mM magnesium sulphate. Taken together, Bacillus licheniformis L-asparaginase can be considered as a promising candidate for clinical application as antileukemic agent.",

However, these pathogens may cause many similar pathological changes, resulting in clinical isolates that are difficult to quickly and simultaneously detect and identify. Here, a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (m-PCR) assay is reported to rapidly identify targets genes ( phoA, KMT1, ureR, toxA, invA , and nuc ) of these six pathogens in clinical samples. Six pairs of specific primers were designed. The optimal reaction conditions, specificity, and sensitivity of the m-PCR assay were investigated. The results showed that betaine remarkably improved amplification of the target genes. Specific test results showed that all six pathogens were detected by the proposed m-PCR protocol without cross-amplification with viruses or parasites. Sensitivity test results showed that the m-PCR system could amplify the six target genes from bacterial genomes or cultures with template amounts of 500 pg or 2.8–8.6 × 10 3 colony forming units, respectively. Furthermore, the six bacterial pathogens isolated from the infected tissue samples were successfully identified. The proposed m-PCR assay is a useful tool to monitor and diagnose bacterial infection in birds with high specificity, sensitivity and throughput.",

There was considerable amount of studies on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for MP detection. However, the result interpretation of these developed LAMP assays was sophisticated and subjective. Therefore, we developed and evaluated a LAMP coupled with nanoparticle-based lateral flow biosensor (LFB) assay (LAMP-LFB) for simple, reliable, and objective identification of MP (MP-LAMP-LFB). Six primers specific to P1 gene of MP were designed, and the preferred temperature for this assay was confirmed to be 65 °C. The amplification products could be visually interpreted by LFB within 2 min. The MP-LAMP-LFB assay specifically identified DNA templates of MP, and no cross-reactivity with other pathogens was obtained. The limit of the detection for this assay was 600 fg of DNA templates in pure cultures, which was in complete accordance with colorimetric indicator detection and agarose gel electrophoresis analysis. This assay was applied to 209 oropharyngeal swab specimens collected from children with acute respiratory tract infection for clinical evaluation, and compared to real-time PCR detection. Using the LAMP-LFB and real-time PCR assay, the positive rates of MP were 47.8% and 31.6%, respectively. Results suggested that the LAMP-LFB assay displayed high sensitivity compared to real-time PCR method. In summary, LAMP-LFB assay established here was a simple, objective, and sensitive assay for MP detection, which can be widely applied in clinical settings, especially in rural areas.",

To investigate the prevalence and the characteristics of Salmonella in a pig slaughterhouse in Yangzhou, a total of 80 Salmonella isolates were isolated from 459 (17.43%) samples in 2016–2017. S. Derby (35/80, 43.75%) was the most prevalent, followed by S. Rissen (16/80, 20.00%) and S. Newlands (11/80, 13.75%). The highest rates of susceptibility were observed to cefoxitin (80/80, 100.0%) and amikacin (80/80, 100.0%), followed by aztreonam (79/80, 98.75%) and nitrofurantoin (79/80, 98.75%). The highest resistance rate was detected for tetracycline (65/80, 81.25%), followed by ampicillin (60/80, 75.00%), bactrim (55/80, 68.75%), and sulfisoxazole (54/80, 67.50%). Overall, 91.25% (73/80) of the isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic, while 71.25% (57/80) of the isolate strains were multidrug resistant in the antimicrobial susceptibility tested. In addition, 86.36% (19/22) of the 22 antimicrobial resistance genes in the isolates were identified. Our data indicated that the resistance to certain antimicrobials was significantly associated, in part, with antimicrobial resistance genes. Furthermore, 81.25% (65/80) isolates harbored the virulence gene of mogA , of which 2 Salmonella Typhimurium isolates carried the mogA , spvB and spvC virulence genes at the same time. The results showed that swine products in the slaughterhouse were contaminated with multidrug resistant Salmonella commonly, especially some isolates carry the spv virulence genes. The virulence genes might facilitate the dissemination of the resistance genes to consumers along the production chain, suggesting the importance of controlling Salmonella during slaughter for public health.",

Cloning and overexpression of the putative XR as well as knockout of the putative XDH genes generated strains with about threefold increased xylitol yield. Strains that combined both genetic modifications displayed fivefold increase in overall xylitol yield. Enzymatic activity assays with lysates of XR overexpressing and XDH knockout strains underlined the presumed functions of the respective genes. Furthermore, growth evaluation of the engineered strains on xylose as sole carbon source provides insights into xylose metabolism and its utilization for cell growth.",

We then investigated the microbiota present in raw feedstuffs: meat and bone meal, wheat, corn, canola, barley, soybean, millrun, sorghum, poultry oil, oats, limestone and bloodmeal from four geographically distinct feedstuff suppliers. Each of the feedstuffs had diverse microbial communities. The meat and bone meal and bloodmeal samples had the most complex and distinct microbial populations. There was substantial overlap in the phylogenetic composition found in the grain and seed samples: barley, canola, corn, millrun, oats, sorghum, soybean meal and wheat. Issues related to methodology, viability of microbial communities in the gut and feed, and the implications for biosecurity are discussed.",

In order to get insight into the individual protease involved in keratin hydrolysis, a keratinase designed as BsKER71 was cloned and expressed in Bacillus subtilis WB600. In silico analysis revealed that BsKER71 protein contained a mature protein of 36.1 kDa. Further, purified BsKER71 could hydrolyze a variety of natural proteins, such as fibrous protein, collagen protein, casein, keratin and bovine serum albumin. In addition, this keratinase exhibited high enzyme activity in a wide range of pH and optimal pH of 10.0 and 9.0 in the hydrolysis of casein and keratin, respectively. Similarly, the optimal temperature was 55 °C and 50 °C for the hydrolysis of above two substrates, respectively. The hydrolytic activity was significantly inhibited by phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), indicating the presence of serine residue in the active site. Moreover, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and phenanthroline moderately inhibited the hydrolytic activity. The catalytic activity was stimulated by Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ , but greatly inhibited by Cu 2+ . Furthermore, several chemicals exhibited different effects on the hydrolysis of casein and keratin by BsKER71.

    "abstract": "Abstract Endocellulase is a key cellulase for cellulosic material pretreatment in the industry by hydrolyzing long cellulose chains into short chains. To investigate the endocellulase characteristics from Bacillus subtilis 1AJ3, and increase its production yield, this paper cloned an endocellulase gene denoted CEL -5A from strain 1AJ3 and expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). The CEL -5A gene was sequenced with a full-length of 1500 bp, encoding a totally of 500 amino acids, and containing two domains: the GH5 family catalytic domain (CD) and the CBM3 family cellulose-binding domain (CBD). Recombinant endocellulase Cel-5A with a His-tag was purified of the Ni-NTA column, and SDS-PAGE results demonstrated that Cel-5A exhibited a molecular weight of 56.4 kDa. The maximum enzyme activity of Cel-5A was observed at pH 4.5 and 50 °C. Moreover, it was active over the broad temperature region of 30–60 °C, and stable within the pH range of 4.5–10.0. In addition, Co 2+ was able to increase enzyme activity, while the majority of metal ions demonstrated stable enzyme activity under low- concentration. The substrate specificity of Cel-5A exhibited a high specific activity on the β-1,3-1,4 glucan linkage from barley. The Michaelis–Menten constant and the maximum velocity of the recombinant Cel-5A for CMC-Na were determined as 14.87 mg/mL and 19.19 μmol/min/mg, respectively. When Cel-5A was applied to the switchgrass and coffee grounds, its color became lighter and the biomass was observed to loosen following hydrolyzation. The saccharification rate reached 12% of the total weight of switchgrass in 20 h. These properties highlight the potential application of Cel-5A as an endocellulase in the pretreatment of biomass, for example, in the coffee grounds/waste, and related industries.",

In this context, the present study was designed to investigate the potential of miR-143 in the treatment of breast cancer. Results showed that miR-143 to be significantly (P < 0.05) downregulated in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. The miR-143 has inhibitory effect on CAMA-1cell growth which was manifested as significant (P < 0.05) decline in loss of viability of cancer cells. The loss of cell viability was revealed to be due to the induction of apoptotic cell death as evident from acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining assays. The apoptotic cell percentage was found to be 35.7% in miR-143 mimics transfected in comparison to 6.4% in miR-NC transfected cells. The western blot analysis showed that miR-143 caused enhancement in Bax and suppression in Bcl-2 expression in CAMA-1 cells. The miR-143 also suppressed the bone metastasis of the CAMA-1 cells by suppressing the expression of Jag1 and deactivation of the Rho-signalling pathway. The transwell assays also showed considerable anti-metastatic effects of miR-143 on CAMA-1 cells. Taken together, miR-143 has growth inhibitory anti-metastatic effect on breast cancer and thus may prove beneficial in breast cancer treatment.",

To explore the effect of different fertilizers and biofertilizers on stevia plant, a two-year field experiment was conducted to investigate the growth response of stevia plants under the influence of nitrogenous fertilizers (NFs) and effective microorganisms (EM). The experiment was laid out in a split-plot design, with EM as the main plot factor (−EM and +EM) and NFs as the subplot factor [control, chemical NFs (Ch-N) and organic NFs (Org-N)]. The results showed that, plants treated with EM and Org-N showed 2-, 2.2-, 2.4-, 2.5-, 3.3- and 3-fold increases in plant height, number of branches, total leaf area, plant fresh weight, plant dry weight and leaf dry yield, respectively, compared to untreated plants. Similarly, plants receiving EM along with Ch-N showed 1.86-, 1.7-, 2.2-, 2.12-, 3-, and 2.72-fold increases in the same traits. Total chlorophyll, protein, N, P, K and sativoside contents were increased by 88.8, 152, 138, 151.5, 43 and 137.5% when EM and Org-N were applied to stevia plants. Application of EM together with Ch-N increased these properties by 0.5, 127.7, 115, 216, 42.6 and 83.8%, respectively in the same traits. Overall, the combined application of NFs and EM improved growth, yield and nutrient accumulation in stevia plants.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The high prices of biopharmaceuticals or biologics used in the treatment of many diseases limit the access of patients to these novel therapies. One example is the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab, successfully used for breast cancer treatment. An economic alternative is the generation of biosimilars to these expensive biopharmaceuticals. Since antibody therapies may require large doses over a long period of time, robust platforms and strategies for cell line development are essential for the generation of recombinant cell lines with higher levels of expression. Here, we obtained trastuzumab-expressing CHO-K1 cells through a screening and selection strategy that combined the use of host cells pre-adapted to protein-free media and suspension culture and lentiviral vectors. The results demonstrated that the early screening strategy obtained recombinant CHO-K1 cell populations with higher enrichment of IgG-expressing cells. Moreover, the measurement of intracellular heavy chain polypeptide by flow cytometry was a useful metric to characterize the homogeneity of cell population, and our results suggest this could be used to predict the expression levels of monoclonal antibodies in early stages of cell line development. Additionally, we propose an approach using 25 cm 2 T-flasks in suspension and shaking culture conditions as a screening tool to identify high producing cell lines. Finally, trastuzumab-expressing CHO-K1 clones were generated and characterized by batch culture, and preliminary results related to HER2-recognition capacity were successful. Further optimization of elements such as gene optimization, vector selection, type of amplification/selection system, cell culture media composition, in combination with this strategy will allow obtaining high producing clones.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purslane is a widespread wild vegetable with both medicinal and edible properties. It is highly appreciated for its high nutritional value and is also considered as a high-quality feed resource for livestock and poultry. In this study, Sanhuang broilers were used to investigate the effect of feeding purslane diets on the growth performance in broilers and their gut microbiota. A total of 48 birds with good growth and uniform weight were selected and randomly allocated to four treatment groups A (control), B, C and D. Dietary treatments were fed with basal diet without purslane and diets containing 1%, 2% and 3% purslane. The 16S rDNA was amplified by PCR and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq platform to analyze the composition and diversity of gut microbiota in the four sets of samples. The results showed that dietary inclusion of 2% and 3% purslane could significantly improve the growth performance and reduce the feed conversion ratio. Microbial diversity analysis indicated that the composition of gut microbiota of Sanhuang broilers mainly included Gallibacterium , Bacteroides and Escherichia-Shigella , etc. As the content of purslane was increased, the abundance of Lactobacillus increased significantly, and Escherichia-Shigella decreased. LEfSe analysis revealed that Bacteroides_caecigallinarum , Lachnospiraceae , Lactobacillales and Firmicutes had significant differences compared with the control group. PICRUSt analysis revealed bacteria mainly enriched in carbohydrate metabolism pathway due to the additon of purslane in the diet. These results suggest that the addition of purslane to feed could increase the abundance of Lactobacillus in intestine, modulate the environment of gut microbiota and promote the metabolism of carbohydrates to improve its growth performance. This study indicates that the effect of purslane on the growth-promoting performance of broilers might depend on its modulation on gut microbiota, so as to provide a certain scientific basis for the application of purslane in the feed industry.",

    "abstract": "Protozoan diseases such as malaria, leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, and sleeping sickness still levy a heavy toll on human lives. Deplorably, only few classes of anti-protozoan drugs have thus far been developed. The problem is further compounded by their intrinsic toxicity, emergence of drug resistance, and the lack of licensed vaccines. Thus, there is a genuine exigency to develop novel anti-protozoan medications. Over the past years, melittin, the major constituent in the venom of European honeybee Apis mellifera, has gathered the attention of researchers due to its potential therapeutic applications. Insofar as we are aware, there has been no review pertinent to anti-protozoan properties of melittin. The present review outlines the current knowledge about anti-protozoan effects of melittin and its underlying mechanisms. The peptide has proven to be efficacious in killing different protozoan parasites such as Leishmania, Plasmodium, Toxoplasma, and Trypanosoma in vitro. Apart from direct membrane-disruptive activity, melittin is capable of destabilizing calcium homeostasis, reducing mitochondrial membrane potential, disorganizing kinetoplast DNA, instigating apoptotic cell death, and induction of autophagy in protozoan pathogens. Emerging evidence suggests that melittin is a promising candidate for future vaccine adjuvants. Transmission-blocking activity of melittin against vector-borne pathogens underscores its potential utility for both transgenic and paratransgenic manipulations. Nevertheless, future research should focus upon investigating anti-microbial activities of melittin, alone or in combination with the current anti-protozoan medications, against a far broader spectrum of protozoan parasites as well as pre-clinical testing of the peptide in animal models.",

Among them, the anticancer activity attracted much attention. However, the molecular mechanism of its inhibitory effect on hepatocellular carcinoma was still unclear. Thus its effect on hepatocellular carcinoma was tested in this research. It was found that iturin A could enter HepG2 cells immediately and cause reactive oxygen species burst, disrupt cell cycle and induce apoptosis, paraptosis and autophagy in vitro. The iturin A without fatty acid chain showed no antitumor activity. Amphiphilic is critical to the activity of iturin A. The anticancer activity of iturin A to hepatocellular carcinoma was also verified in mice models carrying xenograft tumors constructed by HepG2 cells. At a dosage of 3 mg/kg/day, iturin A significantly inhibited the further increase of the tumor weight by 58.55%, and reduced the expression of Ki67 in tumor. In the tumor treated with iturin A, lymphocyte infiltration was found, and the expressions of TGF-β1and PD-L1 were decreased, which indicated that the tumor immune microenvironment was improved. Besides, iturin A showed no significant harm on the health of mice except slight disturbance of liver function. These results suggested that iturin A had significant antitumor effect in vitro and vivo, and provide a basis for the application of iturin A as anticancer agent.",

Recently, the agricultural industry has also began using microalgae as an alternative source for sustainable products to replace agrochemicals. Due to the lack of scientific articles in this research area, the objective of this study was to search for applications of microalgae and to characterize its use in agriculture using the patent documents available in three patent databases, World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), European Patent Office (EPO) and Brazilian Institute of Industrial Property (INPI). The search was carried out using the keyword “microalgae” and applying the filter for International Patent Classification (IPC) code “A01N” which corresponds to patents related to agriculture and cultivation of microalgae. Our patent database search returned 669 documents and 132 patents were selected for the study based on their abstracts. The first patent was registered in 1982 and described the use of microalgae Chlorella extract as a plant growth promoter. After that, no patent was registered for 15 years. From 2005 to 2014, only seven patents were found. However, the scenario changed from 2015 when the number of patents increased mainly in the United States, China and Europe. The patent analysis showed several applications for microalgae in the agricultural sector, such as plant growth promotion, biofertilization, plant disease control, weed management, and post-harvest quality. This review confirmed the increasing interest in microalgae-derived products in agriculture and the value of using patent documents to assess innovative areas.",

Herein, 26 mecA -positive methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolated from clinical samples were identified, and their resistance to 11 antibiotics was investigated. Next, the antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity of the ethanolic extract of M. communis on these strains was evaluated. Furthermore, the effect of this extract on the expression of biofilm-associated genes, icaA , icaD , bap , sarA , and agr , was studied. According to the results, all isolated strains were multidrug-resistant and showed resistance to oxacillin and tetracycline. Also, 96.15 and 88.46 % of them were resistant to gentamicin and erythromycin. However, the extract could effectively combat the strains. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against different strains ranged from 1.56 to 25 mg/ml and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was between 3.125 and 50 mg/ml. Even though most MRSA (67 %) strongly produced biofilm, the sub-MIC concentration of the extract destroyed the pre-formed biofilm and affected the bacterial cells inside the biofilm. It could also inhibit biofilm development by significantly decreasing the expression of icaA , icaD , sarA and bap genes involved in biofilm formation and development. In conclusion, the extract inhibits biofilm formation, ruins pre-formed biofilm, and kills cells living inside the biofilm. Furthermore, it down-regulates the expression of necessary genes and nips the biofilm formation in the bud.",

Antibacterial activity was observed for EOs against both bacterial strains with stronger activity for CiEO against both bacteria. The synergistic antibacterial effect was observed only against B. subtilis. Based on the FIC index, combinations could not inhibit the growth of E. coli. The pure EOs and their combination inhibited cell attachment for both studied bacteria with stronger effect on E. coli. CV and XTT reduction assays results showed that Ci EO and its combination with CaEO had the highest antibiofilm activity at lowest MIC value 0.08% and 0.04/0.02% against biofilm formed by E. coli and B. subtilis respectively, indicating a high antibiofilm potential. Computational docking analyses also postulated that the active constituents of evaluated EOs have the potential to interact with different bacterial targets, suggested binding mode of action of EOs metabolites. By and large, synergistic anti-biofilm properties of EOs may provide further options for developing novel formula to inhibit a variety of infectious clinical and industrial strains without (or less) toxicity effects on human body.",

    "abstract": "Low temperature is an important environmental factor that restricts the growth of Stropharia rugosoannulata; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying S. rugosoannulata responses to low-temperature stress are largely unknown. In this study, we performed a transcriptome analysis of a high-sensitivity strain (DQ-1) and low-sensitivity strain (DQ-3) under low-temperature stress. The liquid hyphae of S. rugosoannulata treated at 25 °C and 10 °C were analyzed by RNA-Seq, and a total of 9499 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses showed that these genes were enriched in \"xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism\", \"carbohydrate metabolism\", \"lipid metabolism\" and \"oxidoreductase activity\". Further research found that carbohydrate enzyme (AA, GH, CE, and GT) genes were downregulated more significantly in DQ-1 than DQ-3 and several cellulase activities were also reduced to a greater extent. Moreover, the CAT1, CAT2, GR, and POD genes and more heat shock protein genes (HSP20, HSP78 and sHSP) were upregulated in the two strains after low-temperature stress, and the GPX gene and more heat shock protein genes were upregulated in DQ-3. In addition, the enzyme activity and qRT-PCR results showed trends similar to those of the RNA-Seq results. This result indicates that low-temperature stress reduces the expression of different AA, GH, CE, and GT enzyme genes and reduces the secretion of cellulase, thereby reducing the carbohydrate metabolism process and mycelial growth of S. rugosoannulata. Moreover, the expression levels of different types of antioxidant enzymes and heat shock proteins are also crucial for S. rugosoannulata to resist low-temperature stress. In short, this study will provide a basis for further research on important signaling pathways, gene functions and variety breeding of S. rugosoannulata related to low-temperature stress.",

Moreover, HK LS 189 supplementation altered the gut microbiota of the pigs by decreasing the proportion of Prevotella and increasing the proportion of Parabacteroides. Beta-diversity analysis showed a significant difference between the two groups. The results support the potential use of HK LS 189 for its anti-obesity effect in pigs through modulation of the gut microbiota. Furthermore, we found changes in the functional pathways of the gut microbiota. The functional pathway study indicated that metabolism and lipid metabolism differed between the two groups. Our data may contribute to understanding the potential use of postbiotic supplementation with HK LS 189 for improving the anti-obesity effects.",

    "abstract": "Artemisia species are important traditional medicinal plants of Ethiopia which are used for the treatment of infection and non-infection health problems. The genus Artemisia (Astraceae) consists of about 500 species worldwide. In this study, the main aim was to investigate chemical components of Artemisia spp. (A. abyssinica, A. absinthium and A. annua) and evaluate their antimicrobial activities against bacterial strains. The results indicated that the crude extract of these plants was effective against selected bacterial strains. Here we isolated the well-known antimalarial drug artemisinin (7 mg, 0.004%) from Artemisia annua leaves using a rapid n-hexane fractionation method. The n-hexane extract of A. abyssinica, ethyl acetate extract of A. absinthium and n-hexane of A. annua showed varying degrees of inhibiting effect against bacterial strains such as Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 T, Salmonella enteritidis ATCC13076T, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC1053T, boydii ATCC1233T, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 T, hospital acquired Acinetobacter baumannii. The ethyl acetate extract of Artemisia absinthium (A.abe) showed the maximum inhibiting effect (35 mm) against A. baumannii. The minimum zone of inhibition (< 3 mm) was recorded for test extract of A.ap against Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC1053T. Ethyl acetate extract of A, absinthium (A.abe) was more effective against these selected bacterial strains and the zone of inhibition ranged from 5 to 35 mm. The minimum inhibition zone (8 mm) was detected against S. typhimurium ATCC 13311 T for both A.ac and n-hexane- EtOAc fraction (8:2) of A, abyssinica. The maximum zone of inhibition (25 mm) for fraction (A.ach F4) of A, abyssinica obtained by column chromatography was recorded against S. pyogen ATCC 19,615. However, there was no zone of inhibition detected for boydii ATCC1233T due to these test extracts. Significant variations (P ≥ 0.05) were observed between all test extracts of these medicinal plants at 95% of confidence intervals. In this study, clear zones of inhibition were detected for the positive control (standard impregnated disks). Based on our results we recommend that various species of Artemisia spp. seem to have the potential for in-depth investigation for various antimicrobial activities that assisting the effort in searching for antimicrobial lead compounds.",

To investigate the prevalence, antimicrobial resistance patterns, virulence determinants, and distribution of antimicrobial resistance genes in STEC strains isolated from dogs: 80 fecal samples were obtained from diseased dogs suffering from hemorrhagic diarrhea from pet animal clinics in Ismailia governorate, Egypt. The obtained samples were examined bacteriologically. Moreover, the retrieved isolates were tested for serogrouping, Congo-red binding, antimicrobial resistance, and PCR-based determination of virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes. The prevalence of E. coli in the examined diseased dogs was 23.75% (19/80). The serogrouping of the recovered isolates revealed that 84.2% of the tested isolates were distributed into three serogroups: O146 (36.8%), O111 (31.5%), and O26 (15.7%). Meanwhile, three isolates were untypable (15.8%). Moreover, all the tested E. coli serovars were positive for CR-binding. PCR revealed that the prevalence of stx 1, eae A, hly A, and stx 2 virulence genes was 100%, 100%, 100%, and 47.3%, respectively. Our findings revealed that 31.5% of the recovered isolates showed MDR to five antimicrobial classes and harbored bla TEM , bla CTX-M , tet A, tet B, and sul 1 genes. Alarmingly, three isolates were carbapenem-resistant. Two strains harbored the bla KPC gene, while one strain carried the bla NDM-1 gene. Concisely, as far as we know, this is the first study that reported the existence of MDR-STEC in dogs in Egypt. The stx 1 gene is the most predominant Shiga toxin gene that accompanied the STEC isolated from hemorrhagic enteritis in dogs. The emerging MDR-STEC in dogs commonly harbors bla TEM , bla CTX-M , sul 1, tet A, tet B, and qnr A resistance genes. Meropenem, levofloxacin, and tigecycline exhibited talented antimicrobial activity against MDR-STEC isolated from dogs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Acinetobacter baumannii is an important opportunistic pathogen, and the cause of nosocomial infections worldwide in recent decades. Efflux pumps are considered as the important causes of multidrug resistance of A. baumannii . The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of efflux pump genes, and evaluate the antibiotic effect of Tigecycline on the expression of adeB gene in isolates of multidrug-resistant. A. baumannii . 70 isolates of A. baumannii were collected and confirmed by biochemical and molecular tests. Antibiotic resistance (Ciprofloxacin, Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and Tigecycline) was performed based on the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method. Then, the effect of Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone inhibitor (CCCP) on isolates was investigated and the frequency of adeB, adeG, adeJ and abeM genes were examined by PCR for isolates with reduced in MIC titer. Also, the antibiotic effect of Tigecycline on adeB gene expression in A. baumannii isolates was analyzed by Real-Time PCR. The antibiotic resistance for Ciprofloxacin, Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and Tigecycline was 97.1%, 95.8% and 37.2%, respectively. Following CCCP inhibitor use, the MIC titer had a decrease in MIC titer containing CCCP inhibitor was 64.3% for Ciprofloxacin, 51.5% for Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and 50% for Tigecycline. The frequencies of genes associated with adeB, adeG, adeJ and abeM efflux pump were 100%, 92.8%, 86% and 98.5%, respectively. Real-Time PCR results showed a correlation between the antibiotic effects of Tigecycline on adeB gene expression. The antibiotic resistance of the isolates was relatively high. The isolates were resistant to Ciprofloxacin and Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole antibiotics, while more sensitive to Tigecycline. Also, efflux pump genes, which are the antibiotic resistance factors of A. baumannii , are frequently high in the isolates but it seems that isolates use other effluxe pumps than RND family to exit tigecycline.

    "abstract": "The suitable structural characteristics of magnetic nanoparticles have resulted in their widespread use in magnetic hyperthermia therapy. Moreover, they are considered a proper and operational choice for pharmaceutical nanocarriers. Using the biomimetic method, we were able to produce iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles from the bacterial source of PTCC1250, Bacillus megaterium, for therangostic diagnosis systems and targeted drug delivery. Some of the benefits of this method include mitigated environmental and biological dangers, low toxicity, high biocompatibility, cheap and short-term mass production possibilities in each synthesis round compared to other biological sources, simple equipment required for the synthesis; and the possibility of industrial-scale production. Bacillus megaterium is a magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) that has a magnetosome organelle capable of orienting based on external magnetic fields, caused by the mineralization of magnetic nanocrystals. Utilizing this capability and adding an iron nitrate solution to the bacterial suspension, we synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles. The extent of synthesis was measured using UV-visible spectrophotometry. The morphology was evaluated using FESEM. The crystallized structure was characterized using RAMAN and XRD. The size and distribution of the nanoparticles were assessed using DLS. The surface charge of the nanoparticles was measured using zeta potential. The synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles was confirmed using FT-IR, and the magnetic property was measured using VSM. This study is continued to identify industrial and clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The prevalence of antibiotic resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa places a heavy burden on the health care sectors urging the need to find alternative, non-antibiotic strategies. The interference with the P. aeruginosa quorum sensing (QS) system represents a promising alternative strategy to attenuate the bacterial virulency and its ability to form biofilms. Micafungin has been reported to impede the pseudomonal biofilm formation. However, the influences of micafungin on the biochemical composition and metabolites levels of P. aeruginosa have not been explored. In this study, the effect of micafungin (100 µg/mL) on the virulence factors, QS signal molecules and the metabolome of P. aeruginosa was studied using exofactor assay and mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approaches. Furthermore, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) using the fluorescent dyes ConA-FITC and SYPRO® Ruby was used to visualize micafungin disturbing effects on the pseudomonal glycocalyx and protein biofilm-constituents, respectively. Our findings showed that micafungin significantly decreased the production of various QS-controlled virulence factors (pyocyanin, pyoverdine, pyochelin and rhamnolipid), along with a dysregulation in the level of various metabolites involved in QS system, lysine degradation, tryptophan biosynthesis, TCA cycle, and biotin metabolism. In addition, the CLSM examination showed an altered matrix distribution. The presented findings highlight the promising role of micafungin as a potential quorum sensing inhibitor (QSI) and anti-biofilm agent to attenuate P. aeruginosa pathogenicity. In addition, they point to the promising role of metabolomics study in investigating the altered biochemical pathways in P. aeruginosa .",

Rhizosphere bacteria play vital roles in plant nutrition and the growth promotion of their host plant. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of three plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), Bacillus subtilis , Bacillus amyloliquefaciens , and Pseudomonas monteilii for their potential role as a biofertilizer. The effect of the PGPR was examined at a commercial strawberry farm in Dayton, Oregon. The PGPR were applied to the soil of the strawberry ( Fragaria × ananassa cultivar Hood) plants in two different concentrations of PGPR, T1 (0.24% PGPR) and T2 (0.48% PGPR), and C (no PGPR). A total of 450 samples from August 2020 to May 2021 were collected, and microbiome sequencing based on the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was conducted. The strawberry quality was measured by sensory evaluation, total acidity (TA), total soluble solids (TSS), color (lightness and chroma), and volatile compounds. Application of the PGPR significantly increased the populations of Bacillus and Pseudomonas and promoted the growth of nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The TSS and color evaluation showed that the PGPR presumptively behaved as a ripening enhancer. The PGPR contributed to the production of fruit-related volatile compounds, while the sensory evaluation did not show significant differences among the three groups. The major finding of this study suggests that the consortium of the three PGPR have a potential role as a biofertilizer by supporting the growth of other microorganisms (nitrogen-fixing bacteria) as part of a synergetic effect and strawberry quality such as sweetness and volatile compounds.",

The effects of applying surfactin for the removal of gray mold on the quality of winter jujube were investigated based on the changes in fruit fatty acids. The results showed that (1) surfactin significantly inhibited the growth of B. cinerea , the EC 50 at 5 d was 46.42 mg/L. (2) Surfactin significantly reduced the disease incidence and diameter of gray mold-inoculated winter jujube in a concentration-dependent manner. For that treated with surfactin at the EC 50, the incidence decreased by 38.89%. (3) For B. cinerea under surfactin treatment, the mycelial morphology changed, the levels of total lipids and ergosterol decreased, the reactive oxygen species levels increased, and the cell integrity was completely damaged. (4) For winter jujube inoculated by B. cinerea , the contents of saturated fatty acids decreased and unsaturated fatty acids increased. For those under the surfactin treatments, winter jujube maintained the fatty acid composition at the level of non-inoculated groups. Mechanical injury significantly changed the fatty acid composition of winter jujube; however, surfactin not only was able to inhibit the growth of gray mold but also mitigated the adverse effects from mechanical injury. The present study demonstrated the potential applications of surfactin in the preservation of postharvest fruit quality.",

The highlight of this work is to provide a favorite condition for capturing curcumin while protecting its structure and intensifying its activities because of the synchronization with HA. Accordingly, HA as a major component of dermis with a critical role in establishing skin health, could fortify the wound healing property as well as antibacterial activity of the hydrogel.

This study was to assess the effects of dehydrocostus lactone (DL) on the Candida albicans growth and biofilms Microdilution assays revealed that DL inhibits a panel of standard Candida species, including C. albicans , as well as 9 C. albicans clinical isolates. The morphological transition of C. albicans in RPMI-1640 medium and the adhesion to polystyrene surfaces can also be decreased by DL treatment, as evidenced by microscopic, metabolic activity and colony forming unit (CFU) counting assays. The XTT assay and microscopy inspection demonstrated that DL can inhibit the biofilms of C. albicans . Confocal microscopy following propidium iodide (PI) staining and DCFH-DA staining after DL treatment revealed that DL can increase the membrane permeability and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. N -acetyl-cysteine could mitigate the inhibitory effects of DL on growth, morphological transition and biofilm formation, further confirming that ROS production induced by DL contributes to its antifungal and antibiofilm effects. This study showed that DL demonstrated antifungal and antibiofilm activity against C. albicans . The antifungal mechanisms may involve membrane damage and ROS overproduction.

    "abstract": "Mycotoxins (MTs) are secondary toxic metabolites that can contaminate food, impacting quality and safety, leading to various negative health effects and serious pathological consequences conferring urgent need to evaluate and validate the currently standard methods used in their analysis. Therefore, this study was aimed to validate ELISA and VICAM immunoaffinity fluorometric, the two common methods used to monitor the level of MTs according to the Egyptian Organization for Standardization and Quality Control. A total of 246 food samples were collected and tested for Aflatoxins (196 samples), Ochratoxin A (139), Zearalenone (70), and Deoxynivalenol (100) using both analytical methods. Results showed that aflatoxins exceeded limits in 42.9, 100, and 13.3% of oily seeds, dried fruits, and chili and spices, respectively. For ochratoxin A, 3.9% of Gramineae and 8% of spices and chili (locally sourced) exceeded the limits, while 17.6% of imported pasta and noodles exceeded the limits for deoxynivalenol. Significant differences for the aflatoxins and ochratoxin A detection among different categories of chocolate, dried fruits, and oily seeds (p-value < 0.05). No zearalenone contamination was detected in the exported, imported, and locally sourced categories. No deoxynivalenol contamination was detected in the tested Gramineae category. In contrast, for pasta and noodles, the imported samples exhibited the highest contamination rate (above the upper limit of 750 µg/kg) with 17.6% of the samples testing positive for deoxynivalenol with no significant difference among different sample categories of Gramineae, pasta, and noodles (p-value > 0.05). In conclusion, our study found no significant differences between the ELISA and immunoaffinity fluorometric analysis in the detection of the respective MTs in various food categories and therefore, they can substitute each other whenever necessary. However, significant differences were observed among different food categories, particularly the local and imported ones, highlighting the urgent need for strict and appropriate control measures to minimize the risk of MTs adverse effects.",

Because foods rich in functional constituents have antioxidant capacity and are important in keeping consumers healthy. Pleurotus ostreatus is among foods rich in functional constituents. However, its functional constituents are affected by various factors. This study compared the antioxidant capacity of P. ostreatus grown on different substrates: straws of tef (Trt1), barley (Trt2), and wheat (Trt3), husks of faba bean (Trt4), and field pea (Trt5), sawdust (Trt6), and the mixture of the above with 1:1 w/w (Trt7). Trt7 had significantly higher radical scavenging activity (RSA) (73.27%), vitamin C (10.61 mg/100 g), and vitamin D (4.92 mg/100 g) compared to other treatments. Whereas the lowest values of RSA (44.24%), vitamin C (5.39 mg/100 g), and vitamin D (1.21 mg/100 g) were found in Trt2. The results indicated that mixed substrate may be a good growth substrate for functionally beneficial P. ostreatus and could be a promising source of natural antioxidants.",

This study aimed to investigate the p ossibility of using recombinant Lactococcus lactis ( L. lactis ) as a live vector to produce recombinant Brucella abortus ( B. abortus ) Omp10 . The gene sequences were obtained from GenBank. The proteins’ immunogenicity was assessed using Vaxijen. After confirming the cloning of the Omp10 gene in the pNZ8148 vector by enzymatic digestion and PCR, transformation into L. lactis was done. SDS-PAGE and western blot methods evaluated omp10 protein expression. Mice received oral recombinant L. lactis vaccines. IgG antibodies against Omp10 were tested using ELISA. Real-time PCR and ELISA were used to analyze cytokine responses. Survival rate and histopathological changes were evaluated after the challenge. Omp10 was chosen for its 1.5524 antigenicity score. Enzymatic digestion and PCR identified a 381-bp gene fragment. A 10 kDa band indicated the success of L. lactis transformation. Mice administered the L. lactis -pNZ8148- Omp 10-Usp45 vaccination 14 days after priming showed significantly higher Omp10 -specific total IgG and IgG1 ( P &lt; 0.001) than the PBS control group. The mice who received the L. lactis -pNZ8148- Omp10 -Usp45 and IRBA vaccines had significantly elevated levels of IFN-γ, TNFα, IL-4, and IL-10 in samples collected on days 14 and 28 ( P &lt; 0.001). Inflammatory response, morphological damage, alveolar edema, and lymphocyte infiltration were reduced in the target group. A recombinant L. lactis expressing the Omp10 protein was constructed as an oral Lactococcus -based vaccine and compared to live attenuated vaccines for future brucellosis investigations.",

The cells were cultured in either two synthetic media or yeast mold (YM) medium for 72 h, after which cytosolic constituents were extracted from the cells with hot water. After analyzing the extracts via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), we found that all strains produced varying amounts of EGT. The EGT-producing strains, including Ustilago siamensis , Anthracocystis floculossa , Tridiomyces crassus , Ustilago shanxiensis , and Moesziomyces antarcticus , were subjected to flask cultivation in YM medium. U . siamensis CBS9960 produced the highest amount of EGT at 49.5 ± 7.0 mg/L after 120 h, followed by T . crassus at 30.9 ± 1.8 mg/L. U . siamensis was also cultured in a jar fermenter and produced slightly higher amounts of EGT than under flask cultivation. The effects of culture conditions, particularly the addition of precursor amino acids, on EGT production by the selected strains were also evaluated. U . siamensis showed a 1.5-fold increase in EGT production with the addition of histidine, while U . shanxiensis experienced a 1.8-fold increase in EGT production with the addition of methionine. These results suggest that basidiomycetous yeasts could serve an abundant source for natural EGT producers.",

Letrozole is one of the drugs for the treatment of breast cancer. In this study, the organic-metallic pharmaceutical porous nanostructure based on zirconium UiO-66 loaded letrozole was synthesized. Its cytotoxicity and effect on apoptosis and migration against breast cancer cell line were investigated. In this experimental study, the UiO-66 nanoparticle-loaded letrozole was synthesized using zirconium chloride (ZrCl4), dimethylformamide (DMF), and HCl. Its characteristics were determined by scanning electron microscopy, and its average size was determined by the DLS method. Also, the rate of letrozole drug release from the nanoparticle was investigated in 24, 48, and 72 h. In addition, its cytotoxicity effects were investigated using the MTT colorimetric method at concentrations of 3.125-100 µg/ml against the breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) in the periods of 48 and 72 h. Also, the expression level of apoptotic genes Bax and Bcl2 was investigated by the Real-Time PCR method. Also, the amount of cell migration was done by the migration assay method. The results showed that UiO-66 bound to letrozole had a spherical morphology and an average size of 9.2 ± 160.1. Also, the letrozole drug was loaded by 62.21 ± 1.80% in UiO-66 nanoparticles and had a slower release pattern than free letrozole in the drug release test, so within 72 h, 99.99% of free letrozole was released in If in UiO-66 containing letrozole, 57.55% of the drug has been released. Also, the cytotoxicity results showed that UiO-66 bound to letrozole has more significant cytotoxic effects than free letrozole ( p &lt; 0.05). Also, the results of Bax and Bcl2 gene expression showed that the treatment of MCF-7 cells with UiO-66 nanoparticles attached to letrozole increased the expression of Bax and Bcl2 genes compared to the reference gene Beta-actin in MCF-7 cell line, respectively. ( p &lt; 0.05) increased by 3.71 ± 0.42 and ( p &lt; 0.01) decreased by 0.636 ± 0.034 ( p &lt; 0.05). Cell migration results showed that the concentration of 50 µg/ml of UiO-66 bound to letrozole decreased the migration of MCF-7 cells. Generally, the results of this study showed that UiO-66 loaded letrozole can be used as a suitable drug carrier for cellular purposes, as it has increased the effects of cytotoxicity and the rate of apoptosis in breast cancer cell line (MCF-7), so it can be used with more studies used nanocarriers as a drug delivery system.",

In this investigation coconut oil was subjected to 0 to 5 L/min of ozone for 3 h and the chemical composition of both crude and ozonized oil was valued via Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS). Some biological tests were done including antibacterial action versus Helicobacter pylori, anti-biofilm activity versus H. pylori, anti-hemolytic activity in the existence of H. pylori, anti-Alzheimer action, and cytotoxic effect towards A-413 cancer cell line to determine the activity of coconut oil and upon exposure to ozone. Fifteen compounds were detected in the coconut oil crude and ozonized oils where the fatty acid esters were the most common molecules in crude coconut oil, whereas alkenes were the most predominant compounds in ozonized coconut oil. A slight elevation of antibacterial action towards H. pylori from 23.0 ± 0.1 to 28.2 ± 0.5 mm was displayed upon exposure of the coconut oil to ozone. Both crude and ozonized coconut oil showed a bactericidal effect with MICs = 62.5 ± 0.1, 125.0 ± 0.2 µg/mL and MBCs = 15.62 ± 0.2, 31.25 0.2 µg/mL for crude and ozonized oil, respectively. A significant elevation in anti-biofilm activity was found upon using 25% of MBCs of ozonized oil relative to crude oil. A dramatic rise was observed in anti-hemolytic activity upon using 25 and 75% of MICs of ozonized oil relative to crude one. A notable elevation of anti-Alzheimer impact was evident upon exposing coconut oil to ozone. Besides, the cytotoxic impact towards A-431 cells was slightly increased after exposing the oil to ozone. The current results suggest a new technique to expose coconut oil to ozone to improve some of its in vitro pharmaceutical applications.",

This study was conducted to isolate Pisolithus sp. and estimate its potential to improve the growth performance of Eucalyptus globulus seedlings under salt-stress conditions. Pisolithus sp. was isolated from mature sporocarps and identified through 18S rDNA. Pisolithus sp. was evaluated for its response to varying pH values, temperatures, and salinity levels. A pot experiment was conducted to assess the Pisolithus strain’s effectiveness in reducing soil salinity’s impact on the growth of Eucalyptus globulus seedlings in sandy soil. The identified Pisolithus tinctorius with an accession number of OM125275 revealed the highest mycelium dry weight of 0.09 g/100 ml medium at pH 5.8, 0.08 g/100 ml medium at 28 °C, and 0.12 g/100 ml medium at 4% NaCl. Eucalyptus globulus seedlings inoculated with Pisolithus tinctorius demonstrated significant improvement in most parameters compared to non-mycorrhizal (control) seedlings under salt stress. The seedlings inoculated with Pisolithus tinctorius and irrigated with 6 dS/m saline water revealed the highest shoot height (55.670 cm), root length (42.33 cm), shoot fresh weight (6.44 g/plant), root fresh weight (1.84 g/plant), shoot dry weight (2.37 g/plant), and root dry weight (0.810 g/plant) when compared to all treatments. Our findings suggest that selecting appropriate fungal strains is crucial for improving plant performance in saline conditions. Graphical abstract",

    "abstract": "Malassezia furfur is the primary etiological agent of dandruff (Pityriasis capitis). Although herbal shampoos are preferred for their natural, mild ingredients over synthetic counterparts, they are often perceived as less effective in managing flaky scalp conditions or furfuration causing dandruff. The study compares the antifungal efficacy of herbal and synthetic shampoos against M. furfur. Seven shampoos including herbal (HS_Adv, HS_M&P, HS_Aloe), synthetic (SYN_01, SYN_02, SYN_03) and an antifungal shampoo containing ketoconazole (KETO) were employed in the study. Experiments were designed to stimulate real-world conditions, utilizing disc-diffusion assay, 3-minute shampoo contact at mild dilutions (1% and 5%), recurrent 3-minute shampoo contact every 24 h with intermittent recovery. Both disc diffusion and 3-minute shampoo contact demonstrated that all shampoos were effectively inhibiting the viability of M. furfur. However, a single 3-minute shampoo contact followed by a prolonged recovery of 72 h revealed SYN_01 and KETO with maximal antifungal action. In contrast, herbal shampoos were as effective as synthetic options when M. furfur was subjected to 3-minute shampoo contact every 24 h with intermittent recovery. Comprehensive ingredient analysis revealed the robust antifungal activity in SYN_01 was probably because of the presence of various surfactants, allergens and a potent synthetic antifungal agent, Piroctone olamine. This study experimentally demonstrates that herbal shampoos are as effective as synthetic options in managing M. furfur-induced dandruff when applied consistently. The findings highlight the importance of regular scalp cleansing for dandruff management and provide valuable insights into the antifungal potential of both herbal and synthetic formulations.",

Known for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial properties, this study explores the antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and wound-healing activities of P. makinoi extracts. The antibacterial potential of P. makinoi extracts was first evaluated using the agar diffusion method, along with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) assays. Subsequently, electron microscopy and a conductivity meter were employed to assess whether P. makinoi extracts exert antibacterial effects by disrupting bacterial cell structures. Finally, the anti-inflammatory and cell proliferation-promoting effects of P. makinoi extracts were assessed in RAW264.7 and CCD-1112Sk cell models. The MIC and MBC of the P. makinoi water extracts against two multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains were 4 and 16–32 mg/mL, respectively, while those for ethanol extracts were 2 and 32 mg/mL, respectively. In the time-kill assay, both strains were killed after treatment with extracts for 12 and 18 h. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the bacterial cells treated with the extracts appeared rough, ruptured, and shriveled. The extracts disrupted the cell membranes, causing electrolyte, protein, and nucleic acid leakage, leading to cell death. Additionally, P. makinoi extracts reduced lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 levels in RAW264.7 cells, and promoted wound healing by enhancing CCD-1112Sk cell proliferation. In conclusion, P. makinoi water and ethanol extracts demonstrated antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects, showing potential for treating wound infections and accelerating healing, making them promising candidates for wound-healing therapies.",

B. thetaiotaomicron CFS notably upregulated GCG, PCSK1, GPR119, GPR120, and TGR5 expression, leading to elevated GLP-1 secretion. B. fragilis CFS decreased GPR119, GPR120, and GCG expression. OMVs from B. thetaiotaomicron at 50 µg/ml significantly enhanced GCG and PCSK1 expression, while B. fragilis OMVs generally decreased gene expression, except for PYY protein abundance. Inactive B. thetaiotaomicron and B. fragilis increased GCG mRNA levels and GLP-1 concentration, with inactive B. fragilis also elevating GLP-2 protein levels.This study suggests that B. thetaiotaomicron and its derivatives, particularly CFS and OMVs, have potential as next-generation probiotics, postbiotics, and paraprobiotics for modulating satiety hormones and managing obesity. Further research is warranted to explore their mechanisms and therapeutic applications in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The occurrence of mosquito-borne diseases is increasing, and their geographical range is expanding due to climate change. New control measures are urgently needed to combat these debilitating and, in some cases, fatal diseases. Bacteria of the genus Bacillus are of interest due to the production of bioactive compounds, including those useful for insect control. The discovery and characterization of new species of Bacillus with mosquito larvicidal activity may offer opportunities to develop new products for vector control. In this study, we evaluated larvicidal activity, described morphological characteristics, and sequenced and analyzed the genome of a bacterial strain (GD02.13) isolated from the Amazon region. The metabolites produced by GD02.13 are as effective in killing Aedes aegypti larvae as the commercial product Natular™ DT (Spinosad). Furthermore, the morphological characteristics of the GD02.13 spores and crystal inclusions resemble those previously described for B. thuringiensis. A phylogenetic analysis based on 443 single-copy orthologs indicated that the bacterial strain GD02.13 belongs to the Bacillus thuringiensis species. Its genome, which was assembled and has a size of 6.6 Mb, contains 16 secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters and genes encoding insecticidal proteins, predicted based on sequence similarity. The data obtained in this study support the development of new insecticide products based on the strain GD02.13 of B. thuringiensis.",

Currently, there are no effective vaccines and drugs for ASFV, making diagnostic methods crucial for the prevention and control of ASF. In this study, the ASFV p30 protein was successfully expressed using a prokaryotic expression system and used as an immunogen to prepare monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2A5. The antigenic epitope recognized by the mAb 2A5 was identified as 58VKYDIVKSARIYAGQGY74. Then, a blue latex microsphere immunochromatographic strip method for detecting ASFV antigens was established. Wherein a rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb) against p30 stored in our laboratory was coupled with blue latex microspheres to prepare an immune probe, with mAb 2A5 as the test line and goat anti-rabbit IgG as the control line. The immunochromatographic strip exhibited excellent sensitivity, with a minimum detection limit of 10 ng/mL for the p30 protein. It demonstrated good specificity, showing no cross-reactivity with PRRSV, PCV2, PPV, and PEDV. Moreover, it maintained good stability and could be stored for at least 100 days at 37 °C. The concordance rate between the immunochromatographic strip and qPCR test kit was 92.2%. The immunochromatographic strip method can meet the requirements of clinical testing and provide technical support for ASFV diagnosis.",

The healing of wounds in diabetic patients is retarded by the elevation in the pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion and free radicles accumulation. Wound management in diabetic patients requires preventing bacterial biofilm development. Due to the wound healing activity of chitosan (CS), lecithin (Le) and melatonin (M), the present study aimed to load melatonin on CS/Le NPs and examine their effect on diabetic wounds infected with Staphylococcus aureus . Melatonin loaded chitosan/lecithin nanoparticles (M-CS/Le NPs) were physically characterized and their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities were examined in vitro. Male Sprague Dawley rats included two division (non-diabetic and diabetic) which were further divided in nine groups. Diabetes induction and follow up throughout the experimental period was confirmed by measuring the levels of fructosamine and blood glucose. Full-thickness wounds was induced in both non-diabetic and diabetic animals followed by infection with Staphylococcus aureus according to the experimental design. The wound healing effect of M-CS/Le NPs was evaluated through measurements of the oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines and apoptotic proteins. Our results showed the anti-microbial, free radical scavenging and hemolysis inhibition effects of M-CS/Le NPs in vitro. Moreover, the preparation of M-CS/Le NPs decreased the dose of used melatonin (when compared to free melatonin). M-CS/Le NPs significantly decreased the wound area percent in treated infected wounds of both non-diabetic and diabetic rats more than free melatonin or unloaded CS/Le NPs. In conclusion, M-CS/Le NPs promoted the wound healing in Staphylococcus aureus -infected wounds in diabetic rats.",

The focus of this research was to isolate the phytochemicals from grape seed and to determine their ability to prevent haemolysis, their antioxidant and microbiological activities. By using the extraction procedure, three solvents were used (distilled water, ethanol and methanol). A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) test was performed to analyse the phenolic compounds and flavonoids content that were used to determine the efficiency of the various solvents used in the extraction process. All the variables under study, namely yield percentage, phenolic component concentration, and flavonoid content got significantly affected by the choice of the solvent used. The flavonoid content of the extracts was in the order methanolic extract &gt; ethanolic extract &gt; water extract. The methanolic extract of the grape seeds exhibited the most powerful antioxidant and hemolysis inhibitory effects among the three extracts, followed by the ethanolic and water extracts. The antibacterial activity of methanolic extract was found to be higher as compared to the ethanolic extract against Staphylococcus aureus . The antibacterial activity of the ethanolic and methanolic extracts against Salmonella enteritidis , Bacillus subtilis , Aspergillus niger and Escherichia coli were found to be equivalent. In conclusion, grape seeds contained several bioactive compounds that exerted an antioxidant, hemolysis inhibition and anti-microbial activities. These activities depends on the concentration of phenolic compounds and flavonoids in the grape seed extracts. Methanol was the superior solvent in the extraction process followed by ethanol.",

The study involves morphological and biochemical identification of Enterococcus sp. and 16S rRNA gene sequencing methods, alongside an exploration of it’s antimicrobial, anti-diabetes and anti-Alzheimer efficacy. The cell-free supernatant (CFS) derived from this isolate ( Enterococcus durans ) exhibited a significant antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive ( Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis ) with inhibition zones of 31.1, 33 and 27 mm, respectively and Gram-negative ( Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi ) bacteria, recording inhibition zones of 24, 25 and 30 mm, respectively. The least values of MIC and MBC were 15.62 µg/ml and 31.25 µg/ml, respectively; in case of Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus . The highest MIC and MBC were 62.5 µg/ml and 250 µg/ml respectively, when testing CFS against Klebsiella pneumonia . Notably, the stability of CFS was maintained at various temperatures, including autoclaving conditions (121 ℃). The isolate displayed tolerance across a wide pH range (2.5—9.5), with enhanced activity observed at acidic pH levels. Butyrylcholinesterase inhibition was estimated to be 84.6%, while amylase inhibition was 97.6% &amp; 94.2%, respectively.

    "abstract": "The technique of microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP) has a bright prospect in the repair of concrete structures with diseases, so the evaluation of the repair effect and its influencing factors are very important issues for civil engineers. In this paper, multi-phase mixed precipitate models are established by using the random particle generation and packing algorithm. Combined with the cohesive zone model, the deformation and failure behavior of notched cement-mortar microbeams before and after repair under three-point bending loading are numerically simulated. The recovery rate is proposed to characterize the repair effect of microbeam. The repair effect and the influences of the proportion of crystalline phases in the precipitate, particle size and notch location on it are evaluated. It is found that the recovery rate of peak load of microbeam decreases from 22.16 to 20.60% as the proportion of calcite increases from 0 to 1 for the combination case of calcite and vaterite in the particles of the precipitate. However, for the combination case of calcite and aragonite, as the proportion of calcite increases from 0 to 1, the recovery rate of peak load decreases from 35.01 to 20.77%. For only calcite grains as the particles of the precipitate, the recovery rate of peak load increases from 12.73 to 36.85% when the particle size increases from 2 to 3.4 μm. When the distance between the notch center and the microbeam midspan increases from 0 to 40 μm, the recovery rate of peak load increases from 20.44 to 77.26%. The effects of the proportion of crystalline phases, particle size and notch location on the repairing effect of microbeams can be explained from the population of matrix-particle interface and stress concentration degree in precipitate. Considering that the precipitate compositions can be regulated by the control of environmental and process parameters, the research in this paper is of great significance for the engineering application of MICP technique.",

As proof of concept, the physiological and biotechnological characteristics of four autotrophic, hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea were examined to quantify novel physiological limits through the elimination of gas limitation during growth and methane formation. We determined unprecedented high maximum specific methane productivity (qCH 4 ) values for: Methanothermobacter marburgensis of 169.59 ± 12.52 mmol g − 1 h − 1 , Methanotorris igneus of 420.21 ± 89.46 mmol g − 1 h − 1 , Methanocaldococcus jannaschii of 364.52 ± 25.50 mmol g − 1 h − 1 and Methanocaldococcus villosus of 356.38 ± 20.79 mmol g − 1 h − 1 . Obtained qCH 4 of M. marburgensis is more than 10-fold higher compared to conventional closed batch cultivation set-ups and as high as the highest reported qCH 4 value of M. marburgensis from fed-batch gas fermentation in stirred tank bioreactors. Furthermore, the GPC demonstrated reliable functionality with Methanococcus maripaludis , operating safely and autonomous during long term cultivation. This novel device enables optimal headspace pressure control, providing flexibility in application for various gas-fermenting biotechnological processes. It facilitates near optimal cultivation conditions in semi-continuous closed batch cultivation mode, the analysis of limiting factors in high-throughput experimental design and allows for automated biomass production of autotrophic, hydrogenotrophic methanogens.

The study aimed to assess the effectiveness of pyrimethamine-loaded mPEG–PCL copolymeric nanoparticles (mPEG–PCL–Pyr) against Toxoplasma gondii ( T. gondii ) tachyzoites. The nanoparticles were fabricated using a nano-precipitation method and characterized using DLS and AFM. Through MTT assay, the anti-toxoplasmic activity was gauged. Healthy and infected cell viability, infection index, proliferation index, plaque count, and size were evaluated. Results indicated a maximum drug loading capacity of 11.23% in the nanoparticles. Toxicity testing on Vero cells infected with tachyzoites revealed notable cytotoxic effects at pyrimethamine-equivalent concentrations of 20 and 40 mg/mL in the mPEG–PCL copolymeric nanoparticle formulation. However, as the results indicated, the administration of mPEG–PCL–Pyr resulted in the reduction of intracellular proliferation, infection index, and the number and size of plaques in comparison to uninfected treated cells ( P &lt; 0.05). The synthesized Nano drug exhibited slightly better performance than pyrimethamine, despite the lack of statistical significance in the observed distinction ( p &gt; 0.05).

    "abstract": "Abstract Marketers of antioxidants and antimicrobials view fruit peels as a special, readily available, reasonably priced, natural, eco-friendly, and lucrative source. Mangos ( Mangifera indica L.) and their byproduct peels and kernels are nutrient-dense, distinctive, affordable, efficient, natural, and environmentally friendly sources of antibacterial agents, antioxidants, and other active chemicals. The current study aimed to prepare extracts of different degrees of polarity from mango peels, detect their active phytochemical compounds, and study their effects as antioxidants, antibacterials against food-borne pathogens, anti-biofilms, and anti-colon cancer in vitro. Phytochemical classes of compounds were screened using different standard methods. The most promising profile was for mango peel ethyl acetate extract (MPEE) due to the presence of a variety of phytochemicals including tannin, coumarin, alkaloids, flavonoids, phenols, steroids, and terpenoids at high concentrations compared to other mango peel extracts. Therefore, it was selected as the most valuable extract to examine its anti-colon cancer impact, anti-foodborne pathogenic bacteria, and antibiofilm. The anti-foodborne pathogenic activity of MPEE was evaluated against Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 7080, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 5638, Salmonella typhi DSM17058, Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Shigella sonnei DSM 5570, and Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 that showed highly impact for all. At MIC and MBC values of 500 μg/ml, the MPEE had a 100% bactericidal spectrum; at lower concentrations of 125–250 µg/ml, no antibacterial action was seen. The MPEE had a biofilm inhibition percentage ranging between 98.75–53.33%; B. cereus had the highest percentage and S. sonnei had the lowest. Furthermore, The MPEE demonstrated an anticancer activity against human colon epithelium ATB-37 (Caco2) with an IC 50 of 430.36 µg/ml. Molecular docking modeling assessment illustrated top-ranked confirmations between major phytochemicals and target protein COX2: P00406 and NFKB: Q63369.",

The diverse range of pathogenic bacteria found in these areas poses substantial management challenges because of their high prevalence of antibiotic resistance, which can be life-threatening, particularly for immunocompromised individuals, including older adults and children. This study identified airborne bacterial species from 14 natural parks in the Hail region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Bacterial colonies isolated on blood agar plates were purified and characterised based on their morphological traits and their ability to secrete various virulence factors. A total of 28 distinct airborne bacterial species were isolated and purified. Antibiotic susceptibility tests revealed high resistance to fosfomycin (41.17%), ampicillin (17.64%), tetracycline (17.64%), and gentamicin (11.76%). Biofilm formation was evaluated qualitatively by slime production and quantitatively by crystal violet technique. The results revealed that 41.17% of the tested strains were non biofilm producers on polystyrene surfaces, 17.64% were weak biofilm formers, and 23.52% exhibited moderate biofilm formation. Notably, six strains exhibited strong biofilm-forming capabilities. Additionally, two bacteria from the Arthrobacter genus (A. crystallopoietes and A. saudimassiliensis) were identified. These findings provide valuable insights into the microbial composition of natural parks in the Hail region and highlight effective management strategies to mitigate health risks.",

The gut microbiota influences host metabolism and immunity, yet its relationship with APOE genotype in healthy individuals is not well understood. The objective of this work was to examine associations between APOE genotype and gut microbiota composition and function in healthy adults, focusing on microbial and metabolic differences related to the APOE4 allele. Seventy-seven healthy Spanish adults were genotyped for APOE. Fecal microbiota profiles were assessed by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing, and predicted functions were inferred using PICRUSt2. Body composition (DEXA) and physical activity (accelerometry) were also measured. APOE4 carriers exhibited subtle shifts in microbiota composition, including a five-fold reduction in Megamonas and lower abundance of the Eubacterium brachy group-both linked to energy harvest and adiposity-compared to APOE3 homozygotes. An uncharacterized Puniceicoccaceae genus was enriched in APOE4 carriers. Although E. brachy group abundance correlated with adiposity, no significant differences in body composition were observed. Functional predictions showed APOE4-associated microbiota enriched in pathways for carotenoid biosynthesis and trehalose metabolism, and depleted in tryptophan biosynthesis, propionate production, and multidrug resistance mechanisms. APOE4 carriers harbor gut microbiota with distinct taxonomic and functional features, potentially reflecting adaptations to metabolic and oxidative challenges. These findings underscore the relevance of the gut microbiome in shaping APOE4-associated phenotypes and warrant further investigation into its mechanistic contributions to health and disease.",

    "abstract": "L-asparaginase is an important enzyme used in the pharmaceutical and food industries. Nowadays, bacterial species represent the main source of microbial synthesis for L-asparaginase. But studies aimed at improving production yields and new methods that use various microbes to expand the scope of application for the generated enzyme are also necessary for industrial manufacturing. This study focused on the isolation of Bacillus paralicheniformis AUMC B-516 and the optimization of L-asparaginase production under submerged fermentation. The enzyme was purified and characterized, followed by an evaluation of its cytotoxic effects against the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line. The results revealed potent anticancer activity, highlighting the potential application of the purified enzyme in cancer therapeutics. Bacillus paralicheniformis AUMC B-516 was utilized for the biosynthesis of L-asparaginase (116.4 U/mL) after 48 h in the presence of 0.2% glucose and 1.0% L-asparagine at 35 °C and pH 8.0. Two-step chromatography (DEAE-cellulose and Sephacryl S200 HR) achieved a 12-fold purification, resulting in an enzyme specific activity of 4087.6 U/mg. For pure L-asparaginase that contained L-asparagine, the Km and Vmax values were 6.22 × 10-2 mM and 120.75 µmol/min, respectively. Quantitative assessment of DNA fragmentation in MCF‑7 cells treated with B. paralicheniformis B-516' pure L-asparaginase was performed (22.2 ± 1.36%) and the drug doxorubicin (23.9 ± 0.93%) were significantly greater than those in the negative control cells (8.9 ± 0.83%). MCF-7 cells treated with 1000, 500, 250, 125, 62.5, or 31.25 µg/mL B. paralicheniformis AUMC B-516' pure L-asparaginase showed considerable cytotoxicity, with an IC50 of 49.3 µg/mL. Biochemical analyses revealed significant increases in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities, while blood glucose, other electrolyte levels, and indicators of renal function remained unchanged. These findings highlight B. paralicheniformis AUMC B-516 as a promising source of L-asparaginase for future biotechnological and pharmaceutical applications.",

    "abstract": "Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD), a viral disease affecting cattle and related species, entered India in 2019, with first outbreak reported in Odisha, and has since caused significant economic losses to the Indian livestock sector. Following its entry, the disease spread rapidly to various states, including the northeastern region which is known for its porous borders. A total of 56 clinical samples (whole blood, skin scrapings, nasal swab, skin lesions and serum) were collected from various outbreaks of LSD in Meghalaya. World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH)-recommended probe-based real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting LSDV126 region detected Lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) in 42 out of 56 clinical samples. Additionally, 182 contemporary serum samples were screened using commercial ELISA kit which indicated an apparent seroprevalence of 11.54% (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.7-17%) and a true prevalence of 12.3% (95% CI 7.86-18.53%). Three representative samples were subjected to partial sequencing-based phylogenetic analysis targeting the LSDVp32 and LSDV117 regions which confirmed the diagnosis of LSD and also revealed circulation of the Kenyan field strain-associated LSDV. Furthermore, a novel isothermal approach exploiting Saltatory Rolling Circle Amplification (SRCA) mechanism was also explored with WOAH-recommended conventional PCR primers which yielded results comparable to real-time PCR-based diagnostic methods with a minimum detection limit of 10 copies/µL of the standard plasmid. The availability of this rapid and reliable diagnostic assay could be harnessed for early diagnosis of LSD, especially in resource-limited and field laboratory settings and ultimately aid in the timely implementation of control strategies.",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests a complex interplay among dietary habits, gut microbiota, and hepatobiliary cancers, yet the causal relationships remain unclear. Here, we conducted a comprehensive two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using genetic instruments from large European cohorts to assess causality among 88 dietary components, 1080 microbiota traits, liver cancer (500 cases, 314,193 controls), and biliary tract cancer (1207 cases, 314,193 controls). We identified significant causal associations of 17 dietary and 101 microbial traits with hepatobiliary cancer risk, while 11 dietary and 70 microbiota traits showed evidence of reverse causality, indicating potential disease-driven alterations. Importantly, a two-step MR mediation analysis revealed that 43 microbial taxa and 6 metabolic pathways significantly mediated dietary influences on hepatobiliary cancer risk; notably, Mollicutes RF9 mediated 31% of the protective effect exerted by zinc on biliary tract cancer. These findings provide genetic evidence delineating gut microbiota as key intermediaries connecting dietary intake to hepatobiliary cancers, highlighting microbiome-targeted dietary strategies as potential preventive interventions. Further research is required to confirm these causal mechanisms and facilitate the development of targeted prevention and therapeutic approaches.",

This work aims to isolate and characterize actinomycetes strains from Egyptian soil, emphasizing the evaluating their antibacterial efficiency, optimizating their metabolite production, and assessing molluscicidal activities against Biomphalaria alexandrina (B. alexandrina), an intermediate host of Schistosoma mansoni (S. mansoni). Nineteen actinomycetes isolates were screened for antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli), Salmonella typhi (S. typhi), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Candida albicans (C. albicans), and Penicillium marneffei (P. marneffei). Isolate No. 10, later identified as Streptomyces rochei ASN (S. rochei ) via 16 S rDNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and was selected for further study. Production media optimization revealed that modified nutritional agar, starch as a carbon source, sodium nitrate as a nitrogen source, and 25 °C incubation maximized antimicrobial metabolite production. Antibacterial activity increased with extended incubation time, peaking at 8 days. Dose-dependent inhibition was observed when different concentrations (20-80%) of cell-free supernatant (CFS) from S. rochei ASN were applied to test pathogens, with S. aureus, C. albicans, and P. marneffei being most susceptible. Scanning electron microscopy revealed severe cellular and structural damage in treated microbes. The CFS also demonstrated significant molluscicidal activity, with LC₅₀ and LC₉₀ values of 26.85 ppm and 40.95 ppm, respectively. It inhibited the hatchability of B. alexandrina eggs in a concentration- and age-dependent manner, and exerted rapid, dose-dependent mortality against S. mansoni miracidia and cercariae. Histological examinations of exposed snails showed degeneration in both hermaphrodite and digestive glands, including disrupted acinar structures, damaged oocytes and spermatocytes, vacuolated digestive cells, and degenerated secretory cells. S. rochei ASN, isolated from Egyptian soil, exhibits potent antimicrobial and molluscicidal activities. Its bioactivity is significantly influenced by growth conditions and medium composition. The strain holds promise as a natural biocontrol agent against pathogenic microbes and snail vectors involved in schistosomiasis transmission, warranting further pharmacological and ecological investigations.",

To address the challenges of food waste while contributing to sustainable leather production, this study explores the feasibility of developing an alternative, ecofriendly leather material. Talaormyces sp. was isolated from eggplant peel waste and was identified using phylogenetic ITS region (Genbank accession number: PQ007745); the closest relatedness was with Talaromyces atroroseus. Eggplant peel waste was exposed to electron beam irradiation at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 kGy. The results showed that exposure of eggplant peel waste to electron beam irradiation affected its rigidity, color, and tensile strength, where exposure to 15 kGy resulted in flexible material that showed tensile strength of 8 MPa, whereas non-irradiated sheets showed tensile strengths of 5 MPa. Modification and optimization of the cultivation media were performed using Full Factorial Design of Experiment. Sucrose (20, 40 g/L), calcium chloride (0.5, 1 M), and glycerol (10, 20%) were tested as 3 factors, two levels. The results showed that increasing the concentration of sucrose in the cultivation media from 20 to 40 g/L increased the mycelial network and induced exopolysaccharides, which act as the bio-binder in the mycelial-leather forming process. A post-treatment study was performed to ensure that there are no spores in the myco-product. These findings demonstrate that both fungal mycelium and eggplant waste-derived fungal sheets have great potential as ecofriendly materials with leather-like properties.",

In this study, we investigated the spatial and temporal dynamics of cellulose degradation by Caldicellulosiruptfor obsidiansis , which does not produce cellulosomes, and Clostridium thermocellum , which does produce cellulosomes. Results showed that the degradation of either regenerated or natural cellulose was synchronized with biofilm formation, a process characterized by the formation and fusion of numerous crater-like depressions on the cellulose surface. In addition, the dynamics of biofilm formation were similar in both bacteria, regardless of cellulosome production. Only the areas of cellulose surface colonized by microbes were significantly degraded, highlighting the essential role of the cellulolytic biofilm in cellulose utilization. After initial attachment, the microbial biofilm structure remained thin, uniform and dense throughout the experiment. A cellular automaton model, constructed under the assumption that the attached cells divide and produce daughter cells that contribute to the hydrolysis of the adjacent cellulose, can largely simulate the observed process of biofilm formation and cellulose degradation. This study presents a model, based on direct observation, correlating cellulolytic biofilm formation with cellulose degradation.",

Dietary fibres are usually of plant origin however microbial exopolysaccharides (EPSs) have analogue structures that could potentially exert similar physiological effects. Pediococcus parvulus 2.6 (Pd 2.6) excretes a ropy EPS and has previously shown probiotic potential. The aim of this work was to evaluate physiological effects of Pd 2.6 and its EPS in vivo. The live Pd 2.6 (both the ropy and non-ropy isogenic variant) and its purified EPS were fed to hypercholesterolemic LDL-receptor deficient mice for 6 weeks to investigate their effects on cholesterol levels and the inflammatory tone of the animals. Both variants of Pd 2.6 survived passage through the mouse gut fulfilling an important criterion of probiotics. The ability to produce EPS was conferring an advantage to survival (faecal recovery of 3.7 (1.9-8.7) vs. 0.21 (0.14-0.34) *108 CFU, P < 0.001, median and 25th and 75th percentiles). The ropy Pd 2.6 decreased the levels of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 compared to the EPS alone (591 ± 14 vs. 646 ± 13 ng/ml, P < 0.05). An increase in liver weight in mice fed the purified EPS was observed, but with no change in liver lipids. No changes in blood lipids were detected in any group. Further the EPS induced growth of the caecal tissue and increased the amount of caecal content showing bulking properties like that of a dietary fibre.",

CA was completely transformed into 4-VC after 48 h of incubation. No 4-vinylphenol or other derivatives could be identified in the reaction media. In this study we demonstrate the capability of L. johnsonii to transform chlorogenic acids from green coffee extract into 4-VC in two steps one pot reaction. Thus, the enzymatic potential of certain lactobacilli might be explored to generate flavor compounds from plant polyphenols.",

Thus it is imperative to develop cost effective and scalable process for the production of vaccines so as to make them affordable for mass use. In this study, performance of a novel disposable iCELLis fixed bed bioreactor system was investigated for the production of some viral vaccines like Rabies, Hepatitis-A and Chikungunya vaccines in comparison to conventional systems like the commercially available packed bed system and roller bottle system. Vero and MRC-5 cell substrates were evaluated for growth parameters in all the three systems maintaining similar seeding density, multiplicity of infection (MOI) and media components. It was observed that Vero cells showed similar growth in all the three bioreactors whereas MRC-5 cells showed better growth in iCELLis Nano system and roller bottle system. Subsequently, the virus infection and antigen production studies also revealed that for Hepatitis-A and Chikungunya iCELLis Nano bioreactor system was better to the commercial packed bed bioreactor and roller bottle systems. Although for rabies antigen production commercially available packed bed bioreactor system was found to be better. This study shows that different bioreactor platforms may be employed for viral vaccine production and iCELLis Nano is one of such new convenient and a stable platform for production of human viral vaccines.",

    "abstract": "The AcrAB-TolC efflux pump is involved in maintaining intrinsic organic solvent tolerance in Escherichia coli. Mutations in regulatory genes such as marR, soxR, and acrR are known to increase the expression level of the AcrAB-TolC pump. To identify these mutations in organic solvent tolerant E. coli, eight cyclohexane-tolerant E. coli JA300 mutants were isolated and examined by DNA sequencing for mutations in marR, soxR, and acrR. Every mutant carried a mutation in either marR or acrR. Among all mutants, strain CH7 carrying a nonsense mutation in marR (named marR109) and an insertion of IS5 in acrR, exhibited the highest organic solvent-tolerance levels. To clarify the involvement of these mutations in improving organic solvent tolerance, they were introduced into the E. coli JA300 chromosome by site-directed mutagenesis using λ red-mediated homologous recombination. Consequently, JA300 mutants carrying acrR::IS5, marR109, or both were constructed and named JA300 acrR IS, JA300 marR, or JA300 acrR IS marR, respectively. The organic solvent tolerance levels of these mutants were increased in the following order: JA300 < JA300 acrR IS < JA300 marR < JA300 acrR IS marR. JA300 acrR IS marR formed colonies on an agar plate overlaid with cyclohexane and p-xylene (6:4 vol/vol mixture). The organic solvent-tolerance level and AcrAB-TolC efflux pump-expression level in JA300 acrR IS marR were similar to those in CH7. Thus, it was shown that the synergistic effects of mutations in only two regulatory genes, acrR and marR, can significantly increase organic solvent tolerance in E. coli.",

BXA43 was purified to homogeneity from the cell lysate and found to be a dual-specificity exo-hydrolase active on para-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside (pNPX), para-nitrophenyl-α-L-arabinofuranoside (pNPA), β-(1 → 4)-xylopyranosyl oligomers (XOS) of degree of polymerisation (DP) 2–4, and birchwood xylan. A phylogenetic tree of the 92 characterised GH43 enzymes displayed five distinct groups (I − V) showing specificity differences. BXA43 belonged to group IV and had an activity ratio for pNPA:pNPX of 1:25. BXA43 was stable below 40°C and at pH 4.0–8.0 and showed maximum activity at pH 5.5 and 50°C. Km and kcat for pNPX were 15.6 ± 4.2 mM and 60.6 ± 10.8 s-1, respectively, and substrate inhibition became apparent above 18 mM pNPX. Similar kinetic parameters and catalytic efficiency values were reported for β-d-xylosidase (XynB3) from Geobacillus stearothermophilus T‒6 also belonging to group IV. The activity of BXA43 for xylooligosaccharides increased with the size and was 2.3 and 5.6 fold higher, respectively for xylobiose and xylotetraose compared to pNPX. BXA43 showed clearly metal inhibition for Zn2+ and Ag+, which is different to its close homologues. Multiple sequence alignment and homology modelling indicated that Arg505Tyr506 present in BXA43 are probably important for binding to xylotetraose at subsite +3 and occur only in GH43 from the Bifidobacterium genus.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Currently, pursuing yeast strains that display both a high potential fitness for alcoholic fermentation and a favorable impact on quality is a major goal in the alcoholic beverage industry. This considerable industrial interest has led to many studies characterizing the phenotypic and metabolic traits of commercial yeast populations. In this study, 20 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains from different geographical origins exhibited high phenotypic diversity when their response to nine biotechnologically relevant conditions was examined. Next, the fermentation fitness and metabolic traits of eight selected strains with a unique phenotypic profile were evaluated in a high-sugar synthetic medium under two nitrogen regimes. Although the strains exhibited significant differences in nitrogen requirements and utilization rates, a direct relationship between nitrogen consumption, specific growth rate, cell biomass, cell viability, acetic acid and glycerol formation was only observed under high-nitrogen conditions. In contrast, the strains produced more succinic acid under the low-nitrogen regime, and a direct relationship with the final cell biomass was established. Glucose and fructose utilization patterns depended on both yeast strain and nitrogen availability. For low-nitrogen fermentation, three strains did not fully degrade the fructose. This study validates phenotypic and metabolic diversity among commercial wine yeasts and contributes new findings on the relationship between nitrogen availability, yeast cell growth and sugar utilization. We suggest that measuring nitrogen during the stationary growth phase is important because yeast cells fermentative activity is not exclusively related to population size, as previously assumed, but it is also related to the quantity of nitrogen consumed during this growth phase.",

In addition, a correlation analysis was performed for the obtained binding numbers and the mannan-, glucan- and protein contents of the products, respectively. In a subsequent experiment, different yeast strains were fermented and treated by autolysis or French press to obtain a concentrated yeast cell wall. The capacity of yeast cell wall products to bind E. coli F4 and Salmonella Typhimurium was assessed with a quantitative microbiological microplate-based assay by measuring the optical density (OD) as the growth parameter of adhering bacteria. Total mannan and glucan were determined by HPLC using an isocratic method and a Refractive Index (RI) Detector. Total protein was determined by Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN). Statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS V19 using Spearman correlation and Mann Whitney U Test.Different yeast derivatives show different binding numbers, which indicate differences in product quality.Interestingly, the binding numbers for Salmonella Typhimurium are consistently higher (between one and two orders of magnitude) than for E. coli F4.We could demonstrate some statistical significant correlations between the mannan- and glucan content of different yeast derivatives and pathogen binding numbers; however, for the different yeast strains fermented under standardized laboratory conditions, no statistically significant correlations between the mannan- and glucan content and the binding numbers for E. coli and Salmonella Typhimurium were found.Interestingly, we could demonstrate that the yeast autolysis had a statistically significant difference on E. coli binding in contrast to the French press treatment. Salmonella binding was independent of these two treatments.As such, we could not give a clear statement about the binding factors involved. We propose that many more factors apart from mannan- and glucan content, such as cell wall structure, strain diversity, structural diversity, structural surroundings, and non-specific interactions play important roles in pathogen immobilization.",

Ralstonia eutropha is regarded as the model organism for PHA biosynthesis. We examined the effects of PHA depolymerase (PhaZ) expression on PHA homeostasis in R. eutropha strains. In order to analyze the impact of PhaZs on R. eutropha granule architecture, we performed electron microscopy on several phaZ knockout strains and the wild type strain grown under PHA production conditions. Analysis of the acquired micrographs was based on stereology: the ratio of granule area and cell area was determined, along with total granule count per full-size cell image. Cells bearing a phaZ2 knockout mutation alone or in conjunction with a phaZ1 mutation were found to have a high granule volume per cell volume and a higher granule count compared to wild type. A phaZ quadruple knockout strain appeared to have a low granule volume per cell volume and a low granule count per cell. Cells bearing a phaZ3 knockout were found to have a higher granule count than the wild type, whereas granule volume per cell volume was similar. Accordingly, we hypothesize that PhaZs have not only an impact on PHA degradation but also on the 3-dimensional granule architecture. Based on our data, PhaZ2 is postulated to affect granule density. This work increased our knowledge about PHA depolymerases in R. eutropha , including enzymes that had previously been uncharacterized.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing recognition that the healthcare environment acts as an important reservoir for transmission of healthcare acquired infections (HCAI). One method of reducing environmental contamination would be use of antimicrobial materials. The antimicrobial activity of thin silica-copper films prepared by chemical vapour deposition was evaluated against standard strains of bacteria used for disinfectant testing and bacteria of current interest in HCAI. The structure of the coatings was determined using Scanning Electron Microscopy and their hardness and adhesion to the substrate determined. Antimicrobial activity was tested using a method based on BS ISO 22196:2007. The coatings had a pale green-brown colour and had a similar hardness to steel. SEM showed nano-structured aggregates of Cu within a silica matrix. A log10 reduction in viability of >5 could be obtained within 4 h for the disinfectant test strains and within 6 h for producing Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Activity against the other hospital isolates was slower but still gave log10 reduction factors of >5 for extended spectrum β-lactamase producing Escherichia coli and >3 for vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa within 24 h. The results demonstrate the importance of testing antimicrobial materials destined for healthcare use against isolates of current interest in hospitals as well as standard test strains. The coatings used here can also be applied to substrates such as metals and ceramics and have potential applications where reduction of microbial environmental contamination is desirable.",

In this research, characteristics of GluDH from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SB5 (GluDH-BA) was reported for the first time. Despite a highly similar amino acid sequence when comparing with GluDH from Bacillus subtilis (GluDH-BS), GluDH-BA exhibited significantly higher specific activity (4.7-fold) and stability when pH was higher than 6. While an optimum activity of GluDH-BA was observed at a temperature of 50 °C, the enzyme was stable only up to 42 °C. GluDH-BA exhibited an extreme tolerance towards n-hexane and its respective alcohols. The productivity of GluDH obtained in this study (8.42 mg-GluDH/g-wet cells; 1035 U/g-wet cells) was among the highest productivity reported for recombinant E. coli. With its low K M-value towards glucose (5.5 mM) and NADP(+) (0.05 mM), GluDH-BA was highly suitable for in vivo applications. In this work, a recombinant solvent-tolerant B. subtilis BA overexpressing GluDH-BA was developed and evaluated by coupling with B. subtilis overexpressing an enzyme P450 BM3 F87V for a whole-cell hydroxylation of n-hexane. Significantly higher products obtained clearly proved that B. subtilis BA was an effective cofactor regenerator, a valuable asset for bioproduction of value-added chemicals.",

The composition of natural grape must (NGM) can be variable; thus, to ensure reproducibility, a synthetic grape must (SGM) with defined composition is commonly used. The aim of this work was to create conditions to advance the use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae laboratory strains for wine fermentation studies, considering previous results obtained for enological strains fermenting NGM under simulated winery conditions. We designed a new SGM formulation, ISA-SGM, by introducing specific modifications to a commonly used formulation, putting together previous reports. We added glucose and fructose in equal amounts (125 g/l) and 50 parts per million (ppm) sulfur dioxide (SO 2, corresponding to standard enological treatment), and we optimized the concentrations of malic acid (3 g/l), citric acid (0.3 g/l), and tartaric acid (3 g/l). Using ISA-SGM, we obtained similar fermentative profiles for the wine strain ISA1000, the prototrophic strain S288C, and its auxotrophic derivative BY4741. In this case, the concentrations of supplements were optimized to 120 mg/l L-uracil, 80 mg/l L-methionine, 400 mg/l L-leucine, and 100 mg/l L-histidine. All these strains tested in ISA-SGM presented a similar fermentative performance as ISA1000 in NGM. ISA-SGM formulation is a promising new tool to allow the use of the auxotrophic BY strains in the detailed assessment of the alcoholic fermentation process under simulated winery conditions, and it provides a foundation to extract relevant physiological conclusions in future research on enological yeast traits.",

The gene lehex20a gene had 1,659 nucleotides, encoding 553 amino acid residues. Sequence analysis indicated that LeHex20A belongs to glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 20, and homologues of lehex20a are broadly represented in the genomes of basidiomycetes. Purified LeHex20A hydrolyzed the terminal monosaccharide residues of β-N-acetylgalactosaminides and β-N-acetylglucosaminides, indicating that LeHex20A is a β-N-acetylhexosaminidase classified into EC 3.2.1.52. The maximum LeHex20A activity was observed at pH 4.0 and 50°C. The kinetic constants were estimated using chitooligosaccharides with degree of polymerization 2-6. GH20 β-N-acetylhexosaminidases generally prefer chitobiose among natural substrates. However, LeHex20A had the highest catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for chitotetraose, and the Km values for GlcNAc6 were 3.9-fold lower than for chitobiose. Furthermore, the enzyme partially hydrolyzed amorphous chitin polymers. These results indicate that LeHex20A can produce N-acetylglucosamine from long-chain chitomaterials.",

Fusarium spp. are producing a plethora of mycotoxins including zearalenone (ZEN), deoxynivalenol (DON) and its acetylated derivatives, 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3-ADON) and 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (15-ADON). The SMCD 2220-01 strain substantially reduced DON, 3-ADON, 15-ADON, and ZEN production capacity in co-culture system. Degradation and detoxification of the pure mycotoxins were also achieved when exposed to SMCD 2220-01 in shake flasks. The thin layer chromatography (TLC) combined with high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-high resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-HRMS) revealed that the amount of mycotoxins exposed to SMCD 2220-01 was considerably reduced compared to control. ZEN level was decreased by 97%, while zearalenone sulfate ([M-H+SO3]- at m/z 397.1052 C18H21O8S1) was detected as a metabolite of ZEN converted to less toxic molecule by the mycoparasite.

    "abstract": "Styrene monooxygenases (SMOs) are flavoenzymes catalyzing the epoxidation of styrene into styrene oxide. SMOs are composed of a monooxygenase (StyA) and a reductase (StyB). The latter delivers reduced FAD to StyA on the expense of NADH. We identified Rhodococcus opacus 1CP as the first microorganism to possess three different StyA isoforms occurring in two systems StyA1/StyA2B and StyA/StyB, respectively. The hydrodynamic properties of StyA isozymes were found to be modulated by the binding of the (reduced) FAD cofactor. StyA1 and SyA2B mainly occur as dimers in their active forms while StyA is a monomer. StyA1 showed the highest epoxidation activity and excellent enantioselectivity in aromatic sulfoxidation. The hydrodynamic and biocatalytic properties of SMOs from strain 1CP are of relevance for investigation of possible industrial applications.",

    "abstract": "Itaconic acid, an unsaturated C5-dicarboxylic acid, is a biobased building block for the polymer industry. The purpose of this study was to establish proof of principle for an anaerobic fermentation process for the production of itaconic acid by modification of the mixed acid fermentation pathway of E. coli. E. coli BW25113 (DE3) and the phosphate acetyltransferase (pta) and lactate dehydrogenase (ldhA) deficient strain E. coli BW25113 (DE3) Δpta-ΔldhA were used to study anaerobic itaconate production in E. coli. Heterologous expression of the gene encoding cis-aconitate decarboxylase (cadA) from A. terreus in E. coli BW25113 (DE3) did not result in itaconate production under anaerobic conditions, but 0.08 mM of itaconate was formed when the genes encoding citrate synthase (gltA) and aconitase (acnA) from Corynebacterium glutamicum were also expressed. The same amount was produced when cadA was expressed in E. coli BW25113 (DE3) Δpta-ΔldhA. The titre increased 8 times to 0.66 mM (1.2 % Cmol) when E. coli BW25113 (DE3) Δpta-ΔldhA also expressed gltA and acnA. In addition, this strain produced 8.5 mM (13 % Cmol) of glutamate. The use of a nitrogen-limited growth medium reduced the accumulation of glutamate by nearly 50 % compared to the normal medium, and also resulted in a more than 3-fold increase of the itaconate titre to 2.9 mM. These results demonstrated that E. coli has potential to produce itaconate and glutamate under anaerobic conditions, closing the redox balance by co-production of succinate or ethanol with H2 and CO2.",

The conversion of glucose to gluconic acid is carried out by secretion of the enzyme, glucose oxidase. In this work, the gene encoding glucose oxidase was identified and deleted from A. carbonarius with the aim of changing the carbon flux towards other organic acids. The effect of genetic engineering was examined by testing glucose oxidase deficient (Δgox) mutants for the production of different organic acids in a defined production medium.

This strategy will allow reducing the redox balance problem observed when the glycerol pathway is blocked, and hereby improve ethanol production.

For the utilization of the endophyte as a commercial biocontrol agent, the fungus has to be mass-produced. B. bassiana was raised in shake flask cultures to produce high concentrations of total spores (TS), which include blastospores (BS) and submerged conidiospores (SCS). The highest concentration of 1.33×10 9 TS/mL and the highest yield of 5.32×10 10 TS/g sucrose was obtained in the TKI broth with 5% sugar beet molasses which consists of 50% sucrose as a carbon source. In spite of the lower sugar concentration (2.5%) the amount of TS could be increased up to 11-times in contrast to the cultivation with 5% sucrose. The scale-up to a 2 L stirred tank reactor was carried out at 25°C, 200–600 rpm and 1 vvm at pH 5.5. A TS yield of 5.2×10 10 TS/g sucrose corresponding to a SCS yield of 0.2×10 10 SCS/g sucrose was obtained after 216 h. With regards to the culture medium the cost of 10 12 TS amounts to 0.24 €. Plutella xylostella larvae, which were fed with oilseed rape leaves treated with spores from fermentation resulted in 77 ± 5% mortality. Moreover, spores from submerged cultivation were able to colonize oilseed rape leaves via leaf application. This is the first report of fermentation of an endophytic B. bassiana strain in a low-cost culture medium to very high yields of TS.",

Here, we performed qPCR based absolute quantitation of selected rumen microbes in the liquid and solid fraction of the rumen fluid of river buffalo adapted to varying proportion of concentrate to green or dry roughages and compared with the MG-RAST based annotation of the metagenomes sequences of 16S r-DNA amplicons and high throughput shotgun sequencing. Animals were adapted to roughage-to-concentrate ratio in the proportion of 50:50, 75:25 and 100:00, respectively for six weeks. At the end of each treatment, rumen fluid was collected at 3 h post feeding. qPCR revealed that the relative abundance of Prevotella bryantii was higher, followed by the two cellulolytic bacteria Fibrobacter succinogens and Ruminococcus flavefaciens that accounted up to 1.33% and 0.78% of the total rumen bacteria, respectively. While, Selenomonas ruminantium and archaea Methanomicrobiales were lower in microbial population in the rumen of buffalo. There was no statistically significant difference between the enumerations shown by qPCR and analysis of the shotgun sequencing data by MG-RAST except for Prevotella. These results indicate the variations in abundance of different microbial species in buffalo rumen under varied feeding regimes as well as in different fractions of rumen liquor, i.e. solid and the liquid. The results also present the reliability of shotgun sequencing to describe metagenome and analysis/annotation by MG-RAST.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aerobic microbial degradation of p -nitrophenol (PNP) has been classically shown to proceed via ‘Hydroquinone (HQ) pathway’ in Gram-negative bacteria, whereas in Gram-positive PNP degraders it proceed via ‘Benzenetriol (BT) pathway’. These pathways are characterized by the ring cleavage of HQ and BT as terminal aromatic intermediates respectively. Earlier reports on PNP degradation have indicated these pathways to be mutually exclusive. We report involvement of both ‘HQ’ and ‘BT’ ring cleavage pathways in PNP degradation by Burkholderia sp. strain SJ98. Genetic characterization of an ~41 Kb DNA fragment harboring PNP degradation gene cluster cloned and sequenced from strain SJ98 showed presence of multiple orfs including pnpC and pnpD which corresponded to previously characterized ‘benzenetriol-dioxygenase (BtD)’ and ‘maleylacetate reductase (MaR)’ respectively. This gene cluster also showed presence of pnpE1 and pnpE2, which shared strong sequence identity to cognate sub-units of ‘hydroquinone dioxygenase’ (HqD). Heterologous expression and biochemical characterization ascertained the identity of PnpE1 and PnpE2. In in vitro assay reconstituted heterotetrameric complex of PnpE1 and PnpE2 catalyzed transformation of hydroquinone (HQ) into corresponding hydroxymuconic semialdehyde (HMS) in a substrate specific manner. Together, these results clearly establish branching of PNP degradation in strain SJ98. We propose that strain SJ98 presents a useful model system for future studies on evolution of microbial degradation of PNP.",

Hence, the phy US417 corresponding gene was cloned in the pMSP3535 vector, and for the first time for a plasmid carrying the pAMβ1 replication origin, multimeric forms of the resulting plasmid were used to transform naturally competent B. subtilis 168 cells. Subsequently, a sequential optimization strategy based on Plackett-Burman and Box-Behnken experimental designs was applied to enhance phytase production by the recombinant Bacillus. The maximum phytase activity of 47 U ml-1 was reached in the presence of 12.5 g l-1 of yeast extract and 15 g l-1 of ammonium sulphate with shaking at 300 rpm. This is 73 fold higher than the activity produced by the native US417 strain before optimization. Characterization of the produced recombinant phytase has revealed that the enzyme exhibited improved thermostability compared to the wild type PHY US417 phytase strengthening its potential for application as feed supplement. Together, our findings strongly suggest that the strategy herein developed combining heterologous expression using a cloning vector carrying the pAMβ1 replication origin and experimental designs optimization can be generalized for recombinant proteins production in Bacillus.",

The outdoor cultivation of microalgae is subject to extreme temperature fluctuations; temperature tolerant microalgae would help mitigate this problem. The waters of the Roman Baths, which have a temperature range between 39°C and 46°C, were sampled for microalgae. A total of 3 green algae, 1 diatom and 4 cyanobacterial species were successfully isolated into ‘unialgal’ culture. Four isolates were filamentous, which could prove advantageous for low energy dewatering of cultures using filtration. Lipid content, profiles and growth rates of the isolates were examined at temperatures of 20, 30, 40°C, with and without nitrogen starvation and compared against the oil producing green algal species, Chlorella emersonii . Some isolates synthesized high levels of lipids, however, all were most productive at temperatures lower than those of the Roman Baths. The eukaryotic algae accumulated a range of saturated and polyunsaturated FAMEs and all isolates generally showed higher lipid accumulation under nitrogen deficient conditions ( Klebsormidium sp. increasing from 1.9% to 16.0% and Hantzschia sp. from 31.9 to 40.5%). The cyanobacteria typically accumulated a narrower range of FAMEs that were mostly saturated, but were capable of accumulating a larger quantity of lipid as a proportion of dry weight ( M. laminosus, 37.8% fully saturated FAMEs). The maximum productivity of all the isolates was not determined in the current work and will require further effort to optimise key variables such as light intensity and media composition.",

Consequently, isolation of novel FFase producers from a sucrose-enriched biotope would help improve FOS productivity and reduce the process cost. Here, three fungi isolated from a unique sugarcane molasses habitat were found to possess FFase activity and one of them, XG21, exhibited a high capacity to synthesize FOS. Analysis of its morphological properties and ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence allowed the taxonomic position to be assigned and it was thus identified as Aspergillus tubingensis XG21. It could utilize various potential carbon sources for vigorous growth, but only produced high-level FFase activity on sucrose. Furthermore, the transfructosylation ability and FOS synthesis were analyzed by TLC and HPLC. During the transfructosylation reaction, an increase in sucrose concentration led to the remarkable enhancement in FOS formation with the maximum content of up to 56.9% within 8 h. Finally, the sugarcane molasses was used to cultivate A. tubingensis XG21 and the optimal FFase activity reached up to 558.3 U/g, which was 88.9% higher than that with sucrose as carbon source.

According to CCD, quadratic optimal model with R2 = 0.99 was used. By analysis of variance, the most effective values of each factor were determined in each experiment. According to the results, the most optimal conditions for removal efficiency of acetamiprid (pH = 7.5, contact time = 65 min, and dose of nanoparticle 550 mg/L) was obtained at 76.55%. Effect concentration (EC50) for RR and CFU test were 1.950 and 2.050 mg/L, respectively. Based on the results obtained from the model, predicted response values showed high congruence with actual response values. And, the model was suitable for the experiment's design conditions.",

    "abstract": "A significant growth promotion of Euglena gracilis was achieved by simply adding ferulic acid from rice bran without diminishing the accumulation of valuable products like paramylon. E. gracilis is a freshwater microalga that is widely applied in cosmetics, food, medicine, and supplements, and it is considered a potential source of biofuel. It is therefore important to enhance its yield at a lower cost for its commercial viability. Introducing a growth regulator derived from agro waste is considered a cheaper and safer strategy to improve biomass productivity compared with other alternatives such as implementing genetic engineering or adding nutrients and plant hormones as growth stimulator. The effect of ferulic acid derived from rice bran on the growth and metabolism of E. gracilis was investigated in this study. To aid in the dissolution of ferulic acid, 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to Cramer-Myers medium. Ferulic acid could alleviate the inhibitory effect of DMSO and significantly promoted the growth of E. gracilis. It was found that cell density was 2.5 times greater than that of the control group and 3.6 times greater than that of the negative control group when 500 mg/L of ferulic acid was added. In addition, the photosynthetic pigment content, especially chlorophyll a, increased with increasing ferulic acid concentrations. The total paramylon production would also be enhanced by ferulic acid since the number of cells increased without reducing the cellular content of paramylon.",

Acremonium cellulolyticus is a mesophilic fungus which produces a high amount of cellulose-related enzymes. In the genome sequence data of A. cellulolyticus, ORFs showing homology to GH10 and GH11 xylanases were found. The xylanases of A. cellulolyticus play an important role in cellulolytic biomass degradation. Search of a draft genome sequence of A. cellulolyticus for xylanase coding regions identified seven ORFs showing homology to GH 11 xylanase genes (xylA, xylB, xylC, xylD, xylE, xylF and xylG). These genes were cloned and their enzymes were prepared with a homologous expression system under the control of a glucoamylase promoter. Six of the seven recombinant enzymes were successfully expressed, prepared, and characterized. These enzymes exhibited optimal xylanase activity at pH 4.0 - 4.5. But this time, we found that only XylC had enormously higher relative activity (2947 U•mg (-1)) than the other xylanases at optimum pH. This result is surprising because XylC does not retain a carbohydrate-binding module 1 (CBM-1) that is necessary to bind tightly own substrate such as xylan. In this study, we discuss the relationship between activity, pH and sequence of seven xylanases in A. cellulolyticus.",

In the current study, conversion of both glucose and xylose sugars into ethanol in wet exploded bagasse hydrolysates was investigated without detoxification using Scheffersomyces (Pichia) stipitis CBS6054, a native xylose utilizing yeast strain. The sugar utilization ratio and ethanol yield (Y p/s ) ranged from 88-100% and 0.33-0.41 ± 0.02 g/g, respectively, in all the hydrolysates tested.

In addition, the Bacillus strain was classified as Bacillus pumilus and its genes were annotated in the GeneBank at NCBI (accession: CP011109.1). Amino acid sequences alignment with known B. pumilus proteases indicated that the two keratinases of B. pumilus strain C4 are subtilisin-like serine proteases belonging to the Protease S8 family.

One group of these hybrids presents a unique ability to release thiol varietal aroma products as well as excessive amounts of acetic acid under specific conditions, which is detrimental for wine organoleptic quality. The aim of this work is to better assess the effects of lipids, sugar concentrations and temperature on the production of acetic acid and thiols during wine fermentation. To this end, we used a Box-Behnken experimental design and response surface modeling on the production of acetic acid and thiols in S. cerevisiae × S. kudriavzevii hybrids from the Eg8 family during fermentation of a synthetic must. We showed that these hybrids produced lower levels of acetic acid when the initial lipid concentration was increased, whereas they produced greater levels when the initial sugar concentration was high. Moreover, we found that lipids had a positive impact on the final concentrations of 4-methyl-4-mercaptopentan-2-one and 3-mercaptohexan-1-ol (3MH), giving box tree and citrus flavors, respectively. The increase of 3MH was concomitant with a decrease of 3-mercaptohexyl acetate (3MHA) characterized by a passion fruit aroma, indicating that lipid addition reduces the rate of 3MH acetylation into 3MHA. These results highlight the key role of lipid management in acetic acid metabolism and thiol release by S. cerevisiae × S. kudriavzevii hybrids and underline its technological interest in alcoholic fermentation to avoid the overproduction of volatile acidity while favoring the release of volatile thiols.",

To meet demand, large amounts of pyruvate are produced through fermentation processes. Here we describe a simple and efficient method for producing pyruvate in Escherichia coli. To stop carbon flux from pyruvate to fatty acids, the accBC genes, which encode the enzyme that catalyzes the first step of fatty acid biosynthesis and is essential for vegetative growth, were manipulated within the genome; its native promoter was replaced with the tetracycline (or doxycycline)-regulated promoter and the corresponding transcriptional regulator genes. The resulting strain grew normally in the presence of doxycycline, but showed poor growth upon withdrawal of doxycycline. Using this strain, we developed a high pyruvate producing strain (strain LAFCPCPt-accBC-aceE), in which the tetracycline-regulated promoter was also introduced upstream of aceE, and the ackA-pta, adhE, cra, ldhA, pflB and poxB genes were deleted. After determining the optimal culture conditions for this strain, the final pyruvate concentration reached 26.1 g L-1 after 72 h with a theoretical yield of 55.6 %.

The results showed that most obtained sequences belongs to Firmicutes followed by Bacteroidetes, and the ratio of Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes in C group (42.31 %) was higher than that in Z group (21.84 %). Zinc bacitracin supplementation caused a significant decreased of the Proteobacteria phylum and Lactobacillus spp. (P < 0.05), while the Lactobacillus spp. significantly increased in S group (P < 0.05). In addition, Ruminococcus spp., especially Ruminococcus albus were the predominant bacterial species found in both S and Z groups. The proportion of Coprococcus spp. significantly increased in Z group (P < 0.05). These findings suggested that the antibiotics used may cause significant changes in the caecum microbiota of rex rabbits, and we also found C group had a similarity caecum bacteria structure with B group which was probably due to the high levels of chlortetracycline resistance.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is a model bacteria used commonly for medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates (mcl-PHAs) production using various substrates. However, despite many studies conducted on P. putida KT2440 strain, the molecular mechanisms of leading to mcl-PHAs synthesis in reaction to environmental stimuli are still not clear. The rearrangement of the metabolism in response to environmental stress could be controlled by stringent response that modulates the transcription of many genes in order to promote survival under nutritional deprivation conditions. Therefore, in this work we investigated the relation between mcl-PHAs synthesis and stringent response. For this study, a relA/spoT mutant of P. putida KT2440, unable to induce the stringent response, was used. Additionally, the transcriptome of this mutant was analyzed using RNA-seq in order to examine rearrangements of the metabolism during cultivation. The results show that the relA/spoT mutant of P. putida KT2440 is able to accumulate mcl-PHAs in both optimal and nitrogen limiting conditions. Nitrogen starvation did not change the efficiency of mcl-PHAs synthesis in this mutant. The transition from exponential growth to stationary phase caused significant upregulation of genes involved in transport system and nitrogen metabolism. Transcriptional regulators, including rpoS, rpoN and rpoD, did not show changes in transcript abundance when entering the stationary phase, suggesting their limited role in mcl-PHAs accumulation during stationary phase.",

Regulation and decontamination of aflatoxins in high exposure areas is lacking. Biological detoxification methods are promising because they are assumed to be cheaper and more environmentally friendly compared to chemical alternatives. White-rot fungi produce non-specific enzymes that are known to degrade aflatoxin in in situ and ex situ experiments. The aims of this study were to (1) decontaminate aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in naturally contaminated maize with the edible, white-rot fungus Pleurotus ostreatus (oyster mushroom) using a solid-state fermentation system that followed standard cultivation techniques, and to (2) and to assess the risk of mutagenicity in the resulting breakdown products and mushrooms. Vegetative growth and yield characteristics of P. ostreatus were not inhibited by the presence of AFB1. AFB1 was degraded by up to 94% by the Blue strain. No aflatoxin could be detected in P. ostreatus mushrooms produced from AFB1-contaminated maize. Moreover, the mutagenicity of breakdown products from the maize substrate, and reversion of breakdown products to the parent compound, were minimal. These results suggest that P. ostreatus significantly degrades AFB1 in naturally contaminated maize under standard cultivation techniques to levels that are acceptable for some livestock fodder, and that using P. ostreatus to bioconvert crops into mushrooms can reduce AFB1-related losses.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have significant potential as alternatives to classical antibiotics. However, AMPs are currently prepared using processes which are often laborious, expensive and of low-yield, thus hindering their research and application. Large-scale methods for production of AMPs using a cost-effective approach is urgently required. In this study, we report a scalable, chromatography-free downstream processing method for producing an antimicrobial peptide, pexiganan, using recombinant Escherichia coli (E. coli). The four helix bundle structure of the unique carrier protein DAMP4 was used to facilitate a simple and cheap purification process based on a selective thermochemical precipitation. Highly pure fusion protein DAMP4var-pexiganan was obtained at high yield (around 24 mg per 800 mL cell culture with a final cultivation OD600 ~ 2). The purification yield of DAMP4var-pexiganan protein is increased twofold with a 72.9% of the protein recovery in this study as compared to the previous purification processes (Dwyer in Chem Eng Sci 105:12–21, 2014). The antimicrobial peptide pexiganan was released and activated from the fusion protein by a simple acid-cleavage. Isoelectric precipitation was then applied to separate the pexiganan peptide from the DAMP4var protein carrier. The final yield of pure bio-produced pexiganan was 1.6 mg from 800 mL of bacterial cell culture (final cultivation OD600 ~ 2). The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) test demonstrated that the bio-produced pexiganan has the same antimicrobial activity as chemically synthesized counterpart. This novel downstream process provides a new strategy for simple and probable economic production of antimicrobial peptides.",

The growth of isolate 9.1 was further examined on six selected lignin model compounds (ferulate, p-coumarate, benzoate, syringate, vanillin and guaiacol) from different upper funneling aromatic pathways and was found able to grow on four out of these six compounds. No growth was detected on syringate and guaiacol. The highest specific growth and uptake rates were observed for benzoate (0.3 h−1 and 4.2 mmol g CDW −1 h−1) whereas the lowest were for the compounds from the coniferyl branch. Interestingly, several pathway intermediates were excreted during batch growth. Vanillyl alcohol was found to be excreted during growth on vanillin. Several other intermediates like cis,cis-muconate, catechol, vanillate and 4-hydroxybenzoate from the known bacterial catabolic pathways were excreted during growth on the model compounds.",

However, S. cerevisiae naturally secretes only a few proteins, such as invertase and the mating alpha factor, and its secretory capacity is limited. It has been reported that engineering protein anterograde trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus by the moderate overexpression of SEC16 could increase recombinant protein secretion in S. cerevisiae. In this study, the retrograde trafficking in a strain with moderate overexpression of SEC16 was engineered by overexpression of ADP-ribosylation factor GTP activating proteins, Gcs1p and Glo3p, which are involved in the process of COPI-coated vesicle formation. Engineering the retrograde trafficking increased the secretion of alpha-amylase but did not induce production of reactive oxygen species. An expanded ER membrane was detected in both the GCS1 and GLO3 overexpression strains. Physiological characterizations during batch fermentation showed that GLO3 overexpression had better effect on recombinant protein secretion than GCS1 overexpression. Additionally, the GLO3 overexpression strain had higher secretion of two other recombinant proteins, endoglucanase I from Trichoderma reesei and glucan-1,4-alpha-glucosidase from Rhizopus oryzae, indicating overexpression of GLO3 in a SEC16 moderate overexpression strain might be a general strategy for improving production of secreted proteins by yeast.",

G12 which had been recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli and named rCelStrep. The main objectives were therefore to set up a complete strategy for creation and automated screening of rCelStrep evolved direct mutants and to apply it to generate and screen a library of 10,000 random mutants to select the most active variants. The diversity was introduced in the gene by error-prone polymerase chain reaction. A primary qualitative screening on solid plates containing carboxymethylcellulose as the substrate allowed selecting 2200 active clones that were then subjected to a secondary quantitative screening towards AZO-CMC for the selection of 76 improved variants that were cultured in flasks and characterized. Five rCelStrep mutants exhibiting the highest hydrolytic activities than the wild-type enzyme were further characterized and applied to the bioconversion of the pretreated Arundo donax lignocellulosic biomass. It is worth of noting that one of the five tested mutants exhibited a 30% improvement in bioconversion yields compared to the wild-type enzyme, despite the absence of the carbohydrate binding module domain in this variant. Homology models of the three-dimensional structures of the catalytic and binding modules of rCelStrep were obtained and localization of mutations on these models allowed us to speculate on the structure–function relationships of the mutants.",

It could degrade 2C4NP at temperatures from 20 to 40 °C and at pH values from 5 to 10, and degrade 2C4NP as high as 1.6 mM. Kinetics assay showed that biodegradation of 2C4NP followed Haldane substrate inhibition model, with the maximum specific growth rate (μmax) of 0.148/h, half saturation constant (Ks) of 0.022 mM and substrate inhibition constant (Ki) of 0.72 mM. Strain CNP-8 was proposed to degrade 2C4NP with hydroxyquinol (1,2,4-benzenetriol, BT) as the ring-cleavage substrate. The 2C4NP catabolic pathway in strain CNP-8 is significant from those reported in other Gram-negative 2C4NP utilizers. Enzymatic assay indicated that the monooxygenase initiating 2C4NP catabolism had different substrates specificity compared with previously reported 2C4NP monooxygenations. Capillary assays showed that strain CNP-8 exhibited metabolism-dependent chemotactic response toward 2C4NP at the optimum concentration of 0.5 mM with a maximum chemotaxis index of 37.5. Furthermore, microcosm studies demonstrated that strain CNP-8, especially the pre-induced cells, could remove 2C4NP rapidly from the 2C4NP-contaminated soil. Considering its adaptability to pH and temperature fluctuations and great degradation efficiency against 2C4NP, strain CNP-8 could be a promising candidate for the bioremediation of 2C4NP-contaminated sites.",

We describe a simple, fast, and high sensitive assay for detecting heterologous proteins production in bacteria either at the overall level (fluorescence spectrophotometry) or at the individual level (fluorescence microscopic image) in this study. Based on a dicistronic model, the translation of target gene in the upstream open reading frame (ORF) was coupled with the synthesis of the mCherry reporter in the downstream ORF in E. coli cells, and subsequently this demonstrated a positive correlation between the expression of target gene and mCherry. Although a time lag exists between the expression of target protein and mCherry reporter, the method described here allows facile monitoring of dynamic changes in target protein expression, relying on indirect determination of the fluorescence intensity of mCherry during fermentation in real-time models. Additionally, the performance of a single bacterial cell factory could be checked under the fluorescence microscope field.",

Co-growth analysis using mT-RFLP methodology and plate inhibitory assay indicated that ZS1 exhibited antagonistic effect against CT5 and CT6. On the other hand, co-growth analysis and plate inhibition assay showed that CT10 antagonized against ZS1. To investigate the potential compounds responsible for the antagonism, supernatant of CT10 culture was subjected to GC–MS analysis. Analysis indicated that CT10 produced a number of antimicrobial compounds including cyclodipeptide c-(L-Pro-L-Phe), which was known to inhibit the growth of Pseudomonas sp. Growth test using the purified c-(L-Pro-L-Phe) from CT10 confirmed its inhibitory activity. We further showed that, using both gravimetric and GC analysis, CT10 antagonism against the oil-eating ZS1 led to the diminishing of crude oil degradation. Together, our results indicate that bioremediation can be affected by environmental antagonists.",

All microorganisms isolated to date harbor a desulfurization operon consisting of three genes dszA, -B and -C which encode for monooxygenases (DszA & C) and desulfinase (DszB). Most of the studies have been carried out using dibenzothiophene as the model organosulfur compound, which is converted into 2 hydroxybiphenyl by a 4S pathway which maintains the calorific value of fuel. There are few studies reported on the regulation of this operon. However, there are no reports on the proteins which can enhance the activity of the operon. In the present study, we used in vitro and in vivo methods to identify a novel TetR family transcriptional regulator from Gordonia sp. IITR100 which functions as an activator of the dsz operon. Activation by TetR family regulator resulted in enhanced levels of desulfurization enzymes in Gordonia sp. IITR100. Activation was observed only when the 385 bp full length promoter was used. Upstream sequences between - 385 and - 315 were found to be responsible for activation. We provide evidence that the TetR family transcription regulator serves as an activator in other biodesulfurizing microorganisms such as Rhodococcus erythropolis IGTS8 and heterologous host Escherichia coli. This is the first report on the isolation of a possible transcriptional regulator that activates the desulfurization operon resulting in improved biodesulfurization.",

Most of these fungal isolates exhibited considerable production of extracellular enzymes, cellulase, lipase and laccase. Fungal isolates of two genera Mucor and Aspergillus sp. demonstrated pelletization capability over a wide range of pH, suggesting them as potential agents towards algae harvesting and wastewater treatment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We established a protoplast-based system to transfer DNA to Knufia petricola strain A95, a melanised rock-inhabiting microcolonial fungus that is also a component of a model sub-aerial biofilm (SAB) system. To test whether the desiccation resistant, highly melanised cell walls would hinder protoplast formation, we treated a melanin-minus mutant of A95 as well as the type-strain with a variety of cell-degrading enzymes. Of the different enzymes tested, lysing enzymes from Trichoderma harzianum were most effective in producing protoplasts. This mixture was equally effective on the melanin-minus mutant and the type-strain. Protoplasts produced using lysing enzymes were mixed with polyethyleneglycol (PEG) and plasmid pCB1004 which contains the hygromycin B (HmB) phosphotransferase ( hph ) gene under the control of the Aspergillus nidulans trp C. Integration and expression of hph into the A95 genome conferred hygromycin resistance upon the transformants. Two weeks after plating out on selective agar containing HmB, the protoplasts developed cell-walls and formed colonies. Transformation frequencies were in the range 36 to 87 transformants per 10 μg of vector DNA and 10 6 protoplasts. Stability of transformation was confirmed by sub-culturing the putative transformants on selective agar containing HmB as well as by PCR-detection of the hph gene in the colonies. The hph gene was stably integrated as shown by five subsequent passages with and without selection pressure.",

Typically, this waste is dried to produce animal feed, but sometimes it is just dumped. Its main component is the peel, which consists mostly of pectin, with D-galacturonic acid as the main monomer. Aspergillus niger is a filamentous fungus that efficiently produces pectinases for the hydrolysis of pectin and uses the resulting D-galacturonic acid and most of the other components of citrus peel for growth. We used engineered A. niger strains that were not able to catabolise D-galacturonic acid, but instead converted it to L-galactonic acid. These strains also produced pectinases for the hydrolysis of pectin and were used for the conversion of pectin in orange peel to L-galactonic acid in a consolidated process. The D-galacturonic acid in the orange peel was converted to L-galactonic acid with a yield close to 90%. Submerged and solid-state fermentation processes were compared.",

    "abstract": "Callisto®, containing the active ingredient mesotrione (2-[4-methylsulfonyl-2-nitrobenzoyl]1,3-cyclohenanedione), is a selective herbicide that controls weeds in corn crops and is a potential environmental contaminant. The objective of this work was to evaluate enzymatic and structural changes in Pantoea ananatis, a strain isolated from water, in response to exposure to this herbicide. Despite degradation of mesotrione, probably due a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pathway in Pantoea ananatis, this herbicide induced oxidative stress by increasing hydrogen peroxide production. Thiol fragments, eventually produced after mesotrione degradation, could be involved in increased GST activity. Nevertheless, there was no peroxidation damage related to this production, as malondialdehyde (MDA) synthesis, which is due to lipid peroxidation, was highest in the controls, followed by the mesotrione- and Callisto®-treated cultures at log growth phase. Therefore, P. ananatis can tolerate and grow in the presence of the herbicide, probably due an efficient control of oxidative stress by a polymorphic catalase system. MDA rates depend on lipid saturation due to a pattern change to a higher level of saturation. These changes are likely related to the formation of GST-mesotrione conjugates and mesotrione degradation-specific metabolites and to the presence of cytotoxic adjuvants. These features may shift lipid membrane saturation, possibly providing a protective effect to bacteria through an increase in membrane impermeability. This response system in P. ananatis provides a novel model for bacterial herbicide tolerance and adaptation in the environment.",

Specific primers were designed to target a highly conserved region of the ORFV B2L gene. This method was able to detect a minimum of 20 copies of ORFV genomic DNA. The results showed no cross-reactions with other common DNA viruses. The time required for the test was approximately 1.5 h. Clinical test samples showed that this method was faster and had a higher sensitivity than traditional PCR. In conclusion, this novel, real-time PCR-based assay provides a rapid, sensitive, and specific method for ORFV detection. This test provides improved technical support for studies regarding the clinical diagnosis and epidemiology of ORFV.",

SDS-PAGE, Native-PAGE and ultracentrifugation analysis disclosed that RBUP was a monomeric protein with a molecular weight of 18.5 kDa. ESI–MS/MS demonstrated that it shared 69% amino acid sequence similarity with Coprinellus congregates ubiquitin (gi|136667). The protein exhibiting strong anticancer activity towards A549 cells. Analysis by employing AO/EB staining and Annexin V-FITC/PI detection indicated that the cytotoxic effect of RBUP was mediated through induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, RBUP displayed hemagglutinating and deoxyribonuclease activities. A temperature of 40 °C and pH of 7.0 were required for optimal DNase activity. Therefore, it was estimated that RBUP exerted its antitumour effect by inducing apoptosis, and its hemagglutinating and DNase activities were also thought to participate in this effect. These results demonstrated that RBUP was a multifunctional protein with potential medicinal applications.",

Standards of the World Health Organization and Environmental Protection Agency for diazinon concentration in water are 0.1 and 9 × 10-6 mg/L, respectively. The aim of this study was the optimization of diazinon biodegradation from aqueous solutions by Saccharomyces cerevisiae using the response surface methodology (RSM). Harvested cells of S. cerevisiae were locally purchased from the Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology. To obtain the optimum condition for diazinon biodegradation using RSM, input parameters included the initial concentration of diazinon (0.01-10 mg/L), concentration of S. cerevisiae (0.5-5%), pH (4-10), and retention time (1-30 h). The research study had a central composite design where one of the methods was RSM. According to the results, the observed values of the removal efficiency of diazinon were variable in the range of 23-96. The highest removal rate was obtained as 96% under the initial diazinon concentration of 2.5 mg/L, S. cerevisiae concentration of 3.88%, pH of 5.5, and retention time of 22.75 h. The results displayed that the removal efficiency of diazinon had a direct relationship with the concentration of S. cerevisiae and retention time, and an inverse relationship with pH and the initial concentration of diazinon. We can conclude that S. cerevisiae has the ability to remove diazinon with the lowest cost and a high efficiency.",

In this study, we used DNA sequences obtained directly from the sample metagenome and from a derived fosmid library to survey the functional diversity of this extreme habitat. The metagenomic fosmid library containing 11,520 clones was screened using function- and sequence-based methods to identify recombinant clones expressing carbohydrate-degrading enzymes. Open reading frames (ORFs) encoding carbohydrate-degrading enzymes were predicted by BLAST against the CAZy database, and many fosmid clones expressing carbohydrate-degrading activities were discovered by functional screening using Escherichia coli as a heterologous host. Each complete ORF predicted to encode a cellulase identified from sequence- or function-based screening was subcloned in an expression vector. Five subclones was found to have significant activity using a fluorescent cellulose model substrate, and three of these were observed to be highly thermostable. Based on phylogenetic analyses, the thermostable cellulases were derived from thermophilic Archaea and are distinct from known cellulases. Cellulase F1, obtained from function-based screening, contains two distinct cellulase modules, perhaps resulting from fusion of two archaeal cellulases and with a novel protein structure that may result in enhanced activity and thermostability. This enzyme was found to exhibit exocellulase function and to have a remarkably high activity compared to commercially available enzymes. Results from this study highlight the complementarity of hybrid approaches for enzyme discovery, combining sequence- and function-based screening.",

Since treatment of these infections remains most challenging and commonly requires implant removal, prevention is of utmost importance. In the present work a titania-sol was equipped with a copper salt resulting after calcination in a titania coating (TiO2) with antibacterial properties combined with good cytocompatibility. In vitro tests with bacteria as well as tissue cells were carried out under corresponding conditions. Mouse fibroblasts and different staphylococcal strains were used for growth inhibition assays with serial dilutions of CuCl2. Cultivation on the surface of bare Ti6Al4V, TiO2-coated and copper-filled TiO2-coated Ti6Al4V samples was performed with both bacteria and tissue cells. Bacterial and cellular proliferation and mitochondrial activity were hereby determined. Coating of Ti6Al4V with pure TiO2 significantly improved cytocompatibility compared to the uncoated alloy. In the growth inhibition assays, fibroblasts tolerated higher concentrations of copper ions than did bacteria. Nevertheless, copper integration reduced fibroblast proliferation and mitochondrial activity on the surface coating. On the other hand, integration of copper into the TiO2-coating significantly reduced adhesion of viable bacteria resulting in a promising combination of cytocompatibility and antibacterial properties. Additionally, significant bacterial growth inhibition by antibacterial amounts of copper was also demonstrated in the supernatant. In conclusion, the copper-loaded TiO2-coatings for medical implants may be a promising approach to reduce the rate of implant-associated infections.",

Monitoring these metabolic processes is a crucial component in efficient industrial application. Unfortunately, monitoring these metabolic processes can often be invasive and time consuming and expensive, especially within an anaerobic environment. Electrochemical techniques, such as cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) offer a non-invasive approach to monitor microbial activity and growth. EIS and CV were used to monitor Clostridium phytofermentans, an anaerobic and endospore-forming bacterium. C. phytofermentans ferments a wide range of sugars into hydrogen, acetate, and ethanol as fermentation by-products. For this study, both traditional microbiological and electrochemical techniques were used to monitor the growth of C. phytofermentans and the formation of fermentation products. An irreversible reduction peak was observed using CV beginning at mid-logarithmic phase of growth. This peak was associated with C. phytofermentans and not the spent medium and was indicative of a decrease in carbon and energy sources to the cells. Additionally, EIS analysis during growth provided information related to increased charge transfer resistance of the culture also as a function of carbon and energy source depletion. Results demonstrate that CV and EIS are useful tools in the monitoring the physiological status of bioprocesses.",

    "abstract": "Gut microbiota positively contribute to livestock nutrition and metabolism. The manipulation of these microbes may improve animal health. Some feed additives improve livestock health and metabolism by regulating gut microbiota composition and activity. We fed hybrid pigs diets supplemented with 0% (control), 5% (treat 1), 10% (treat 2), or 15% (treat 3) fermented Mao-tai lees (FML) for 90 days. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bioamines, and microbial communities found in colonic contents were analyzed to investigate microbiota composition and metabolic profiles. Concentrations of straight-chain fatty acids (e.g., acetate, propionate, and butyrate) and tyramine increased with FML supplementation content. Contrary to the minor effects of 5% and 10% FML on gut microbiota, 15% FML influenced beta diversity (Jaccard or Bray–Curtis dissimilarity) but not alpha diversity (number of operational taxonomic units and Shannon diversity) of pig gut microbial communities compared to the control group. Notably, 15% FML animals were characterized by a higher abundance of potentially beneficial bacteria (Lactobacillus and Akkermansia) but lower abundances of potential pathogens (Escherichia). Numerous genes associated with metabolism (e.g., starch, sucrose, and sulfur-compounds metabolism) showed a higher relative abundance in the 15% FML than in the control group. Additionally, most Phascolarctobacterium, Treponema, Prevotella, and Faecalibacterium bacterial markers in the 15% FML group were positively correlated with straight-chain fatty acid concentrations, suggesting that these bacteria are likely associated with SCFA production. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the beneficial effects of 15% FML on fermentation of undigested compounds and gut microbiota composition in the colon. Thus, 15% FML supplementation in pig feed may possibly represent a way to optimize pig colon health for livestock farming.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen an increasing interest in laccase enzymes. Due to their ability of oxidizing various substrates, they are nowadays applied in multiple industrial fields including pulp delignification, textile dye bleaching, and bioremediation. In contrast to laccase production from native sources, with its generally low yield and high cost, heterologous laccase expression is far better suited to meet the growing industrial demands. TVLCC5 gene encoding Trametes versicolor laccase 5 was overexpressed in Arxula adeninivorans using the strong constitutive TEF1 promoter. Recombinant Tvlcc5 protein was purified by immobilized-metal ion affinity chromatography and biochemically characterized using 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) as substrate for standard activity assays. The enzyme showed the highest activity at 50 °C between pH 4.5–5.5. The half-life of Tvlcc5 at 60 °C was around 20 min. The negative effect of chloride anions on enzyme activity was demonstrated. A fed-batch cultivation of Tvlcc5 producing strain A. adeninivorans G1212/YRC102-TEF1-TVLCC5-6H was performed and resulted in a laccase activity of 4986.3 U L−1. To improve the expression level of recombinant laccase in A. adeninivorans, cultivation conditions were optimized by single factor experiments. Recombinant Tvlcc5 proved to be a promising agent for degradation of pharmaceuticals that are an important source of environmental pollution. Concentration of diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole decreased to 46.8% and 51.1% respectively after 24 h incubation with Tvlcc5. When 1 mM redox mediator ABTS was added complete degradation was obtained within 1 h.",

Studying the effect of Hafnia alvei H4 quorum sensing regulatory genes on AHLs is necessary for the quality and preservation of instant sea cucumber. In this study, the draft genome of H. alvei H4, which comprises a single chromosome of 4,687,151 bp, was sequenced and analyzed and the types of AHLs were analyzed employing thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and high resolution triple quadrupole liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Then the wild-type strain of H. alvei H4 and the luxI/R double mutant (Δ luxIR ) were compared by transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq). The results indicate that the incomplete genome sequence revealed the presence of one quorum-sensing (QS) gene set, designated as lasI/expR . Three major AHLs, N -hexanoyl- l -homoserine lactone (C6-HSL), N -butyryl- l -homoserine lactone (C4-HSL), and N -(3-oxo-octanoyl)- l -homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C8-HSL) were found, with C6-HSL being the most abundant. C6-HSL was not detected in the culture of the luxI mutant (Δ luxI ) and higher levels of C4-HSL was found in the culture of the luxR mutant (Δ luxR ), which suggested that the luxR gene may have a positive effect on C4-HSL production. It was also found that AHL and QS genes are closely related in the absence of luxIR double deletion. The results of this study can further elucidate at the genetic level that luxI and luxR genes are involved in the regulation of AHL.",

These are also present in other cereal grains, but their proportions vary with AX being the major component in wheat and rye and β-glucan in barley and oats. Therefore, it was hypothesised that these NSPs could act synergistically when fermented in vitro at the ratios present in the major foods consumed, resulting in increased prebiotic activity. AX and β-glucan were therefore tested in in vitro fermentation studies to assess their prebiotic activity when used individually and/or in different ratios. Short-chain fatty-acids (SCFAs) produced from in vitro fermentation were measured using HPLC and bacterial populations were measured using flow cytometry with fluorescence in situ hybridisation (Flow-FISH). Fermentation of AX alone resulted in a significant bifidogenic activity and increased concentrations of SCFAs, mainly acetate, after 8–24 h of fermentation, however β-glucan alone did not show prebiotic activity. The greatest prebiotic activity, based on concentration of total SCFAs and increases in total bacteria as well as beneficial Bifidobacterium and Clostridium coccoides/Eubacterium groups, was observed when AX and β-glucan were combined at a 3:1 ratio, which corresponds to their ratios in wheat flour which is major source of cereal fibre in the diet. This indicates that the population of bacteria in the human GI tract may be modulated by the composition of the fibre in the diet, to maximise the prebiotic potential.",

    "abstract": "Various enzymatic cocktails were produced from two Trichoderma reesei strains, a cellulase hyperproducer strain and a strain with β-glucosidase activity overexpression. By using various carbon sources (lactose, glucose, xylose, hemicellulosic hydrolysate) for strains growth, contrasted enzymatic activities were obtained. The enzymatic cocktails presented various levels of efficiency for the hydrolysis of cellulose Avicel into glucose, in presence of xylans, or not. These latter were also hydrolyzed with different extents according to cocktails. The most efficient cocktails (TR1 and TR3) on Avicel were richer in filter paper activity (FPU) and presented a low ratio FPU/β-glucosidase activity. Cocktails TR2 and TR5 which were produced on the higher amount of hemicellulosic hydrolysate, possess both high xylanase and β-xylosidase activities, and were the most efficient for xylans hydrolysis. When hydrolysis of Avicel was conducted in presence of xylans, a decrease of glucose release occurred for all cocktails compared to hydrolysis of Avicel alone. Mixing TR1 and TR5 cocktails with two different ratios of proteins (1/1 and 1/4) resulted in a gain of efficiency for glucose release during hydrolysis of Avicel in presence of xylans compared to TR5 alone. Our results demonstrate the importance of combining hemicellulase and cellulase activities to improve the yields of glucose release from Avicel in presence of xylans. In this context, strategies involving enzymes production with carbon sources comprising mixed C5 and C6 sugars or combining different cocktails produced on C5 or on C6 sugars are of interest for processes developed in the context of lignocellulosic biorefinery.",

At the phylum level, wild sables exhibited a significant difference in the relative abundances of Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria, whereas housed sables only exhibited significant changes in TM7 at the phylum level, and Clostridia, at the class level. The predominance of Bacteroidetes in wild sables warrants further research.

The study was operated in pilot-scale and OLRs of 0.11-1.3 gCOD/L.d. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) image showed that the biofilm with a proper thickness was formed on IFAS reactor's media. The results indicated that the best removal efficiency of BOD5, COD, and TSS were 85.24, 92.52 and 90.21%, respectively, in an organic loading of 0.44 gCOD/L.d. Then, with the OLR increased, the removal efficiencies of BOD5, COD, and TSS increased as long as the organic loading reached 0.44 gCOD/L.d. But with the OLR increased more, the removal efficiency of these parameters decreased. The ANOVA statistical test results showed that the mean difference of removal efficiency in organic loadings for BOD5 (p ≤ 0.001) and COD (p = 0.003) was significant, while it was insignificant for TSS (p = 0.23). The best removal efficiencies of Total Nitrogen (TN) and Total Phosphorus (TP) were 89.60 and 86.67%, respectively, which were obtained at an OLR of 0.44 gCOD/L.d. By increasing OLR up to 0.44 gCOD/L.d, removal efficiencies of TN and TP increased, while the removal efficiency decreased with the OLR increased more, and this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.021). Finally, the results showed that the IFAS system provided a proper efficiency in treatment of the synthetic greywater and it could be used in a full scale.",

    "abstract": "Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) play vital roles in sustaining soil productivity and plant communities. However, adaption and differentiation of AMF in response to commonly used fertilization remain poorly understood. In this study, we showed that the AMF community composition was primarily driven by soil physiochemical changes associated with chronic inorganic and organic fertilization of 37 years in Mollisols. High-throughput sequencing indicated that inorganic fertilizer negatively affected AMF diversity and richness, implying a reduction of mutualism in plant–AMF symbiosis; however, a reverse trend was observed for the application of inorganic fertilizer combined with manure. With regards to AMF community composition, order Glomerales was dominant, but varied significantly among different fertilization treatments. All fertilization treatments decreased family Glomeraceae and genus Funneliformis, while Rhizophagus abundance increased. Plant-growth-promoting-microorganisms of family Claroideoglomeraceae and genus Claroideoglomus were stimulated by manure application, and likely benefited pathogen suppression and phosphorus (P) acquisition. Family Gigasporaceae and genus Gigaspora were negatively correlated with available P in soil. Additionally, redundancy analysis further suggested that soil available P, organic matter and pH were the most important factors in shaping AMF community composition. These results provide strong evidence for niche differentiation of phylogenetically distinct AMF populations under different fertilization regimes. Manure likely contributes to restoration and maintenance of plant–AMF symbiosis, and the balanced fertilization would favor the growth of beneficial AMF communities as one optimized management in support of sustainable agriculture in Mollisols.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria play vital roles in soil biological fertility; however, it remains poorly understood about their response to long-term fertilization in Chinese Mollisols, especially when organic manure is substituted for inorganic nitrogen (N) fertilizer. To broaden our knowledge, high-throughput pyrosequencing and quantitative PCR were used to explore the impacts of inorganic fertilizer and manure on bacterial community composition in a 35-year field experiment of Chinese Mollisols. Soils were collected from four treatments: no fertilizer (CK), inorganic phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fertilizer (PK), inorganic P, K, and N fertilizer (NPK), and inorganic P and K fertilizer plus manure (MPK). All fertilization differently changed soil properties. Compared with CK, the PK and NPK treatments acidified soil by significantly decreasing soil pH from 6.48 to 5.53 and 6.16, respectively, while MPK application showed no significant differences of soil pH, indicating alleviation of soil acidification. Moreover, all fertilization significantly increased soil organic matter (OM) and soybean yields, with the highest observed under MPK regime. In addition, the community composition at each taxonomic level varied considerably among the fertilization strategies. Bacterial taxa, associated with plant growth promotion, OM accumulation, disease suppression, and increased soil enzyme activity, were overrepresented in the MPK regime, while they were present at low abundant levels under NPK treatment, i.e. phyla Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, class Alphaproteobacteria, and genera Variovorax, Chthoniobacter, Massilia, Lysobacter, Catelliglobosispora and Steroidobacter. The application of MPK shifted soil bacterial community composition towards a better status, and such shifts were primarily derived from changes in soil pH and OM.",

Their success of colonising the infant gut is believed to be, at least partly, due to their ability to metabolize available carbon sources by means of secreted or intracellular glycosyl hydrolases (GHs). Among these, β-galactosidases are particularly relevant as they allow bifidobacteria to grow on β-galactosyl-linked saccharidic substrates, which are present in copious amounts in the milk-based diet of their infant host (e.g. lactose and human milk oligosaccharides). In the present study we employed an in silico analysis to identify GH family 2 and 42 β-galactosidases encoded by typical infant-associated bifidobacteria. Comparative genome analysis followed by characterisation of selected β-galactosidases revealed how these GH2 and GH42 members are distributed among these infant-associated bifidobacteria, while their hydrolytic activity towards growth substrates commonly available in the infant gut were also assessed.",

In this study, we firstly used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to observe the morphology of amyloid fibers in S. mutans. Then the extracted amyloid fibers from biofilm were studied for their characteristics. Further, the influencing factors, PH, temperature and eDNA, were investigated. Results showed there were mainly two morphologies of amyloid fibers in S. mutans, different in width. Amyloid fibers inhibitor-EGCG obviously destroyed biofilm at different stages, which is dose-dependent. The amount of amyloid fibers positively correlated with biofilm biomass in clinical isolates. Acidic pH and high temperature obviously accelerated amyloid fibrillation. During amyloid fibrillation, amyloid growth morphologies were observed by TEM and results showed two growth morphologies. Amyloid fibers formed complex with eDNA, which we call (a)eDNA. The molecular weight of (a)eDNA was similar to genomic DNA, greatly larger than that of eDNA in matrix. Combined use of DNase I and EGCG was more efficiently in inhibiting amyloid fibers and biofilm biomass. In conclusion, amyloid fibers are the crucial structures for S. mutans biofilm formation, showing two types of morphology. Acidic pH and temperature can obviously accelerate amyloid fibrillation. Amyloid fibers form complex with (a)eDNA and combined use of DNase and amyloid fiber inhibitor is more efficiently in inhibiting S. mutans biofilm formation.",

However, using non-native production hosts can lead to enzymes with altered post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation. We have investigated how production in a non-native host affects the physicochemical properties and enzymatic activity of a feruloyl esterase from Myceliophthora thermophila, MtFae1a. The enzyme was produced in two microorganisms that introduce glycosylation (M. thermophila and Pichia pastoris) and in Escherichia coli (non-glycosylated). Mass spectrometric analysis confirmed the presence of glycosylation and revealed differences in the lengths of glycan chains between the enzymes produced in M. thermophila and P. pastoris. The melting temperature and the optimal temperature for activity of the non-glycosylated enzyme were considerably lower than those of the glycosylated enzymes. The three MtFae1a versions also exhibited differences in specific activity and specificity. The catalytic efficiency of the glycosylated enzymes were more than 10 times higher than that of the non-glycosylated one. In biotechnology, immobilization is often used to allow reusing enzyme and was investigated on mesoporous silica particles. We found the binding kinetics and immobilization yield differed between the enzyme versions. The largest differences were observed when comparing enzymes with and without glycosylation, but significant variations were also observed between the two differently glycosylated enzymes. We conclude that the biotechnological value of an enzyme can be optimized for a specific application by carefully selecting the production host.",

The intestinal microbiota had received plenty of attention in recent years due to their influence on host health and performance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the fecal microbiota at early growth period and porcine feed efficiency (FE) under a commercial feeding environment. Ninety-one pigs were reordered according to the residual feed intake (RFI) values between day 90 on test and day 160 off test, 9 lowest RFI pigs and 9 highest RFI pigs were selected as the LRFI group and the HRFI group, respectively. Fecal samples from pigs in the early grower phase (day 80) were performed for microbial diversity, composition, and predicted functionality by using 16S rRNA sequencing. The results showed that no significant differences in microbial alpha diversity were observed between two RFI groups, whereas, some RFI-associated compositional differences were revealed. In particular, the microbiota of the LRFI group (more feed-efficient) had significantly higher levels of some members of Clostridiales and Bacteroidales (e.g., g_1_68 and g_norank_f_p_2534_18B5 ), which may promoted FE through protecting gut barrier function, compared with those of the HRFI pigs. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways analysis found that the LRFI pigs were likely have microbiota with higher levels of amino acid metabolism. Moreover, redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that litter size, parity, and date of birth had significant effects on the bacterial community structure. These results improved our knowledge of the porcine early-life fecal microbiota and its potential link underlying RFI, which would be useful for future development of microbial biomarkers for predicting and improving porcine FE as well as investigation of targets for dietary strategies.",

    "abstract": "Propagation conditions have been shown to be of considerable importance for the fermentation ability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The limited tolerance of yeast to inhibitors present in lignocellulosic hydrolysates is a major challenge in second-generation bioethanol production. We have investigated the hypothesis that the addition of nutrients during propagation leads to yeast cultures with improved ability to subsequently ferment lignocellulosic materials. This hypothesis was tested with and without short-term adaptation to wheat straw or corn stover hydrolysates during propagation of the yeast. The study was performed using the industrial xylose-fermenting S. cerevisiae strain CR01. Adding a mixture of pyridoxine, thiamine, and biotin to unadapted propagation cultures improved cell growth and ethanol yields during fermentation in wheat straw hydrolysate from 0.04 g g-1 to 0.19 g g-1 and in corn stover hydrolysate from 0.02 g g-1 to 0.08 g g-1. The combination of short-term adaptation and supplementation with the vitamin mixture during propagation led to ethanol yields of 0.43 g g-1 in wheat straw hydrolysate fermentation and 0.41 g g-1 in corn stover hydrolysate fermentation. These ethanol yields were improved compared to ethanol yields from cultures that were solely short-term adapted (0.37 and 0.33 g g-1). Supplementing the propagation medium with nutrients in combination with short-term adaptation was thus demonstrated to be a promising strategy to improve the efficiency of industrial lignocellulosic fermentation.",

A total of 72 piglets were weighed and randomly allotted into three treatments (four replication pens per treatment with six piglets/pen) for a 28-day experiment. The dietary treatments were as follows: basal diet (control group, CTR), basal diet supplementation with antibiotic (antibiotic group, ABT), and basal diet supplementation with 0.1% Bacillus subtilis (probiotic group, PBT). The average daily gain of body weight increased in both the ABT and PBT groups, and dietary antibiotics decreased the feed:gain ratio (F:G), as compared to the CTR group (P < 0.05). Both ABT and PBT piglets had increased serum triglycerides and lipase, amylase, maltase activities and villus height:crypt depth ratio (V/C) in ileum (P < 0.05). The PBT group also showed an increase in serum glucose and villus height in the ileum (P < 0.05). Dietary antibiotics increased Lactobacillus johnsonii, as compared to the CTR group, but decreased bacterial diversity and increased Escherichia coli, as compared to the PBT group (P < 0.05). Piglets dietary with B. subtilis modulated the microbiota by increasing the abundance of Firmicutes (L. johnsonii, L. reuteri) and decreasing the abundance of E. coli, as compared to the control group (P < 0.05). These results indicate that dietary of B. subtilis improves growth performance and intestinal health and can be a promising alternative to antibiotics in piglets diet.",

To investigate the optimization of culture medium components for higher SAM production, metabolome analysis was conducted to compare the intracellular metabolite concentrations between Kyokai no. 6 (high SAM-producing) and laboratory yeast S288C (control) under different SAM production conditions. Metabolome analysis and the result of principal component analysis showed that the rate-limiting step for SAM production was ATP supply and the levels of degradation products of adenosine nucleotides were higher in Kyokai 6 strain than in the S288C strain under the L-methionine supplemented condition. Analysis of ATP accumulation showed that the levels of intracellular ATP in the Kyokai 6 strain were also higher compared to those in the S288C strain. Furthermore, as expected from metabolome analysis, the SAM content of Kyokai 6 strain cultivated in the medium without yeast extract increased by 2.5-fold compared to that in the additional condition, by increasing intracellular ATP level with inhibited cell growth. These results suggest that high SAM production is attributed to the enhanced ATP supply with L-methionine condition and high efficiency of intracellular ATP consumption.",

    "abstract": "Phytase is a phosphatase enzyme widely used as feed additive to release inorganic phosphorus from plant phytate and enhance its uptake in monogastric animals. Although engineered fungal phytases are used most, a natural enzyme gives opportunity to understand novel properties, if any. In the current study, a novel fungal strain, Aspergillus foetidus MTCC 11682 was immobilized on poly urethane cubes and used for phytase production, purification and molecular characterization. Phytase produced by this method was partially purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation and Sephacryl S-200HR gel filtration to 23.4-fold (compared to crude extract) with recovery of 13% protein. Electrophoresis analysis revealed that phytase has molecular weight of 90.5 kDa on non-reducing and 129.6 kDa on reducing SDS-PAGE. The purified phytase exhibited a wider pH and temperature stability. Analysis of the cloned sequence showed that the gene has 1176 bp that encodes for a peptide of 391 amino acids of the core catalytic region. It was also found that phytase from A. foetidus has a sequence identity of 99% with the phytase gene of other Aspergillus species at nucleotide level and 100% at protein level in A. niger, A. awamori, A. oryzae. In silico analysis of sequence identified the presence of two consecutive and one non-consecutive intra chain disulfide bonds in the phytase. This probably contributed to the differential migration of phytase on reducing and non-reducing SDS-PAGE. There are predicted 11 O-glycosylation sites and 8 N-glycosylation sites, possibly contributed to an enhanced stability of enzyme produced by this organism. This study opened up a new horizon for exploring the novel properties of phytase for other applications.",

The salt tolerance capacity of strain F1 was further verified and the effects of initial pH, initial NaNO2 concentration and inoculation size on the denitrification capacity of strain F1 under saline conditions were evaluated. Strain F1 was identified as Pannonibacter phragmitetus and named Pannonibacter phragmitetus F1. This strain can tolerate NaCl concentrations up to 70 g/L, and its most efficient denitrification capacity was observed at NaCl concentrations of 0-10 g/L. Under non-saline condition, the removal percentages of NO2--N and NO3--N by strain Pannonibacter phragmitetus F1 at pH of 10 and inoculation size of 5% were 100% and 83%, respectively, after cultivation for 5 days. Gas generation was observed during the cultivation, indicating that an efficient denitrification performance was achieved. When pH was 10 and the inoculation size was 5%, both the highest removal percentages of NO2--N (99%) and NO3--N (95%) by strain Pannonibacter phragmitetus F1 were observed at NaCl concentration of 10 g/L. When the NaCl concentration was 10 g/L, strain Pannonibacter phragmitetus F1 can adapt to a wide range of neutral and alkaline environments (pH of 7-10) and is highly tolerant of NaNO2 concentration (0.4-1.6 g/L). In conclusion, strain Pannonibacter phragmitetus F1 has a great potential to be applied in the treatment of saline wastewater containing high nitrogen concentrations, e.g. coastal aquaculture wastewater.",

Those gene fragments were inserted into the pET30a expression vector. One recombinant strain with the highest expressed soluble eCap from four entire Cap (one wt-eCap and three opti-eCap) and one recombinant strain expressed opti-dCap were selected for further purification. The purified eCap and dCap were identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), a large number of round hollow particles with a diameter of 10 nm virus-like particles (VLPs) were observed in eCap, whereas irregular aggregation of proteins observed in dCap. After formation the VLPs were applied as a coating antigen to establish an indirect ELISA (I-ELISA) for detection of PCV3-specific antibody in swine serum. 373 clinical swine serum samples from China collected in 2019 were tested utilizing the VLP-based I-ELISA method under optimized conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of self-assembly into VLPs of PCV3 recombinant Cap.

    "abstract": "H9N2 avian influenza virus has spread worldwide, and vaccination with an inactivated virus is currently the major prevention method in China. To further understand the effect of the selection pressure from antibodies on the evolution of H9N2 avian influenza virus, F/98 (A/Chicken/Shanghai/F/98), which is the vaccine representative of H9N2 avian influenza virus in East China, was used for serial passaging for 20 generations in chickens with and without vaccination. After plaque purification from trachea and lung tissues, 390 quasispecies were obtained. The second-generation quasispecies under the selection pressure of vaccine antibodies had undergone 100% antigen variation, while after passaging to the fifth generation, only 30-40% of the quasispecies displayed antigen variation when there was no selection pressure of vaccine antibodies, implying that the selection pressure of vaccine antibodies promotes the antigen variation of F/98. We found for the first time that there were three mutation hotspots in the HA genes of the quasispecies under the selection pressure of vaccine antibodies, which were K131R, A168T, and N201D. Moreover, under the selection pressure of vaccine antibodies, 10 amino acids (67-76) of the NA protein of all quasispecies were deleted, and PB2 of the quasispecies had undergone a high-frequency R355K mutation. However, without selection pressure of vaccine antibodies, NP had undergone two high-frequency mutations, namely, V186I and L466I, and a high-frequency mutation of L77I appeared in the NS gene. This result shows that the vaccine antibody selection pressure could control and regulate gene variation of the F/98 virus. Compared to that of the parental virus F/98, the EID50 of the twentieth passaged virus under the selection pressure of vaccine antibodies did not change, while the EID50 of the twentieth passaged virus without selection pressure of vaccine antibodies was significantly enhanced by 794 times. Furthermore, the twentieth passaged virus with selection pressure from vaccine antibodies lost its lethal ability in embryonated chicken eggs, whereas the EID50 of the twentieth passaged virus without selection pressure of vaccine antibodies increased to 6.3 times that of the F/98 strain. All the above results show that the selection pressure of vaccine antibodies promotes the antigen variation of H9N2 avian influenza virus and plays a role in regulating and controlling gene mutation of H9N2 avian influenza virus.",

Currently, no single drug has been developed to effectively treat infections caused by Acanthamoeba. Recent studies have shown that drugs conjugated with nanoparticles exhibit potent in vitro antiamoebic activity against pathogenic free-living amoebae. In this study, we have developed a nano drug delivery system based on iron oxide nanoparticles conjugated with metronidazole which were further loaded with amphotericin B to produce enhanced antiamoebic effects against Acanthamoeba castellanii. The results showed that metronidazole-nanoparticles-amphotericin B (Met-MNPs-Amp) significantly inhibited the viability of these amoebae as compared to the respective controls including drugs and nanoparticles alone. Met-MNPs-Amp exhibited IC50 at 50 μg/mL against both A. castellanii trophozoites and cysts. Furthermore, these nanoparticles did not affect the viability of rat and human cells and showed safe hemolytic activity. Hence, the results obtained in this study have potential utility in drug development against infections caused by Acanthamoeba castellanii. A combination of drugs can lead to successful prognosis against these largely neglected infections. Future studies will determine the value of conjugating molecules with diagnostic and therapeutic potential to provide theranostic approaches against these serious infections.",

Identification and detection of these pathogens from field and plant material could be significant for the selection of resistant varieties and formulation of disease management strategies. In the present study, a duplex qPCR assay developed for simultaneous detection and quantification of both pathogens from different samples. Two sets of species-specific primers developed for the detection of P. xanthii and P. cubensis pathogens by targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the rDNA gene cluster. The specificity of designed primers was also evaluated against the different microbial, plant, soil, and environmental samples. Initially, the individual assays for P. cubensis and P. xanthii were validated using their corresponding species-specific primers, which amplified the prominent and distinctive products of ~ 705 bp and ~ 290 bp size, respectively. SYBR green-based duplex real-time PCR assay was developed to detect and quantify both mildew pathogens from different field samples. The species-specific oligonucleotide primer sets showed high specificity with melt curve peaks at 85.83 °C and 88.05 °C, for P. xanthii and P. cubensis , respectively. The relative quantification and lowest detection limit of qPCR assays using tenfold diluted plasmid ( Csp 1 and Csd 1) DNA were estimated (0.1 pg/µl) through a standard curve.

Hence, this study explored heat-shock-induced genomic alterations in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using genetic screening systems and customized single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays, we found that heat shock (52 °C) for several minutes could heighten mitotic recombination by at least one order of magnitude. More than half of heat-shock-induced mitotic recombinations were likely to be initiated by DNA breaks in the S/G2 phase of the cell cycle. Chromosomal aberration, mainly trisomy, was elevated hundreds of times in heat-shock-treated cells than in untreated cells. Distinct chromosomal instability patterns were also observed between heat-treated and carbendazim-treated yeast cells. Finally, we demonstrated that heat shock stimulates fast phenotypic evolutions (such as tolerance to ethanol, vanillin, fluconazole, and tunicamycin) in the yeast population. This study not only provided novel insights into the effect of temperature fluctuations on genomic integrity but also developed a simple protocol to generate an aneuploidy mutant of yeast.",

There remains a great need to improve the use of existing drugs for HIV therapy. Berberine is traditionally used to treat diarrhea, bacillary dysentery, and gastroenteritis in clinics, here our research shows that berberine is effective in inhibiting HIV-1 entry. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis studies reveal that berberine can directly bind to both N36 and C34 to form a novel N36-berberine-C34 complex and effectively block the six-helix bundle formation between the N-terminal heptad repeat peptide N36 and the C-terminal heptad repeat peptide C34. Circular dichroism experiments show that binding of berberine produces conformational changes that damages the secondary structures of 6-HB. Computer-aided molecular docking studies suggest a hydrogen bond with T-639 and two polar bonds with Q-563 and T-639 are established, involving the oxygen atom and the C=O group of the indole ring. Berberine completely inhibits six HIV-1 clade B isolates and exhibits antiviral activities in a concentration-dependent manner with IC50 values varying from 5.5 to 10.25 µg/ml. This compound-peptide interaction may represent a mechanism of action of antiviral activities of berberine. As a summary, these studies successfully identify compound berberine as a potential candidate drug for HIV-1 treatment. As a summary, antiviral activity of berberine in combination with its use in clinical practice, this medicine can be used as a potential clinically anti-HIV drug.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Insulin has captured researchers’ attention worldwide. There is a rapid global rise in the number of diabetic patients, which increases the demand for insulin. Current methods of insulin production are expensive and time-consuming. A PCR-based strategy was employed for the cloning and verification of human insulin. The human insulin protein was then overexpressed in E. coli on a laboratory scale. Thereafter, optimisation of human insulin expression was conducted. The yield of human insulin produced was approximately 520.92 (mg/L), located in the intracellular fraction. Human insulin was detected using the MALDI-TOF-MS and LC–MS methods. The crude biosynthesised protein sequence was verified using protein sequencing, which had a 100% similarity to the human insulin sequence. The biological activity of human insulin was tested in vitro using a MTT assay, which revealed that the crude biosynthesised human insulin displayed a similar degree of efficacy to the standard human insulin. This study eliminated the use of affinity tags since an untagged pET21b expression vector was employed. Tedious protein renaturation, inclusion body recovery steps, and the expensive enzymatic cleavage of the C-peptide of insulin were eliminated, thereby making this method of biosynthesising human insulin a novel and more efficient method.",

    "abstract": "Cell suspensions of Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus acidophilus were exposed to 600-ns pulsed electric fields (nsPEFs) at varying amplitudes (Low-13.5, Mid-18.5 or High-23.5 kV cm-1) and pulse numbers (0 (sham), 1, 5, 10, 100 or 1000) at a 1 hertz (Hz) repetition rate. The induced temperature rise generated at these exposure parameters, hereafter termed thermal gradient, was measured and applied independently to cell suspensions in order to differentiate inactivation triggered by electric field (E-field) from heating. Treated cell suspensions were plated and cellular inactivation was quantified by colony counts after a 24-hour (h) incubation period. Additionally, cells from both exposure conditions were incubated with various antibiotic-soaked discs to determine if nsPEF exposure would induce changes in antibiotic susceptibility. Results indicate that, for both species, the total delivered energy (amplitude, pulse number and pulse duration) determined the magnitude of cell inactivation. Specifically, for 18.5 and 23.5 kV cm-1 exposures, L. acidophilus was more sensitive to the inactivation effects of nsPEF than E. coli, however, for the 13.5 kV cm-1 exposures E. coli was more sensitive, suggesting that L. acidophilus may need to meet an E-field threshold before significant inactivation can occur. Results also indicate that antibiotic susceptibility was enhanced by multiple nsPEF exposures, as observed by increased zones of growth inhibition. Moreover, for both species, a temperature increase of ≤ 20 °C (89% of exposures) was not sufficient to significantly alter cell inactivation, whereas none of the thermal equivalent exposures were sufficient to change antibiotic susceptibility categories.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Microbial community structure and metabolic activities have profound impacts on biogeochemical processes in marine sediments. Functional bacteria such as nitrate- and sulfate-reducing bacteria respond to redox gradients by coupling specific reactions amenable to relevant energy metabolisms. However, similar functional patterns have not been observed for sedimentary archaea (except for anaerobic methanotrophs and methanogens). We coupled taxonomic composition with comprehensive geochemical species to investigate the participation of distinct bacteria and archaea in sedimentary geochemical cycles in a sediment core (300 cm) from Pearl River Estuary (PRE). Geochemical properties (NO 3 − , dissolved Mn and Fe, SO 4 2+ , NH 4 + ; dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), δ 13 C DIC , dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total organic carbon (TOC), δ 13 C TOC , and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM)) exhibited strong depth variability of different trends. Bacterial 16S rRNA- and dsrB gene abundance decreased sharply with depth while archaeal and bathyarchaeotal 16S rRNA gene copies were relatively constant. This resulted in an increase in relative abundance of archaea from surface (11.6%) to bottom (42.8%). Network analysis showed that bacterial groups of Desulfobacterales , Syntrophobacterales and Gammaproteobacteria were significantly (P &lt; 0.0001) associated with SO 4 2− and dissolved Mn while archaeal groups of Bathyarchaeota , Group C3 and Marine Benthic Group D (MBGD) showed close positive correlations (P &lt; 0.0001) with NH 4 + , δ 13 C TOC values and humic-like FDOM. Our study suggested that these bacterial groups dominated in redox processes relevant to sulfate or metal oxides, while the archaeal groups are more like to degrade recalcitrant organic compounds in anaerobic sediments.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the synergistic antibacterial effects of nisin and selected licorice polyphenols (glabridin, licoricidin, licochalcone A) against planktonic and biofilm-embedded E. faecalis cells. The biocompatibility and anti-inflammatory properties of the nisin/licorice polyphenol combinations were also investigated. The lantibiotic bacteriocin (nisin), the two isoflavonoids (glabridin, licoricidin), and the chalcone (licochalcone A) efficiently inhibited the growth of E. faecalis, with MICs ranging from 6.25 to 25 µg/mL. Combining nisin with each licorice polyphenol individually resulted in a significant synergistic antibacterial effect. Following a 30-min contact, nisin in combination with either glabridin, licoricidin, or licochalcone A caused significant biofilm killing. The nisin/licorice polyphenol combinations had no cytotoxic effects (oral epithelial cells, gingival fibroblasts, and stem cells of the apical papilla), with the exception of nisin/glabridin, when used at their MICs. Lastly, we showed that nisin/glabridin, nisin/licoricidin, and nisin/licochalcone A inhibit NF-κB activation induced by E. faecalis in a monocyte model, suggesting that these combinations possess anti-inflammatory properties. The present study provides evidence that combinations of nisin and glabridin, licoricidin, or licochalcone A show promise as root canal disinfection agents.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Helicobacter pylori infection can cause a variety of gastrointestinal diseases. In severe cases, there is a risk of gastric cancer. Antibiotics are often used for clinical treatment of H. pylori infections. However, because of antibiotic overuse in recent years and the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria, there is an urgent need to develop new treatment methods and drugs to achieve complete eradication of H. pylori . Endolysins and holins encoded by bacterial viruses (i.e., phages) represent a promising avenue of investigation. These lyase-based antibacterial drugs act on the bacterial cell wall to destroy the bacteria. Currently, a type of endolysin that has been studied more frequently acts on the amide bond between peptidoglycans, and holin is a transmembrane protein that can punch holes in the cell membrane. However, as a Gram-negative bacterium, H. pylori possesses a layer of impermeable lipopolysaccharides on the cell wall, which prevents endolysin interaction with the cell wall. Therefore, we designed a genetic linkage between an endolysin enzyme and a holin enzyme with a section of polypeptides (e.g., polycations and hydrophobic peptides) that enable penetration of the outer membrane. These complexes were designated “artilysins” and were efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli . In vitro bacteriostasis experiments showed that the purified artilysins had strong bacteriostatic effects on H. pylori . In addition, the surface of H. pylori was perforated and destroyed, as confirmed by electron microscopy, which was proved that artilysins had bacteriolytic effect on H. pylori .",

Despite the advancements in HCC treatments such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, and hormonal therapy, researchers are pursuing novel natural edible compounds for the treatment of cancer to eliminate dreadful side effects. Pleurotus ostreatus is one of the most edible cuisines in Asia as well as all over the world. It has been a source of nutritious diet since it was classified as an edible mushroom with no or negligible side effects. The present study focused on the natural anti-cancerous and anti-ascites capabilities of polysaccharides extracted from Pleurotus ostreatus in-vivo as well as in-vitro. Administration of polysaccharide Pleurotus ostreatus showed a significant decrease in tumor cell metastasis while the increase in the survival period among mice models of H22 malignant ascites. Downregulation of regenerative genes Foxp3 and Stat3 and secretion of immunological factors such as IL-2, TNF α, and INF γ were observed after treating with the partially pure extracted polysaccharide. Twining with the hypothesis of tumor suppression in-vivo model polysaccharide showed a decrease in invasion and migration abilities and henceforth responsible for the gene regulation such Cytochrome C which supposedly induced the chain of gene regulation process resulting in apoptosis in HCC cell lines observed in-vitro experiments. Collective research findings manifested that polysaccharide extracted from Pleurotus ostreatus bears anti-proliferative activity and thus influence tumor suppression in-vivo and in-vitro against hepatocellular carcinoma and can be used for therapeutic purposes as a potential anti-cancerous source in the future.",

Results also demonstrated that an environment co-contaminated with relatively high sublethal concentrations of copper ion and tetracycline co-contaminated environment could induce much higher antibiotic resistance than the low sublethal and control groups. Whole-genome characterization results indicated that variability existed within the genotype and phenotype involved in antibiotic resistance. Additionally, the evolved resistant strains displayed hereditary resistance after 5 round culture cycles in LB broth over 5 days.

The objective of the present study is to evaluate phage populations from water bodies to inhibit planktonic and biofilm mode of growth of drug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in vitro and curtail planktonic growth in vivo in a zebrafish model. Phage specific to K. pneumoniae (MTCC 432) was isolated from Ganges River (designated as KpG). One-step growth curve, in vitro time kill curve study and in vivo infection model were performed to evaluate the ability of phage to curtail planktonic growth. Crystal violet assay and colony biofilm assay were performed to determine the action of phages on biofilms. KpG phages had a greater burst size, better bactericidal potential and enhanced inhibitory effect against biofilms formed at liquid air and solid air interfaces. In vitro time kill assay showed a 3 log decline and a 6 log decline in K. pneumoniae colony counts, when phages were administered individually and in combination with streptomycin, respectively. In vivo injection of KpG phages revealed that it did not pose any toxicity to zebrafish as evidenced by liver/brain enzyme profiles and by histopathological analysis. The muscle tissue of zebrafish, infected with K. pneumoniae and treated with KpG phages alone and in combination with streptomycin showed a significant 77.7% and 97.2% decline in CFU/ml, respectively, relative to untreated control. Our study reveals that KpG phages has the potential to curtail plantonic and biofilm mode of growth in higher animal models.",

Soil fumigation using dazomet followed by biological organic fertilizer was applied to suppress the Fusarium wilt disease. We propose that fumigation suppresses the soil indigenous community, especially the soil-borne pathogens, while the utilization of bio-organic fertilizer facilitates the recovery of the soil microbiome to a beneficial, suppressive state through the introduction of plant growth-promoting microorganisms. Greenhouse experiment showed that applied biological organic fertilizer after dazomet fumigation effective restrain the disease incidence with a 93.6% disease control. Fumigation strongly decreased soil microbial diversity and altered relative taxa abundances, suggesting the possibility of niche release by the resident soil microbial community. Fumigation followed by bio-fertilizer transformed the soil microbial community composition and resulted in higher relative abundances of beneficial microbial groups such as Bacillus (8.5%) and Trichoderma (13.5%), coupled with lower Fusarium abundance compared to other treatments. Network analysis illustrated that soil fumigation decreased interactions within the soil microbial community with less nodes and links while bio-fertilizer addition promoted node interactions. In addition, bio-fertilizer addition after fumigation resulted in the beneficial species becoming the key network connectors. Collectively, fumigation appears to release the resident soil niche resulting in lower diversity while the beneficial microbes introduced by bio-fertilizer addition colonize these niches, leading to a more complex community with fewer pathogens that suppresses Fusarium wilt disease incidence.",

Therefore, this article reviews the latest research on the biosynthesis of terpenoids in basidiomycetes and summarizes the CYP450 involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoids in basidiomycetes. We also propose opportunities and challenges for chassis microbial heterologous production of terpenoids in basidiomycetes and provide a reference basis for the better development of basidiomycete engineering.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The increasing global perception of the importance of microbial inoculants to promote productivity and sustainability in agriculture prompts the adoption of bio-inputs by the farmers. The utilization of selected elite strains of nitrogen-fixing and other plant-growth promoting microorganisms in single inoculants creates a promising market for composite inoculants. However, combining microorganisms with different physiological and nutritional needs requires biotechnological development. We report the development of a composite inoculant containing Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens and Azospirillum brasilense for the soybean crop. Evaluation of use of carbon sources indicates differences between the microbial species, with Bradyrhizobium growing better with mannitol and glycerol, and Azospirillum with malic acid and maleic acid, allowing the design of a formulation for co-culture. Species also differ in their growth rates, and the best performance of both microorganisms occurred when Azospirillum was inoculated on the third day of growth of Bradyrhizobium . The composite inoculant developed was evaluated in five field trials performed in Brazil, including areas without and with naturalized populations of Bradyrhizobium . The composite inoculant resulted in symbiotic performance comparable to the application of the two microorganisms separately. In comparison to the single inoculation with Bradyrhizobium , co-inoculation resulted in average increases of 14.7% in grain yield and 16.4% in total N accumulated in the grains. The performance of the composite inoculant was similar or greater than that of the non-inoculated control receiving a high dose of N-fertilizer, indicating the importance of the development and validation of inoculants carrying multiple beneficial microorganisms.",

The richness and diversity of intestinal flora in UC patients were significantly lower than those in healthy control group (P &lt; 0.05). Significant differences were observed between the intestinal flora-species of UC patients and healthy controls.

The incidence of UC is significantly associated with the changes in intestinal flora. Changes in intestinal flora may lead to a decrease in the diversity of intestinal flora or to the enrichment of a particular intestinal flora.",

In this paper we demonstrate that they can be employed to generate mammalian-equivalent metabolites of the pyrethroid pesticides transfluthrin and β-cyfluthrin, both of which are fluorinated. The pesticides were incubated with grown cultures of Cunninghamella elegans, C. blakesleeana and C. echinulata and the biotransformation monitored using fluorine-19 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Transfluthrin was initially absorbed in the biomass, but after 72 h a new fluorometabolite appeared in the supernatant; although all three species yielded this compound, it was most prominent in C. blakesleeana. In contrast β-cyfluthrin mostly remained in the fungal biomasss and only minor biotransformation was observed. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of culture supernatant extracts revealed the identity of the fluorinated metabolite of transfluthrin to be tetrafluorobenzyl alcohol, which arose from the cytochrome P450-catalysed cleavage of the ester bond in the pesticide. The other product of this hydrolysis, dichlorovinyl-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane carboxylic acid, was also detected by GC-MS and was a product of β-cyfluthrin metabolism too. Upon incubation with rat liver microsomes the same products were detected, demonstrating that the fungi can be used as models of mammalian metabolism of fluorinated pesticides.",

In this study, antifouling activities of nine bioactive extracts (non-polar to polar) from different organs of the sea cucumber Stichopus herrmanni were tested against five bacterial strains, barnacle and brine shrimp larvae. The ethyl acetate extract of the body wall showed the highest in-vitro antifouling activity including high antibacterial and anti-barnacle activities and low toxicity against the brine shrimp as non-target organism. Based on these results, 10 phr of the ethyl acetate extract from S.herrmanni was added to different coatings consisting of polycaprolactone (PCL)/polylactic acid (PLA) blends containing various compositions of PLA (0, 10, and 20 wt.%). Polyvinyl chloride panels were coated with the prepared antifouling coatings and immersed in seawater for three months. Panel coated with PCL 80% /PLA 20% containing 10 phr of the antifoulant (panel-5), showed the highest resistance against fouling settlement with fouling coverage of 41.66% (P < 0.05). In addition, the lowest fouling weight was measured in panel-5 as well (81.00 ± 9.85 g) (P < 0.05). These findings indicate the antibacterial and antifouling potential of semi-polar bioactive extracts from the S. herrmanni body wall as natural antifoulants, as well as the enhanced antifouling performance of PCL/the natural antifoulant coatings by adding PLA.",

Therefore, this study aimed to biosynthesize Au–Ag nanoparticles using propolis as a natural reducing agent and investigate their antibacterial activity against antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus sciuri ( S. sciuri ), Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( P. aeruginosa ), and Salmonella enterica Typhimurium ( S. enterica ), besides demonstrating their anticancer activity in cancer cell lines. The biosynthesized Au@AgNPs were characterized using UV–Vis spectrophotometer, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Zeta potential, Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Fourier Transformation Infrared (FTIR), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Moreover, the detection of antibacterial activity was assessed through disc diffusion, the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC), time-killing curve, and detection of cell membrane integrity via SEM. As a result, the UV–Vis spectrum revealed the formation of Au@AgNPs in a single peak between 533 and 555 nm. Furthermore, FTIR analysis confirmed nanoparticles’ green synthesis due to the presence of carbon functional groups. The formulated Au@AgNPs showed antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The MIC and the MBC of P. aeruginosa and S. sciuri were 31.25 µg/mL. However, nanoparticles were more effective on S. enterica with MIC of 7.5 µg/mL and MBC of 15.6 µg/mL. Furthermore, the time-killing curve of the three model bacteria with the treatment was effective at 50 µg/mL. Besides, SEM of the tested bacteria indicated unintegrated bacterial cell membranes and damage caused by Au@AgNPs. Regarding the anticancer activity, the results indicated that the biosynthesized Au@AgNPs have a cytotoxic effect on HEPG2 cell lines. In conclusion, this research revealed that the green synthesized Au@AgNPs could be effective antibacterial agents against S. sciuri , P. aeruginosa , and S. enterica and anticancer agents against HEPG2.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Various PCR-based genome-walking methods have been developed to acquire unknown flanking DNA sequences. However, the specificity and efficacy levels, and the operational processes, of the available methods are unsatisfactory. This work proposes a novel walking approach, termed differential annealing-mediated racket PCR (DAR-PCR). The key to DAR-PCR is the use of primer-mediated intra-strand annealing (ISA). An ISA primer consists of a 5’ root homologous to the known sequence and a heterologous 3’ bud. In the single low-stringency cycle, the ISA primer anneals to a site on an unknown region and extends towards the sequence-specific primer (SSP) 1 site, thereby forming a target single-stranded DNA bound by the SSP1 complement and the ISA primer. In the subsequent more stringent cycles, its complementary strand is accumulated, owing to the differential annealing between the moderate-stringency ISA primer and the high-stringency SSP1. The accumulation of this strand provides an opportunity for ISA mediated by the ISA primer root. A loop-back extension subsequent to ISA occurs, creating a racket-like DNA with the known region positioned at both ends of the unknown sequence. This DNA is exponentially amplified during the secondary PCR driven by an SSP pair inner to SSP1. DAR-PCR was validated as an efficient walking method by determining unknown flanking sequences in Lactobacillus brevis and Oryza sativa .",

Recently, however, there has been an increase in clinical reports concerning less prevalent Enterococcus species, such as E. durans, E. hirae, and E. gallinarum. Rapid and accurate laboratory methods are needed to facilitate the identification of all these bacterial species. In the present study, we compared the relative accuracy of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), VITEK 2, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing using 39 enterococci isolates from dairy samples, and compared the resultant phylogenetic trees. We found that MALDI-TOF MS correctly identified all isolates at the species level except for one, whereas the VITEK 2 system, which is an automated identification system using biochemical characteristics of species, misidentified ten isolates. However, phylogenetic trees constructed from both methods showed all isolates in similar positions. Our results clearly showed that MALDI-TOF MS is a reliable and rapid tool for identifying Enterococcus species with greater discriminatory power than the biochemical assay method of VITEK 2.",

While there have been improvements in the cultivation technology, the mechanism of mycelial block cultivation, such as mycelial growth and enzymatic sawdust degradation, has not been clarified. In this study, the mycelium was elongated longitudinally in the bottle sawdust culture for 27 days, and the cultivated sawdust medium was divided into three sections (top, middle, and bottom parts). To determine spatial heterogeneity in the enzyme secretion, the enzymatic activities of each part were analyzed. Lignocellulose degradation enzymes, such as endoglucanase, xylanase, and manganese peroxidase were highly secreted in the top part of the medium. On the other hand, amylase, pectinase, fungal cell wall degradation enzyme (β-1,3-glucanase, β-1,6-glucanase, and chitinase), and laccase activities were higher in the bottom part. The results indicate that the principal sawdust degradation occurs after mycelial colonization. Proteins with the laccase activity were purified from the bottom part of the medium, and three laccases, Lcc5, Lcc6 and Lcc13, were identified. In particular, the expression of Lcc13 gene was higher in the bottom part compared with the level in the top part, suggesting Lcc13 is mainly produced from the tip region and have important roles for mycelial spread and nutrient uptake during early stage of cultivation.",

Currently, L-asparaginase obtained from bacterial sources is constrained by several issues, including lesser productivity, stability, selectivity, and higher toxicity. The goal of this study is to provide fungal L-asparaginase with in-vitro effectiveness towards different human carcinomas. L-asparaginase from endophytic Fusarium solani (Gene Bank accession number MW209717) isolated from the roots of the medicinal plant Hedera helix L. was characterized and optimized experimentally for maximum L-asparaginase production in addition to evaluating its subsequent cytotoxicity towards acute monocytic leukemia and human skin fibroblast cell lines. The enzyme production was maximized using potato dextrose media (15.44 IU/ml/hr) at the 5th and 6th days of fermentation with incubation temperature 30 °C, 3% asparagine, 150-180 rpm agitation rate and a 250 ml flask. Enzyme characterization studies revealed that the enzyme maintained its thermal stability with temperatures up to 60 °C. However, its optimal activity was achieved at 35 °C. On measuring the enzymatic activity at various temperatures and different pH, maximum enzyme activity was recorded at 40 °C and pH 8 using 0.1 M asparagine concentration. Results also revealed promising cytotoxic activity against acute monocytic leukemia with IC50 = 3.66 µg/ml and low cytotoxicity against tested normal human skin fibroblast cell line which suggested that it might have selective toxicity, and consequently it could be used as a less toxic alternative to the current formulations.",

We investigated the potency of secondary metabolites from seventy endophytic actinobacteria against laboratory and field strains of Spodoptera littoralis (fourth instar), comparable to the bioinsecticide spinetoram (Radiant SC 12%). Endophytes from Artemisia herba-alba and A. judaica were highly effective. Chemical profiling of the most potent metabolite of the strain Streptomyces sp. ES2 was investigated using LC-QTOF-MS-MS technique, and the activity was validated through molecular docking studies. Metabolic extracts from actinobacteria belonging to Streptomyces, Nocardioides, and Pseudonocardia showed immediate and latent death to the Spodoptera littoralis fourth instar larvae. The metabolite from strain ES2 has shown the most promising and significant histopathological and inhibitory effects on the fourth instar larvae. ES2 metabolite caused lesions in the body wall cuticle, indicating a different mode of action than that of Radiant. Chemical profiling of ES2 showed the presence of cyromazine (molt inhibitor), 4-nitrophenol, and diazinon as key constituents. In conclusion, these findings suggest that secondary metabolites from endophytic actinobacteria inhabiting wild medicinal plants can be a sustainable source for promising natural biocontrol agents.

Conversely, utilizing organic fertilizers such as sage offers several advantages, including cost-effectiveness, soil enhancement, and promotion of root development. A two-year field experiment was conducted to investigate the impact of different potassium fertilizer sources and biofertilizers (specifically Bacillus cereus (MBc)) on potato plants. The experiment employed a split-plot design with three replicates, where the main plot factor was MBc (with and without), and the subplot factor was the sources of potassium fertilizer (control without K fertilizer, 100% Feldspar (FD), 100% Filter cake (FC), 75% FD + 25% FC, 25% FD + 75% FC, and 50% FD + 50% FC). The purpose was to examine the growth response of potato plants to these treatments. The results indicated that all treatments increased plant height, stem count, and tuber dry matter compared to the control. Furthermore, all treatments exhibited a higher uptake of macronutrients (N, P, and K) compared to the control. Notably, the plants treated with 100FC combined with MBc showed a significant 104.74% increase in total tuber weight compared to the control treatment. Additionally, the addition of 100FC with MBc significantly enhanced the availability of N, P, and K by 73.13%, 110.33%, and 51.88% respectively, compared to the control treatment. Apart from the biofertilizers, the individual application of FC and its combination with FD also demonstrated positive effects on soil fertility, potato growth, and yield.",

The most significant side effects, which affect 1 to 10% of consumers, are kidney injury and ototoxicity. Several studies discussed the role of grape seed extract (GSE) in renoprotection against AMK. The current study aimed to extract Muscat of Alexandria grape seeds followed by its characterization to determine its bioactive components and elements. GSE nanoparticles was prepared and tested, in vitro, to determine its safety for the in vivo experiment. Experimental groups were control group I, AMK group II, GSE (50 mg/kg)-AMK group III, GSE (100 mg/kg)-AMK group IV, GSE NPs (25 mg/kg)-AMK group V and GSE NPs (50 mg/kg)-AMK group VI. Groups 2-6 received 100 mg/kg/day of AMK by intramuscular injection for two weeks for the induction of experimental nephrotoxicity. Groups 3-6 received daily doses of GSE or GSE NPs by oral gavage, concurrently, with AMK for two weeks. GSE was rich in polyphenol compounds like proanthocyanidins, phenolic acids like gallic and egallic acids, catechine and epicatechine. GSE NPs have a smooth surface and a size that ranged from 40 to 70 nm; and have an anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cytotoxic and anti-microbial in vitro effects. It reduced oxidative stress and inflammation that followed AMK administration; and attenuated the AMK-induced nephrotoxicity. GSE NPs were safe to be used in vivo as a renoprotective agent against AMK; where, it reduced the oxidative stress and inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Type-2 diabetes is mediated by defects in either insulin secretion or insulin action. In an effort to identify extracts that may stimulate glucose uptake, similar to insulin, a high throughput-screening assay for measuring glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells was established. During the screening studies to discover novel antidiabetic compounds from microbial resources a Streptomyces strain PM0324667 (MTCC 5543, the Strain accession number at Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh, India), an isolate from arid soil was identified which expressed a secondary metabolite that induced glucose uptake in L6 skeletal muscle cells. By employing bioactivity guided fractionation techniques, a tri-substituted simple aromatic compound with anti-diabetic potential was isolated. It was characterized based on MS and 2D NMR spectral data and identified as NFAT-133 which is a known immunosuppressive agent that inhibits NFAT-dependent transcription in vitro. Our investigations revealed the antidiabetic potential of NFAT-133. The compound induced glucose uptake in differentiated L6 myotubes with an EC50 of 6.3 ± 1.8 μM without activating the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ. Further, NFAT-133 was also efficacious in vivo in diabetic animals and reduced systemic glucose levels. Thus it is a potential lead compound which can be considered for development as a therapeutic for the treatment of type-2 diabetes. We have reported herewith the isolation of the producer microbe, fermentation, purification, in vitro, and in vivo antidiabetic activity of the compound.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In winemaking, nutrient supplementation is a common practice for optimising fermentation and producing quality wine. Nutritionally suboptimal grape juices are often enriched with nutrients in order to manipulate the production of yeast aroma compounds. Nutrients are also added to active dry yeast (ADY) rehydration media to enhance subsequent fermentation performance. In this study we demonstrate that nutrient supplementation at rehydration also has a significant effect on the formation of volatile sulfur compounds during wine fermentations. The concentration of the 'fruity' aroma compounds, the polyfunctional thiols 3-mercaptohexan-1-ol (3MH) and 3-mercaptohexyl acetate (3MHA), was increased while the concentration of the 'rotten egg' aroma compound, hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), was decreased. Nutrient supplementation of the rehydration media also changed the kinetics of H 2 S production during fermentation by advancing onset of H 2 S production. Microarray analysis revealed that this was not due to expression changes within the sulfate assimilation pathway, which is known to be a major contributor to H 2 S production. To gain insight into possible mechanisms responsible for this effect, a component of the rehydration nutrient mix, the tri-peptide glutathione (GSH) was added at rehydration and studied for its subsequent effects on H 2 S formation. GSH was found to be taken up during rehydration and to act as a source for H 2 S during the following fermentation. These findings represent a potential approach for managing sulfur aroma production through the use of rehydration nutrients.",

The bacterium grew well aerobically at around 55°C and was identified as Ureibacillus thermosphaericus strain A1. We purified the enzyme about 47-fold to homogeneity from crude cell extract using five successive purification steps. The molecular mass of the purified protein was about 80 kDa, and the molecule consists of a homodimer with the subunit molecular mass of about 40 kDa. The optimum pH and temperature for the catalytic activity of the enzyme are about 10.5 and 65°C, respectively. The enzyme is highly selective for meso-diaminopimelate as the electron donor, and NADP but not NAD can serve as the electron acceptor. The Km values for meso-diaminopimelate and NADP at 50°C and pH 10.5 are 1.6 mM and 0.13 mM, respectively. The nucleotide sequence of this meso-DAPDH gene encodes a 326-amino acid peptide. When the gene was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3), the specific activity in the crude extract of the recombinant cells was about 18.0-fold higher than in the extract from U. thermosphaericus strain A1. This made more rapid and simpler purification of the enzyme possible.",

In this work, we focused on the biotransformation of 5-haloindole into 5-halotryptophan, a pharmaceutical intermediate, using Escherichia coli expressing a recombinant tryptophan synthase enzyme encoded by plasmid pSTB7. To optimise the reaction we compared two E. coli K-12 strains (MC4100 and MG1655) and their ompR234 mutants, which overproduce the adhesin curli (PHL644 and PHL628). The ompR234 mutation increased the quantity of biofilm in both MG1655 and MC4100 backgrounds. In all cases, no conversion of 5-haloindoles was observed using cells without the pSTB7 plasmid. Engineered biofilms of strains PHL628 pSTB7 and PHL644 pSTB7 generated more 5-halotryptophan than their corresponding planktonic cells. Flow cytometry revealed that the vast majority of cells were alive after 24 hour biotransformation reactions, both in planktonic and biofilm forms, suggesting that cell viability was not a major factor in the greater performance of biofilm reactions. Monitoring 5-haloindole depletion, 5-halotryptophan synthesis and the percentage conversion of the biotransformation reaction suggested that there were inherent differences between strains MG1655 and MC4100, and between planktonic and biofilm cells, in terms of tryptophan and indole metabolism and transport. The study has reinforced the need to thoroughly investigate bacterial physiology and make informed strain selections when developing biotransformation reactions.",

We successfully evaluated the combination of pentachloronitrobenzene and vancomycin added to the yeast-mannitol medium to inhibit most fungi and Gram-positive soybean microbiota, thus producing reliable counts of B. japonicum from inoculated soybean seeds. Percentages of recovery and survival factors were obtained and used to construct a two-phase exponential decay non-linear regression function. High temperature and desiccation decreased these parameters, while the optimization of temperature and the use of osmoprotective compounds with inoculants increased them. The use of this protocol minimized heterogeneity between experiments and may be considered more reliable than the simple expression of direct colony count of bacteria recovered from seeds.",

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have emerged as promising alternative agents for treatment of infectious diseases. This study characterizes novel synthetic peptides sequentially derived from the AMP centrocin 1, isolated from the green sea urchin, for their applicability as anti-infective agents.The microbicidal effect of centrocin 1 heavy chain (CEN1 HC-Br), its debrominated analogue (CEN1 HC), the C-terminal truncated variants of both peptides, i.e. CEN1 HC-Br (1-20) and CEN1 HC (1-20), as well as the cysteine to serine substituted equivalent CEN1 HC (Ser) was evaluated using minimal microbicidal concentration assay. The anti-inflammatory properties were assessed by measuring the inhibition of secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. All the peptides tested exhibited marked microbicidal and anti-inflammatory properties. No difference in efficacy was seen comparing CEN1 HC-Br and CEN1 HC, while the brominated variant had higher cytotoxicity. C-terminal truncation of both peptides reduced salt-tolerability of the microbicidal effect as well as anti-inflammatory actions. Also, serine substitution of cysteine residue decreased the microbicidal effect. Thus, from the peptide variants tested, CEN1 HC showed the best efficacy and safety profile. Further, CEN1 HC significantly reduced bacterial counts in two different animal models of infected wounds, while Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) failed to develop resistance against this peptide under continued selection pressure. In summary, CEN1 HC appears a promising new antimicrobial agent, and clinical studies are warranted to evaluate the applicability of this AMP for local treatment of infections in man.",

Transformants carrying the T-DNA from a binary vector pBIG2RHPH2 were sufficiently mitotically stable to allow functional genomic analyses. The AMT technique was optimized by altering the concentration of acetosyringone, the ratio and concentration of A. tumefaciens and A. aculeatus cells, the duration of co-cultivation, and the status of A. aculeatus cells when using conidia, protoplasts, or germlings. On average, 30 transformants per 10 4 conidia or 217 transformants per 10 7 conidia were obtained under the optimized conditions when A. tumefaciens co-cultured with fungi using solid or liquid induction media (IM). Although the transformation frequency in liquid IM was 100-fold lower than that on solid IM, the AMT method using liquid IM is better suited for high-throughput insertional mutagenesis because the transformants can be isolated on fewer selection media plates by concentrating the transformed germlings. The production of two albino A. aculeatus mutants by AMT confirmed that the inserted T-DNA disrupted the polyketide synthase gene AapksP , which is involved in pigment production. Considering the efficiency of AMT and the correlation between the phenotypes and genotypes of the transformants, the established AMT technique offers a highly efficient means for characterizing the gene function in A. aculeatus .",

In this connection, this work explored new experimental procedures in order to quantitatively check the potential of some culture conditions to induce a determined fungal morphology by altering both hyphal morphology and conidia adhesion capacity. The capacity of environmental conditions to modify hyphal morphology was evaluated by examining the influence of some culture conditions on the cell wall lytic potential of Aspergillus niger MYA 135. The relative value of the cell wall lytic potential was determined by measuring a cell wall lytic enzyme activity such as the mycelium-bound β-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase (Mb-NAGase). On the other hand, the quantitative value of conidia adhesion was considered as an index of its aggregation capacity. Concerning microscopic morphology, a highly negative correlation between the hyphal growth unit length (l HGU ) and the specific Mb-NAGase activity was found (r = -0.915, P &lt; 0.001). In fact, the environment was able to induce highly branched mycelia only under those culture conditions compatible with specific Mb-NAGase values equal to or higher than 190 U g dry . wt -1 . Concerning macroscopic morphology, a low conidia adhesion capacity was followed by a dispersed mycelial growth. In fact, this study showed that conidia adhesion units per ml equal to or higher than 0.50 were necessary to afford pellets formation. In addition, it was also observed that once the pellet was formed the l HGU had an important influence on its final diameter. Finally, the biotechnological significance of such results was discussed as well.",

When purified lysins are added externally to Gram-positive bacteria they mediate rapid death by the same mechanism. For this reason, novel therapeutic strategies have been developed using such enzybiotics. However, like other proteins introduced into mammalian organisms, they are quickly cleared from systemic circulation. PEGylation has been used successfully to increase the in vivo half-life of many biological molecules and was therefore applied to Cpl-1, a lysin specific for S. pneumoniae. Cysteine-specific PEGylation with either PEG 10K or 40K was achieved on Cpl-1 mutants, each containing an additional cysteine residue at different locations To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the PEGylation of bacteriophage lysin. Compared to the native enzyme, none of the PEGylated conjugates retained significant in vitro anti-pneumococcal lytic activity that would have justified further in vivo studies. Since the anti-microbial activity of the mutant enzymes used in this study was not affected by the introduction of the cysteine residue, our results implied that the presence of the PEG molecule was responsible for the inhibition. As most endolysins exhibit a similar modular structure, we believe that our work emphasizes the inability to improve the in vivo half-life of this class of enzybiotics using a cysteine-specific PEGylation strategy.",

Modern molecular approaches to detect, characterize, and quantify microorganisms provide rapid and thorough measures unbiased by the need for cultivation. The requirement of timely extraction of high quality nucleic acids for molecular analysis is faced with specific challenges when used to study the influence of microorganisms on oil production. Production facilities are often ill equipped for nucleic acid extraction techniques, making the preservation and transportation of samples off-site a priority. As a potential solution, the possibility of extracting nucleic acids on-site using automated platforms was tested. The performance of two such platforms, the Fujifilm QuickGene-Mini80™ and Promega Maxwell®16 was compared to a widely used manual extraction kit, MOBIO PowerBiofilm™ DNA Isolation Kit, in terms of ease of operation, DNA quality, and microbial community composition. Three pipeline biofilm samples were chosen for these comparisons; two contained crude oil and corrosion products and the third transported seawater. Overall, the two more automated extraction platforms produced higher DNA yields than the manual approach. DNA quality was evaluated for amplification by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and end-point PCR to generate 454 pyrosequencing libraries for 16S rRNA microbial community analysis. Microbial community structure, as assessed by DGGE analysis and pyrosequencing, was comparable among the three extraction methods. Therefore, the use of automated extraction platforms should enhance the feasibility of rapidly evaluating microbial biofouling at remote locations or those with limited resources.",

To help understand metabolic shifts associated with elevated glycerol, protein expression levels were quantified by LC/MS/MS analyses. Thirty one (31) proteins involved in conversion of glycerol to 1,3-PDO and other by-products were analyzed by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The analyses revealed that high glycerol concentrations reduced cell growth. The expression levels of most proteins in glycerol catabolism pathways were down-regulated, consistent with the slower growth rates observed. However, at high initial glycerol concentrations, some of the proteins involved in the butyrate synthesis pathways such as a putative ethanol dehydrogenase (CBY_3753) and a 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (CBY_3045) were up-regulated in both exponential and stationary growth phases. Expression levels of proteins (CBY_0500, CBY_0501 and CBY_0502) involved in the reductive pathway of glycerol to 1,3-PDO were consistent with glycerol consumption and product concentrations observed during fermentation at both glycerol concentrations, and the molar yields of 1,3-PDO were similar in both cultures. This is the first report that correlates expression levels of glycerol catabolism enzymes with synthesis of 1,3-PDO in C. butyricum.

Current microalgae biofuel strategies typically rely on growing high-lipid producing laboratory strains of microalgae in open raceways or closed system photobioreactors. Unfortunately, these microalgae species are found to be sensitive to environmental stresses or competition by regional strains. Contamination by invasive species can diminish productivity of commercial algal processes. A potential improvement to current strategies is to identify high-lipid producing microalgae, which thrive in selected culture conditions that reduce the risk of contamination, such as low pH. Here we report the identification of a novel high-lipid producing microalgae which can tolerate low pH growth conditions. Lig 290 is a Scenedesmus spp. isolated from a low pH waterbody (pH = 4.5) in proximity to an abandoned lignite mine in Northern Ontario, Canada. Compared to a laboratory strain of Scendesmus dimorphus, Lig 290 demonstrated robust growth rates, a strong growth profile, and high lipid production. As a consequence, Lig 290 may have potential application as a robust microalgal species for use in biofuel production.",

We recently characterized an antimicrobial peptide that was called Paracentrin 1 from the 5-kDa peptide fraction from the coelomocyte cytosol of the Paracentrotus lividus. In this study, the chemically synthesized Paracentrin 1, was tested for its antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties against reference strains of Gram positive and Gram negative. The Paracentrin 1 was active against planktonic form of staphylococcal strains (reference and isolates) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442 at concentrations ranging from 12.5 to 6.2 mg/ml. The Paracentrin 1 was able to inhibit biofilm formation of staphylococcal and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains at concentrations ranging from 3.1 to 0.75 mg/ml. We consider the tested peptide as a good starting molecule for novel synthetic derivatives with improved pharmaceutical potential.",

High fluorescence levels were obtained in a glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase double deletion strain (gpd1Δgpd2Δ), which is deficient in the ability to regenerate NAD(+) via glycerol formation. The responsiveness of the reporter system to externally induced perturbations in NADH oxidation was also evaluated in the gpd1Δgpd2Δ strain background by addition of acetoin, as well as by introduction of a set of heterologous xylose reductases (XRs) having different selectivities for NADH. Addition of acetoin during cell proliferation under oxygen-limited conditions resulted in a more than 2-fold decrease in mean fluorescence intensity as compared to the control experiment. Strains carrying XRs with different selectivities for NADH could be distinguished at the single cell level, so that the XR with the highest selectivity for NADH displayed the lowest fluorescence. In conclusion, the designed system successfully allowed for monitoring perturbations in the cellular redox metabolism caused by environmental changes, or by heterologous gene expression. The reporter system displayed high resolution in distinguishing cytosolic NADH oxidation capacity and hence has potential to be used for high-throughput screening based on the fluorescence of single cells.",

It is naturally produced by several bacteria as a response to nutrient starvation in the excess of a carbon source. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae could be an alternative production host as it offers good inhibitor tolerance towards weak acids and phenolic compounds and does not depolymerize the produced PHB. As nitrogen limitation is known to boost the accumulation of PHB in bacteria, the present study aimed at investigating the effect of nitrogen availability on PHB accumulation in two recombinant S. cerevisiae strains harboring different xylose consuming and PHB producing pathways: TMB4443 expressing an NADPH-dependent acetoacetyl-CoA reductase and a wild-type S. stipitis XR with preferential use of NADPH and TMB4425 which expresses an NADH-dependent acetoacetyl-CoA reductase and a mutated XR with a balanced affinity for NADPH/NADH. TMB4443 accumulated most PHB under aerobic conditions and with glucose as sole carbon source, whereas the highest PHB concentrations were obtained with TMB4425 under anaerobic conditions and xylose as carbon source. In both cases, the highest PHB contents were obtained with high availability of nitrogen. The major impact of nitrogen availability was observed in TMB4425, where a 2.7-fold increase in PHB content was obtained. In contrast to what was observed in natural PHB-producing bacteria, nitrogen deficiency did not improve PHB accumulation in S. cerevisiae. Instead the excess available carbon from xylose was shunted into glycogen, indicating a significant gluconeogenic activity on xylose.",

In this study, we aimed to produce ammonia from amino acids and amino acid-based biomass-like resources by modifying the metabolism of Escherichia coli. By engineering metabolic flux to promote ammonia production using the overexpression of the ketoisovalerate decarboxylase gene (kivd), derived from Lactococcus lactis, ammonia production from amino acids was 351 mg/L (36.6% yield). Furthermore, we deleted the glnA gene, responsible for ammonia assimilation. Using yeast extract as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen, the resultant strain produced 458 mg/L of ammonia (47.8% yield) from an amino acid-based biomass-like material. The ammonia production yields obtained are the highest reported to date. This study suggests that it will be possible to produce ammonia from waste biomass in an environmentally friendly process.",

We determined the cytotoxic effects of 100 crude extracts from 54 selected organisms on the adherent murine mammary cell carcinoma 4T1 and human mammary adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cell lines. These extracts were obtained from strains of Isoptericola, Ornithinimicrobium, Janibacter, Nesterenkonia, Alkalibacterium, Bacillus, Halomonas, Chromohalobacter, Shewanella, Salipiger, Martellela, Oceanibaculum, Caenispirillum and Labrenzia. The extracts of 23 strains showed an IC50 of less than 100 μg mL-1. They were subsequently analyzed by LC/MS allowing dereplication of 20 compounds. The cytotoxic effect was related to a complex mixture of diketopiperazines present in many of the extracts analyzed. The greatest cytotoxic activity against both of the evaluated cell lines was obtained from the chloroform extract of Labrenzia aggregata USBA 371 which had an IC50 < 6 μg mL-1. Other extracts with high levels of cytotoxic activity were obtained from Bacillus sp. (IC50 < 50 μg mL-1) which contained several compounds such as macrolactin L and A, 7-O-succinoylmacrolactin F and iturin. Shewanella chilikensis USBA 344 also showed high levels of cytotoxic activity against both cell lines in the crude extract: an IC50 < 15 μg mL-1 against the 4T1 cell line and an IC50 < 68 μg mL-1 against the MCF-7 cell line. Nesterenkonia sandarakina CG 35, which has an IC50 of 118 µg mL-1 against 4T1, is a producer of diketopiperazines and 1-acetyl-β-carboline. Also, Ornithinimicrobium kibberense CG 24, which has IC50 < 50 μg mL-1, was a producer of diketopiperazines and lagunamycin. Our study demonstrates that these saline environments are habitats of halophilic and halotolerant bacteria that have previously unreported cytotoxic activity.",

In this study we show the degradation of the aliphatic ketone dodecane-2-one by Candida maltosa and the related yeasts Candida tropicalis , Candida catenulata and Candida albicans as well as Trichosporon asahii and Yarrowia lipolytica . One pathway is initiated by the formation of decyl acetate, resulting from a Baeyer-Villiger-oxidation of this ketone. Beyond this, an initial reduction to dodecane-2-ol by a keto reductase was clearly shown. In addition, two different ways to metabolize dodec-1-ene were proposed. One involved the formation of dodecane-2-one and the other one a conversion leading to carboxylic and dicarboxylic acids. Furthermore the induction of ketone degrading enzymes by dodecane-2-one and dodec-1-ene was shown. Interestingly, with dodecane no subterminal degradation products were detected and it did not induce any enzymes to convert dodecane-2-one.",

Strains of F. oxysporum were isolated and assessed for their genetic variability. Using optimised solid-state straw culture conditions, experiments were conducted that compared fungal strains in terms of their growth, enzyme activities (cellulases, xylanase and alcohol dehydrogenase) and yield of bioethanol and the undesirable by-products acetic acid and xylitol. Significant inter-strain divergence was recorded in regards to the capacity of studied F. oxysporum strains to produce alcohol from untreated straw. No correlation was observed between bioethanol synthesis and either the biomass production or microbial enzyme activity. A strong correlation was observed between both acetic acid and xylitol production and bioethanol yield. The level of diversity recorded in the alcohol production capacity among closely-related microorganism means that a targeted screening of populations of selected microbial species could greatly improve bioprocessing yields, in terms of providing both new host strains and candidate genes for the bioethanol industry.",

In this study, we performed a quantitative proteome analysis to determine changes in the extracellular proteins produced by C. cellulovorans for degradation of several types of natural soft biomass. C. cellulovorans was cultured in media containing bagasse, corn germ, rice straw (natural soft biomass), or cellobiose (control).

Of these, we focused on 77 saccharification-related proteins of both cellulosomal and non-cellulosomal origins. Statistical analysis showed that 18 of the proteins were specifically produced during degradation of types of natural soft biomass. Interestingly, the protein Clocel_3197 was found and commonly involved in the degradation of every natural soft biomass studied. This protein may perform functions, in addition to its known metabolic functions, that contribute to effective degradation of natural soft biomass.",

    "abstract": "Use of oleaginous microorganisms as \"micro-factories\" for accumulation of single cell oils for biofuel production has increased significantly to mitigate growing energy demands, resulting in efforts to upgrade industrial waste, such as second-generation lignocellulosic residues, into potential feedstocks. Dilute-acid pretreatment (DAP) is commonly used to alter the physicochemical properties of lignocellulosic materials and is typically coupled with simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) for conversion of sugars into ethanol. The resulting DAP residues are usually processed as a waste stream, e.g. burned for power, but this provides minimal value. Alternatively, these wastes can be utilized as feedstock to generate lipids, which can be converted to biofuel. DAP-SSF residues were generated from pine, poplar, and switchgrass. High performance liquid chromatography revealed less than 0.13% monomeric sugars in the dry residue. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was indicative of the presence of lignin and polysaccharides. Gel permeation chromatography suggested the bacterial strains preferred molecules with molecular weight ~ 400–500 g/mol. DAP-SSF residues were used as the sole carbon source for lipid production by Rhodococcus opacus DSM 1069 and PD630 in batch fermentations. Depending on the strain of Rhodococcus employed, 9–11 lipids for PD630 and DSM 1069 were observed, at a final concentration of ~ 15 mg/L fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) detected. Though the DAP-SSF substrate resulted in low FAME titers, novel analysis of solid-state fermentations was investigated, which determined that DAP-SSF residues could be a viable feedstock for lipid generation.",

Up to now, two different metabolic routes have been introduced via genetic engineering, consisting of either the isomerization or the oxido-reduction of d-xylose to d-xylulose that is further connected to the pentose phosphate pathway and glycolysis. In the present study, cytosolic d-xylose oxidation was investigated instead, through the introduction of the Weimberg pathway from Caulobacter crescentus in S. cerevisiae. This pathway consists of five reaction steps that connect d-xylose to the TCA cycle intermediate α-ketoglutarate. The corresponding genes could be expressed in S. cerevisiae, but no growth was observed on d-xylose indicating that not all the enzymes were functionally active. The accumulation of the Weimberg intermediate d-xylonate suggested that the dehydration step(s) might be limiting, blocking further conversion into α-ketoglutarate. Although four alternative dehydratases both of bacterial and archaeon origins were evaluated, d-xylonate accumulation still occurred. A better understanding of the mechanisms associated with the activity of dehydratases, both at a bacterial and yeast level, appears essential to obtain a fully functional Weimberg pathway in S. cerevisiae.",

Since Adriamycin® (ADR) is widely used to induce proteinuria in mouse models, the aim of this study was to explore the potential effect of gut microbiome on this process. Both ADR resistant (C57BL/6) and susceptible (BALB/C) strains were part of the induced nephropathy with ADR injection. BALB/C mice significantly presented increased urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) with renal lesions in pathology, but C57BL/6 mice were absent from kidney damage. Species and genus level resolution analysis showed a shift in gut microbial profile between BALB/C and C57BL/6 mice. ADR further altered the stool microbiome in BALB/C mice, particularly with enrichment of Odoribacter and depletion of Turicibacter, Marvinbryantia and Rikenella. Moreover, the level of UACR in BALB/C mice was marked related to the abundance of Marvinbryantia, Odoribacter and Turicibacter in stool. Meanwhile, ADR remarkably increased the serum levels of interleukin (IL)-2 in BALB/C mice, but not in C57BL/6 mice. It is suggested that the favorably altered stools as shown in the microbiome might promote the inflammation and proteinuria in ADR-sensitive mice, which provides a new insight on the pathogenicity of chronic kidney disease.",

The results showed that the concentration of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) peaked near the oil leak point and gradually decreased along the coastline, ranging from 21.5 to 133.2 μg/g. The distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was correlated with TPH, and naphthalenes were dominant in the 20 detected PAHs. The bacterial diversities in seriously polluted and slightly polluted sediments were completely different. As degrading bacteria, Alcanivorax and Lutibacter were the main genera at the oil-polluted sites. The analysis of biotoxicity by the luminescent bacteria method showed great differences among the polluted sites, the control site in Jiaozhou Bay, and the non-polluted site outside of Jiaozhou Bay. The biotoxicity also peaked at the site near the oil leak point. These results indicate that the oil spill that occurred 3 years ago still affects the environment and impacts the bacterial communities in the sediments.",

    "abstract": "Sweet potato vine (SPV) is an abundant agricultural waste, which is easy to obtain at low cost and has the potential to produce clean energy via anaerobic digestion (AD). The main objectives of this study were to reveal methane production and process stability of SPV and the mixtures with animal manure under various total solid conditions, to verify synergetic effect in co-digestion of SPV and manure in AD systems, and to determine the kinetics characteristics during the full AD process. The results showed that SPV was desirable feedstock for AD with 200.22 mL/g VSadded of methane yield in wet anaerobic digestion and 12.20 Lmethane/Lworking volume in dry anaerobic digestion (D-AD). Synergistic effects were found in semi-dry anaerobic digestion and D-AD with each two mixing feedstock. In contrast with SPV mono-digestion, co-digestion with manure increased methane yield within the range of 14.34–49.11% in different AD digesters. The values of final volatile fatty acids to total alkalinity (TA) were below 0.4 and the values of final pH were within the range of 7.4–8.2 in all the reactors, which supported a positive relationship between carbohydrate hydrolysis and methanogenesis during AD process. The mathematical modified first order model was applied to estimate substrate biodegradability and methane production potential well with conversion constant ranged from 0.0003 to 0.0953 1/day, which indicated that co-digestion increased hydrolysis efficiency and metabolic activity. This work provides useful information to improve the utilization and stability of digestion using SPV and livestock or poultry manure as substrates.",

However, few studies have examined the relationship between the fecal microbiota and HMs. In this study the effect of unfermented Astragalus (UA) and fermented Astragalus (FA) on growth performance, serum biochemical parameters, and fecal microbiota was evaluated in broiler chickens. In total, 180 one-day-old broiler chickens (Avian breeds) were randomly assigned to a control (C) group fed a basal diet, an unfermented (U) group fed a basal diet containing 0.5% UA, or a fermented (F) group fed a basal diet containing 0.5% FA, for 42 days. The F/G ratio was lower in F and U groups than in C group from 22 to 42 days (P < 0.05). Glutathione superoxide dismutase, antioxidant capacity, and total superoxide dismutase were higher, whereas malondialdehyde was lower in F group than in C and U groups from 1 to 21 days and from 22 to 42 days (P < 0.05). Fecal microbiota were profiled on an Illumina MiSeq platform following PCR amplification of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. At the genus level Lactobacillus was the most abundant genus on day 7 in F group. Importantly, a potentially pathogenic genus, Enterococcus, was less abundant in the U and F groups than in the C group on day 35 (P < 0.05). These results indicate that dietary supplementation with 0.5% FA has beneficial effects on growth performance, serum biochemical parameters and fecal microbiota of broiler chickens.",

Aspergillus nidulans, an ascomycete fungus that contains multiple AA9 LPMOs in the genome, offers an excellent model system to study their activity during the oxidative degradation of biomass. AN1602, a dual domain AA9-LPMO in A. nidulans appended with a carbohydrate-binding module, CBM1, was expressed in Pichia pastoris for analyzing oxidative cleavage on cellulosic substrates. The mass spectral and HPAEC analyses showed that the enzyme cleaves phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC) in the presence of a reducing agent, yielding a range of cello-oligosaccharides. In addition to the polymeric substrate cellulose, AN1602 is also active on soluble cellohexaose, a property that is restricted to only a few characterized LPMOs. Product analysis of AN1602 cleaved cellohexaose revealed that C4 was the sole site of oxidation. The sequence and predicted structure of the catalytic domain of AN1602 matched very closely to known C4 cellohexaose active enzymes.",

    "abstract": "The edible white rot fungus Lentinula edodes possesses a variety of lignin degrading enzymes such as manganese peroxidases and laccases. Laccases belong to the multicopper oxidases, which have a wide range of catalytic activities including polyphenol degradation and synthesis, lignin degradation, and melanin formation. The exact number of laccases in L. edodes is unknown, as are their complete properties and biological functions. We analyzed the draft genome sequence of L. edodes D703PP-9 and identified 13 multicopper oxidase-encoding genes; 11 laccases in sensu stricto, of which three are new, and two ferroxidases. lcc8, a laccase previously reported in L. edodes, was not identified in D703PP-9 genome. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 13 multicopper oxidases can be classified into laccase sensu stricto subfamily 1, laccase sensu stricto subfamily 2 and ferroxidases. From sequence similarities and expression patterns, laccase sensu stricto subfamily 1 can be divided into two subgroups. Laccase sensu stricto subfamily 1 group A members are mainly secreted from mycelia, while laccase sensu stricto subfamily 1 group B members are expressed mainly in fruiting bodies during growth or after harvesting but are lowly expressed in mycelia. Laccase sensu stricto subfamily 2 members are mainly expressed in mycelia, and two ferroxidases are mainly expressed in the fruiting body during growth or after harvesting, and are expressed at very low levels in mycelium. Our data suggests that L. edodes laccases in same group share expression patterns and would have common biological functions.",

    "abstract": "A novel strain of Pseudomonas putida LS46 was isolated from wastewater on the basis of its ability to synthesize medium chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates (mcl-PHAs). P.putida LS46 was differentiated from other P.putida strains on the basis of cpn60 (UT). The complete genome of P.putida LS46 was sequenced and annotated. Its chromosome is 5,86,2556 bp in size with GC ratio of 61.69. It is encoding 5316 genes, including 7 rRNA genes and 76 tRNA genes. Nucleotide sequence data of the complete P. putida LS46 genome was compared with nine other P. putida strains (KT2440, F1, BIRD-1, S16, ND6, DOT-T1E, UW4, W619 and GB-1) identified either as biocontrol agents or as bioremediation agents and isolated from different geographical region and different environment. BLASTn analysis of whole genome sequences of the ten P. putida strains revealed nucleotide sequence identities of 86.54 to 97.52%. P.putida genome arrangement was LS46 highly similar to P.putida BIRD1 and P.putida ND6 but was markedly different than P.putida DOT-T1E, P.putida UW4 and P.putida W619. Fatty acid biosynthesis (fab), fatty acid degradation (fad) and PHA synthesis genes were highly conserved among biocontrol and bioremediation P.putida strains. Six genes in pha operon of P. putida LS46 showed >98% homology at gene and proteins level. It appears that polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthesis is an intrinsic property of P. putida and was not affected by its geographic origin. However, all strains, including P. putida LS46, were different from one another on the basis of house keeping genes, and presence of plasmid, prophages, insertion sequence elements and genomic islands. While P. putida LS46 was not selected for plant growth promotion or bioremediation capacity, its genome also encoded genes for root colonization, pyoverdine synthesis, oxidative stress (present in other soil isolates), degradation of aromatic compounds, heavy metal resistance and nicotinic acid degradation, manganese (Mn II) oxidation. Genes for toluene or naphthalene degradation found in the genomes of P. putida F1, DOT-T1E, and ND6 were absent in the P. putida LS46 genome. Heavy metal resistant genes encoded by the P. putida W619 genome were also not present in the P. putida LS46 genome. Despite the overall similarity among genome of P.putida strains isolated for different applications and from different geographical location a number of differences were observed in genome arrangement, occurrence of transposon, genomic islands and prophage. It appears that P.putida strains had a common ancestor and by acquiring some specific genes by horizontal gene transfer it differed from other related strains.",

    "abstract": "The biosynthesis of poly(lactic acid) (PLA)-like polymers, composed of >99 mol% lactate and a trace amount of 3-hydroxybutyrate, in engineered Corynebacterium glutamicum consists of two steps; the generation of the monomer substrate lactyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and the polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase-catalyzed polymerization of lactyl-CoA. In order to increase polymer productivity, we explored the rate-limiting step in PLA-like polymer synthesis based on quantitative metabolite analysis using liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy (LC-MS). A significant pool of lactyl-CoA was found during polymer synthesis. This result suggested that the rate-limitation occurred at the polymerization step. Accordingly, the expression level of PHA synthase was increased by means of codon-optimization of the corresponding gene that consequently led to an increase in polymer content by 4.4-fold compared to the control. Notably, the codon-optimization did not significantly affect the concentration of lactyl-CoA, suggesting that the polymerization reaction was still the rate-limiting step upon the overexpression of PHA synthase. Another important finding was that the generation of lactyl-CoA was concomitant with a decrease in the acetyl-CoA level, indicating that acetyl-CoA served as a CoA donor for lactyl-CoA synthesis. These results show that obtaining information on the metabolite concentrations is highly useful for improving PLA-like polymer production. This strategy should be applicable to a wide range of PHA-producing systems.",

An analytical procedure for identification of p-benzoquinone (BQ) and 2,6-dimethoxybenzoquinone (DMBQ) in pretreated biomass was developed, and the inhibitory effects of BQ and DMBQ on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae were assessed. The benzoquinones were analyzed using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-triple quadrupole-mass spectrometry after derivatization with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine. Pretreatment liquids examined with regard to the presence of BQ and DMBQ originated from six different lignocellulosic feedstocks covering agricultural residues, hardwood, and softwood, and were produced through impregnation with sulfuric acid or sulfur dioxide at varying pretreatment temperature (165–204 °C) and residence time (6–20 min). BQ was detected in all six pretreatment liquids in concentrations ranging up to 6 mg/l, while DMBQ was detected in four pretreatment liquids in concentrations ranging up to 0.5 mg/l. The result indicates that benzoquinones are ubiquitous as by-products of acid pretreatment of lignocellulose, regardless of feedstock and pretreatment conditions. Fermentation experiments with BQ and DMBQ covered the concentration ranges 2 mg/l to 1 g/l and 20 mg/l to 1 g/l, respectively. Even the lowest BQ concentration tested (2 mg/l) was strongly inhibitory to yeast, while 20 mg/l DMBQ gave a slight negative effect on ethanol formation. This work shows that benzoquinones should be regarded as potent and widespread inhibitors in lignocellulosic hydrolysates, and that they warrant attention besides more well-studied inhibitory substances, such as aliphatic carboxylic acids, phenols, and furan aldehydes.",

Among the copper sulfides, chalcopyrite is the most abundant and therefore economically relevant. However, primary copper sulfide bioleaching is restricted due to high ionic strength raffinate solutions and particularly chloride coming from the dissolution of ores. In this work we describe the chalcopyrite bioleaching capacity of Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans strain Cutipay (DSM 27601) previously described at the genomic level (Travisany et al. (2012) Draft genome sequence of the Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans Cutipay strain, an indigenous bacterium isolated from a naturally extreme mining environment in Northern Chile. J Bacteriol 194:6327-6328). Bioleaching assays with the mixotrophic strain Cutipay showed a strong increase in copper recovery from chalcopyrite concentrate at 50°C in the presence of chloride ion, a relevant inhibitory element present in copper bioleaching processes. Compared to the abiotic control and a test with Sulfobacillus acidophilus DSM 10332, strain Cutipay showed an increase of 42 and 69% in copper recovery, respectively, demonstrating its high potential for chalcopyrite bioleaching. Moreover, a genomic comparison highlights the presence of the 2-Haloacid dehalogenase predicted-protein related to a potential new mechanism of chloride resistance in acidophiles.

Large scale industrial application of this enzyme is very limited owing to its high production costs. In the present study, cost effective production of tannase by Klebsiella pneumoniae KP715242 was studied under submerged fermentation using different tannin rich agro-residues like Indian gooseberry leaves (Phyllanthus emblica), Black plum leaves (Syzygium cumini), Eucalyptus leaves (Eucalyptus glogus) and Babul leaves (Acacia nilotica). Among all agro-residues, Indian gooseberry leaves were found to be the best substrate for tannase production under submerged fermentation. Sequential optimization approach using Taguchi orthogonal array screening and response surface methodology was adopted to optimize the fermentation variables in order to enhance the enzyme production. Eleven medium components were screened primarily by Taguchi orthogonal array design to identify the most contributing factors towards the enzyme production. The four most significant contributing variables affecting tannase production were found to be pH (23.62 %), tannin extract (20.70 %), temperature (20.33 %) and incubation time (14.99 %). These factors were further optimized with central composite design using response surface methodology. Maximum tannase production was observed at 5.52 pH, 39.72 °C temperature, 91.82 h of incubation time and 2.17 % tannin content. The enzyme activity was enhanced by 1.26 fold under these optimized conditions. The present study emphasizes the use of agro-residues as a potential substrate with an aim to lower down the input costs for tannase production so that the enzyme could be used proficiently for commercial purposes.",

Since xylose is not a natural substrate for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, recombinant S. cerevisiae strongly prefers glucose over xylose, and the fermentation rate and ethanol yield with xylose are both lower than those with glucose. To determine the molecular basis for glucose and xylose fermentation, we used microarrays to investigate the transcriptional difference of a xylose-utilizing industrial strain cultured in both single sugar media and a mixed sugar medium of glucose and xylose. The transcriptomes were nearly identical between glucose metabolizing cells in the glucose alone medium and those in the glucose fermentation phase in the mixed-sugar medium. Whereas the transcriptomes highly differed between the xylose metabolizing cells in the xylose alone medium and those in the xylose fermentation phase in the mixed sugar medium, and the differences mainly involved sulfur metabolism. When the transcriptional profiles were compared between glucose fermentation state and xylose fermentation state, we found the expression patterns of hexose transporters and glucose signaling pathway differed in response to different sugar sources, and the expression levels of the genes involved in gluconeogenesis, the glyoxylate and tricarboxylic acid cycles and respiration increased with xylose, indicating that the xylose-metabolizing cells had high requirements for maintenance energy and lacked the carbon catabolite repression capability.

    "abstract": "Elevated seawater temperature has altered the coupling between coastal primary production and heterotrophic bacterioplankton respiration. This shift, in turn, could influence the feedback of ocean ecosystem to climate warming. However, little is known about how natural bacterioplankton community responds to increasing seawater temperature. To investigate warming effects on the bacterioplankton community, we collected water samples from temperature gradients (ranged from 15.0 to 18.6 °C) created by a thermal flume of a coal power plant. The results showed that increasing temperatures significantly stimulated bacterial abundance, grazing rate, and altered bacterioplankton community compositions (BCCs). The spatial distribution of bacterioplankton community followed a distance similarity decay relationship, with a turnover of 0.005. A variance partitioning analysis showed that temperature directly constrained 2.01 % variation in BCCs, while temperature-induced changes in water geochemical and grazing rate indirectly accounted for 4.03 and 12.8 % of the community variance, respectively. Furthermore, the relative abundances of 24 bacterial families were linearly increased or decreased (P < 0.05 in all cases) with increasing temperatures. Notably, the change pattern for a given bacterial family was in concert with its known functions. In addition, community functional redundancy consistently decreased along the temperature gradient. This study demonstrates that elevated temperature, combined with substrate supply and trophic interactions, dramatically alters BCCs, concomitant with decreases in functional redundancy. The responses of sensitive assemblages are temperature dependent, which could indicate temperature departures.",

    "abstract": "Ecotoxicological implications of mercury (Hg) pollution of hydrosphere require effective Hg-removal strategies as antidote to the environmental problems. Mercury-tolerant yeasts, Yarrowia spp. Idd1 and Idd2 strains, were studied for intracellular accumulation and extracellular micro-precipitation of Hg during growth stage of the yeast strains. In a liquid medium containing 870 (±23.6) µg of bioavailable Hg2+, 419.0 µg Hg2+ (approx.) was taken up by the wet biomasses of the yeast strains after 48 h post-inoculation. Large portion of the adsorbed Hg was found in cell wall (approx. 49-83 %) and spheroplast (approx. 62-89 %). Negligible quantities of Hg were present in the mitochondria (0.02-0.02 %), and appreciable amount of Hg was observed in nuclei and cell debris (15.2-65.3 %) as evidence of bioaccumulation. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) produced by the growing Yarrowia cells was a complex of protein, carbohydrates and other substances, immobilizing 43.8 (±0.7)-58.7 (±1.0) % of initial Hg in medium as micro-precipitates, while 10.13 ± 0.4-39.2 ± 4.3 % Hg content was volatilized. Transmission electron microscopy coupled with X-ray energy dispersive spectrophotometry confirmed the cellular removal of Hg and formation of EPS-Hg complex colloids in the surrounding bulk solution as micro-precipitates in form of extracellular Hg-nanoparticles. Hg mass balance in the bio-sequestration experiment revealed excellent Hg removal (>97 %) from the medium (containing ≤16 μg ml-1 Hg2+) by the yeast strains via bioaccumulation, volatilization and micro-precipitation. The yeast strains are also effectively applicable in biological purification technology for Hg contaminated water because of their high self-aggregation activity and separatability from the aquatic environments. Graphical abstract Yarrowia species are oligotrophic marine yeasts that exhibited great potentials for mercuric ion remediation technologies, which are classified into four categories based on the process acting on the metal. These include immobilization through biosorption, compartmentation via bioaccumulation, separation from bulk solution via micro-precipitation upon EPS-Hg complex formation, and destruction that is a process to reduce the mercuric ion to metallic mercury.",

As such, various forms of adaptive responses towards extracellular trace metal ions are essential for the survival and fitness of bacteria in their environment. A soil Pseudomonas putida, strain S13.1.2 has been isolated from French vineyard soil samples, and shown to confer resistance to copper ions. Further investigation revealed a high capacity to tolerate elevated concentrations of various heavy metals including nickel, cobalt, cadmium, zinc and arsenic. The complete genome analysis was conducted using single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing and the genome consisted in a single chromosome at the size of 6.6 Mb. Presence of operons and gene clusters such as cop, cus, czc, nik, and asc systems were detected and accounted for the observed resistance phenotypes. The unique features in terms of specificity and arrangements of some genetic determinants were also highlighted in the study. Our findings has provided insights into the adaptation of this strain to accumulation and persistence of copper and other heavy metals in vineyard soil environment.",

Therefore, CB-like lipids (CBL, which are composed of POP, POS and SOS) are in great demand. Saccharomyces cerevisiae produces TAGs as storage lipids, which are also mainly composed of C16 and C18 fatty acids. However, POP, POS and SOS are not among the major TAG forms in yeast. TAG synthesis is mainly catalyzed by three enzymes: glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), lysophospholipid acyltransferase (LPAT) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT). In order to produce CBL in S. cerevisiae, we selected six cocoa genes encoding GPAT, LPAT and DGAT potentially responsible for CB biosynthesis from the cocoa genome using a phylogenetic analysis approach. By expressing the selected cocoa genes in S. cerevisiae, we successfully increased total fatty acid production, TAG production and CBL production in some S. cerevisiae strains. The relative CBL content in three yeast strains harboring cocoa genes increased 190, 230 and 196% over the control strain, respectively; especially, the potential SOS content of the three yeast strains increased 254, 476 and 354% over the control strain. Moreover, one of the three yeast strains had a 2.25-fold increased TAG content and 6.7-fold higher level of CBL compared with the control strain. In summary, CBL production by S. cerevisiae were increased through expressing selected cocoa genes potentially involved in CB biosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Rapidly developing industry raises concerns about the environmental impacts of nanoparticles, but the effects of inorganic nanoparticles on bacterial community in wastewater treatment remain unclear. The present research assessed the impact of cerium oxide nanoparticles (nCeO) on the microbiome of activated sludge system. The results showed that 18,330 over 28,201 reads generated from control samples were assigned to Proteobacteria while 5527 reads (19.6%), 3260 reads (11.567%), and 719 reads (2.55%) were assigned to unclassified_Bacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, respectively. When stressed with nCeO2 NPs, a decrease on reads was noted with 53, 48, 27.7 and 24% assigned to Proteobacteria. Gammaproteobacteria (80.57%) was found to be the most predominant Proteobacteria. The impact of nCeO2 NPs was also observed on pollutants removal as only 1.83 and 35.15% of phosphate and nitrate could be removed in the bioreactor stressed with 40 mg-nCeO2-NPs/L. This was confirmed by a drastic reduction of activities for enzymes catalysing denitrification (NaR and NiR) and degradation of polyphosphate (ADK and PPK). ADK appeared to be the most affected enzyme with activity decrease reaching over 90% when stressed with 10 mg-nCeO2/L. Furthermore, bacterial diversity was not significantly different whereas their species richness showed significant difference between control and treated samples. A large number of reads from control samples could not be classified down to the lower taxonomic level \"genera\" suggesting hitherto vast untapped microbial diversity. The denitrification related genera including Trichococcus and Acinetobacter were found to alternatively dominating treated samples highlighting those nCeO2 NPs could enhance the growth of some bacterial species while inhibiting those of others. Nevertheless, the study indicates that nCeO2 NPs in wastewater at very high concentrations may have some adverse effects on activated sludge process as they inhibit the removal of phosphate.",

Our results showed that, Firstly, the gut microbiota community comprised 21 phyla, 40 classes, 62 orders, 96 families, and 216 genera.

Secondly, the golden takin maintained higher richness in spring than in the winter while community diversity and evenness was not significantly different. Thirdly, four female golden takins demonstrated highly similar microbiota and the five golden takin males had relatively highly similar microbiota. All of our results might indicate that the fecal microbiota of golden takins were influenced by the season and the animal's sex. The findings provided theoretical basis regarding the gut microbiota of golden takins and may offer new insights to protect this endangered species.",

    "abstract": "During the transition period, fatty liver syndrome may be caused in cows undergo negative energy balance, ketosis or hypocalcemia, retained placenta or mastitis problems. During the transition stage, movement of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) increases into blood which declines the hepatic metabolism or reproduction and consequently, lactation performance of dairy cows deteriorates. Most of studies documented that, choline is an essential nutrient which plays a key role to decrease fatty liver, NEFA proportion, improve synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, maintain lactation or physiological function and work as anti-oxidant in the transition period of dairy cows. Also, it has a role in the regulation of homocysteine absorption through betaine metabolite which significantly improves plasma α-tocopherol and interaction among choline, methionine and vitamin E. Many studies reported that, supplementation of rumen protected form of choline during transition time is a sustainable method as rumen protected choline (RPC) perform diverse functions like, increase glucose level or energy balance, fertility or milk production, methyl group metabolism, or signaling of cell methionine expansion or methylation reactions, neurotransmitter synthesis or betaine methylation, increase transport of lipids or lipoproteins efficiency and reduce NEFA or triacylglycerol, clinical or sub clinical mastitis and general morbidity in the transition dairy cows. The purpose of this review is that to elucidate the choline importance and functions in the transition period of dairy cows and deal all morbidity during transition or lactation period. Furthermore, further work is needed to conduct more studies on RPC requirements in dairy cows ration under different feeding conditions and also to elucidate the genetic and molecular mechanisms of choline in ruminants industry.",

In this study, we employed two N-terminal signal peptides, PelB and DsbA, to direct a recombinant scFv antibody (single-chain variable fragment), 13R4, to the periplasm via the Sec and SRP pathways respectively. A design of experiments (DoE) approach was used to optimise process conditions (temperature, inducer concentration and induction point) influencing bacterial physiology and the productivity, solubility and location of scFv. The DoE study indicated that titre and subcellular location of the scFv depend on the temperature and inducer concentration employed, and also revealed the superiority of the PelB signal peptide over the DsbA signal peptide in terms of scFv solubility and cell physiology. Baffled shake flasks were subsequently used to optimise scFv production at higher biomass concentrations. Conditions that minimised stress (low temperature) were shown to be beneficial to production of periplasmic scFv. This study highlights the importance of signal peptide selection and process optimisation for the production of scFv antibodies, and demonstrates the utility of DoE for selection of optimal process parameters.",

The parasitic fungus Bjerkandera adusta Dec 1 was cultured in potato dextrose (PD) medium with or without alizarin. Alizarin was a good substrate for the dye-decolorizing peroxidase (DyP) from B. adusta Dec 1 and hampered B. adusta growth at the early stage of plate culture. During liquid shaking culture, DyP activity in cultures supplemented with 100 μM alizarin was greater than that in controls cultured without alizarin. In particular, DyP activity per dry cell mass increased approximately 3.5-, 3.1-, and 2.9-fold at 24, 30, and 36 h after inoculation, respectively, compared with control cultures. These data suggest that alizarin stimulates the expression of DyP. Interestingly, alizarin rapidly decomposed at an early stage in culture (24-42 h) in PD medium supplemented with 100 μM alizarin. Thus, alizarin appears to induce DyP expression in B. adusta Dec 1, and this DyP, in turn, rapidly degrades alizarin. Collectively, our findings suggest that the physiological role of DyP is to degrade antifungal compounds produced by plants.",

The experiment was assigned randomly into four treatments: (1) high protein diet (163.39 g/kg CP) without RPMet (HP); (2) low protein diet (146.33 g/kg CP) without RPMet (LP); (3) low protein diet, supplement with low RPMet (RPMet: 0.11 g/kg) (LPLMet); and (4) low protein diet, supplement with high RPMet (RPMet: 0.81 g/kg) (LPHMet), mixed with 20 g basal diet in each fermenter. Based on National Research Council (NRC) (Nutrient requirements of dairy cattle, National Academies Press, Washington, DC, 2001) recommendation for dairy ruminants HP diet was formulated as positive normal control and LP as a negative control. Results demonstrated that CP disappearance was found significantly higher (P < 0.05) in supplement groups compared with HP and found similar (P > 0.05) with LP. However, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and gross energy (GE) were found a parallel among supplement groups compared to HP and higher than LP. Furthermore, microbial crude protein, total and short chain fatty acids were found similar in LPHMet and HP and found significantly higher than LPLMet and LP. The R. albus population of LPHMet found parallel to HP and pointedly higher than LP in a solid and liquid fraction. Daily production of ammonia nitrogen, total gas, and methane were higher in HP than LP, LPLMet, and LPHMet. Overall, results concluded that values of digestibility, rumen fermentation, microbial crude protein, and R. albus population were similar of LPHMet to that of HP group. However, production of ammonia-N, total gas, and methane volume were significantly higher in the HP group than LPLMet, LPHMet, and LP groups.

    "abstract": "Abstract The microbial production of rhamnolipids has been in the focus of research for the last decades. Today, mainly heterologous production systems are targeted due to the advantage of non-pathogenic hosts as well as uncoupling from complex quorum sensing regulatory networks compared to their natural producer Pseudomonas aeruginosa . In the recent past, the presence and function of a ROSE-like RNA-thermometer located in the 5′UTR of the rhamnosyltransferase genes rhlAB has been reported in wild type P. aeruginosa . In this study, the temperature-induced regulation of this native RNA-thermometer for heterologous rhamnolipid production was evaluated and its potential application for process control is discussed. For this purpose, the non-pathogenic production host P. putida KT2440 containing the rhlAB genes with the native P. aeruginosa 5′-UTR region was used. The system was evaluated and characterized regarding the effect of temperature on growth and product formation, as represented by efficiency parameters and yields. Experimental data suggests a major effect of temperature on specific rhamnolipid production rates. With maximum values of 0.23 g/(g h) at 37 °C, this constitutes a more than 60% increase compared to the production rate of 0.14 g/(g h) at the growth optimum of 30 °C. Interestingly however, control experiments unveiled that besides the regulatory effect of the RNA-thermometer, multiple metabolic effects may contribute equally to the observed increase in production rate. As such, this work constitutes an important step towards the utilization of temperature-based process designs and enables the possibility for novel approaches for process control.",

Among Clostridia, this ability to degrade and metabolize a wide range of hemicellulose and pectin substrates is a unique feature; however, the mechanisms are currently unknown. To clarify the mechanisms of hemicelluloses and pectin recognition and metabolism, we carried out a quantitative proteome analysis of C. cellulovorans cultured with these substrates. C. cellulovorans was cultured in the medium of glucose (control), xylan, galactomannan (Locus bean gum, LBG), or pectin for 36 h. Xylan and galactomannan were used to search for the common recognition mechanisms of hemicellulose, and pectin was used to search for unique recognition systems in C. cellulovorans. Using an isobaric tag method and liquid chromatograph/mass spectrometer equipped with a long monolithic silica capillary column, we identified 734 intracellular proteins from all substrates. We performed KEGG analyses and cluster analyses of the resulting proteins. In the KEGG analyses, we found common degradation mechanisms for hemicellulose and pectin. In the cluster analysis corresponding to the genome analysis, we detected substrate-specific clusters that include genes involved in substrate recognition, substrate degradation, and metabolism. Combining the results of the KEGG analyses and cluster analyses, we propose the mechanisms involved in the recognition and metabolism of hemicellulose and pectin in C. cellulovorans.",

    "abstract": "Ustiloxin B, originally isolated from the fungus Ustilaginoidea virens, is a known inhibitor of microtubule assembly. Ustiloxin B is also produced by Aspergillus flavus and is synthesized through the ribosomal peptide synthesis pathway. In A. flavus, the gene cluster associated with ustiloxin B production contains 15 genes including those encoding a fungal C6-type transcription factor and ustiloxin B precursor. Although the koji mold Aspergillus oryzae, which is genetically close to A. flavus, has the corresponding gene cluster, it does not produce ustiloxin B, which may be explained by the fact that the gene encoding the transcription factor UstR is not expressed. Here, to investigate whether ustiloxin B can be produced by expressing ustR in A. oryzae, we constructed ustR expression (ustR EX) strains and analyzed ustiloxin B production. In the ustR EX strains, all genes in the cluster were up-regulated, in line with expression of ustR, and ustiloxin B produced. To elucidate whether the KexB protease is involved in the processing of the ustiloxin B precursor protein UstA, which has repeats of basic amino acid doublets resembling KexB target sites, we also constructed a ustR EX strain with the ∆kexB genotype. Although ustR was expressed in this strain, ustiloxin B was barely detectable. This finding strongly suggests that KexB is required for ustiloxin B production.",

In UVB-irradiated human fibroblast cells, gallic acid glucoside lowered matrix metalloproteinase-1 levels and increased the collagen content, which was indicative of a stronger anti-aging effect than that of gallic acid or arbutin. These results indicated that gallic acid glucoside is likely a superior cosmetic ingredient with skin-whitening and anti-aging functions.",

Little is known about gene expression or the physiology of I. orientalis under ethanol stress. In this study, high-throughput RNA sequencing was used to investigate the transcriptome profile of I. orientalis in response to ethanol. 502 gene transcripts were differentially expressed, of which 451 were more abundant, and 51 less abundant, in cells subjected to 4 h of ethanol stress (10% v/v). Annotation and statistical analyses suggest that multiple genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis, trehalose metabolism, and stress response are differentially expressed under these conditions. The up-regulation of molecular chaperones HSP90 and HSP70, and also genes associated with the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway suggests that ethanol stress may cause aggregation of misfolded proteins. Finally, ethanol stress in I. orientalis appears to have a nitrogen starvation effect, and many genes involved in nutrient uptake were up-regulated.",

    "abstract": "The adverse effects of antibiotics have attracted widespread attention, thus reducing the use of antibiotics in animal feed has become a very important issue in improving of the health of livestock. The effects of Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium) on growth performance and gut microbiota in weaned piglets were investigated in the present study. Piglets were randomly assigned to four treatments: a control group fed with a diet containing 75 mg/kg aureomycin (Diet 1 group) and three experimental groups fed with diets of 50 mg/kg aureomycin (Diet 2 group), 50 mg/kg aureomycin + 9 × 105 CFU/g E. faecium (Diet 3 group), or 50 mg/kg aureomycin + 1.2 × 106 CFU/g E. faecium (Diet 4 group). Their gut microbial communities were analyzed by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the 16SrRNA gene. The results showed that the final body weights and the average daily gain of the weaned piglets in the Diet 2 group were higher (P = 0.05) than those in the Diet 1 or Diet 3 group. Decreasing trends (P = 0.08) was observed in mortality rate in the Diet 3 and 4 group when compared with that in the Diet 1 group. Increases in the Sobs, Chao1, ACE, and Shannon indexes and a decrease in the Simpson index were observed at intervals from day 1 to 14 (P < 0.05). The Sobs, Chao1, and ACE indexes in the Diet 3 group were the lowest on day 14 (P < 0.05). The abundance of Bacteroidetes was increased and that of Proteobacteria was decreased from day 1 to 7, but both of them kept stable from day 7 to 14. Besides, the lowest abundance of Fusobacteria, Lentisphaerae, and Planctomycetes was observed on day 1 and the lowest abundance of Actinobacteria was observed on day 14 in the Diet 3 group (P < 0.05). Overall, these results suggest that the antibiotics and E. faecium interventions result in different changes in the gut microbiota, and a reduced antibiotics diet supplemented with 1.2 × 106 CFU/g E. faecium does not affect the growth performance in weaned piglets.",

XylCMS proved to be a GH11 xylanase with high identity to a hypothetical glycosyl hydrolase from Ruminococcus flavefaciens. XylCMS with a molecular weight of about 47 kDa showed maximum activity at pH 6 and 55 °C. The enzyme activity was significantly stimulated by NaCl in 1-5 M concentrations. Interestingly, the optimum temperature was not influenced by NaCl but the Kcat of the enzyme was enhanced by 2.7-folds at 37 °C and 1.2-folds at 55 °C. The Km value was decreased with NaCl by 4.3-folds at 37 °C and 3.7-folds at 55 °C resulting in a significant increase in catalytic efficiency (Kcat/Km) by 11.5-folds at 37 °C and 4.4-folds at 55 °C. Thermodynamic analysis indicated that the activation energy (Ea) and enthalpy (∆H) of the reaction were decreased with NaCl by 2.4 and threefold, respectively. From the observations and the results of fluorescence spectroscopy, it was concluded that NaCl at high concentrations improves both the flexibility and substrate affinity of XylCMS that are crucial for catalytic activity by influencing substrate binding, product release and the energy barriers of the reaction. XylCMS as an extreme halophilic xylanase with stimulated activity in artificial seawater and low water activity conditions has potentials for application in industrial biotechnology.",

The aqueous extract of Berberis aristata root bark displayed broad spectrum activity against 13 test pathogens, ranging from 12 to 25 mm. In classical optimization, 15% concentration prepared at 40 °C for 40 min was optimal and thermostable. Statistical optimization enhanced the activity by 1.13-1.30-folds. Ethyl acetate was the best organic solvent to elute out the potential compound responsible for antimicrobial activity. Diterpenes were the most abundant phytoconstituent (15.3%) and showed broad spectrum antimicrobial activity ranging from 16.66 to 42.66 mm. Ethyl acetate extract displayed the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (0.05-1 mg/mL), followed by diterpenes (0.05-5 mg/mL) and flavonoids (0.05-10 mg/mL). The test extracts were microbicidal in nature and showed a prolonged post antibiotic effect ranging from 2 to 8 h. They were found to be biosafe as per Ames and MTT assay. The in vitro cytotoxicity evaluation of diterpenes against L20B, RD and Hep 2 cell lines revealed its IC50 ranging from 245 to 473 µg/mL. Acute oral toxicity of diterpenes on Swiss albino mice did not show any changes in behavioral pattern, body weight, biochemical parameters as well as organs' architecture. The study thus indicates B. aristata could be a potential candidate for development of potent drug owing to its antimicrobial potential and biosafe profile.",

In vivo, PEDV-infected piglets supplemented with air-dried solid state fermentative cultivate containing B. licheniformis-fermented products (BLFP) showed milder clinical symptoms and decreased viral shedding. Importantly, no significant systemic pathological lesions and no reduction in average daily gain were noted in pigs supplemented with the BLFP, which suggests that it is safe for use in pigs. In vitro experiments revealed that while B. licheniformis crude extracts exhibited no toxicity in Vero cells, co-cultivation of B. licheniformis crude extracts with PEDV significantly reduced viral infection and replication. Summarized current results suggest that the B. licheniformis-fermented products could be a novel candidate food additive for reducing the impact of PED on the swine industry.",

In this study we determined the effect of goethite, hematite, magnetite and ferrihydrite on the transformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) by Yarrowia lipolytica AN-L15. The presence of ferric (oxyhydr)oxides led to a small decrease in the rate of TNT removal. In all cases, a significant release of NO2 (-) from TNT and further NO2 (-) oxidation to NO3 (-) was observed. A fraction of the released NO2 (-) was abiotically decomposed to NO and NO2, and then NO was likely oxidized abiotically to NO2 by O2. ESR analysis revealed the generation of superoxide in the culture medium; its further protonation at low pH resulted in the formation of hydroperoxyl radical. Presumably, a fraction of NO released during TNT degradation reacted with superoxide and formed peroxynitrite, which was further rearranged to NO3 (-) at the acidic pH values observed in this study. A transformation and reduction of ferric (oxyhydr)oxides followed by partial dissolution (in the range of 7-86% of the initial Fe(III)) were observed in the presence of cells and TNT. Mössbauer spectroscopy showed some minor changes for goethite, magnetite and ferrihydrite samples during their incubation with Y. lipolytica and TNT. This study shows that i) reactive oxygen and nitrogen species generated during TNT transformation by Y. lipolytica participate in the abiotic conversion of TNT and ii) the presence of iron(III) minerals leads to a minor decrease in TNT transformation.",

Here, we investigated the possibilities of finding the best media for high cell density fermentation, by analyzing different media samples, focusing on improving fermentation techniques and recombinant protein production. Initial fermentation of E. coli BL21 DE3:pAV01 in baffled flasks showed that high cell density was achieved when using complex media, Luria–Bertani (LB) and Terrific medium broth (TB) (10 and 14 g/L wet weight, respectively), as compared to mineral media M9, modified minimal medium (MMM) and Riesenberg mineral medium (RM) (7, 8 and 7 g/L, respectively). However, in fed-batch fermentation processes when using MMM after 25 h cultivation, it was possible to yield an optical density (OD600) of 139 corresponding to 172 g/L of wet biomass was produced in a 30 L TV Techfors-S Infors HT fermenter, with a computer controlled nutrient supply (glucose as a carbon source) delivery system, indicating nearly 1.5 times that obtained from TB. Upon purification, a total of 1.65 mg/g of protein per gram cell biomass was obtained and the purified AviPure showed affinity for immunoglobulin. High cell density fed batch fermentation was achieved by selecting the best media and growth conditions, by utilizing a number of fermentation parameters like media, fermentation conditions, chemical concentrations, pO2 level, stirrer speed, pH level and feed media addition. It is possible to reach cell densities higher than shake flasks and stirred tank reactors with the improved oxygen transfer rate and feed.",

    "abstract": "Clean coal technologies (e.g. coal biosolubilization) are of essential value, especially in Europe, where coal is the national wealth and other energy sources like crude oil are not available. Fusarium oxysporum LOCK 1134, the strain isolated from brown coal, efficiently biosolubilizes lignite. The obtained liquefied products contain 50% less sulfur and over 99% less mercury than the crude coal. Moreover, the liquefied coal can be modified further by laccase. In this study F. oxysporum laccase was expressed in Pichia pastoris for the first time and was assessed as an additional agent for coal degradation. The novel laccase contributes to humic and fulvic acids release from liquefied coal due to introduction of oxygen into coal structure. The effect is increased when a natural redox mediator, sinapic acid, is present in the reaction mixture-up to 30% and 80% respectively. Humic acids obtained by biological process are environmentally friendly fertilizers that may have stimulating effects on crop growth.",

However, it is unclear whether and what extend Baimang disease alters the intestinal microbiota in mud crab (Scylla paramamosain). Here, we conducted intestinal contents Illumina sequencing of healthy and Baimang diseased mud crab (S. paramamosain) to understand bacterial community variations among health status. In addition, bacterial functional predication was used to investigate whether and how the bacteria variations further change their functions? The phyla of Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Tenericutes, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Spirochaetae constituted over 96.44% of the total intestinal bacteria, with being the dominant taxa. The 7 most significantly different orders, including the increased four orders of Clostridiales, Entomoplasmatales, Bacteroidales, and Mycoplasmatales and the decreased three orders of Vibrionales, Campylobacterales, and Fusobacteriales, accounted for 61.14% dissimilarity, probably being the indicator taxa of Baimang disease. Accordingly, 12 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes orthologies in level 3 shifted significantly at the diseased crabs. Especially, bacterial secretion system, secretion system, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis proteins and Vibrio cholerae pathogenic cycle, being related to bacterial virulence, were reduced. In addition, the reduced butanoate metabolism, and induced methane metabolism and one carbon pool by folate were important metabolic processes of probiotic, such as Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp., with playing critical roles in host health. This study suggests that Baimang disease coupled altered the intestinal bacterial communities and functions, providing timely information for further analysis the influencing mechanism of Baimang disease in mud crab (S. paramamosain).",

However, it is not known whether coix seed improves post-weaning growth performance and productivity, and the mechanism of interaction between coix seed and gut microbiota remains unknown. In this study, we established four groups: (i) control, (ii) antibiotic-fed, (iii) coix seed powder-fed, and (iv) coix seed extract-fed. The feeding experiment was conducted for 4 weeks. Coix seed extract significantly increased average weight gain and reduced the feed/meat ratio in weaned pigs, in addition to reducing the pH of their gastric juice. Further assays demonstrated that coix seed promotes an increase in the density and length of the gastrointestinal villi. Next, 16s sequencing of gut microbiota showed that coix seed significantly increased the abundance of phylum Bacteroidetes and genus Lactobacillus (p < 0.05) and reduced the abundance of phylum Prevotella (p < 0.05) in the gut microbiota. In contrast, the abundance of phylum Bacteroidetes and genus Lactobacillus decreased in the control group and antibiotic group, whereas the abundance of phylum Prevotella increased. Our findings indicate that coix seed improves growth performance and productivity in post-weaning pigs by reducing the pH value of gastric juice, increasing the density and length of gastrointestinal villi, and modulating gut microbiota. Thus, coix seed has good potential for use as a feed supplement in swine production.",

Then, we examined the alginolytic effects of CZBC1 (concentrations 103-106 colony forming units (cfu)/mL) on these three species (concentrations 103-106 cells/mL) to determine the effective concentrations of CZBC1 for Oscillatoria spp. alginolysis.

When the initial concentration of CZBC1 was lower (103 cfu/mL), its inhibitory effects were delayed by 2-5 days, but the cell counts were significantly decreased compared with the control, evidencing significant alginolysis. In addition, the higher the concentration of the algicidal bacteria suspension, the more significant the alginolytic effects. Our results indicate that CZBC1 has different alginolytic mechanisms for O. chlorina, O. tenuis, and O. planctonica, and that different initial concentrations of CZBC1 have different alginolytic effects on these algal species.",

The pathogenicity and virulence against the two species of mosquitoes were evaluated by using 30 isolates of Beauveria bassiana , an entomopathogenic fungus isolated from Korea that has high thermotolerance and UV-B tolerance. Regarding pathogenicity, 23 isolates were pathogenic to Ae. albopictus and 12 isolates were pathogenic to Cx. pipiens ; Ae. albopictus adults were more susceptible to B. bassiana than Cx. pipiens adults. Among the isolates, 6 isolates that were simultaneously pathogenic to the two species of mosquitoes were used to evaluate virulence and conidia productivity. B. bassiana CN6T1W2 and JN5R1W1 had higher virulence than the other isolates, and they were more virulent in Ae. albopictus than in Cx. pipiens . The conidia productivity of B. bassiana JN5R1W1 on millet grain medium was higher than that of B. bassiana CN6T1W2. Based on these results, B. bassiana JN5R1W1 was selected as the most efficient isolate for the simultaneous control of the two mosquito species. B. bassiana JN5R1W1 can be used effectively in the development of fungal insecticides to simultaneously control Ae. albopictus and Cx. pipiens adults with similar distribution areas.",

Furthermore, both the accessibility and activity of the displayed proteins are affected by the length of anchor proteins. The ideal promoter, secretion signal, and anchor protein combination depend on the proteins of interest. In this study, we optimized a yeast surface display suitable for nanobody evaluation. We designed five display systems that used different combinations of promoters, secretion signals, and anchor proteins. Anti-hen egg-white lysozyme nanobody was used as the model nanobody. The amount of nanobodies displayed on yeast cells, the number of antigens bound to the displayed nanobodies, and the display efficiency were quantified. Overall, we improved the yeast display system for nanobody engineering and proposed its optimization.",

The impressive efficacy exhibited by T-DM1 has heightened the need for more further studies on the underlying mechanisms of T-DM1 cytotoxicity. Previous research suggested that autophagy was crucial for cancer therapy, but the role of autophagy in T-DM1 treatment has not been investigated. Here, we demonstrated for the first time that T-DM1 triggered obvious autophagy in HER2-positive SK-BR-3 and BT-474 breast cancer cells. Blocking autophagy with pharmacological inhibitors chloroquine (CQ) or LY294002 partly reduced T-DM1-induced apoptosis and Caspase-3/7 activation, suggesting that autophagy played an essential role in the cytotoxicity induced by T-DM1 in HER2-positive breast cancer cells. Further investigation demonstrated that Akt/mTOR signaling pathway was involved in T-DM1-induced autophagy in a time-dependent manner. Altogether, our results highlighted the important role of autophagy as a novel mechanism for T-DM1-induced cytotoxicity and elucidated the critical relationships between T-DM1-induced autophagy and apoptosis in human HER2-positive breast cancer cells, which provides novel insight into the underlying anti-tumor mechanism of T-DM1.",

However, the poor permeability of the macromolecules across the blood-brain barrier, determined by multifactorial anatomical and physiological milieu, restricts the clinical therapeutic effect of bevacizumab. The low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 (LRP1) is highly expressed in the endothelial cells of the brain capillary and the glioma cells. Angiopep-2 (ANG) is a 19-aa oligopeptide that can bind to LRP1 and penetrate the blood-brain barrier by receptor-mediated transport. Therefore, ANG can be used as a dual-targeting drug delivery carrier into the brain and the glioma sites. In this study, ANG gene was fused with the C-terminal domain of single-chain antigen binding fragment (scFab) of the anti-VEGF antibody and recombinant scFab-ANG protein was expressed and purified using Rosatte (DE3) strain. We confirmed that ANG could carry anti-VEGF-scFab, penetrate a three-dimensional model of the brain tumor, and cross the hCMEC/D3 monolayer in the in vitro blood-brain barrier model. The animal experiments demonstrated that 3 h after the tail intravenous protein injection, the fluorescent signals in the brains of the mice in the scFab-ANG group were stronger than that in the scFab group. Furthermore, the study of the in situ rat glioma model shows that scFab-ANG could target glioma while anti-VEGF-scFab could not. These findings indicate that scFab-ANG had stronger transepithelial permeability and glioma targeting capacity. Thus, it can be a potential candidate drug for glioblastoma therapy.",

Additional genome-wide analysis of CS1801 was also performed to explore the genomic basis for chitin degradation. The results showed that CS1801 possesses a chromosome with 5,611,479 bp (73% GC) and a plasmid with 1,388,284 bp (73% GC). The CS1801 genome consists of 7584 protein-coding genes, 90 tRNA and 21 rRNA operons. In addition, the results of genomic CAZyme analysis indicated that CS1801 comprises 103 glycoside hydrolase family genes, which could regulate the glycoside hydrolases that contribute to chitin degradation. The whole-genome information of CS1801 could highlight the mechanism underlying the chitin degradation activity of CS1801, strongly indicating that CS1801 is characterized by a substantial number of genes encoding chitinases and the complete metabolic pathway of chitin, conferring CS1801 with promising potential applicability in chitooligosaccharide production.",

Scirpus triqueter L.) from a eutrophic wetland. High-throughput sequencing of pmo A based on DNA and cDNA was used to analyze the methanotrophic community. Sequencing of cDNA pmo A amplicons confirmed that the structure of active methanotrophic was not always consistent with DNA. A type I methanotroph, Methylomonas , was the most active group in P. australis , whereas Methylocystis, a type II methanotroph, was the dominant group in S. triqueter . In T. angustifolia , these two types of methanotroph existed in similar proportions. However, at the DNA level, Methylomonas was predominant in the roots of all three plants. In addition, vegetation type could have a profound impact on root-associated methanotrophic community at both DNA and cDNA levels. These results indicate that members of the genera Methylomonas (type I) and Methylocystis (type II) can significantly contribute to aerobic methane oxidation in a eutrophic wetland.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Pullulanase is an important starch-debranching enzyme mostly used in starch processing-related food industries. However, the levels of pullulanase produced from recombinant Bacillus subtilis , a Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) host, are generally limited. To enhance the activity of pullulanase, batch fermentation and fed-batch fermentation were systematically investigated. The overall purpose is to improve the fermentation yield by optimizing the feeding strategy in the fermentation process, thereby increasing the enzyme activity of pullulanase. Therefore, in this study, the feeding methods, the feeding ingredients, the feeding concentration, and pH values were studied in detail. The optimized fermentation conditions for pullulanase production from recombinant B. subtilis were determined as following: inoculum volume 7%, pH 6.5, the dissolved oxygen level 30%, and constant-rate feeding of 100 mL glucose solution (400 g L −1 ) in late logarithmic growth. The OD 600 of recombinant B. subtilis and enzyme activity were 84.54 and 102.75 U mL −1 , which were respectively 141% and 144% higher than that before optimization. These findings provided a prerequisite for further amplification of the fermentation system to obtain higher enzyme activity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The fungal kingdom has been widely studied as a source of bioactive compounds of interest to the pharmaceutical and food industry. This paper studies the production of natural red pigments by Fusarium solani BRM054066 in the submerged fermentation system, using Doehlert experimental design to determine optimal cultivation conditions. The chemical composition of the red pigment was determined by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS). Antioxidant activity was assessed by the ability to sequester of free radical DPPH. In the analysis of anti-inflammatory activity, murine peritoneal macrophages activated by LPS were used, and the gene expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-17 was determined using qPCR. As a result, it was found that agitation at 200 rpm and glucose concentration ≥ 20 g/L promote the best results in the production of red pigment. The chemical compounds identified were two naphthoquinones, fusarubin and dihydrofusarubin, and an anthraquinone, a bostrycoidin, being fusarubin the majority compound. The red pigment showed antioxidant activity by scavenge 50% of the DPPH radical, in a concentration of 24 µg/mL. The pigment also showed an effective anti-inflammatory capacity by reducing the overexpression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 and promoting the production of anti-inflammatory IL-10 and IL-17, in murine macrophages activated by LPS (p &lt; 0.05). According to the results, the fungus F. solani BRM054066, under optimized conditions of cultivation, proved to be a promising source of biologically active natural pigments with wide industrial applicability.",

The dominant phyla Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were decreased ( P ≤ 0.01) with lactating progress and phyla Bacteroidetes were increased ( P = 0.008) with lactating progress and dietary transition. At family level, the predominant families were Ruminococcaceae (35.23%), Lachnospiraceae (11.46%), Rikenellaceae (10.44%) and Prevotellaceae (6.89%). A total of 14 genera were different between fecal samples from Fresh1d and Fresh14d, included the predominant genera, such as Ruminococcaceae_UCG - 005 ( P = 0.008), Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group ( P = 0.043) and Christensenellaceae_R - 7_group ( P = 0.008). All fecal bacterial communities shared members of the genera Ruminococcaceae_UCG - 005 , Bacteroides and Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group . These findings help to improve our understanding of the composition and structure of the fecal microbial community in fresh cows and may provide insight into bacterial adaptation time and dietary in lactating cows.",

In this study, a dual selection system was designed to tune the binding specificity of a transcription factor to a particular ligand with the ampicillin resistance gene amp (ON selection) as the positive selection marker and the levansucrase gene sacB (OFF selection) as the negative selection marker. It was applied to the lead responsive transcription factor PbrR in a whole-cell lead biosensor previously constructed in our lab (Jia et al. in Fems Microbiol Lett 365:fny157, 2018). After multiple rounds of ON-OFF selection, two mutants with higher specificity for lead were selected. Structural analysis revealed that the mutation C134 located on the metal-binding loop at the C-terminal of PbrR is likely associated with the enhanced binding to both lead and cadmium. The double mutations D64A and L68S close to the metal-binding residue C79 may lead to the reduced binding specificity toward zinc ions. This dual selection system can be applied to engineer the specificity of other transcription factors and provide fine-tuned tools to synthetic biology.",

The use of human drug metabolites as authentic standards to evaluate their toxicity is essential for drug development. However, the chemical synthesis of 4-OH-CPA is complex and leads to only low yields and undesired side products. In past years, fungal unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) have raised to powerful biocatalysts. They can exert the identical selective oxyfunctionalization of organic compounds and drugs as known for CYP enzymes with hydrogen peroxide being used as sole cosubstrate. Herein, we report the efficient enzymatic hydroxylation of CPA using the unspecific peroxygenase from Marasmius rotula (MroUPO) in a simple reaction design. Depending on the conditions used the primary liver metabolite 4-OH-CPA, its tautomer aldophosphamide (APA) and the overoxidized product 4-ketocyclophosphamide (4-keto-CPA) could be obtained. Using a kinetically controlled approach 4-OH-CPA was isolated with a yield of 32% (purity > 97.6%). Two human cancer cell lines (HepG2 and MCF-7) were treated with purified 4-OH-CPA produced by MroUPO (4-OH-CPAUPO). 4-OH-CPAUPO-induced cytotoxicity as measured by a luminescent cell viability assay and its genotoxicity as measured by γH2AX foci formation was not significantly different to the commercially available standard. The high yield of 4-OH-CPAUPO and its biological activity demonstrate that UPOs can be efficiently used to produce CYP-specific drug metabolites for pharmacological assessment.",

However, investigations of different Centaurea calcitrapa L. extracts in terms of cytotoxicity and antimicrobial activity against phytopathogens are generally scarce. The phenolic profile and broad antimicrobial activity (especially towards bacterial phytopathogens) of methanol (MeOH), 70% ethanol (EtOH), ethyl-acetate (EtOAc), 50% acetone (Me 2 CO) and dichloromethane: methanol (DCM: MeOH, 1: 1) extracts of C. calcitrapa leaves and their potential toxicity on MRC-5 cell line were investigated for the first time. A total of 55 phenolic compounds were identified: 30 phenolic acids and their derivatives, 25 flavonoid glycosides and aglycones. This is also the first report of the presence of centaureidin, jaceidin, kaempferide, nepetin, flavonoid glycosides, phenolic acids and their esters in C. calcitrapa extracts. The best results were obtained with EtOAc extract with lowest MIC values expressed in µg/mL ranging from 13 to 25, while methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus was the most susceptible strain. The most susceptible phytopathogens were Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae , Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris and Agrobacterium tumefaciens . The highest cytotoxicity was recorded for EtOAc and Me 2 CO extracts with the lowest relative and absolute IC 50 values between 88 and 102 µg/mL, while EtOH extract was the least toxic with predicted relative IC 50 value of 1578 µg/mL. Our results indicate that all tested extracts at concentration considered as non-toxic can be one of great importance in combat towards phytopathogenic and human pathogenic strains, as well as natural sources of antimicrobials.",

Sixteen heifers (8-month-old, 220 ± 30 kg) were randomly divided into four treatments according to different BPS substitution ratios of feed basis (0%, 25%, 50%, and 75%). The experiment consisted of a 7-day preliminary feeding period and a 30-day experimental period.

Agricultural by-products and oyster shells were used to produce economical bio-concrete. Sesame meal was the optimal agricultural by-product for low-cost spore production of the alkaliphilic Bacillus miscanthi strain AK13. Transcriptomic dataset was utilized to compare the gene expressions of AK13 strain under neutral and alkaline conditions, which suggested that NaCl and riboflavin could be chosen as growth-promoting factors at alkaline pH. The optimal levels of sesame meal, NaCl, and riboflavin were induced with the central composite design to create an economical medium, in which AK13 strain formed more spores with less price than in commercial sporulation medium. Calcium nitrate obtained from nitric acid treatment of oyster shell powder increased the initial compressive strength of cement mortar. Non-ureolytic calcium carbonate precipitation by AK13 using oyster shell-derived calcium ions was verified by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis. Stereomicroscope and field emission scanning electron microscopy confirmed that oyster shell-derived calcium ions, along with soybean meal-solution, increased the bacterial survival and calcium carbonate precipitation inside mortar cracks. These data suggest the possibility of commercializing bacterial self-healing concrete with economical substitutes for culture medium, growth nutrient, and calcium sources.",

A total of 49 biomarkers with statistical differences were detected in the four growth stages. The different microbiota among groups enhanced the ability to degrade fiber, carbohydrates, and other substances during the growth stages. The endocrine system was different in multiple growth stage paired comparisons, which was attributed to the different body statuses in the growth stages.

This features caused to oil recovery, lubrication and facilities of crude oil in pipeline. In current research Biosurfactant-producing strain was isolated from the storage tanks of the Isfahan Oil Refining Company in Iran, and screened by oil expansion test, droplet collapse, and surface tension reduction measurement. Hydrocarbon recovery from crude oil sludge was measured under constant conditions. The effect of factoring biosource lubrication on crude oil in pipelines was investigated in vitro. Also, the optimization of biosurfactant production in different conditions was measured as a single factor and using Response Surface Method (RSM). The best biosurfactant-producing bacterium was identified as Kocuria rosea ABR6, and its sequence was registered in the gene bank with access number of MK100469. Chemical analysis proved that the produced biosurfactant was a lipopeptide. 7% of crude oil was recovered from petroleum sludge by biosurfactant obtained from Kocuria rosea ABR6. Also, the speed of crude oil transfer in pipelines was upgraded as it could be said that for a certain distance the transfer time reduced from 64 to 35 s. The highest biosurfactant production was measured at pH 9, aeration rate of 120 rpm and 96 h after incubation. The use of biosurfactants produced by Kocuria rosea ABR6 is recommended to remove oil sludge and lubricate oil in pipelines recommended in the oil industry.",

    "abstract": "Globally, the reserves of heavy crude oil are seven times more abundant than that of light crude, and yet, they are underutilized because of their high viscosity and density, which is largely due to the presence of large amounts of asphaltenes. Biotransformation of heavy oil asphaltenes into smaller metabolites can be used for reducing their viscosity. Several microorganisms capable of asphaltene biodegradation have been reported but only few have been characterized for its biotransformation. In the present study, a 9-membered microbial consortium was isolated from an oil contaminated soil. About 72% and 75% asphaltene biotransformation was achieved by growing cells at shake flask level and in a 1.5 l bioreactor, respectively. A representative structure of asphaltene was constructed based on LC–MS, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, FT-IR, ICPMS and elemental analysis (CHNS) of n-heptane purified asphaltene from Maya crude oil. Biotransformation of asphaltene, as analyzed by performing 1H-NMR, FT-IR and elemental analysis, resulted in 80% decrease in S and N when compared to the control along with incorporation of oxygen in the structure of asphaltene. About 91% decrease in the viscosity of the Maya crude oil was observed after two weeks when oil: aqueous phase ratio was 1:9. The results suggest that the isolated microbial consortium can be used for biological upgradation of heavy crude oil. To our knowledge, this is the first report where a microbial consortium resulted in such high asphaltene biotransformation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Here, we report and discuss the applicability of Variovorax paradoxus strain BFB1_13 in the bioremediation of BTEX contaminated sites. Strain BFB1_13 was capable of degrading all the six BTEX-compounds under both aerobic (O 2 conc. 8 mg l −1 ) and micro-aerobic/oxygen-limited (O 2 conc. 0.5 mg l −1 ) conditions using either individual (8 mg‧l −1 ) or a mixture of compounds (~ 1.3 mg‧l −1 of each BTEX compound). The BTEX biodegradation capability of SBP-encapsulated cultures (SBP—Small Bioreactor Platform) was also assessed. The fastest degradation rate was observed in the case of aerobic benzene biodegradation (8 mg l −1 per 90 h). Complete biodegradation of other BTEX occurred after at least 168 h of incubation, irrespective of the oxygenation and encapsulation. No statistically significant difference was observed between aerobic and microaerobic BTEX biodegradation. Genes involved in BTEX biodegradation were annotated and degradation pathways were predicted based on whole-genome shotgun sequencing and metabolic analysis. We conclude that V. paradoxus strain BFB1_13 could be used for the development of reactive biobarriers for the containment and in situ decontamination of BTEX contaminated groundwater plumes. Our results suggest that V. paradoxus strain BFB1_13—alone or in co-culture with other BTEX degrading bacterial isolates—can be a new and efficient commercial bioremediation agent for BTEX contaminated sites.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Xylanases are widely used enzymes in the food, textile, and paper industries. Most efficient xylanases have been identified from lignocellulose-degrading microbiota, such as the microbiota of the cow rumen and the termite hindgut. Xylanase genes from efficient pulp and paper wastewater treatment (PPWT) microbiota have been previously recovered by metagenomics, assigning most of the xylanase genes to the GH10 family. In this study, a total of 40 GH10 family xylanase genes derived from a certain PPWT microbiota were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Among these xylanase genes, 14 showed xylanase activity on beechwood substrate. Two of these, PW-xyl9 and PW-xyl37, showed high activities, and were purified to evaluate their xylanase properties. Values of optimal pH and temperature for PW-xyl9 were pH 7 and 60 ℃, respectively, while those for PW-xyl37 were pH 7 and 55 ℃, respectively; their specific xylanase activities under optimal conditions were 470.1 U/mg protein and 113.7 U/mg protein, respectively. Furthermore, the Km values of PW-xyl9 and PW-xyl37 were determined as 8.02 and 18.8 g/L, respectively. The characterization of these two xylanases paves the way for potential application in future pulp and paper production and other industries, indicating that PPWT microbiota has been an undiscovered reservoir of efficient lignocellulase genes. This study demonstrates that a metagenomic approach has the potential to screen efficient xylanases of uncultured microorganisms from lignocellulose-degrading microbiota. In a similar way, other efficient lignocellulase genes might be identified from PPWT treatment microbiota in the future.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cereal feedstocks have high arabinoxylan content as their main hemicellulose, which is linked to lignin by hydroxycinnamic acids such as ferulic acid. The ferulic acid is linked to arabinoxylan by ester bonds, and generally, the high substitution of ferulic acid leads to a loss of activity of xylanases targeting the arabinoxylan. In the current study, a feruloyl esterase (FAE-1) from a termite hindgut bacteria was functionally characterised and used in synergy with xylanases during xylan hydrolysis. The FAE-1 displayed temperature and pH optima of 60 ℃ and 7.0, respectively. FAE-1 did not release reducing sugars from beechwood xylan (BWX), wheat arabinoxylan (WAX) and oat spelt xylan (OX), however, displayed high activity of 164.74 U/mg protein on p -nitrophenyl-acetate (pNPA). In contrast, the GH10 xylanases; Xyn10 and XT6, and a GH11 xylanase, Xyn2A, showed more than two-fold increased activity on xylan substrates with low sidechain substitutions; BWX and OX, compared to the highly branched substrate, WAX. Interestingly, the FAE-1 and GH10 xylanases (Xyn10D and XT6) displayed a degree of synergy (DS) that was higher than 1 in all enzyme loading combinations during WAX hydrolysis. The 75%XT6:25%FAE-1 synergistic enzyme combination increased the release of reducing sugars by 1.34-fold from WAX compared to the control, while 25%Xyn10D:75%FAE-1 synergistic combination released about 2.1-fold of reducing sugars from WAX compared to controls. These findings suggest that FAE-1 can be used in concert with xylanases, particularly those from GH10, to efficiently degrade arabinoxylans contained in cereal feedstocks for various industrial settings such as in animal feeds and baking.",

We investigated the role and molecular mechanism through which SFN regulates proliferation and self-renewal of lung cancer stem cells. CD133 + cells were isolated with MACs from lung cancer A549 and H460 cells. In this study, we found that SFN inhibited the proliferation of lung cancer cells and self-renewal of lung cancer stem cells simultaneously. Meanwhile, the mRNA and protein expressions of Shh, Smo, Gli1 and PHC3 were highly activated in CD133 + lung cancer cells. Compared with siRNA-control group, Knock-down of Shh inhibited proliferation of CD133 + lung cancer cells, and decreased the protein expression of PHC3 in CD133 + lung cancer cells. Knock-down of PHC3 also affected the proliferation and decreased the Shh expression level in CD133 + lung cancer cells. In addition, SFN inhibited the activities of Shh, Smo, Gli1 and PHC3 in CD133 + lung cancer cells. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of SFN on the proliferation of siRNA-Shh and siRNA-PHC3 cells was weaker than that on the proliferation of siRNA-control cells. Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway might undergo a cross-talk with PHC3 in self-renewal of lung cancer stem cells. SFN might be an effective new drug which could inhibit self-renewal of lung cancer stem cells through the modulation of Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathways and PHC3. This study could provide a novel way to improve therapeutic efficacy for lung cancer stem cells.",

One alternative approach for infection control is quorum quenching which was found to decrease virulence of such pathogen. In this study, the efficiency of a recombinant Ahl-1 lactonase formulated as a hydrogel was investigated to control the infection of multidrug resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa infected burn using a murine model. The recombinant N-acylhomoserine lactonase (Ahl-1) was formulated as a hydrogel. To test its ability to control the infection of MDR P. aeruginosa , a thermal injury model was used. Survival rate, and systemic spread of the infection were evaluated. Histopathological examination of the animal dorsal skin was also done for monitoring the healing and cellular changes at the site of infection. Survival rate in the treated group was 100% relative to 40% in the control group. A decrease of up to 3 logs of bacterial count in the blood samples of the treated animals relative to the control group and a decrease of up to 4 logs and 2.3 logs of bacteria in lung and liver samples, respectively were observed. Histopathological examination revealed more enhanced healing process in the treated group. Accordingly, by promoting healing of infected MDR P. aeruginosa burn and by reducing systemic spread of the infection as well as decreasing mortality rate, Ahl-1 hydrogel application is a promising strategy that can be used to combat and control P. aeruginosa burn infections.",

These well-known glycosidase inhibitors are of interest as therapeutics, yet several aspects of azasugars remain unknown including their distribution, structural diversity, and chemical ecology. The hallmark signature of bacterial azasugar biosynthesis is a three gene cluster (3GC) coding for aminotransferase, phosphatase, and dehydrogenase enzymes. Using the bioinformatics platform Enzyme Similarity Tool (EST), we identified hundreds of putative three gene clusters coding for azasugar production in microbial species. In the course of this work, we also report a consensus sequence for the aminotransferase involved in azasugar biosynthesis as being: SGNXFRXXXFPNXXXXXXXLXVPXPYCXRC. Most clusters are found in Bacillus and Streptomyces species which typically inhabit soil and the rhizosphere, but some clusters are found with diverse species representation such as Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus which are symbiotic with entomopathogenic nematodes; the human skin commensal Cutibacterium acnes, and the marine Bacillus rugosus SPB7, a symbiont to the sea sponge Spongia officinalis . This pan-taxonomic survey of the azasugar 3GC signature may lead to the identification of new azasugar producers, facilitate studies of their natural functions, and lead to new potential therapeutics.",

Phoma spp. such as Phoma arachidicola, P. sorghina, P. exigua var. exigua , P. herbarum, P. multirostrata, P. betae, P. fimeti, P. tropica, among others are known to produce different bioactive metabolites including polyketides, macrosporin, terpenes and terpenoids, thiodiketopiperazines, cytochalasin derivatives, phenolic compounds, and alkaloids. These bioactive metabolites have already demonstrated their antimicrobial potential (antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral) against various pathogens. In the present review, we have discussed the antimicrobial potential of secondary metabolites produced by different Phoma species. We have also deliberated the biogenic synthesis of eco-friendly antimicrobial silver nanoparticles from Phoma and their role as potential antimicrobial agents.",

Pigs and other wild and domestic animals are reservoirs for these bacteria. Infection is usually spread to humans by ingestion of contaminated food. Yersiniosis is considered a rare disease, but recent studies indicate that it is overlooked in the diagnostic process therefore the infections with this bacterium are not often identified. Reliable diagnosis of Yersiniosis by culturing is difficult due to the slow growth of the bacteria easily overgrown by other more rapidly growing microbes unless selec-tive growth media is used. Phage adhesins recognizing bacteria in a specific manner can be an excellent diagnostic tool, es-pecially in the diagnosis of pathogens difficult for culturing. In this study, it was shown that Gp17, the tail fiber protein (TFP) of phage φYeO3-12, specifically recognizes only the pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica serotype O:3 (YeO:3) bacteria. The ELISA test used in this work confirmed the specific interaction of this protein with YeO:3 and demonstrated a promising tool for developing the pathogen recognition method based on phage adhesins.",

Here, a feasible expression system has been developed to produce strong recombinant fusion bioinspired protein using mussel foot protein 3 and 5 (Mfps) along with gas vesicle protein A (GvpA) of Anabaena flos-aquae, and a curli protein CsgA from E. coli, expressed under the control of alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promoter for high-level production in yeast P. pastoris using pPICZα vector. Purified chimeric proteins were first evaluated using western blotting, and their remaining dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) was measured in the modified proteins by NBT assay. We further elucidated the mechanistic properties of obtained adhesive protein assembly in various pH levels based on its different subunits using atomic force microscopy (AFM) when adsorbed onto the mica surface. We found that both combinational structural features of subunits and post-translational changes during expression in yeast host have led to potent adherence due to higher DOPA residues specially in acidic condition and tetrad complex which is higher than that of earlier reports in prokaryotic systems. We believe that our obtained chimeric protein resulted from the fusion of GvpA and CsgA proteins with DOPA-containing Mfp proteins, expressed in the methylotrophic yeast, P. pastoris, not only presents a candidate for future biomedical applications but also provides novel biological clues used for high-performance bioinspired biomaterial designation.",

Rumen fermentation parameters of male goat kids viz., total gas production, CH4, true dry matter digestibility (TDMD), organic matter digestibility (TOMD), partial fraction (PF), microbial biomass (MBP), ammonia (N), acetate, propionate, butyrate and acetate propionate ratio were observed under in vitro conditions. Results revealed that crude protein, organic matter and ethyl ether content were higher in ML as compared to concentrate mixture and berseem. Magnesium and iron content were also higher in ML as compared to concentrate and berseem. Total gas production, digestibility of DM and OM, MBP, acetate and propionate level were improved (P < 0.05) upto 10-20% replacement. In contrast, decreased in CH4 (%) and CH4 (mL/100 mg dDM) was noted with increased levels of ML incorporation. There was no change observed in ammonia, acetate: propionate ratios at all the three planes of nutrition. In this study, it is concluded that mixing Moringa oleifera leaves in feed can be used as protein supplement and reduce the methane emission without causing any effect on digestibility and rumen fermentation parameters. However, ML can be suggested for widespread practice to attain the sustainable animal production (10-20%) and to alleviate the global warming.",

Additionally, there were fewer and more dispersed bacteria in the biofilms of the S. mutans MV-treated group than that in the control group. Furthermore, the expression levels of the biofilm-related virulence factors GtfG, GtfP, and SpxB in S. gordonii and S. sanguinis were significantly downregulated in response to S. mutans MVs.

    "abstract": "Abstract Heparanase (HPSE) is an endoglycosidase cleaves heparan sulfate (HS) and this contributes to the degradation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. HS cleaved by HPSE induces activation of autophagy and formation of autophagosommes which facilitate binding of HPSE to the HS and subsequent release of growth factors. The interaction between HPSE and HS triggers releases of chemokines and cytokines which affect inflammatory response and cell signaling pathways with development of hyperinflammation, cytokine storm (CS) and coagulopathy. HPSE expression is induced by both SARS-CoV-2 and monkeypox virus (MPXV) leading to induction release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, endothelial dysfunction and thrombotic events. Co-infection of MPX with SARS-CoV-2 may occur as we facing many outbreaks of MPX cases during Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, targeting of HPSE by specific inhibitors may reduce the risk of complications in both SARS-CoV-2 and MPXV infections. Taken together, HPSE could be a potential link between MPX with SARS-CoV-2 in Covid-19 era.",

    "abstract": "It is a growing problem around the world to deal with nontuberculous mycobacteria infection (NTM), but its clinical significance is still largely unknown. This study aims to investigate the epidemiology of NTM infections from various clinical samples and determine their clinical significance. From December 2020 to December 2021, 6125 clinical samples were collected. In addition to phenotypic detection, genotypic detection through multilocus sequence typing (hsp65, rpoB, and 16S rDNA genes) and sequencing was also conducted. Records of patients were consulted for clinical information, such as symptoms and radiological findings. Of the 6,125 patients, 351 (5.7%) were positive for acid-fast bacteria (AFB). Out of 351 AFB, 289 (82.3%) and 62 (17.7%) subjects were identified as M. tuberculosis complex (MTC) and NTM strains, respectively. Isolates of Mycobacterium simiae and M. fortuitum were the most frequent, followed by isolates of M. kansasii and M. marinum. We also isolated M. chelonae, M. canariasense, and M. jacuzzii, which are rarely reported. Symptoms (P = 0.048), radiographic findings (P = 0.013), and gender (P = 0.039) were associated with NTM isolates. M. Fortuitum, M. simiae, and M. kansasii presented with bronchiectasis, infiltration, and cavitary lesions most frequently, while cough was the most common symptom. In conclusion, Mycobacterium simiae and M. fortuitum were presented in seventeen and twelve NTM isolates from the collected samples. There is evidence that NTM infections in endemic settings may contribute to the dissemination of various diseases and the control of tuberculosis. In spite of this, further research is needed to evaluate the clinical significance of NTM isolates.",

    "abstract": "Anal fistula is a common proctological disease, but the thorough mechanisms of the anal fistula formation are still unclear. An increasing number of studies have revealed the crucial role of gut microbiota in intestinal diseases. We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to analyze the intestinal microbiome in order to determine whether there are differences in the microbiome between anal fistula patients and healthy individuals. The microbiome samples were extracted by repeatedly wiping the rectal wall with intestinal swab. Before this operation, the whole intestine of all participants was irrigated and the score of the Boston bowel preparation scale reached 9. The biodiversity of gut microbiome of rectum revealed significant difference between anal fistula patients and healthy individuals. 36 discriminative taxa were identified by LEfSe analysis between two groups. At the phylum level, Synergistetes was enriched in anal fistula patients, while Proteobacteria was higher in healthy individuals. We also found that at the genus level, Blautia, Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus, Coprococcus, Bacteroides, Clostridium, Megamonas and Anaerotruncus were highly enriched in anal fistula patients, while the microbiome of healthy individuals was enriched with Peptoniphilus and Corynebacterium. Spearman correlations showed the extensive and close association among genera and species. Finally, a diagnostic prediction model was constructed by random forest classifier, and the area under curve (AUC) reached 0.990. This study gave an important hint for analyzing gut microbiome of rectum in anal fistula patient.Keypoints.We use the 16S rRNA gene sequencing to test the microbiome samples extracted from the intestinal swab. This is the first study to explore the gut microbiome of rectum using this workflow. We also found the distinct gut microbiome of rectum differences between anal fistula patients and healthy individuals.",

    "abstract": "Rapid and successful clinical diagnosis and bacterial infection treatment depend on accurate identification and differentiation between different pathogenic bacterial species. A lot of efforts have been made to utilize modern techniques which avoid the laborious work and time-consuming of conventional methods to fulfill this task. Among such techniques, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) can tell much about bacterial identity and functionality. In the present study, a sensitivity-improved version of LIBS, i.e. nano-enhanced LIBS (NELIBS), has been used to discriminate between two different bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis) belonging to different taxonomic orders. Biogenic silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are sprinkled onto the samples' surface to have better discrimination capability of the technique. The obtained spectroscopic results of the NELIBS approach revealed superior differentiation between the two bacterial species compared to the results of the conventional LIBS. Identification of each bacterial species has been achieved in light of the presence of spectral lines of certain elements. On the other hand, the discrimination was successful by comparing the intensity of the spectral lines in the spectra of the two bacteria. In addition, an artificial neural network (ANN) model has been created to assess the variation between the two data sets, affecting the differentiation process. The results revealed that NELIBS provides higher sensitivity and more intense spectral lines with increased detectable elements. The ANN results showed that the accuracy rates are 88% and 92% for LIBS and NELIBS, respectively. In the present work, it has been demonstrated that NELIBS combined with ANN successfully differentiated between both bacteria rapidly with high precision compared to conventional microbiological discrimination techniques and with minimum sample preparation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aerobic hydrogen-oxidizing ‘Knallgas’ bacteria are promising candidates for microbial cell factories due to their ability to use hydrogen and carbon dioxide as the sole energy and carbon sources, respectively. These bacteria can convert atmospheric CO 2 to chemicals which could help to mitigate climate change by replacing fossil fuel-based chemicals. A known method to enhance the product yield is to disrupt competing metabolic pathways in the host organism. One such pathway in many ‘Knallgas’ bacteria is polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) biosynthesis. In this study, the PHB biosynthesis genes of a non-model ‘Knallgas’ bacterium Xanthobacter sp. SoF1 were identified. Consequently, the phaA , phaB and phaC genes were individually deleted and the resulting knockouts were evaluated for their ability to produce PHB in autotrophic shake flask and small-scale bioreactor cultivations. The results demonstrate that PHB production was inactivated in the phaC1 knockout strain, which advances the development of Xanthobacter sp. SoF1 as a production host. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Enterococcus faecalis is one of the main pathogens that causes hospital-acquired infections because it is intrinsically resistant to some antibiotics and often is capable of biofilm formation, which plays a critical role in resisting the external environment. Therefore, attacking biofilms is a potential therapeutic strategy for infections caused by E. faecalis . Current research indicates that diacerein used in the treatment of osteoarthritis showed antimicrobial activity on strains of gram-positive cocci in vitro. In this study, we tested the MICs of diacerein using the broth microdilution method, and successive susceptibility testing verified that E. faecalis is unlikely to develop resistance to diacerein. In addition, we obtained a strain of E. faecalis HE01 with strong biofilm-forming ability from an eye hospital environment and demonstrated that diacerein affected the biofilm development of HE01 in a dose-dependent manner. Then, we explored the mechanism by which diacerein inhibits biofilm formation through qRT-PCR, extracellular protein assays, hydrophobicity assays and transcriptomic analysis. The results showed that biofilm formation was inhibited at the initial adhesion stage by inhibition of the expression of the esp gene, synthesis of bacterial surface proteins and reduction in cell hydrophobicity. In addition, transcriptome analysis showed that diacerein not only inhibited bacterial growth by affecting the oxidative phosphorylation process and substance transport but also inhibited biofilm formation by affecting secondary metabolism, biosynthesis, the ribosome pathway and luxS expression. Thus, our findings provide compelling evidence for the substantial therapeutic potential of diacerein against E. faecalis biofilms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Effective disinfection of contaminated surfaces is essential for preventing the transmission of pathogens. In this study, we investigated the UV irradiance and wavelength distribution of a 222-nm ultraviolet C (UVC) excimer lamp and its disinfection efficacy against microorganisms in laboratory conditions. By using a carrier quantitative germicidal test with stainless steel sheets as carriers, we examined the disinfection effect of the 222-nm UVC lamp on three standard strains- Staphylococcus aureus , Escherichia coli , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa . We tested the disinfection efficacy under different conditions by adjusting irradiation time, as well as the state and temperature of the stainless steel carriers. Our results indicated that a bacterial suspension in PBS and not-dried stainless steel carriers yielded better disinfection than in TSB and dried carriers. Additionally, carrier temperature had no significant impact on disinfection efficacy. When utilizing a bacterial suspension in PBS and non-dried carriers at a temperature of 20 °C, the three bacteria were eliminated by 222-nm UVC excimer lamp irradiation in just 15 s. In contrast, when using a bacterial suspension in TSB and dried carriers at temperatures of 20 °C, 4 °C, or − 20 °C, the three bacteria were eradicated by 222-nm UVC excimer lamp irradiation in 60 s. Comparatively, the LPM lamp required more than 10 min to achieve the same disinfection effect. Our data demonstrate that the 222-nm UVC excimer lamp has higher irradiance and a more potent microbial disinfection effect than the LPM lamp, requiring significantly less irradiation time to achieve the same disinfection effect under identical conditions. Furthermore, the 222-nm UVC excimer lamp exhibited a substantial disinfection effect on bacterial propagules at low temperatures. Our findings support the optimization of “tunnel-type” cold-chain goods disinfection devices, providing an alternative, highly efficient, and practical tool to combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2 through cold-chain systems.

    "abstract": "Abstract Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a prevalent, intricate, and intractable form of neuropathic pain. The available evidence indicates that alterations in the gut microbiota are significant environmental determinants in the development of chronic neuropathic pain. Nevertheless, the correlation between the gut microbiota and PHN remains elusive. A cross-sectional study was performed on a cohort of 27 patients diagnosed with PHN and 27 matched healthy controls. Fecal samples were collected and subjected to microbiota analysis using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Comparable levels of bacterial richness and diversity were observed in the gut microbiota of PHN patients and healthy controls. A significant difference was observed in 37 genera between the two groups. Furthermore, the LEfSe method revealed that the abundance levels of Escherichia-Shigella , Streptococcus , Ligilactobacillus , and Clostridia_UCG-014_unclassified were elevated in PHN patients, while Eubacterium_hallii_group , Butyricicoccus , Tyzzerella , Dorea , Parasutterella , Romboutsia , Megamonas, and Agathobacter genera were reduced in comparison to healthy controls. Significantly, the discriminant model utilizing the predominant microbiota exhibited efficacy in distinguishing PHN patients from healthy controls, with an area under the curve value of 0.824. Moreover, Spearman correlation analysis demonstrated noteworthy correlations between various gut microbiota and clinical symptoms, including disease course, anxiety state, sleep quality, heat pain, pain intensity, and itching intensity. Gut microbiota dysbiosis exists in PHN patients, microbiome differences could be used to distinguish PHN patients from normal healthy individuals with high sensitivity and specificity, and altered gut microbiota are related to clinical manifestations, suggesting potentially novel prevention and therapeutic directions of PHN.",

In recent years, more and more attention has been paid to the studies of soil microbial diversity in newly born wetlands in coal mining subsidence areas. However, there are few reports on the seasonal variation of soil microbial diversity and its relationship with soil physical and chemical properties. In this study, 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology was used to analyze the seasonal changes of soil microbial composition and functional diversity in newly formed wetlands in coal mining subsidence areas, and to determine the seasonal changes of soil nutrient elements and physical and chemical properties in coal mining subsidence areas, so as to analyze the correlation between soil microbial diversity and soil nutrient elements and physical and chemical properties in newly formed wetlands in coal mining subsidence areas. A total of 16,050 OTUs were obtained after sample gene noise reduction. Proteobacteria , Acidobacteriota and Bacteroidota were the highest abundance in the coal mining subsidence area of Jining. The two seasons gathered separately, and temperature (Temp), total phosphorus (TP), available phosphorus (AP), total organic carbon (TOC) and dry matter content (DMC) were the key factors for the seasonal change of soil microbial community in the wetland of the coal mining subsidence area of Jining. The contents of Temp, AP and TP were significantly correlated with the abundance of soil microorganisms in summer subsidence area, while the contents of DMC and TOC were significantly correlated with the abundance of soil microorganisms in winter subsidence area. Soil microbial diversity in coal mining subsidence area was correlated with the seasons.

A rapid screening method, combining atmospheric and room temperature plasma mutagenesis, 48-deep-well plates fermentation, and microplate reader detection, was developed. A mutant strain named WB15 with high RNA content was successfully obtained, exhibiting the RNA content of 156 ± 4.5 mg/g DCW, 1.4 times of the starting strain CCTCC AY 92020. Furthermore, Plackett–Burman design and response surface methodology were employed to identify three significant factors (yeast extract, soybean peptone, and KH 2 PO 4 ) affecting the RNA content. By utilizing the optimal medium composed of 13.43 g/L yeast extract, 12.12 g/L soybean peptone and 2.78 g/L KH 2 PO 4 , the RNA content of WB15 further increased to 184 ± 4.9 mg/g DCW. Additionally, the mutant strain WB15 exhibited a greater cellular width compared to AY 92020, along with increased growth rate and single-cell RNA content by 22% and 48.9%, respectively. Perturbations in ribosome assembly, specifically a reduction in the ratio of ribosomal proteins to ribosomal RNA of the large subunit, might indirectly contribute to the higher RNA content in the WB15 strain. Overall, the combination of rapid screening with fermentation medium optimization proved to be an effective approach for improving the RNA content of C. jadinii , thus facilitating the industrial production of RNA.",

We analysed the transcriptomic changes of Tv-1511 under normal and heat stress conditions using RNA sequencing. We observed that Tv-1511 regulates the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites through a complex network of signalling pathways. Additionally, it significantly activates the anti-oxidant defence system, heat shock proteins and stress-response-related transcription factors in response to heat stress. TvHSP70 was identified as a key gene, and transgenic Tv-1511 overexpressing TvHSP70 (TvHSP70-OE) was generated.

We observed that TvHSP70 over-expression significantly triggered the growth, anti-oxidant capacity, anti-fungal activity and growth-promoting ability of Tv-1511. Regarding anti-oxidant capacity, TvHSP70 primarily up-regulated genes involved in enzymatic and non-enzymatic anti-oxidant systems. In terms of anti-fungal activity, TvHSP70 primarily activated genes involved in the synthesis of enediyne, anti-fungal and aminoglycoside antibiotics. This study provides a comparative analysis of the functional significance and molecular mechanisms of HSP70 in Trichoderma . These findings provide a valuable foundation for further analyses.",

A comprehensive analysis of volatile metabolites produced by Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) in BC bottles was conducted using GC-IMS. Subsequently, the released VOCs were analyzed to examine differences in VOC release between CRKP and carbapenem-susceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae (CSKP). A total of 54 VOCs were detected, of which 18 (6 VOCs found in both monomer and dimer forms) were successfully identified. The VOCs produced by K. pneumoniae in BC bottles (BacT/ALERT® SA) were primarily composed of organic acids, alcohols, esters, and ketones. The content of certain VOCs was significantly different between CRKP and CSKP after the addition of imipenem (IPM). Moreover, the inclusion of carbapenemase inhibitors facilitated the identification of carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae based on the variations in VOCs. This study demonstrates the utility of GC-IMS technology in identifying CRKP, and reveals that changes in VOCs are closely related to the growth and metabolism of K. pneumoniae, indicating that they can be leveraged to promote early identification of CRKP bacteremia.

    "abstract": "Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) is a member of the ESKAPE group and is responsible for severe community and healthcare-associated infections. Certain Klebsiella species have very similar phenotypes, which presents a challenge in identifying K. pneumoniae. Multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae is also a serious global problem that needs to be addressed. A total of 190 isolates were isolated from urine (n = 69), respiratory (n = 52), wound (n = 48) and blood (n = 21) samples collected from various hospitals in the Al-Qassim, Saudi Arabia, between March 2021 and October 2022. Our study aimed to rapidly and accurately detect K. pneumoniae using the Peptide Mass Fingerprinting (PMF) technique, confirmed by real-time PCR. Additionally, screening for antibiotic susceptibility and resistance was conducted. The primary methods for identifying K. pneumoniae isolates were culture, Gram staining, and the Vitek® 2 ID Compact system. An automated MALDI Biotyper (MBT) instrument was used for proteome identification, which was subsequently confirmed using SYBR green real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) and microfluidic electrophoresis assays. Vitek® 2 AST-GN66 cards were utilized to evaluate the antimicrobial sensitivity of K. pneumoniae isolates. According to our results, Vitek® 2 Compact accurately identified 178 out of 190 (93.68%) K. pneumoniae isolates, while the PMF technique correctly detected 188 out of 190 (98.95%) isolates with a score value of 2.00 or higher. Principal component analysis was conducted using MBT Compass software to classify K. pneumoniae isolates based on their structure. Based on the analysis of the single peak intensities generated by MBT, the highest peak values were found at 3444, 5022, 5525, 6847, and 7537 m/z. K. pneumoniae gene testing confirmed the PMF results, with 90.53% detecting entrobactin, 70% detecting 16 S rRNA, and 32.63% detecting ferric iron uptake. The resistance of the K. pneumoniae isolates to antibiotics was as follows: 64.75% for cefazolin, 62.63% for trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 59.45% for ampicillin, 58.42% for cefoxitin, 57.37% for ceftriaxone, 53.68% for cefepime, 52.11% for ampicillin-sulbactam, 50.53% for ceftazidime, 52.11% for ertapenem, and 49.47% for imipenem. Based on the results of the double-disk synergy test, 93 out of 190 (48.95%) K. pneumoniae isolates were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. In conclusion, PMF is a powerful analytical technique used to identify K. pneumoniae isolates from clinical samples based on their proteomic characteristics. K. pneumoniae isolates have shown increasing resistance to antibiotics from different classes, including carbapenem, which poses a significant threat to human health as these infections may become difficult to treat.",

All three treatment groups showed highly significant differences in in situ crude protein disappearance (ISCPD) compared to the CON group ( p &lt; 0.01). (4) Good’s Coverage for all experimental groups was greater than 0.99, meeting the conditions for subsequent sequencing. Compared to the CON group, the Shannon index significantly increased in the CA group ( p &lt; 0.01), and the Simpson index increased significantly in the MA group ( p &lt; 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the Chao index among the three treatment groups and the CON group ( p &gt; 0.05). At the genus level, the abundance of Lentilactobacillus in the MA, CA, and MA + CA groups was significantly higher than in the control group ( p &lt; 0.05). PICRUSt prediction results indicated that the metabolic functional microbial groups in the CA and MA treatment groups were significantly higher than in the CON group ( p &lt; 0.05), suggesting that the addition of MA or CA could reduce the loss of nutritional components such as protein and carbohydrates in mixed ensilage. In conclusion, the addition of malic acid and citric acid to a mixture of apple pomace and corn protein powder during ensiling reduces nutritional losses, improves fermentation quality and rumen degradation rate, enhances the diversity of the microbial community in ensiled feed, and improves microbial structure. The combined addition of malic acid and citric acid demonstrates a superior effect.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Microbial degradation of fluorinated compounds raised significant attention because of their widespread distribution and potential environmental impacts. Here, we report a bacterial isolate, Rhodococcus sp. NJF-7 capable of defluorinating monofluorinated medium-chain length alkanes. This isolate consumed 2.29 ± 0.13 mmol L − 1 of 1-fluorodecane (FD) during a 52 h incubation period, resulting in a significant release of inorganic fluoride amounting to 2.16 ± 0.03 mmol L − 1 . The defluorination process was strongly affected by the initial FD concentration and pH conditions, with lower pH increasing fluoride toxicity to bacterial cells and inhibiting enzymatic defluorination activity. Stoichiometric conversion of FD to fluoride was observed at neutral pH with resting cells, while defluorination was significantly lower at reduced pH (6.5). The discovery of the metabolites decanoic acid and methyl decanoate suggests that the initial attack by monooxygenases may be responsible for the biological defluorination of FD. The findings here provide new insights into microbial defluorination processes, specifically aiding in understanding the environmental fate of organic semi-fluorinated alkane chemicals.",

    "abstract": "The primary challenge to improving existing cancer treatment is to develop drugs that specifically target tumor cell. NGR peptide is tumor homing peptide that selectively target cancer cells while interleukin 15 is a pleiotropic cytokine with anticancer properties. This study computationally engineered a IL15-NGR fusion peptide by linking the homing peptide NGR with the targeting peptide IL-15. After evaluating and validating the chimeric peptide, we docked it to the IL-15Rα/IL-15Rβ/γc heterodimer receptor, examining the interactions and binding energy and lastly, molecular dynamics simulations were performed. The secondary and tertiary structures, along with physicochemical properties of the designed IL-15-NGR chimeric protein, were predicted using GOR IV, trRosetta and ProtParam online servers respectively. The quality and 3D structure validation were confirmed via ProSA-web and SAVES 6.0 analysis which predicted an ERRAT score of 96.72%, with 97.6% of residues in the Ramachandran plot, validating its structure. Finally, Docking, MD simulations and interaction analysis were performed using ClusPro 2.0 and GROMACS and PDBsum, which exhibited significant hydrogen bonding and salt bridges, confirming the formation of a stable docked complex. These results were further corroborated by simulation analysis, which demonstrated a stable and dynamic behavior of the docked complex in a biological environment. The predicted high expression value of fusion protein was 0.844 in E.coli using SOLUPROT tool. These findings suggest efficient expression of the IL15-NGR fusion protein if its gene is inserted into E. coli and indicates its potential as a safe and effective anticancer treatment, paving the way for targeted therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Trichophyton rubrum is one of the most frequently isolated fungi in patients with dermatophytosis. Despite its clinical significance, the molecular mechanisms of drug resistance and pathogenicity of T. rubrum remain to be elucidated because of the lack of genetic tools, such as efficient gene targeting systems. In this study, we generated a T. rubrum strain that lacks the nonhomologous end-joining-related gene ku80 (Δku80) and then developed a highly efficient genetic recombination system with gene targeting efficiency that was 46 times higher than that using the wild-type strain. Cyp51A and Cyp51B are 14-α-lanosterol demethylase isozymes in T. rubrum that promote ergosterol biosynthesis and are the targets of azole antifungal drugs. The expression of cyp51A mRNA was induced by the addition of the azole antifungal drug efinaconazole, whereas no such induction was detected for cyp51B, suggesting that Cyp51A functions as an azole-responsive Cyp51 isozyme. To explore the contribution of Cyp51A to susceptibility to azole drugs, the neomycin phosphotransferase (nptII) gene cassette was inserted into the cyp51A 3′-untranslated region of Δku80 to destabilize the mRNA of cyp51A. In this mutant, the induction of cyp51A mRNA expression by efinaconazole was diminished. The minimum inhibitory concentration for several azole drugs of this strain was reduced, suggesting that dermatophyte Cyp51A contributes to the tolerance for azole drugs. These findings suggest that an efficient gene targeting system using Δku80 in T. rubrum is applicable for analyzing genes encoding drug targets.",

The initial pH of the medium, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), tryptone, and NaCl concentrations were further optimized using a response surface Central Composite design. Fermentation under optimized variables of initial pH 6.0, presence of CMC, tryptone, and NaCl at concentrations of 2%, 0.03%, and 0.12%, respectively, resulted in 3.24 fold increase in cellulase productivity (2023 U/L) as compared to that under basal conditions (625 U/L). Cellulase production was also improved with a 4 Kilogray (KGy) dosage of gamma radiation. In comparison to the wild-type strain under basal circumstances, S. thermodiastaticus produced 5.1 fold more cellulase after a combination of model-based optimization and gamma radiation mutation. Cellulase was partially purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by dialysis. The resulting cellulase was 1.74 times purified and its specific activity was 4.21 U/mg. The molecular weight of cellulase is 63 kDa as indicated by SDS-PAGE and zymogram. Its maximum activity was achieved at 60 °C and pH 5.0.

Such microorganisms are capable of consuming this gas, supporting the Microbial Prospection of Oil and Gas (MPOG) methodology. The goal of the present work was to characterize microbial communities involved in short-chain alkane metabolism, namely methane, ethane and propane, in samples from a petroliferous (P) soil through clone libraries of the 16S rRNA gene of the Domains Bacteria and Archaea and the catabolic gene coding for the soluble di-iron monooxygenase (SDIMO) enzyme alpha subunit. The microbial community presented high abundance of the bacterial phylum Actinobacteria, which represented 53% of total clones, and the Crenarchaeota group I.1b from the Archaea Domain. The analysis of the catabolic genes revealed the occurrence of seven Operational Protein Families (OPF) and higher richness (Chao = 7; Ace = 7.5) and diversity (Shannon = 1.09) in P soil when compared with a non-petroliferous (Np) soil (Chao = 2; Ace = 0, Shannon = 0.44). Clones related to the ethene monooxygenase (EtnC) and methane monooxygenase (MmoX) coding genes occurred only in P soil, which also presented higher levels of methane and lower levels of ethane and propane, revealed by short-chain hydrocarbon measures. Real-time PCR results suggested that the SDIMO genes occur in very low abundance in the soil samples under study. Further investigations on SDIMOs genes in natural environments are necessary to unravel their still uncharted diversity and to provide reliable tools for the prospection of degrading populations.",

Acremonium cellulolyticus is a filamentous fungus with high cellulase production but productivity of hemicellulase, especially β-xylosidase, is lower than other filamentous fungi. We identified 2.4 Kb β-xylosidase gene in the A. cellulolyticus genome sequence information and it encoded 798 amino acids without introns. To enhance hemicellulase productivity in A. cellulolyticus , we transformed this fungus with the identified β-xylosidase gene driven by the cellobiohydrolase Ι ( cbh1 ) promoter, using the protoplast-polyethyleneglycol (PEG) method, and obtained a transformant, YKX1. Hydrolysis rate of xylooligosaccharides was more than 50-fold higher using culture supernatant from YKX1 than that from the parental strain, Y-94. Total cellulase activity (measured by filter paper assay) in YKX1 was not affected by the cbh1 promoter used for expression of β-xylosidase, and induced by cellulose. Since YKX1 can produce larger amount of β-xylosidase without affecting cellulase productivity, it is considered to be beneficial for practical monosaccharide recoveries from lignocellulosic biomass.",

The bacterial alliinase was purified 300-fold from a cell-free extract, giving rise to a homogenous protein band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The bacterial alliinase (96 kDa) consisted of two identical subunits (48 kDa), and was most active at 60°C and at pH 8.0. The enzyme stoichiometrically converted (-)-alliin ((-)-S-allyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide) to form allicin, pyruvic acid, and ammonia more selectively than (+)-alliin, a naturally occurring substrate for plant alliinase ever known. The C-S lyase activity was also detected with this bacterial enzyme when S-alkyl-L-cysteine was used as a substrate, though such a lyase activity is absolutely absent in alliinase of plant origin. The enzyme generated a fungicidal activity against Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a time- and a dose-dependent fashion using alliin as a stable precursor. Alliinase of Ensifer adhaerens FERM P-19486 is the enzyme with a novel type of substrate specificity, and thus considered to be beneficial when used in combination with garlic enzyme with respect to absolute conversion of (±)-alliin to allicin.",

    "abstract": "Auxotrophic mutants of Aspergillus can be isolated in the presence of counter-selective compounds, but the process is laborious. We developed a method to enable reversible impairment of the ku80 gene (Aaku80) in the imperfect fungus Aspergillus aculeatus. Aaku80 was replaced with a selection marker, orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase (pyrG), followed by excision of pyrG between direct repeats (DR) to yield the Aaku80 deletion mutant (MR12). The gene-targeting efficiency at the ornithine carbamoyltransferase (argB) locus was drastically elevated from 3% to 96% in MR12. The frequency of marker recycling depended on DR length. One uridine auxotroph was obtained from 3.3 × 105, 1.4 × 105, and 9.2 × 103 conidia from strains harboring 20-, 98-, and 495-bp DRs, respectively. Because these strains maintained the short DRs after 5 d of cultivation, we investigated whether Aaku80 function was disrupted by pyrG insertion with the 20-bp DR and restored after excision of pyrG. The Aaku80 disruption mutant (coku80) was bred by inserting pyrG sandwiched between 20-bp DRs into the second intron of Aaku80, followed by excision of pyrG between the DRs to yield the coku80rec strain. Analyses of homologous recombination frequency and methyl methanesulfonate sensitivity demonstrated that Aaku80 function was disrupted in coku80 but restored in coku80rec. Furthermore, pyrG was maintained in coku80 at least for ten generations. These data indicated that reversible impairment of ku80 in A. aculeatus is useful for functional genomics in cases where genetic segregation is not feasible.",

In this study, enhanced incorporation of 3H4MV into PHA was investigated using branched amino acid leucine as a precursor of 3H4MV. Leucine has the same carbon backbone as 3H4MV and is expected to be a natural and self-producible precursor. We found that the incorporation of 3H4MV was enhanced by the supplementation of excess amount (10 g/L) of leucine in the culture medium. This finding indicates that 3H4MV can be derived from leucine. To increase metabolic flux to leucine biosynthesis in the host strain by eliminating the feedback inhibition, the cells were subjected to N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (NTG) mutagenesis and leucine analog resistant mutants were generated. The mutants showed statistically higher 3H4MV fraction than the parent strain without supplementing leucine. Additionally, by supplying excess amount of leucine, the mutants synthesized 3HB-based PHA copolymer containing 3.1 mol% 3H4MV and 1.2 mol% 3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV) as minor constituents, which significantly affected the thermal properties of the copolymer. This study demonstrates that it is possible to enhance the monomer supply of 3H4MV into PHA by manipulating leucine metabolism.",

Signal peptides play an important role in targeting proteins for translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane to the periplasmic space and release into culture medium during the secretion process. Alpha toxinH35L (ATH35L) was selected as an antigen for vaccine development against Staphylococcus aureus infections. It was successfully secreted into culture medium of E. coli by using bacterial signal peptides linked to the N-terminus of the protein. In order to improve the level of secreted ATH35L, we designed a series of novel signal peptides by swapping individual domains of modifying dsbA and pelB signal peptides and tested them in a fed-batch fermentation process. The data showed that some of the modified signal peptides improved the secretion efficiency of ATH35L compared with E. coli signal peptides from dsbA, pelB and phoA proteins. Indeed, one of the novel signal peptides improved the yield of secreted ATH35L by 3.5-fold in a fed-batch fermentation process and at the same time maintained processing at the expected site for signal peptide cleavage. Potentially, these new novel signal peptides can be used to improve the secretion efficiency of other heterologous proteins in E. coli. Furthermore, analysis of the synthetic signal peptide amino acid sequences provides some insight into the sequence features within the signal peptide that influence secretion efficiency.",

The isolates were categorized in three groups based on their bioremediation activity, i.e., 5 (12.8%) organisms without biodegradation activity, 20 (51.2%) organisms with previously reported biodegradation activity, and 14 (35.9%) organisms that showed biodegradation activity but not previously reported. Our results showed that the Iranian ecosystems harbor a good reservoir of diverse mycobacterial species with biodegrading potentiality for neutralizing environmental chemical pollutants.",

    "abstract": "Current genome walking methods are very time consuming, and many produce non-specific amplification products. To amplify the flanking sequences that are adjacent to Tn5 transposon insertion sites in Serratia marcescens FZSF02, we developed a genome walking method based on TAIL-PCR. This PCR method added a 20-cycle linear amplification step before the exponential amplification step to increase the concentration of the target sequences. Products of the linear amplification and the exponential amplification were diluted 100-fold to decrease the concentration of the templates that cause non-specific amplification. Fast DNA polymerase with a high extension speed was used in this method, and an amplification program was used to rapidly amplify long specific sequences. With this linear and exponential TAIL-PCR (LETAIL-PCR), we successfully obtained products larger than 2 kb from Tn5 transposon insertion mutant strains within 3 h. This method can be widely used in genome walking studies to amplify unknown sequences that are adjacent to known sequences.",

The fermentation process was optimized by single-factor tests, and results showed that high temperature (50 °C) was especially suitable for the γ-PGA production by GXG-5.

Comparison of GXG-5 and GXA-28 (glutamate-dependent strain) under respective optimal fermentation conditions, the γ-PGA yield of GXG-5 was 19.0% higher than that of GXA-28, and GXG-5 was also superior to GXA-28 in the availability of carbon sources and substrates. Furthermore, the glutamate dependent difference between GXA-28 and GXG-5 was analyzed by genomic sequencing, results indicated that genes related to the glutamate dependent difference mainly involved in carbohydrate transport and metabolism and amino acid metabolism, and 13 genes related to γ-PGA synthesis were mutated in GXG-5. This study provided a potential glutamate-independent strain to replace glutamate-dependent strain for γ-PGA production, and shared novel information for understanding the glutamate dependent difference at the genomic level.",

The agarase-encoding gene, ID2563, consisted of 1800 bp that encoded a 599-residue protein with a signal peptide of 19 amino acids. Sequence analysis suggested that the agarase belongs to the GH16 family. The agarase was expressed in Escherichia coli with a total activity of 4.99 U/mL in fermentation medium. The extracellular enzyme activity accounted for 65.73% of the total activity, which indicated that the agarase can be extracellularly secreted using the wild-type signal peptide from Microbulbifer sp. Q7. The agarase exhibited maximal activity at approximately 40 °C and pH 6.0. It was stable between pH 6.0 and pH 9.0, which was a much wider range than most of the reported agarases. The agarase was sensitive to some metal ions (Cu2+, Zn2+ and Fe3+), but was resistant to urea and SDS. The agarase hydrolyzed β-1,4-glycosidic linkages of agarose, primarily yielding neoagarotetraose and neoagarohexaose as the final products. These indicate that this recombinant agarase can be an effective tool for the preparing functional neoagaro-oligosaccharides.",

The PTR-MS ion signal permitted temporal resolution of the volatile production while the SPME results revealed distinct compound identities. The quantitative PTR-MS results showed the volatile production was dominated by ethanol and acetaldehyde, while the concentration of the remainder of volatiles consistently reached 2,000 ppbv. The measurement of alcohols from the fungal culture by the two techniques correlated well. Notable compounds of fuel interest included nonanal, 1-octen-3-ol, 1-butanol, 3-methyl- and benzaldehyde. Abiotic comparison of the two techniques demonstrated SPME fiber bias toward higher molecular weight compounds, making quantitative efforts with SPME impractical. Together, PTR-MS and SPME GC-MS were shown as valuable tools for characterizing volatile fuel compound production from microbiological sources.",

The 58.5kb of PKS region consisting 12 PKS modules arranged in five different PKS genes, was assumed to be responsible for the biosynthesis of plecomacrolide backbone including 16-membered macrocyclic lactone. All the modules showed high similarities with typical type I PKS genes. However, the starting module of PKS gene was confirmed to be specific for isobutyrate by sequence comparison of an acyltransferase domain. In downstream of PKS region, the genes for methoxymalonate biosynthesis were located, among which a gene for FkbH-like protein was assumed to play an important role in the production of methoxymalonyl-CoA from glyceryl-CoA. Further the genes encoding flavensomycinyl-ACP biosynthesis for the post-PKS tailoring were also found in the upstream of PKS region. By gene disruption experiments of a dehydratase domain of module 12 and an FkbH-like protein, this gene cluster was confirmed to be involved in the biosynthesis of bafilomycin.",

In the insecticidal process, chitinases are suggested to perforate the peritrophic membrane barrier to facilitate the invasion of the Cry proteins into epithelial membranes. A chitinase gene from B. thuringiensis was successfully expressed in a soluble form in Escherichia coli, and the gene product was purified and characterized. The purified recombinant enzyme, BthChi74, hydrolyzed an artificial substrate, 4-nitrophenyl N,N'-diacetyl-β-D-chitobioside [4NP-(GlcNAc)2], and the natural substrates, colloidal chitin and crystalline α-chitin, but it did not hydrolyze cellulose. BthChi74 exhibited catalytic activity under a weakly acidic to neutral pH range at 50 °C, and it was stable over a wide pH range for 24 h. Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) indicated a protein melting temperature (T m) of 63.6 °C. Kinetic analysis revealed k cat and K M values of 1.5 s-1 and 159 μM, respectively, with 4NP-(GlcNAc)2 as a substrate. BthChi74 produced (GlcNAc)2 and GlcNAc from colloidal chitin and α-chitin as substrates, but the activity toward the latter was lower than that toward the former. BthChi74 could bind similarly to chitin beads, crystalline α-chitin, and cellulose through a unique family 2 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM2). The structure-function relationships of BthChi74 are discussed in relation to other chitinases, such as Listeria chitinase, which possesses a family 5 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM5).",

However, the innate biological mechanism influencing the bacterial viability is still unclear. In this study, a mutant-based approach, using Escherichia coli as a model, was used to prove the concept that common stress-response genes are important for airborne survival of bacteria. Mutants with a single gene knockout that are known to respond to general stress (rpoS) and oxidative stress (oxyR, soxR) were selected in the study. Low relative humidity (RH), 30–40% was more detrimental to the bacteria than high RH, >90%. The log reduction of ∆rpoS was always higher than that of the parental strain at all RH levels but the ∆oxyR had a higher log reduction than the parental strain at intermediate RH only. ∆soxR had the same viability compared to the parental strain at all RH levels. The results hint that although different types and levels of stress are produced under different RH conditions, stress-response genes always play a role in the bacterial viability. This study is the first reporting the association between stress-response genes and viability of airborne bacteria.",

SWPOP primer set is characterized by a partial overlap of 10 bp with 3'-part of the latter primer is identical to 5'-part of the former one, which makes the SWPOP primer in use anneal to SWPOP site of the prior PCR product only at relatively low temperature. For each PCR, target single-stranded DNA primed by the SWPOP primer in the exclusive one low-stringency cycle is converted into double-stranded form in the following high-stringency cycle due to the presence of a perfect annealing site for the specific primer. This double-stranded DNA bounded by the specific primer and the SWPOP primer is exponentially amplified in the remaining high-stringency cycles. Non-target single-stranded DNA, however, cannot be amplified given the lack of perfect complementary sequences for any primers. Therefore, the partial overlap of a SWPOP primer set preferentially synthesizes target products but inhibits nonspecific amplification. We successfully exploited SWPOP-PCR to obtain the DNA sequences flanking glutamate decarboxylase gene (gadA) locus in Lactobacillus brevis NCL912 and hygromycin gene (hyg) integrated in rice.",

The minimum inhibitory concentration for PC was 0.125% (v v−1) for linalool and 0.5% (v v−1) for citral, eugenol and thymol.

The gene encoding an aspartic protease (MCAP) from Mucor circinelloides DSM 2183 was cloned and expressed into Pichia pastoris using both the native M. circinelloides signal peptide (mcSP) and α-factor secretion signal from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (α-MF). When expressed in P. pastoris using α-MF and mcSP, MCAP was secreted into the culture medium at a concentration 200 mg L-1 (410 MCU mL-1) and 110 mg L-1 (249 MCU mL-1), respectively. The SDS-PAGE analysis of each culture shows that the protein was secreted in the media in two forms with molecular weights of approximately 33 and 37 kDa. Upon digestion using endoglycosidase H (Endo H), only one band at 33 kDa was observed, indicating that the protein might be glycosylated. One putative N-glycosylation site was found and a site-directed mutagenesis at position Asn331-Gln of the sequence produce only one form of the protein of 33 kDa, similar to that obtained when digested with Endo H. The optimum temperature and pH activity of the expressed MCAP was found to be at 60 °C and 3.6, respectively.",

With aerobic activated sludge as seeds and low content artificial wastewater (NH4+-N 50 mg/L; NO2--N 55 mg/L) as influent for the ANAMMOX reactor, nitrogen removal was initially observed on day 38 with a removal rate 1.3 mg N L-1 day-1, and increased to 90.4 mg N L-1 day-1 on day 55 with almost complete removal of ammonia and nitrite, indicating a successful startup of the reactor. Increasing influent load stepwise to NH4+-N 272.7 mg/L/NO2--N 300 mg/L, nitrogen removal rate increased gradually to 470 mg N L-1 day-1 on day 228, and maintained a stable level (~ 420 mg N L-1 day-1) following introduction of SHARON effluent since day 229. Correlation between microbial community dynamics and nitrogen removal capability was significant (r = 0.489, p < 0.001). Microbial community composition was determined by influent ammonia, influent nitrite, effluent nitrate and some undefined factors. Anammox bacteria, accounting for ~ 98.7% of Planctomycetes, became detectable (0.03% relative abundance) since day 38 and increased to 0.9% on day 58, well consistent with nitrogen removal performance of the reactor. Relative abundance of anammox bacteria gradually increased to 38.4% on day 140 with stepwise increased influent load; decreased to 0.4% on day 169 because of nitrite inhibition; increased to 19.24% on day 233 when the influent load was dropped; kept at ~ 9.0% with SHARON effluent used as influent and dropped to 3.3% finally. Anammox bacteria, only Candidatus Brocadia and Ca. Kuenenia detected, were the most abundant at genus level. Ca. Brocadia related taxa were enriched firstly under low load and detectable during the entire experimental period. Three main groups represented by Ca. Brocadia related OTUs were enriched or eliminated at different loads, but Ca. Kuenenia related taxa were enriched only under high load (NO2--N > 300 mg/L), suggesting their different niches and application for different loads. These findings improve the understanding of relationships among microbial community/functional taxa, running parameters and reactor performance, and will be useful in optimizing running parameters for rapid startup and high, stable efficiency.",

Using this system, we developed a method of \"mixed and quantitative proteome analysis\" in which C. albicans and macrophages were simultaneously analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS without the need to isolate the two individual living cells. Two hundred twenty-seven proteins from C. albicans and five proteins from macrophages were identified as candidate interaction-specific molecules. C. albicans seemed to produce glucose through a β-oxidation pathway, a glyoxylate cycle, and gluconeogenesis for escape from macrophages. Up-regulation of stress-related and candidate pathogenic proteins in C. albicans indicated how C. albicans endured the harsh environment inside the macrophages. Down-regulation of apoptosis-associated protein NOA1- and chaperone HSPA1A-syntheses in macrophage indicated that C. albicans was able to escape from macrophages in part by suppressing the production of these macrophage proteins.",

The knowledge of individual biomass concentrations allows for the calculation of biomass specific conversion rates which form the basis of anaerobic digestion models. Only few attempts addressed the absolute quantification of individual biomass concentrations in methanogenic microbial ecosystems which has so far impaired the calculation of biomass specific conversion rates and thus model validation. This study proposes a quantitative PCR (qPCR) approach for the direct determination of individual biomass concentrations in methanogenic microbial associations by correlating the native qPCR signal (cycle threshold, Ct) to individual biomass concentrations (mg dry matter/L). Unlike existing methods, the proposed approach circumvents error-prone conversion factors that are typically used to convert gene copy numbers or cell concentrations into actual biomass concentrations. The newly developed method was assessed and deemed suitable for the determination of individual biomass concentrations in a defined coculture of Desulfovibrio sp. G11 and Methanospirillum hungatei JF1. The obtained calibration curves showed high accuracy, indicating that the new approach is well suited for any engineering applications where the knowledge of individual biomass concentrations is required.",

The endogenous laccase candidate gene (Gtlcc3) was fused with the promoter of the G. trabeum glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-encoding gene and co-transformed with the hpt-bearing pAH marker plasmid.

Moreover, strain L#61 was able to degrade lignin in Japanese cedar wood-containing medium, in contrast to wild-type G. trabeum KU-41 and to a typical white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium. By using strain L#61, direct ethanol production from Japanese cedar wood was improved compared to wild type.

The aim of the present study was to select from a collection of 493 marine-derived fungi the best producer of xylanase in order to evaluate the enzymatic production under different conditions. A total of 112 isolates produced xylanase in solid medium containing xylan as the carbon source, with 31 of them able to produce at least 10 U/mL of the enzyme. The best production (49.41 U/mL) was achieved by the strain LAMAI 31, identified as Aspergillus cf. tubingensis. After confirming the lack of pathogenicity (absence of ochratoxin A and fumonisin B2 production) this fungus was submitted to the experimental design in order to evaluate the effect of different variables on the enzymatic production, with the aim of optimizing culture conditions. Three experimental designs (two Plackett-Burman and one factorial fractional) were applied. The best condition for the enzymatic production was defined, resulting in an increase of 12.7 times in comparison with the initial production during the screening experiments. In the validation assay, the peak of xylanase production (561.59 U/mL) was obtained after 96 h of incubation, being the best specific activity achieved after 72 h of incubation. Xylanase from A. cf. tubingensis LAMAI 31 had optimum pH and temperature at 5.0 and 55 °C, respectively, and was shown to be stable at a range of 40-50 °C, and in pH from 3.6 to 7.0. Results from the present work indicate that A. cf. tubingensis LAMAI 31 can be considered as a new genetic resource for xylanase production.",

    "abstract": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a powerful greenhouse gas emitted from wastewater treatment, as well as natural systems, as a result of biological nitrification and denitrification. While denitrifying bacteria can be a significant source of N2O, they can also reduce N2O to N2. More information on the kinetics of N2O formation and reduction by denitrifying bacteria is needed to predict and quantify their impact on N2O emissions. In this study, kinetic parameters were determined for Paracoccus pantotrophus, a common denitrifying bacterium. Parameters included the maximum specific reduction rates, $$\\hat{q}$$ , growth rates, $${\\hat{\\upmu }}$$ , and yields, Y, for reduction of NO3 − (nitrate) to nitrite (NO2 −), NO2 − to N2O, and N2O to N2, with acetate as the electron donor. The $$\\hat{q}$$ values were 2.9 gN gCOD−1 d−1 for NO3 − to NO2 −, 1.4 gN gCOD−1 d−1 for NO2 − to N2O, and 5.3 gN gCOD−1 d−1 for N2O to N2. The $${\\hat{\\upmu }}$$ values were 2.7, 0.93, and 1.5 d−1, respectively. When N2O and NO3 − were added concurrently, the apparent (extant) kinetics, $$\\hat{q}_{\\text{app}}$$ , assuming reduction to N2, were 6.3 gCOD gCOD−1 d−1, compared to 5.4 gCOD gCOD−1 d−1 for NO3 − as the sole added acceptor. The $${\\hat{\\upmu }}_{\\text{app}}$$ was 1.6 d−1, compared to 2.5 d−1 for NO3 − alone. These results suggest that NO3 − and N2O were reduced concurrently. Based on this research, denitrifying bacteria like P. pantotrophus may serve as a significant sink for N2O. With careful design and operation, treatment plants can use denitrifying bacteria to minimize N2O emissions.",

Organic amendment of PAH contaminated soil with compost and farmyard manure has proven to be efficient for PAH bioremediation mediated by native microorganisms, even though information on the identity of PAH degraders in organic-amended soil is still scarce. Here we provide molecular insight into the bacterial communities in soil amended with compost or farmyard manure for which the degradation mass balances of 13C-labeled pyrene have been recently published and assess the relevant bacterial genera capable of degrading pyrene as a model PAH. We performed statistical analyses of bacterial genera abundance data based on total DNA and RNA (for comparison) extracted from the soil samples. The results revealed complex pyrene degrading communities with low abundance of individual degraders instead of a limited number of abundant key players. The bacterial degrader communities of the soil-compost mixture and soil fertilized with farmyard manure differed considerably in composition albeit showing similar degradation kinetics. Additional analyses were carried out on enrichment cultures and enabled the reconstruction of several nearly complete genomes, thus allowing to link microcosm and enrichment experiments. However, pyrene mineralizing bacteria enriched from the compost or unfertilized soil-compost samples did not dominate pyrene degradation in the soils. Based on the present findings, evaluations of PAH degrading microorganisms in complex soil mixtures with high organic matter content should not target abundant key degrading species, since the specific degraders may be highly diverse, of low abundance, and masked by high bacterial background.",

Genes originating from Synechococcus elongatus strain PCC7942, encoding acyl-ACP/CoA reductase and aldehyde deformylating oxygenase enzymes, were successfully expressed in A. carbonarius, which lead to the production of pentadecane and heptadecane, alkanes that have not been previously produced by this fungus. Titers of 0.2, 0.5 and 2.7 mg/l pentadecane and 0.8, 1.6 and 10.2 mg/l heptadecane were achieved using glucose, Yeast malt and oatmeal media, respectively. Besides producing alkanes, we found elevated levels of internal free fatty acids and triglycerides in the alkane producing transformant. These findings can indicate that a yet unidentified, native fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase channels back the fatty aldehydes into the fatty acid metabolism, thus competing for substrate with the heterologously expressed fatty aldehyde deformylating oxygenase. These findings will potentially facilitate the future application of robust, fungal cell factories for the production of advanced biofuels from various substrates.",

The sensitivity of both assays was 100% when tested on 50 chicken and duck fecal samples from 10 provinces of China. These assays were also tested in field samples, including soil and water collected adjacent to duck farms, and soils fertilized with chicken manure. Poultry mitochondrial DNA was detected in most of these samples, indicating that the assays are a robust method for monitoring environmental contamination with poultry feces.

    "abstract": "Use of thermophilic organisms has a range of advantages, but the significant lack of engineering tools limits their applications. Here we show that β-galactosidase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (BgaB) can be applicable in a range of conditions, including different temperatures and oxygen concentrations. This protein functions both as a marker, promoting colony color development in the presence of a lactose analogue S-gal, and as a reporter enabling quantitative measurement by a simple colorimetric assay. Optimal performance was observed at 70 °C and pH 6.4. The gene was introduced into G. thermoglucosidans. The combination of BgaB expressed from promoters of varying strength with S-gal produced distinct black colonies in aerobic and anaerobic conditions at temperatures ranging from 37 to 60 °C. It showed an important advantage over the conventional β-galactosidase (LacZ) and substrate X-gal, which were inactive at high temperature and under anaerobic conditions. To demonstrate the versatility of the reporter, a promoter library was constructed by randomizing sequences around −35 and −10 regions in a wild type groES promoter from Geobacillus sp. GHH01. The library contained 28 promoter variants and encompassed fivefold variation. The experimental pipeline allowed construction and measurement of expression levels of the library in just 4 days. This β-galactosidase provides a promising tool for engineering of aerobic, anaerobic, and thermophilic production organisms such as Geobacillus species.",

    "abstract": "The inadequate removal of pharmaceuticals and other micropollutants in municipal wastewater treatment plants, as evidenced by their detection of these substances in the aquatic environment has led to the need for sustainable remediation strategies. Laccases possess a number of advantages including a broad substrate spectrum. To identify promoting or inhibitory effects of reaction partners in the remediation processes we tested not only single compounds—as has been described in most studies—but also mixtures of pollutants. The reaction of diclofenac (DCF) and flufenamic acid (FA), mediated by Trametes versicolor laccase resulted in the formation of products, which were more hydrophilic than the respective reactant (reactant concentration of 0.1 mM; laccase activity 0.5 U/ml). Analyses (HPLC, LC/MS) showed that the product 1a and 1b for DCF and FA, respectively, to be a para-benzoquinone imine derivative. The formation of 1a was enhanced by the addition of bisphenol A (BPA). After 6 days 97% more product was formed in the mixture of DCF and BPA compared with DCF tested alone. Product 1a was also detected in experiments with micropollutant-supplemented secondary effluent. Within 24 h 67% and 100% of DCF and BPA were transformed, respectively (25 U/ml). Experiments with a membrane reactor (volume 10 l; phosphate buffer, pH 7) were in good agreement with the results of the laboratory scale experiments (50 ml). EC50-values were also determined. The data support the use of laccases for the removal or detoxification of recalcitrant pollutants. Thus, the enzyme laccase may be a component of an additional environmentally friendly process for the treatment stage of wastewater remediation.",

While various algicidal bacterial strains have been identified, limited studies have explored the influence of bacterial culture conditions on its algicidal activity. Here, the effect of oxygen on the algicidal activity of a novel bacterium JK12, against a model diatom, Phaeodactylum tricornutum (P. tricornutum) was studied. Strain JK12 showed high algicidal activity against P. tricornutum and was identified as Pseudomonas chlororaphis (P. chlororaphis) by 16S ribosomal RNA gene analysis. JK12 culture supernatant exhibited strong algicidal activity while washed JK12 cells showed no obvious activity, indicating that JK12 indirectly attacks algae by secreting extracellular algicidal metabolites. Micro-aerobic culture condition dramatically enhanced the algicidal activity of JK12 by 50%, compared to that cultured under aerobic condition in 24 h. Extracellular metabolomic profiling of JK12 using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed significantly higher amounts of allantoic acid, urocanic acid, cytidine 2',3'-cyclic phosphate, uridine 2',3'-cyclic phosphate, and chlorinated tryptophan in the micro-aerobic culture. This is the first report to demonstrate the important role of oxygen on the algicidal activity of a non-pathogenic strain P. chlororaphis. In addition, the metabolomics analysis provided insights into the algicidal mechanism of P. chlororaphis.",

This research was conducted on HLB infected 10-year-old Kinnow orchard located at Multan, Pakistan. Different classes of antibiotics in various combinations were applied on HLB-infected trees. The antibiotic treatments were applied before flowering in February, during fruit setting in April and at fruit growth stage in June. The different antibiotics combinations used were Ampicillin sodium + Rifampicin, Cefalexin + Rifampicin, Ampicillin sodium + Cefalexin, Ampicillin sodium + Cefalexin + Rifampicin and Control (distilled water). Different fruit qualitative and quantitative attributes were examined. The application of antibiotics significantly decreased 2–11% in flower, June and pre-harvest drops as compared to control. Further, antibiotics increased fruit weight and yield by five times while the juice content, total soluble solids, ripening index, total sugars, phenolic and vitamin C content were also increased in fruits. In addition, total soluble proteins, peroxidase and catalase activities were increased in fruits harvested from antibiotic treated plants compared to control, however the superoxidase dismutase activity was decreased in fruits of antibiotic treated plants. Finally, it is concluded that application of different antibiotics combinations helps in improving the fruit yield and different quality attributes of HLB infected Kinnow trees.",

High rates of mortality and tissue damage have been reported in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with sepsis. Bovine lactoferrin (BLF) is a well-known 80-kDa glycoprotein in the transferrin family that inhibits sepsis in low-birth-weight neonates. The present study investigated the protective effects of BLF in a rat model of sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). The wet/dry ratio, lipid peroxidation, antioxidant markers, total protein, total cell count, inflammatory markers and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels were assessed. Histopathological analysis was also carried out. BLF treatment reduced the wet/dry ratio of lung tissue by 30.7% and 61.3%, and lipid peroxidation by 22.3% and 67%, at concentrations of 100 and 200 mg/kg, respectively. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) and catalase were increased by more than 50% under treatment with 200 mg/kg BLF. Inflammatory markers, neutrophils, lymphocytes and total cell count were reduced by more than 50% under treatment with 200 mg/kg BLF. BLF treatment significantly reduced MPO activity, by 28.2% and 74.3%, at concentrations of 100 and 200 mg/kg, respectively. Neutrophilic infiltration and edema were observed in control rats. However, BLF treatment restored intestinal microvilli to the normal range and reduced inflammatory cell invasion. Collectively, these results suggest that BLF is an effective therapeutic agent against sepsis-induced ALI.",

With this goal, several genes have been identified as promising candidates to confer improved tolerance to S. cerevisiae. In most of the cases, however, the evaluation of the genetic modification was performed only in laboratory strains, that is, in strains that are known to be quite sensitive to various types of stresses. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of overexpressing genes encoding the transcription factor (YAP1) and the mitochondrial NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase (MCR1), either alone or in combination, in an already robust and xylose-consuming industrial strain of S. cerevisiae and evaluated the effect during the fermentation of undiluted and undetoxified spruce hydrolysate. Overexpression of either gene resulted in faster hexose catabolism, but no cumulative effect was observed with the simultaneous overexpression. The improved phenotype of MCR1 overexpression appeared to be related, at least in part, to a faster furaldehyde reduction capacity, indicating that this reductase may have a wider substrate range than previously reported. Unexpectedly a decreased xylose fermentation rate was also observed in YAP1 overexpressing strains and possible reasons behind this phenotype are discussed.",

Using a new in vitro oral mucosa co-culture model, we recently showed a clear inhibition of epithelial wound healing in the presence of an oral microbial community. In this paper, we have used the same model in combination with specific oral microbial species to obtain a better insight into the role of the oral microbiota in wound healing. Monocultures of Klebsiella oxytoca and Lactobacillus salivarius significantly inhibited wound healing with ~20%, whereas Streptococcus mitis and S. oralis enhanced the healing process with ~15% in 24 h. Yet, neither S. oralis or S. mitis were able to counteract the inhibitory effects from K. oxytoca on wound healing. Other tested microbial species had no effect on wound healing. Apart from this species-dependency, the inhibitory effect on wound healing depended on a microbial threshold concentration. Further mechanistic experiments with K. oxytoca excluded different microbial factors and hypothesized that quorum sensing molecules might play a role in the inter-kingdom signalling during wound healing. These results are important for the development of new strategies for the management of (infected) wounds and ulcerations.",

Cells were exposed to sodium chloride to cause osmotic stress as one main environmental stressor bacteria have to cope with when growing in soil. Planktonic cells were more tolerant with a complete inhibition of growth at 0.7 M NaCl, compared to 0.5 M for agar-grown cells. Cell surface hydrophobicity, measured as water contact angles, was significantly higher for agar-grown cells (92°) than for planktonic cells (40°), and increased in the presence of NaCl. Agar-grown cells also showed a significantly higher degree of saturation of membrane fatty acids that increased in the presence of NaCl. These results demonstrate that planktonic and colony grown bacteria show different responses when confronted with osmotic stress suggesting that the tolerance and adaptive mechanisms are dependent on the environmental conditions as well as the initial physiological state.",

    "abstract": "Degradation of lignin by fungi enhances availability of cellulose and hemicellulose in plant waste and thereby increases the amount of carbon source available to these microorganisms. The button mushroom Agaricus bisporus degrades only about half of the lignin in compost and about 40% of the carbohydrates remain unutilized during mushroom cultivation. Here it was assessed whether over-expression of the manganese peroxidase gene mnp1 improves lignin degradation and, as a consequence, carbohydrate breakdown by A. bisporus. Transformants expressing mnp1 under the control of actin regulatory sequences produced MnP activity in malt extract medium, while the parental strain A15 did not. MnP activity was increased 0.3- and 3-fold at casing and after the 2nd flush of a semi-commercial cultivation, respectively, when compared to strain A15. Pyrolysis-GC–MS showed that overexpression of MnP decreased phenylmethane and phenylethane type lignin relative to the phenylpropane type after the 2nd flush. However, it neither affected the syringyl/guaiacyl derived residue ratio nor the ratio of oxidized to non-oxidized lignin residues. Moreover, the carbohydrate content and accessibility was not affected in compost. Notably, the capacity of compost extract to consume the MnP co-factor H2O2 was 4- to 8-fold higher than its production. This may well explain why over-expression of mnp1 did not improve carbohydrate degradation in compost. In fact, availability of H2O2 may limit lignin degradation by wild-type A. bisporus.",

    "abstract": "A simple colorimetric assay is presented for detecting bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV)-RNA based on aggregation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in the presence of charge-neutral peptide nucleic acids (PNA). Free charge-neutral PNA oligomers tended to be adsorbed onto AuNPs and act as a coagulant, whereas hybridizing complementary RNA with PNA disrupted PNA-induced AuNP aggregation, and the NPs remained stable. However, non-complementary RNA did not have this effect, and PNA induced aggregation of the AuNPs that resulted in a color change of the reaction from red to blue. The label-free colorimetric assay developed was estimated to have a 10.48 ng/reaction BVDV-RNA detection limit for the visual assay and 1.05 ng/reaction BVDV-RNA using a spectrophotometer. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for the assay was in accordance with real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and nested RT-PCR results were 98 and 100%, respectively. Absorption of the 520/620 nm ratio was linear, along with an increase in the target RNA concentration of 1.64–52.4 ng/reaction (R2 = 0.992), which showed a linear correlation for the quantitative assay. This study established a rapid visual label and enzyme-free diagnostic assay for detecting BVDV that is applicable in any clinical laboratory.",

    "abstract": "Monascus species are edible fungi due to the production of food colorant and other beneficial compounds. Hence, it has been an attractive thesis to improve their productivities. Increasing numbers of investigations revealed that regulating the activities of histone deacetylases can significantly perturb secondary metabolites (SM) production at a global level. In this study, dihydrocoumarin (DHC, an inhibitor of the Sirtuin family of NAD+-dependent deacetylases) was used to treat Monascus ruber for evaluating its effects on organism growth and SM production. The results revealed that the variation trends of colonial sizes, biomass and mycotoxin were in a dose-dependent manner. Generally, they decreased with the increased DHC concentrations in the designed range. But the variation trend of pigment was different. Comparison of SM profile, three new peaks occurred to the mycelia extractions from DHC-treated strain corresponding to molecular weights 402, 416 and 444, respectively. These three compounds were identified as Monasfluol B, Monascus azaphilone C and acetyl-monasfluol B (a new Monascus chemical pigment structure). In short, DHC can stimulate M. ruber strain to produce more pigment-like polyketides but inhibition of mycotoxin (citrinin).",

In this paper, a novel search algorithm based on crossover elitist preservation mechanism (CEP) for solving protein-ligand docking problems is proposed. The proposed algorithm, namely genetic algorithm with crossover elitist preservation (CEPGA), employ the CEP to keep the elite individuals of the last generation and make the crossover more efficient and robust.

In comparison with GA, LGA and SODOCK in the aspects of lowest energy and highest accuracy, the results of which indicate that the CEPGA is a reliable and successful method for protein-ligand docking problems.",

Gold nanomaterials with different sizes as 2–3 nm small and 9–90 nm (50 nm average size) large were stabilized by LPa via different chemical synthetic strategies. The nanomaterials were fully characterized using atomic force microscope (AFM), transmission electron microscope, ultraviolet–visible absorption spectroscopy, and Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy. Antibiofilm activity of Au-LPa nanomaterials was tested using LPa alone, Au-LPa and unprotected gold nanomaterials against the both biofilm-producing bacteria. The results showed that LPa alone did not inhibit biofilm formation to a significant extent below 0.025 mM, while conjugation with gold nanomaterials displayed manifold enhanced antibiofilm potential against both strains. Moreover, it was also observed that the antibiofilm potency of the Au-LPa nanomaterials varies with size variations of nanomaterials. AFM analysis of biofilms further complemented the assay results and provided morphological aspects of the antibiofilm action of Au-LPa nanomaterials.",

The hydrolysates composition underlies process-related fluctuations and therefore the obtained peptide fingerprint and bioactive properties may vary. To overcome this obstacle and enable the production of specific hydrolysates with selected peptides, a ceramic capillary system was developed and characterized for the continuous production of a consistent peptide composition. Therefore, the protease Alcalase was immobilized on the surface of aminosilane modified yttria stabilized zirconia capillaries with a pore size of 1.5 µm. The loading capacity was 0.3 µg enzyme per mg of capillary with a residual enzyme activity of 43%. The enzyme specific peptide fingerprint produced with this proteolytic capillary reactor system correlated with the degree of hydrolysis, which can be controlled over the residence time by adjusting the flow rate. Common food proteins like casein, sunflower and lupin protein isolates were tested for continuous hydrolysis in the developed reactor system. The peptide formation was investigated by high-performance liquid chromatography. Various trends were found for the occurrence of specific peptides. Some are just intermediately occurring, while others cumulate by time. Thus, the developed continuous reactor system enables the production of specific peptides with desired bioactive properties.",

    "abstract": "L-Ornithine, a non-essential amino acid, has enormous industrial applications in food, pharmaceutical, and chemical industries. Currently, L-ornithine production is focused on microorganism fermentation using Escherichia coli or Corynebacterium glutamicum. In C. glutamicum, development of high L-ornithine producing C. glutamicum was achieved by deletion of argF, but was accompanied by growth deficiency and arginine auxotrophy. L-Arginine has been routinely added to solve this problem; however, this increases production cost and causes feedback inhibition of N-acetyl-L-glutamate kinase activity. To avoid the drawbacks of growth disturbance due to disruption of ArgF, strategies were adopted to attenuate its expression. Firstly, ribosome binding site substitution and start codon replacement were introduced to construct recombinant C. glutamiucm strains, which resulted in an undesirable L-ornithine production titer. Then, we inserted a terminator (rrnB) between argD and argF, which significantly improved L-ornithine production and relieved growth disturbance. Transcription analysis confirmed that a terminator can be used to downregulate expression of argF and simultaneously improve the transcriptional level of genes in front of argF. Using disparate terminators to attenuate expression of argF, an optimal strain (CO-9) with a T4 terminator produced 6.1 g/L of L-ornithine, which is 42.8% higher than that produced by strain CO-1, and is 11.2-fold higher than that of the parent CO strain. Insertion of terminators with gradient termination intensity can be a stable and powerful method to exert precise control of the expression level of argF in the development of L-ornithine producing strains, with potential applications in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.",

Results, the T5 diet resulted in the best (P < 0.05) final body weight, body weight gain, feed conversion ratio, protein efficiency, relative growth rate, and dressed weight. The best (P < 0.05) digestion coefficients were associated with the T4 and T5 diets. Rabbits fed diets supplemented with citric acid alone or with addition of graded levels of whey powder showed significantly lower (P < 0.05) intestinal pH than those fed the T1 diet. The T4 and T5 diets resulted in greater CP and ash in the thigh muscle compared with the T1 and T2 diets. Calcium content in the femur bone was higher (P < 0.05) in the T5 group followed by T4 and T3. The wall of different parts of the small intestine improved in the T4 and T5 groups, showing the greatest increase in the small intestinal villi, intestinal glands, and amount of goblet cells. In conclusion, addition of whey powder (1.5, and 2.25%) increased the growth performance, nutrient digestibility and crude protein content of the thigh muscle, and improved the gut health of growing rabbits and the best level was 2.25% whey powder. Citric acid addition had no positive effect on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, crude protein content of the thigh muscle, and the gut health.",

However, due to the very thick cell wall of B. braunii, traditional chemical/physical downstream processing very often is not as effective as expected and requires high amounts of energy. In this cases, the application of two-phase aqueous-organic solvent systems could be an alternative to cultivate microalgae allowing for a simultaneous extraction of the valuable compounds without significant negative effects on cell growth. Two-phase systems have been applied before, however, there are no studies so far on the mechanisms used by microalgae to survive in contact with solvents present as a second-phase. In this study, the effects of the solvents limonene, n-decane and n-decanol on growth of the microalga B. braunii as well as the adaptive cell response in terms of their phospholipid fatty acid contents were analized. A concentration-dependent negative effect of all three solvents on cell growth was observed. Effects were accompanied by changes of the membrane fatty acid composition of the alga as manifested by a decrease of the unsaturation . In addition, an association was found between the solvent hydrophobicity (given as log octanol-water partition coefficient ([Formula: see text]) values) and their toxic effects, whereby n-decanol and n-decane emerged as the most and least toxic solvent respectively. Among the tested solvents, the latter promises to be the most suitable for a two-phase extraction system.",

During repeated transfer on fresh potato dextrose agar plates containing 100 µg/ml hygromycin B, most transformants lost drug resistance, while the remaining isolates showed stable resistance over five transfers. No drug-resistant colonies appeared in control experiments without DNA or using a promoter-less derivative of the plasmid, indicating that a transient expression of the recombinant hph was driven by the promoter sequence in these unstable drug-resistant transformants. Southern blot analysis of the stable transformants revealed random integration of the plasmid DNA fragment in the chromosome at different copy numbers. This transformation system yielding mostly transient transformants was successfully used for promoter assay experiments, and only a 141-bp fragment was found to be essential for the basic promoter function of glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase gene (gpd) in this fungus. Subsequent mutational analyses suggested that a TATAA sequence is important for the basic promoter function of gpd gene. The promoter assay system will enable the functional analysis of gene expression control sequences quickly and easily, mostly in the absence of undesirable effects from differences in copy number and chromosomal position of an integrated reporter gene among stable transformants.",

Both strains degraded β-1,3-glucan and chitosan, two major polysaccharide components of ascomycetes fungal cell wall, supplemented in the medium. β-1,3-Glucanase was detected in the supernatants of cultures supplemented with different types of glucan. Similarly, chitosanase was detected in cultures supplemented with chitosan. Both the enzyme activities were also detected in cultures containing glucose as a substrate. Live cells of F. oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae that were co-incubated with each anaerobic strain under anaerobic conditions using glucose as a substrate died during incubation. Freeze-dried dead fungal biomass of the pathogen, when added to the culture, supported good growth of both anaerobes and production of both enzymes. Severe and nearly complete degradation of both live and dead fungal cells during incubation with anaerobic bacteria was observed by fluorescence microscopy. When individual anaerobic bacterial strain was co-incubated with live pathogenic fungal cells in wheat bran, a popular material for BSD-treatment, both the strains grew well and killed the fungal pathogen promptly by producing both enzymes.

Heterologous expression of these genes from Caulobacter crescentus into recombinant Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032 and C. glutamicum ATCC 31831 (with an innate pentose transporter, araE) resulted in an efficient bioconversion process to produce xylonic acid from xylose. Process parameters including the design of production medium was optimized using a statistical tool, Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Maximum xylonic acid of 56.32 g/L from 60 g/L xylose, i.e. about 76.67% of the maximum theoretical yield was obtained after 120 h fermentation from pure xylose with recombinant C. glutamicum ATCC 31831 containing the plasmid pVWEx1 xylB . Under the same condition, the production with recombinant C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 (with pVWEx1 xylB ) was 50.66 g/L, i.e. 69% of the theoretical yield. There was no significant improvement in production with the simultaneous expression of xylB and xylC genes together indicating xylose dehydrogenase activity as one of the rate limiting factor in the bioconversion. Finally, proof of concept experiment in utilizing biomass derived pentose sugar, xylose, for xylonic acid production was also carried out and obtained 42.94 g/L xylonic acid from 60 g/L xylose. These results promise a significant value addition for the future bio refinery programs.",

These three strains showed obvious lipase activities to olive oil and L. casei f1 performed highest enzyme activity of 17.8 U/mL. L. casei f1, L. paracasei f2 and L. paracasei f3 could lipolyze the blending oils, peanut oil and sesame oil with diverse degrading rates. The degrading rates to the preferred oils, L. casei f1 to blending oils, L. paracasei f2 to peanut oil and L. paracasei f3 to sesame oil, were 21.2%, 27.3% and 39.6%, respectively. The corresponding oil degrading rates increased as the cell growth and the highest degrading rates were obtained at the stationary phase with the viable count more than 7.5 LogCFU/mL. By GC–MS analysis, L. casei f1, L. paracasei f2 and L. paracasei f3 performed diverse lipolytic capacities to the 12 kinds of fat acids and all of them preferred to hydrolyze the linoleic acid with the degrading rate of 49.11%, 31.83% and 64.44%, respectively. These three strains showed considerable probiotic properties, displaying higher than 10 6 CFU/mL desirable viable count though the simulated gastrointestinal tract, as well as inhibiting six indicator bacteria. These results suggested that the three isolated strains could be considered as novel probiotic candidates and applied in the food industry.",

    "abstract": "Maslinic acid is an active member of pentacyclic triterpenes predominantly found in dietary plants including hawthorn berries and olive fruit skins. It has been reported to show immense pharmacological and biological importance including anticancer property. This research was initiated to explore the anticancer potential of maslinic acid against human neuroblastoma. The effects of maslinic acid on cellular apoptosis, ROS generation, cell migration and invasion, caspase activation and targeting MAPK/ERK signaling pathway were investigated. The proliferation percentage was calculated by performing of MTT assay. AO/EB and annexin V/PI staining assays along with western blotting were used to monitor the apoptosis and expressions of apoptosis connected proteins. Spectrofluorometry was used for ROS monitoring. To assess the anti-metastatic effects of maslinic acid on neuroblastoma cells, transwell chambers assays for migration as well as invasion were executed. Western blotting was implemented to establish the expressions of MAPK/ERK signaling pathway connected proteins. Results evidenced remarkable anticancer potential of maslinic acid against human neuroblastoma. It induced dose as well as time reliant anti-proliferative effects against SHSY-5Y cells selectively. The underlying mechanism of cancer suppressive effects of maslinic acid was found to mediate via caspase-dependent apoptosis. Further, ROS production amplified terrifically with exposure of SHSY-5Y to higher maslinic acid doses. Cell migration and invasion in SHSY-5Y cells were both reduced remarkably by maslinic acid. Finally, the activity of proteins associated with MAPK/ERK signaling pathway was found to be significantly reduced with increasing maslinic acid doses. In conclusion, it was observed that maslinic acid possesses a great anti-neuroblastoma potential and could be considered for its chemotherapy provided further investigations are recommended.",

The PGH activity, stability, and the antibacterial activity of the spore-displayed p75 (CotG-p75) protein were also investigated. The PGH activity of the CotG-p75 against peptidoglycan extracted from B. subtilis was confirmed by the ninhydrin test.

In addition, the antibacterial activity of CotG-p75 against Listeria monocytogenes was evaluated by a time-kill assay. After 6 h incubation in phosphate-buffered saline, CotG-p75 reduced the number of viable cells of L. monocytogenes by up to 2.0 log. Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed that the cell wall of L. monocytogenes was partially damaged by the treatment with CotG-p75.

In this research work 200 samples were collected from soil, plant surfaces (leaves, flowers and fruits), waste oils from traditional oil milling houses and dairy products (cheese, milk and yoghurt) in Ethiopia. Three hundred and forty yeast colonies were isolated from these samples. By applying Sudan III staining tests, 18 strains were selected as possible oleaginous yeasts. The 18 strains were identified and characterized for their lipid production as a feedstock for biodiesel production in the future. They were identified using morphological and physiological methods as well as sequencing the 3'end of the small-subunit rRNA gene, the internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS; ITS 1, ITS 2 and the intervening 5.8S rRNA gene), and the D1/D2 domain of the 26S rRNA gene. The 18 yeasts were identified as Cutaneotrichosporon curvatus (syn, Cryptococcus curvatus) (PY39), Rhodotorula kratochvilovae (syn, Rhodosporidium kratochvilovae) (SY89), Rhodotorula dairenensis (SY94) and Rhodotourula mucilaginosa (SY09, SY18, SY20, PY21, PY23, PY25, SY30, PY32, SY43, PY44, SY52, PY55, PY61, SY75 and PY86). Under nitrogen-limited cultivation conditions, R. mucilaginosa PY44 produced the highest biomass (15.10 ± 0.54 g/L), while R. mucilaginosa PY32 produced the lowest biomass (10.32 ± 0.18 g/L). The highest lipid yield of 6.87 ± 0.62 g/L and lipid content of 46.51 ± 0.70 % were attained by C. curvatus (syn, C. curvatus) PY39. On the other hand, R. mucilaginosa PY61 gave the lowest lipid yield (2.06 ± 0.52 g/L) and R. mucilaginosa SY52 gave the lowest lipid content of 16.99 ± 0.85 %. The results in this research work suggest that much more oleaginous yeasts can be isolated from Ethiopian environment.

The results showed that the dominant product of S. bovis S1 was lactate at both pH, the production depended on the starch level, and more lactate was produced at pH 6.5 than that at pH 5.5 (P < 0.001). At pH 5.5, the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and α-amylase (α-AMY), their abundances, the relative expressions of LDH, PFL (gene encoding pyruvate formate-lyase), CCPA (gene encoding global catabolite control protein A) and α-AMY genes were higher than those at pH 6.5 (P < 0.05), whereas the concentration of fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FDP) was lower. The activity of LDH, α-AMY and FDP, and the relative expressions of LDH, PFL, CCPA and α-AMY genes were, in general, positively related to the starch level. The canonical regression analysis indicated that the pH had more profound effect compared with the starch level, in terms of the acid productions, enzyme activity and gene expressions. It was concluded that the fermentation of S. bovis was regulated at the transcription level in response to both pH and substrate starch concentration, but more sensitive to pH changes.",

In order to accomplish this, we analyzed both, the expression of five laccase genes by real time RT-qPCR, and also the laccase activity and isoforms patterns during the time-course of a Pleurotus ostreatus submerged fermentation supplemented with either acetyl yellow G (AYG) or remazol brilliant blue R (RBBR) dyes. For the purpose of obtaining a stable reference gene for optimal normalization of RT-quantitative PCR gene expression assays, we tested four candidate reference genes. As a result of this analysis, gpd was selected as reference index for data normalization. The addition of dyes had an induction effect on the enzymatic activity and also modified the zymogram profile. Fermentation with RBBR showed the highest laccase activity and number of isoforms along the course of the fermentation. Laccase gene expression profiles displayed up/down regulation along the fermentation time in four laccase genes (pox4, pox3, poxa1b and pox2), while pox1 was not expressed in either of the fermentation conditions. AYG addition caused the highest induction and repression levels for genes pox3 and poxa1b respectively. The expression level for all genes in the presence of RBBR were lower than in AYG, being in both conditions this response growth time dependent. These results show the influence of the nature of dyes on the induction level of laccase activity and on the differential regulation of the laccase genes expression in P. ostreatus.",

Non-enzymatic hydrolysis occurred under conditions in which buffers with pH 12 and 13 were added or temperature of 50 °C and above. Different concentrations of metal ions or detergents alone did not cause the film hydrolysis. The depolymerizing activity of lipases on P(3HB-co-4HB) was optimum in the pH range of 6–8 and at temperatures between 30 and 50 °C. Addition of metal ions and detergents in different concentrations was also shown to cause variable effects on the depolymerizing activity of commercial lipases. Pancreatic extracts from both mouse and chicken showed similar depolymerizing activity as the commercial lipases on the P(3HB-co-4HB) film. The presence of lipolytic enzymes in the organ extracts was confirmed with another lipase activity assay, p-nitrophenyl laurate assay. For the first time this has produced a direct evidence for the involvement of lipase-like enzymes from animal in the degradation of this PHA. Lipase is most likely the enzyme from pancreas that was involved in the degradation.",

The carbon flux and factor(s) restricting HA yield were not well understood. Here, we investigated the function of genes involved in sucrose metabolism and identified targets limiting HA yield, which were exploited to construct efficient S. zooepidemicus strains for HA production. The sucrose uptake was addressed by deletion of scrA and scrB, which encodes sucrose-PTS permease and sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase, respectively. We found that scrB was essential for the growth of S. zooepidemicus and HA biosynthesis, and accumulation of sucrose-6-phosphate was toxic. ΔscrB could not grow in THY-sucrose medium, while ΔscrA and ΔscrAΔscrB showed negligible growth defects. Overexpression of scrA significantly reduced biomass and HA production, while overexpression of scrB resulted in 26% increase of biomass and 30% increase of HA yield. We revealed that fructose-6-phosphate for HA biosynthesis mainly originates from glucose-6-phosphate. Deletion of scrK, a gene encoding hexokinase, led to 11% reduction of biomass and 12% decrease of HA yield, while deletion of hasE, a gene encoding phosphoglucoisomerase, resulted in the abolishment of HA biosynthesis and a significantly slow growth. We found that HA biosynthesis could be improved by directing carbon flux to fructose-6-phosphate. Deletion of fruA encoding the EII of fructose-PTS and fruK encoding phosphofructokinase showed no apparent effect on cell growth, but resulted in 22 and 27% increase of HA yield, respectively. Finally, a strain with 55% increase of HA was constructed by overexpression of scrB in ΔfruK. These results provide a solid foundation for further metabolic engineering of S. zooepidemicus for highly efficient HA production.",

The reads were assembled de novo by hierarchical genome assembly process (HGAP) algorithm version 2. Genes were annotated by NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline. The generated genome sequence was 4,979,656 bp with an average G+C content of 67.45%. Calculation of ANI confirmed previous classification that strain YC-RL2 is G. alkanivorans.

A phthalate degradation operon could not be identified in the genome indicating that strain YC-RL2 possesses a novel way of phthalate degradation. A total of 203 and 22 CDSs were annotated as esterase/hydrolase and dioxygenase genes respectively.

    "abstract": "Flavonoid is one of the widespread groups of plant secondary metabolites that provide several health benefits. However, the explicit mechanism of flavonoid biosynthesis in plants largely remains unclear. Chalcone isomerase an important class of enzyme presents crucial role during flavonoid metabolism in many plants. Here, we isolated the full-length cDNA (1161 bp) of a novel Chalcone Isomerase from safflower encoding 217 amino acid polypeptide using oligos from 5' and 3' ends. The result of Sanger sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that CtCHI is highly homologous to other plants, including typical polyadenylation signals AATAA and Poly A tail. The transient expression in tobacco mesophyll cells using Green Fluorescent Protein tagging determined the subcellular localization of CtCHI in cell membrane and nucleus. The CtCHI ectopic expression in different safflower varieties at different flowering stages showed that CtCHI were found in abundance at the bud stage of Jihong No. 1. Further correlation analysis between CtCHI expression and flavonoid accumulation at various flowering phases suggested that CtCHI might play a potential role during flavonoid biosynthesis in safflower. In addition, the overexpression of pBASTA-CtCHI in transgenic Arabidopsis infiltrated with floral dip transformation showed relatively higher expression level and increased flavonoid accumulation than wild type. Moreover, the in vitro enzymatic activity and HPLC analysis of transgenic Arabidopsis confirmed the de novo biosynthesis of Rutin. Taken together, our findings laid the foundation of identifying an important gene that might influence flavonoid metabolism in safflower.",

The Y3+ resistant fungus was identified as Penicillium sp.

However, the fungus was able to remove 99% of Y3+ during the growth process, at an initial concentration of less than 600 μM. Bioaccumulation of Y was observed on the cell surface of the ZD28 strain by elemental mapping using scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy.

The ability of Pseudomonas putida PTCC 1694 (bacteria) and Pleurotus ostreatus IRAN 1781C (fungus) to treat contaminated gas stream with toluene and its biological degradation was compared under similar operating conditions. For this purpose, a biofilter on the laboratory scale was designed and constructed and the tests were carried out in two stages. The first stage, bacterial testing, lasted 20 days and the second stage, fungal testing, lasted 16 days. Inlet loading rates (IL) for bacterial and fungal biofilters were 21.62 ± 6.04 and 26.24 ± 7.35 g/m 3 h respectively. In general, fungal biofilter showed a higher elimination capacity (EC) than bacterial biofilter (18.1 ± 6.98 vs 13.7 ± 4.7 g/m 3 h). However, the pressure drop in the fungal biofilter was higher than the bacterial biofilter (1.26 ± 0.3 vs 1 ± 0.3 mm water), which was probably due to the growth of the mycelium. Fungal biofiltration showed a better performance in the removal of toluene from the air stream.",

    "abstract": "Peatlands have acted as C-sinks for millennia, storing large amounts of carbon, of which a significant amount is yearly released as methane (CH4). Sphagnum mosses are a key genus in many peat ecosystems and these mosses live in close association with methane-oxidizing and nitrogen-fixing microorganisms. To disentangle mechanisms which may control Sphagnum-associated methane-oxidation and nitrogen-fixation, we applied four treatments to Sphagnum mosses from a pristine peatland in Finland: nitrogen fertilization, phosphorus fertilization, CH4 addition and light. N and P fertilization resulted in nutrient accumulation in the moss tissue, but did not increase Sphagnum growth. While net CO2 fixation rates remained unaffected in the N and P treatment, net CH4 emissions decreased because of enhanced CH4 oxidation. CH4 addition did not affect Sphagnum performance in the present set-up. Light, however, clearly stimulated the activity of associated nitrogen-fixing and methane-oxidizing microorganisms, increasing N2 fixation rates threefold and CH4 oxidation rates fivefold. This underlines the strong connection between Sphagnum and associated N2 fixation and CH4 oxidation. It furthermore indicates that phototrophy is a strong control of microbial activity, which can be directly or indirectly.",

In this study, the growth and degradation kinetics of Acinetobacter junii LH-1-1 and Klebsiella pneumoniae BPBA052 during deltamethrin and 3-PBA degradation were established, respectively. When the inoculum proportion of the strains LH-1-1 and BPBA052 was 7.5:2.5, and LH-1-1 was inoculated 24 h before inoculation of strain BPBA052, 94.25% deltamethrin was degraded and 9.16 mg/L of 3-PBA remained within 72 h, which was 20.36% higher and 10.25 mg/L lesser than that in monoculture of LH-1-1, respectively. And the half-life of deltamethrin was shortened from 38.40 h to 24.58 h. Based on gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde, 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic butyl dacyl ester, and phenol were identified as metabolites during deltamethrin degradation in co-culture. This is the first time that a co-culture degradation pathway of deltamethrin has been proposed based on these identified metabolites. Bioremediation of deltamethrin-contaminated soils with co-culture of strains LH-1-1 and BPBA052 significantly enhanced deltamethrin degradation and 3-PBA removal. This study provides a platform for further studies on deltamethrin and 3-PBA biodegradation mechanism in co-culture, and it also proposes a promising approach for efficient bioremediation of environment contaminated by pyrethroid pesticides and their associated metabolites.",

Garcinol is a polyisoprenylated benzophenone found in the fruit of Garcinia indica , which is abundant in tropical regions. This fruit contains high levels of garcinol, isoxanthochymol, isogarcinol, hydroxycitric acid and xanthochymol. Garcinol and hydroxycitric acid have been shown to have antioxidant effects. In this study, rats were assigned to sham, control, low-dose, high-dose and positive control groups. Hemodynamic and apoptotic markers were evaluated, and histopathological analysis was conducted. The mRNA and protein levels of caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2 and cleaved caspase-3 were quantified. Garcinol treatment increased the heart rate and improved the maximum rate of increase in left-ventricle (LV) pressure (+d p /d t max ), maximum rate of decrease in LV pressure (–d p /d t max ), LV ejection fraction and LV systolic pressure in rats with induced heart failure. Garcinol treatment reversed body, liver and heart weight changes, resulting in returns to near-normal levels. In the garcinol treatment group, the number of broken fibers, extent of inflammatory cell infiltration and rate of apoptosis remained within normal ranges. Garcinol reduced the cross-sectional areas of cardiomyocytes, and reduced interstitial fibrosis to a normal level. The mRNA and protein levels of cleaved caspase-3, caspase-3 and Bax were reduced, whereas those of Bcl-2 were increased, following high-dose (100 mg/kg) garcinol treatment. These findings suggest that garcinol effectively prevents apoptosis in rats with isoproterenol-induced heart failure and in cardiac H9C2 cells.",

    "abstract": "Fenvalerate is a pyrethroid insecticide with rapid action, strong targeting, broad spectrum, and high efficiency. However, continued use of fenvalerate has resulted in its widespread presence as a pollutant in surface streams and soils, causing serious environmental pollution. Pesticide residues in the soil are closely related to food safety, yet little is known regarding the kinetics and metabolic behaviors of fenvalerate. In this study, a fenvalerate-degrading microbial strain, CD-9, isolated from factory sludge, was identified as Citrobacter freundii based on morphological, physio-biochemical, and 16S rRNA sequence analysis. Response surface methodology analysis showed that the optimum conditions for fenvalerate degradation by CD-9 were pH 6.3, substrate concentration 77 mg/L, and inoculum amount 6% (v/v). Under these conditions, approximately 88% of fenvalerate present was degraded within 72 h of culture. Based on high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, ten metabolites were confirmed after the degradation of fenvalerate by strain CD-9. Among them, o-phthalaldehyde is a new metabolite for fenvalerate degradation. Based on the identified metabolites, a possible degradation pathway of fenvalerate by C. freundii CD-9 was proposed. Furthermore, the enzyme localization method was used to study CD-9 bacteria and determine that its degrading enzyme is an intracellular enzyme. The degradation rate of fenvalerate by a crude enzyme solution for over 30 min was 73.87%. These results showed that strain CD-9 may be a suitable organism to eliminate environmental pollution by pyrethroid insecticides and provide a future reference for the preparation of microbial degradation agents and environmental remediation.",

Challenge and hemolysis experiments showed that the E. faecium R8 strain had no toxicity to the crucian carp. Bacteriostatic experiment showed that this isolate obviously inhibited the growth of Aeromonas veronii and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. The proliferation of E. faecium R8 strain occurred after exposure to various growth conditions such as at pH values from 2.0 to 4.0 for 8 h, bile concentrations from 0.2 to 1.2% and high temperature of 80 °C. This bacterial strain grew best under the condition of 37 °C, pH 7.0 and salinity 30 ppt, and its growth curve exhibited four distinct phases. These results showed that the E. faecium R8 strain had potential probiotic characteristics and could be used as a candidate strain for aquatic probiotics.",

We investigated the anti-quorum sensing activity of sub-minimum inhibitory concentration (sub-MIC) of copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate-ciprofloxacin (Cu-CIP) complex and free ciprofloxacin (free-CIP) against P. aeruginosa PAO1. Copper-CIP complex was synthesized and its characterization was assessed using spectroscopic methods and single crystal X-ray analysis. The effect of sub-MIC (1/4 and 1/16 MIC) concentrations of Cu-CIP and free-CIP on cell growth, biofilm formation, motility, alginate and pyocyanin production, H 2 O 2 susceptibility and expression of QS circuit genes lasI and lasR in PAO1 was determined. Minimum inhibitory concentration of Cu-CIP complex and free-CIP was determined as 0.125 µg/ml. Copper-CIP complex did not show significant effect on the cell growth at concentrations of 1/4 and 1/16 MIC. However, sub-MIC concentrations (1/4 and 1/16 MIC) of Cu-CIP showed the significant reduction in violacein production, motility, biofilm formation, alginate and pyocyanin production and sensitivity to H 2 O 2 in a concentration dependent manner (P &lt; 0.001). Copper-CIP at the concentration of 1/4 MIC showed the greatest reduction in lasI and lasR transcriptional expression (89.5% and 96.2% respectively). Considering the biological effects of Cu-CIP complex and its inhibitory activity on QS related virulence traits at low concentrations (0.03 and 0.007 µg/ml), it may be used as an effective approach in the management of infections caused by P. aeruginosa.",

The DPO system-based multiplex RT-PCR method simplified the primer design and did not require optimization of the annealing temperature. Specificity analysis revealed that the method could specifically detect TGEV, PEDV, PRV-A, PDCoV, and SADS-CoV without any cross-amplification of other circulating swine viruses. The limit of detection of the method was as low as 10 3 –10 4 copies/μL plasmid of each virus. The method also had good repeatability, and obvious results were seen in three repeat experiments with an interval of 45 days. This optimized multiplex RT-PCR method was used to evaluate 181 clinical swine samples that were collected from four provinces of China between September 2016 and August 2018. The results showed that the positive detection rates of PEDV, PDCoV, SADS-CoV, PRV-A, and TGEV were 30.94% (56/181), 17.67% (32/181), 11.6% (21/181), 9.39% (17/181), and 0.55% (1/181), respectively. Mixed infection of two or more viruses was also common. The DPO system-based multiplex RT-PCR could be a useful tool for detecting enteric virus infections. This method has the advantages of easy operation, low cost, high detection efficiency, and short running time for early diagnosis in clinical cases.",

The photocatalytic method on the basis of bacterial inactivation seems to be a suitable disinfectant due to the lack of by-products formation. Herein, g-C 3 N 4 /Fe 3 O 4 /Ag nanocomposite combined with UV-light irradiation was applied for the inactivation two well-known bacteria namely, E. coli and B. subtilis . The nanocomposite was prepared by a hydrothermal method, and subsequently it was characterized by XRD, FT-IR, SEM, EDX and PL analyses. The optimum conditions established for the inactivation of both bacteria were as follows: nanocomposite dosage 3 g/L and bacterial density of 10 3 CFU/mL. In the meantime, the efficient inactivation of E. coli and B. subtilis took 30 and 150 min, respectively. The results also revealed that inactivation rate dropped with an increase in the bacterial density. It is also pointed out that OH˚ was found out to be the main radical species involved in the inactivation process. Finally, the kinetic results indicated that the inactivation of E. coli and B. subtilis followed the Weibull model. It is concluded that C 3 N 4 /Fe 3 O 4 /Ag nanocomposite along with UV-light irradiation is highly effective in inactivating E. coli and B. subtilis bacteria in the aqueous solutions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Microbial degradation of recalcitrant alkanes under anaerobic conditions results in the accumulation of heavy oil fraction in oil reservoirs. Hydroxylation of alkanes is an important activation mechanism under anaerobic conditions, but the diversity and distribution of the responsible microorganisms in the subsurface environment are still unclear. The lack of functional gene polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers and commercially available intermediate degradation chemical compounds are the major obstacles for this research. In this investigation, PCR primers for the ahyA gene (encoding alkane hydroxylase) were designed, evaluated, and improved based on the nucleotide sequences available. Using microbial genomic DNA extracted from oil-contaminated soil and production water samples of oil reservoirs, ahyA gene nucleotide sequences were amplified and retrieved successfully from production water sample Z3-25 of Shengli oilfield. Additionally, the signature biomarker of 2-acetylalkanoic acid was detected in both Shengli and Jiangsu oilfields. These results demonstrate that anaerobic hydroxylation is an active mechanism used by microorganisms to degrade alkanes in oxygen-depleted oil reservoirs. This finding expands the current knowledge of biochemical reactions about alkane degradation in subsurface ecosystems. In addition, the PCR primers designed and tested in this study serve as an effective molecular tool for detecting the microorganisms responsible for anaerobic hydroxylation of alkanes in this and other ecosystems.",

The present study aimed to investigate the antibacterial and anti-virulence activities of theaflavins (TFs) to Streptococcus mutans UA159 as well as the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that TFs were capable of suppressing the acid production, cell adherence, water-insoluble exopolysaccharides production, and biofilm formation by S. mutans UA159 with a dosage-dependent manner while without influencing the cell growth. By a genome-wide transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq), we found that TFs attenuated the biofilm formation of S. mutans UA159 by inhibiting glucosyltransferases activity and the production of glucan-binding proteins (GbpB and GbpC) instead of directly blocking the expression of genes coding for glucosyltransferases. Further, TFs inhibited the expression of genes implicated in peptidoglycan synthesis, glycolysis, lipid synthesis, two-component system, signaling peptide transport ( comA ), oxidative stress response, and DNA replication and repair, suggesting that TFs suppressed the virulence factors of S. mutans UA159 by affecting the signal transduction and cell envelope stability, and weakening the ability of cells on oxidative stress resistance. In addition, an upregulated expression of the genes involved in protein biosynthesis, amino acid metabolism, and transport system upon TFs treatment indicated that cells increase the protein synthesis and nutrients uptake as one self-protective mechanism to cope with stress caused by TFs. The results of this study increase our current understanding of the anti-virulence activity of TFs on S. mutans and provide clues for the use of TFs in the prevention of dental caries.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Different types of mulching film could variously influence soil properties and plant growth. Yet, surprisingly few studies have investigated the effects of mulching film upon soil microbial diversity and community structure. In this research, two kinds of mulching film, a traditional PE (polyethylene) mulching film and a degradable PBAT ((Poly [butyleneadipate- co -terephthalate])) mulching film, were applied to cotton ( Gossypium spp.) plants grown in Xinjiang Province, China. The respective influence of the two mulching films on the cotton’s soil microbial (bacteria and fungi) diversity and community were investigated. The results showed that applying the PBAT mulching film could significantly alter the diversity of non-rhizosphere soil fungi when compared to using the PE mulching film. However, neither the PE nor PBAT mulching film had any significant influence on the diversity of soil bacteria and rhizosphere soil fungi. Nevertheless, soil microbial community composition differed under the PBAT mulching film treatment vis-à-vis the PE mulching film treatment. The abundance of Gibellulopsis was higher under the PBAT than PE mulching film treatment. Our study’s findings provided an empirical basis for the further application of degradable PBAT mulching film for the sustainable development of cotton crops.",

Hence, the best growing hairy root line in terms of growth rate was selected and subcultured for treatment with elicitors. Then, at the end of the log phase of growth, chitosan (100, 200, and 400 mg/L), salicylic acid (100, 200, and 300 mM), and ultrasound (1, 2, and 4 min) were applied to hairy roots culture medium. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed that the content of galegine was significantly increased after elicitation compared with the control. Thus, the highest content of galegine (14.55 mg/g FW) was obtained 2 days after elicitation when ultrasonic waves were applied to the hairy root culture medium for 4 min. Also, elicitation resulted in a significant increase in the content of total phenol, flavonoid, H2O2 and MDA compared with the control. So that the highest total flavonoid content was obtained in hairy roots that were treated with ultrasonic waves for 4 min and harvested 2 days after elicitation; while, application of 400 mg/L chitosan for 4 days resulted in the highest total phenol (16.84 mg/g FW).",

The degrading enzymatic activities of macroalgal epiphytes are of paramount interest for the industrial by-product sector and biomass resource applications. We characterized the polysaccharide hydrolytic profile of bacterial isolates obtained from three macroalgal species: the red macroalgae Asparagopsis taxiformis and Sphaerococcus coronopifolius (Rhodophyceae) and the brown Halopteris scoparia (Phaeophyceae), sampled in South Portugal. Bacterial enrichment cultures supplemented with chlorinated aliphatic compounds, typically released by marine algae, were established using as inoculum the decaying biomass of the three macroalgae, obtaining a collection of 634 bacterial strains. Although collected from the same site and exposed to the same seawater seeding microbiota, macroalgal cultivable bacterial communities in terms of functional and phylogenetic diversity showed host specificity. Isolates were tested for the hydrolysis of starch, pectin, alginate and agar, exhibiting a different hydrolytic potential according to their host: A. taxiformis showed the highest percentage of active isolates (91%), followed by S. coronopifolius (54%) and H. scoparia (46%). Only 30% of the isolates were able to degrade starch, while the other polymers were degraded by 55–58% of the isolates. Interestingly, several isolates showed promiscuous capacities to hydrolyze more than one polysaccharide. The isolate functional fingerprint was statistically correlated to bacterial phylogeny, host species and enrichment medium. In conclusion, this work depicts macroalgae as holobionts with an associated microbiota of interest for blue biotechnologies, suggesting isolation strategies and bacterial targets for polysaccharidases’ discovery.",

    "abstract": "Natural soil has the ability to suppress the soil-borne pathogen to a certain extent, and the assemblage of soil microbiome plays a crucial role in maintaining such ability. Long-term monoculture accelerates the forms of soil microbiome and leads to either disease conducive or suppressive soils. Here, we explored the impact of soil conditions on bacterial wilt disease (healthy or diseased) under long-term tobacco monoculture on the assemblage of bacterial and fungal communities in bulk and rhizosphere soils during the growth periods. With Illumina sequencing, we compared the bacterial and fungal composition of soil samples from tobacco bacterial wilt diseased fields and healthy fields in three growth periods. We found that Proteobacteria and Ascomycota were the most abundant phylum for bacteria and fungi, respectively. Factors of soil conditions and tobacco growth periods can significantly influence the microbial composition in bulk soil samples, while the factor of soil conditions mainly determined the microbial composition in rhizosphere soil samples. Next, rhizosphere samples were further analyzed with LEfSe to determine the discriminative taxa affected by the factor of soil conditions. For bacteria, the genus Ralstonia was found in the diseased soils, whereas the genus Flavobacterium was the only shared taxon in healthy soils; for fungi, the genus Chaetomium was the most significant taxon in healthy soils. Besides, network analysis confirmed that the topologies of networks of healthy soils were higher than that of diseased soils. Together, our results suggest that microbial assemblage in the rhizosphere will be largely affected by soil conditions especially after long-term monoculture.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 currently is the main cause of the severe acute respiratory disease and fatal outcomes in human beings worldwide. Several genes are used as targets for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, including the RDRP, N, and E genes. The present study aimed to determine the RDRP, N, and E genes expressions of SARS-CoV- 2 in clinical samples. For this purpose, 100 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples were collected from diagnostic laboratories of Mazandaran province, Iran. After RNA extraction, the real-time reverse transcription PCR (real-time RT-PCR) assay was performed for differential gene expressions' analysis of N, E, and RDRP. The threshold cycle (Ct) values for N, RDRP, and E targets of 100 clinical samples for identifying SARS-CoV-2 were then evaluated using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). This result suggests N gene as a potential target for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2, since it was observed to be highly expressed in the nasopharyngeal or oropharynges of COVID-19 patients (P < 0.0001). Herein, we showed that SARS-CoV- 2 genes were differentially expressed in the host cells. Therefore, to reduce obtaining false negative results and to increase the sensitivity of the available diagnostic tests, the target genes should be carefully selected based on the most expressed genes in the cells.",

    "abstract": "Abstract According to a 2019 report from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was listed as one of the “serious threats” that had become a global public challenge in hospitals and community. Biofilm-associated infections and refractory persisters of S. aureus also impede the effectiveness of conventional antibiotics that have greatly increased difficulty in clinical therapy. There is an urgent need to develop new antimicrobials with antibiofilm and anti-persister capacities, and drug repurposing is the most effective and most economical solution to the problem. The present study profiles the antimicrobial activity of ceritinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, against S. aureus in vitro and in vivo. We investigated the antimicrobial efficacy of ceritinib against planktonic and persistent S. aureus by a time-killing kinetics assay. Then, antibiofilm effect of ceritinib was assessed by crystal violet staining and laser confocal microscope observation. Ceritinib showed biofilm inhibition and mature biofilm eradication, and possesses robust bactericidal activity against S. aureus persisters. We also evaluated antimicrobial efficacy in vivo using a subcutaneous abscess infection model. Ceritinib ameliorated infection in a subcutaneous abscess mouse model and only showed negligible systemic toxicity in vivo. Mechanism exploration was conducted by transmission electron microscopy, fluorescently labeled giant unilamellar vesicle assays, and a series of fluorescent dyes. In conclusion, we find ceritinib represents potential bactericidal activity against MRSA by disrupting cell membrane integrity and inducing reactive oxygen species production, suggesting ceritinib has the potential to treat MRSA-related infections.",

Actinobacillus succinogenes can ferment various carbon sources and accumulate relatively high concentrations of SA, but few reliable genetic engineering tools exist for A. succinogenes and this has hindered strain improvement to increase SA production for industrial application. Two different repressors, endonuclease-deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) from Streptococcus pyogenes and Cpf1 (dCpf1) from Francisella tularensis , were applied to construct a CRISPRi system in A. succinogenes . Codon-optimized Cas9 and native Cpf1 were successfully expressed in A. succinogenes , and the corresponding sgRNA and crRNA expression elements, promoted by the fumarate reductase promoter, frd , were introduced into the CRISPRi plasmid. The highest repression of the ackA gene (encoding acetate kinase) and thereby acetic acid production (~ eightfold) was achieved by the dCpf1-based CRISPRi system, in which the mutation site, E1006A acted at the start of the coding region of ackA, the gene which regulates acetic acid biosynthesis. Compared with the ackA gene knockout mutant, cell growth was moderately improved and SA production increased by 6.3%. Further, the SA titer and productivity in a 3 L fermenter reached 57.06 g/L and 1.87 g/L/h, and there was less acetic acid production. A dCpf1-based CRISPRi-mediated gene repression system was successfully established for the first time, providing a simple and effective tool for studying functional genomics in A. succinogenes and optimizing SA production.",

The best isolates able to effectively degrade IPU were selected, characterized, and identified as Pseudomonas putida and Acinetobacter johnsonii. The catechol 1, 2-dioxygenase enzyme's catA gene was amplified, cloned, and expressed in E. coli M15. The Expressed E. coli showed high degradation efficiency (44.80%) as analyzed by HPLC after 15 days of inoculation in comparison to P. putida (21.60%). The expression of the catA gene in P. putida and expressed E. coli was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The results displayed a significant increase in the mRNA levels of the catA gene by increasing the incubation time with IPU. Hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) mass spectrometry analysis revealed that three intermediate metabolites, 1-(4-isopropylphenyl)-3-methylurea (MDIPU), 4-Isopropylaniline (4-IA) and 1-(4-isopropylphenyl) urea (DDIPU) were generated by both P. putida and expressed E. coli. In addition, IPU-induced catA activity was detected in both P. putida and expressed E. coli. The supernatant of both P. putida and expressed E. coli had a significant influence on weed growth. The study clearly exhibited that P. putida and expressed E. coli were capable of metabolizing IPU influentially and thus could be utilized for bioremediation and biodegradation technology development.",

This study investigated the use of silver nanoparticles biosynthesized in a culture filtrate of Lactobacillus acidophilus as antimicrobials. UV–visual spectrophotometry, Fourier-transform-infrared spectroscopy, X-ray power diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy have all validated the findings. The biosynthesized nanoparticles ranged in size from 33 to 90 nm. The cytotoxicity of the nanosilver generated was then investigated using nine 200 g BW rats separated into three groups. When compared to the control group, the treated rats showed little signs of toxicity; parameters of physiological function, including alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, albumin, creatinine, and urea were significantly different in treated and non-treated animals. Moreover, the antibacterial role of the generated silver nanoparticles was examined in multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogenic bacteria, Proteus vulgaris , Escherichia coli , Staphylococcus aureus , and Klebsiella pneumoniae , revealing high antibacterial activity against the examined bacteria. For more demonstration of the effect of the nanosilver on transcription and gene regulation of treated and non-treated bacteria differential display droplet digital-PCR was used, and the results revealed that several genes were up- and down-regulated. Some genes were selected for DNA sequencing and according to the sequence analysis, these genes were mec A, beta-lactam, and unidentified protein genes, and these have been deposited in the GenBank Database with the following accession numbers: Staphylococcus MZ748472 and Klebsiella MZ748473.

In this study, mycelium of Flammulina filiformis was exposed to blue light, red light and dark conditions, and then the comparative metabolome and transcriptome analysis was applied to explore metabolic regulation mechanism of F. filiformis under blue light and red light conditions. The yield of the fruiting body of F. filiformis under blue light condition was much higher than that under dark and red light conditions. Metabolome analysis showed that blue light treatment reduced the concentrations of many low molecular weight carbohydrates in the pilei, but it promoted the accumulation of some low molecular weight carbohydrates in the stipes. Blue light also decreased the accumulation of organic acids in the stipes. Blue light treatment reduced the levels of tyrosine and tryptophan in the stipes, but it largely promoted the accumulation of lysine in this organ. In the stipes of F. filiformis , blue light shifted metabolite flow to synthesis of lysine and carbohydrates through inhibiting the accumulation of aromatic amino acids and organic acids, thereby enhancing its nutritional and medicinal values. The transcriptome analysis displayed that blue light enhanced accumulation of lysine in fruiting body of F. filiformis through downregulation of lysine methyltransferase gene and L-lysine 6-monooxygenase gene. Additionally, in the stipes, blue light upregulated many hydrolase genes to improve the ability of the stipe to biodegrade the medium and elevated the growth rate of the fruiting body.",

The best docked plant compounds were further analysed for druglikeness and toxicity. In addition to having excellent docking scores, two plant compounds-ellagic acid and baicalein-also exhibited highly desirable drug-like qualities. These substances outperform more well-known EPIs like piperine and verapamil in terms of effectiveness. This data shows that these two compounds might be further investigated for their potential as Rv1258c inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Coccidia of the genus Eimeria are important pathogens that cause coccidiosis in livestock and poultry. Due to the expansion of intensive farming, coccidiosis has become more difficult to control. In addition, the continued use of anti-coccidiosis drugs has led to drug resistance and residue. Some herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) have been shown to alleviate the clinical symptoms of coccidiosis, while enhancing immunity and growth performance (GP) of livestock and poultry. Previous in vitro and in vivo studies have reported that the TCM herb Portulaca oleracea exhibited anti-parasitic activities . In total, 36 female Hu lambs were equally divided into six treatment groups: PL (low-dose P. oleracea ), PH (high-dose P. oleracea ), PW ( P. oleracea water extract), PE ( P. oleracea ethanol extract), DIC (diclazuril), and CON (control). The treatment period was 14 days. The McMaster counting method was used to evaluate the anti-coccidiosis effects of the different treatments. Untargeted metabolomics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing were used to investigate the effects of treatment on the gut microbiota (GM) and GP. The results showed that P. oleracea ameliorated coccidiosis, improved GP, increased the abundances of beneficial bacteria, and maintained the composition of the GM, but failed to completely clear coccidian oocysts. The Firmicutes to Bacteroides ratio was significantly increased in the PH group. P. oleracea increased metabolism of tryptophan as well as some vitamins and cofactors in the GM and decreased the relative content of arginine, tryptophan, niacin, and other nutrients, thereby promoting intestinal health and enhancing GP. As an alternative to the anti-coccidiosis drug DIC, P. oleracea effectively inhibited growth of coccidia, maintained the composition of the GM, promoted intestinal health, and increased nutrient digestibility.",

    "abstract": "Abstract One of Egypt’s most notable and historically significant vegetable crops is the Liliaceae plant, Allium cepa L. In this study, the effectiveness of methanolic extracts of Artemisia absinthium leaves, Calotropis procera latex, Moringa oleifera seeds, and Syzygium aromaticum clove was investigated in vitro and, in a greenhouse, setting against Fusarium oxysporum , the pathogen that causes onion basal rot in Assiut Governorate, Egypt. The S. aromaticum extract exhibited the inhibition peak (63.3%), whereas the A. absinthium extract had the lowest inhibition impact against F. oxysporum growth (41.1%). The gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC–MS) analysis revealed that 82 important compounds, with abundances ranging from low to high, were present in the tested S. aromaticum ’s methanolic extract. The primary components were acetaldehyde, hydroxy- and 2-propanone, 1,1,3,3-tetrachloro-(42.71%), 1,2-ethanediol, and methyl alcohol (34.01%). In comparison to the infected control, the disease severity was significantly reduced by 20% with the use of a plant extracts mixture and Dovex 50% and increased by 62.22% with the use of an extract from A. absinthium . When compared to the infected control, onion plant fresh weight and dry weight were considerably higher under the clove extract therapy. The plant extracts used in this study’s testing contain a number of active ingredients, including amino acids, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and enzymes, which is probably why they have such positive impacts. The application of a combination of plant extracts was suggested as a feasible strategy for improving the growth and productivity of onion plants by the study’s findings. More research is needed to comprehend the mechanisms by which plant extracts promote plant development and to optimize the concentration and timing of administration.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutics that interfere with the damage/pathogen-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs/PAMPs) have evolved as promising candidates for hepatic inflammation like that occurring in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In the current study, we examined the therapeutic impact of the phosphodiesterase-1 inhibitor vinpocetine (Vinpo), alone or when combined with Lactobacillus, on hepatic abnormalities caused by a 13-week high-fat diet (HFD) and diabetes in rats. The results show that Vinpo (10 and 20 mg/kg/day) dose-dependently curbed HFD-induced elevation of liver injury parameters in serum (ALT, AST) and tissue histopathology. These effects were concordant with Vinpo's potential to ameliorate HFD-induced fibrosis (Histological fibrosis score, hydroxyproline, TGF-β1) and oxidative stress (MDA, NOx) alongside restoring the antioxidant-related parameters (GSH, SOD, Nrf-2, HO-1) in the liver. Mechanistically, Vinpo attenuated the hepatocellular release of DAMPs like high mobility group box (HMGB)1 alongside lowering the overactivation of the pattern recognition receptors including, toll-like receptor (TLR)4 and receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE). Consequently, there was less activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B that lowered production of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 in Vinpo-treated HFD/diabetes rats. Compared to Vinpo treatment alone, Lactobacillus probiotics as adjunctive therapy with Vinpo significantly improved the disease-associated inflammation and oxidative stress injury, as well as the insulin resistance and lipid profile abnormalities via enhancing the restoration of the symbiotic microbiota. In conclusion, combining Vinpo and Lactobacillus probiotics may be a successful approach for limiting NAFLD in humans.",

The interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the main protein-protein interaction (PPI) implicated in the virus entry into the host cells. Spike-ACE2 PPI represents a major target for drug intervention. We have repurposed a previously described protein-protein interaction detection method to be utilized as a drug screening assay. The assay was standardized using Chitosan nanoparticles (CNPs) as the drug and SARS-CoV-2 spike-ACE2 interaction as the PPI model. The assay was then used to screen four natural bioactive compounds: Curcumin (Cur), Gallic acid (GA), Quercetin (Q), and Silymarin (Sil), and their cytotoxicity was evaluated in vitro. Production of the spike protein and the evaluation of its activity in comparison to a standard commercial protein was part of our work as well. Here we describe a novel simple immunofluorescent screening assay to identify potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors that could assess the inhibitory effect of any ligand against any PPI.

This study focuses on isolating and purifying chitinase ( Af Chi)from a marine bacterium and testing its antifungal efficacy against C. gloeosporioides spore germination by targeting the chitin in the fungal cell wall. The chitinase was purified from a marine bacterium A. faecalis from the Arabian Sea and had a molecular mass of 45 kDa and a specific activity of 84.6 U/mg. Af Chi worked best at 50 °C and pH 7.0 in Tris HCl buffer. Na + ion was the highest cofactor, highlighting the halophilic nature of this chitinase. K + , Ca 2+ , Cu 2+ , Mg 2+ , Mn 2+ , and EDTA also increased activity, while Fe 3+ , Zn 2+ , Co 2+ , and Pb 2+ decreased it. The K m and V max values were 1.87 µg/mL and 17.45 U/mL, respectively.

We evaluated the effect of substituting chicken feed with 0–100% of Pleurotus eryngii and Lentinula edodes SMS at different stocking densities (200–1000 larvae/box) on development, composition, and substrate reduction of black soldier fly ( Hermetia illucens ) larvae. Although the survival rate was not significantly different, feeding pure SMS led to a low growth rate. The substitution level of SMS negatively correlated with individual larval weight, total harvested biomass, larval growth rate (LGR), feed conversion ratio (FCR), substrate reduction, and waste reduction index (WRI) except for the 20% substitution. Feeding 40% SMS resulted in the highest number of prepupae. In the density experiment, the heaviest larvae (220–239 mg fresh weight) were obtained at 200 larvae/box in the 0% SMS group. The frass residue and FCR decreased with increased density. Remarkably, when feeding 20% SMS at 250 larvae/box, the harvested biomass, LGR, and FCR did not differ significantly from the 0% SMS control, whereas some of the higher densities led to a deterioration. In fact, the frass residue, substrate reduction, and WRI were even improved at 250 larvae/box in the 20% SMS group. The chemical analyses of larvae reared on 20% SMS at 250 larvae/box showed comparable ash and fat contents and a higher protein content compared to the 0% SMS group. Accordingly, up to 20% of a standard diet such as chicken feed can be replaced by low-cost SMS without disadvantages for breeding.",

After 16 days of incubation, metabolites were purified by micro-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography. Four metabolites could be identified by co-chromatography with chemically synthesized standards. The chemical structures of three compounds were resolved by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy plus infrared spectroscopy in one case. All metabolites were confirmed by high resolution mass spectrometry-derived molecular formulae. They comprised compounds in which the carboxyl group or the fluorine atom had been exchanged for a hydroxyl group. Furthermore, replacement of the CN group and the intact amine moiety by a hydroxyl group as well as degradation of the amine substituent were observed. The chemical structure of a catechol-type fluoroquinolone metabolite (F-5) could be fully defined for the first time. The latter initiated a hypothetical degradation sequence providing a unique metabolite, F-13, which consisted of the cyclopropyl-substituted pyridone ring still carrying C-7 and C-8 of pradofloxacin, now linked by a double bond and substituted by a hydroxyl and the CN group, respectively. Most likely, all reactions were hydroxyl radical-driven. Metabolite F-13 proves fungal cleavage of the aromatic fluoroquinolone core for the first time. Hence, two decades after the emergence of the notion of the non-biodegradability of fluoroquinolones, fungal degradation of all key structural elements has been proven.",

In this study, the PHA biosynthetic genes of this strain were successfully cloned and characterized. The PHA biosynthetic cluster of this strain consisted of a PHA synthase (phaC), β-ketothiolase (phaA), acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (phaB) and PHA synthesis regulator (phaR).

PepP is involved in the hydrolysis of proline-rich proteins and, thus, is important for the debittering of protein hydrolysates. For accurate determination of PepP activity, a novel gas chromatographic assay was established. The release of L-leucine during the hydrolysis of L-leucine-L-proline-L-proline (LPP) was examined for determination of PepP activity. Sufficient recombinant PepP production was achieved via bioreactor cultivation at 16 °C, resulting in PepP activity of 90 μkat LPP L culture -1 . After automated chromatographic purification by His-tag affinity chromatography followed by desalting, PepP activity of 73.8 μkat LPP L culture -1 was achieved. This was approximately 700-fold higher compared to the purified native PepP produced by Lactococcus lactis ssp . lactis NCDO 763 as described in literature. The molecular weight of PepP was estimated to be ~ 40 kDa via native-PAGE together with a newly developed activity staining method and by SDS-PAGE. Furthermore, the kinetic parameters K m and V max were determined for PepP using three different tripeptide substrates. The purified enzyme showed a pH optimum between 7.0 and 7.5, was most active between 50°C and 60°C and exhibited reasonable stability at 0°C, 20°C and 37°C over 15 days. PepP activity could be increased 6-fold using 8.92 mM MnCl 2 and was inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline and EDTA.",

    "abstract": "Production of the biopolymer polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae starts at the end of exponential phase particularly when the specific growth rate is decreased due to the depletion of glucose in the medium. The specific growth rate and the type of carbon source (fermentable/non-fermentable) have been known to influence the cell physiology and hence affect the fermentability of S. cerevisiae. The production of PHB utilizes cytosolic acetyl-CoA as a precursor and the S. cerevisiae employed in this study is therefore a strain with the enhanced cytosolic acetyl-CoA supply. Growth and PHB production at different specific growth rates were evaluated on glucose, ethanol and a mixture of glucose and ethanol as carbon source. Ethanol as carbon source yielded a higher PHB production compared to glucose since it can be directly used for cytosolic acetyl-CoA production and hence serves as a precursor for PHB production. However, this carbon source results in lower biomass yield and hence it was found that to ensure both biomass formation and PHB production a mixture of glucose and ethanol was optimal, and this resulted in the highest volumetric productivity of PHB, 8.23 mg/L · h-1, at a dilution rate of 0.1 h-1.",

    "abstract": "Lycopene is an import ant compound with an increasing industrial value. However, there is still no biotechnological process to obtain it. In this study, a semi-continuous system for lycopene extraction from recombinant Escherichia coli BL21 cells is proposed. A two-phase culture mode using organic solvents was found to maximize lycopene production through in situ extraction from cells. Within the reactor, three phases were formed during the process: an aqueous phase containing the recombinant E. coli, an interphase, and an organic phase. Lycopene was extracted from the cells to both the interphase and the organic phase and, consequently, thus enhancing its production. Maximum lycopene production (74.71 ± 3.74 mg L(-1)) was obtained for an octane-aqueous culture system using the E. coli BL21LF strain, a process that doubled the level obtained in the control aqueous culture. Study of the interphase by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed the proteo-lipidic nature and the high storage capacity of lycopene. Moreover, a cell viability test by flow cytometry (CF) after 24 h of culture indicated that 24 % of the population could be re-used. Therefore, a batch series reactor was designed for semi-continuous lycopene extraction. After five cycles of operation (120 h), lycopene production was similar to that obtained in the control aqueous medium. A final specific lycopene yield of up to 49.70 ± 2.48 mg g(-1) was reached at 24 h, which represents to the highest titer to date. In conclusion, the aqueous-organic semi-continuous culture system proposed is the first designed for lycopene extraction, representing an important breakthrough in the development of a competitive biotechnological process for lycopene production and extraction.",

In this study, we investigated the effects of sodium chloride concentration on PHB accumulation and pyruvate secretion in the KM-1 strain and, unexpectedly, observed that oxaloacetate, an important intermediate chemical in the TCA cycle, glycogenesis, and aspartic acid biosynthesis, was secreted. We then further analyzed oxaloacetate productivity after changing the sodium chloride additive concentration, additive time-shift, and culture temperature. In 42-h batch-cultivation experiments, we found that wild-type Halomonas sp. KM-1 secreted 39.0 g/L oxaloacetate at a rate of 0.93 g/(L h). The halophilic bacteria Halomonas has already gained attention for industrial chemical-production processes owing to its unique properties, such as contamination-free culture conditions and a tolerance for high substrate concentrations. Moreover, no commercial scale oxaloacetate production was previously reported to result from bacterial fermentation. Oxaloacetate is an important intermediate chemical in biosynthesis and is used as a health food based on its role in energy synthesis. Thus, these data provided important insights into the production of oxaloacetate and other derivative chemicals using this strain.",

Despite the various pharmaceutical effects of geniposide on a human body, its hydrolysis into a smaller molecule, genipin, by β-glucosidase produced by bacteria in the intestines is particularly important to improve geniposide uptake into the body. Since geniposide is much more abundant in Gardeniae Fructus than its aglycone genipin, we herein transformed geniposide into genipin using purified recombinant β-glucosidase from Lactobacillus antri (rBGLa), which was expressed in Escherichia coli to enhance the genipin content. Purified rBGLa was characterized using p-nitrophenyl β-D-glucopyranoside, and the optimal temperature and pH for its β-glucosidase activity were found to be 45 °C and 6.0. When the enzyme was immobilized, rBGLa was active at higher temperatures than the free enzyme, and we confirmed that its stability upon changes in pH and temperature was highly improved. Using 0.5 μg/mL free rBGLa, single compound of 0.4 mM geniposide was efficiently converted into genipin within 2 h, and the immobilized rBGLa also successfully transformed geniposide in a hot-water extract of Gardeniae Fructus into the aglycone, which makes it applicable to the food and pharmaceutical industries.",

In this study, the sequence homology analysis indicated that OmpF from E. coli CVCC 1515 shares a high identity (90−100%) with about half of the E. coli (46.7%) and Shigella (52.8%) strains. Then the recombinant OmpF was supposed to be developed as a versatile vaccine to prevent E. coli infection. OmpF was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) using the auto-induction method. The recombinant OmpF (rOmpF) protein had an average molecular weight of 40 kDa with the purity of 90%. Immunological analysis indicated that the titers of anti-rOmpF sera against rOmpF and whole cells were 1:240,000 and 1:27,000, respectively. The opsonophagocytosis result showed that 72.21 ± 11.39 and 11.04 ± 3.90% of bacteria were killed in the rOmpF immunization and control groups, respectively.

Herein, we developed a circulation direct monitoring and sampling system (CDMSS) that can monitor the behaviour of CO2 and O2 in the gas-liquid phases and obtain a sample without interrupting the shaking of the culture in Erlenmeyer flasks capped with breathable culture plugs. Shake-flask culturing of Escherichia coli using this set-up indicated that a high concentration of CO2 accumulated not only in the headspace (maximum ~100 mg/L) but also in the culture broth (maximum ~85 mg/L) during the logarithmic phase (4.5-9.0 h). By packing a CO2 absorbent in the gas circulation unit of CDMSS, a specialised shake-flask culture was developed to remove CO2 from the headspace. It was posited that removing CO2 from the headspace would suppress increases in the dissolved CO2 concentration in the culture broth (maximum ~15 mg/L). Furthermore, the logarithmic growth phase (4.5-12.0 h) was extended, the U.O.D.580 and pH value increased, and acetic acid concentration was reduced, compared with the control. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a method aimed at improving the growth of E. coli cells without changing the composition of the medium, temperature, and shaking conditions.",

The value of Cid, 1.584 for Fe2+-PPC and 0.552 for Fe3+-PPC, indicates that the effect of the boundary layer is more important in adsorption of Pb2+ by Fe2+-PPC and the pore diffusion is the rate limiting mechanism after 30 min.

Sphagnum mosses harbor a diverse microbiome including nitrogen-fixing and methane (CH4) oxidizing bacteria. The inhibitory effect of oxygen on microbial nitrogen fixation is documented for many bacteria. However, the role of nitrogen-fixing methanotrophs in nitrogen supply to Sphagnum peat mosses is not well explored. Here, we investigated the role of both oxygen and methane on nitrogen fixation in subarctic Sphagnum peat mosses. Five species of Sphagnum mosses were sampled from two mesotrophic and three oligotrophic sites within the Lakkasuo peatland in Orivesi, central Finland. Mosses were incubated under either ambient or low oxygen conditions in the presence or absence of methane. Stable isotope activity assays revealed considerable nitrogen-fixing and methane-assimilating rates at all sites (1.4 ± 0.2 µmol 15N–N2 g−1 DW day−1 and 12.0 ± 1.1 µmol 13C–CH4 g−1 DW day−1, respectively). Addition of methane did not stimulate incorporation of 15N-nitrogen into biomass, whereas oxygen depletion increased the activity of the nitrogen-fixing community. Analysis of the 16S rRNA genes at the bacterial community level showed a very diverse microbiome that was dominated by Alphaproteobacteria in all sites. Bona fide methane-oxidizing taxa were not very abundant (relative abundance less than 0.1%). Based on our results we conclude that methanotrophs did not contribute significantly to nitrogen fixation in the investigated peatlands.",

Nevertheless, the demand for processed meat is constantly rising and producers are searching for novel strategies to reduce microbial contaminations in their products. In the present study, we evaluated the applicability of alkylpyrazines as antimicrobial agents. These fragrant molecules naturally occur in different vegetables, fruits, roasted nut and meat. Several pyrazine derivatives are readily added to processed products for flavoring purposes in the food industry. To evaluate their potential for application, two derivatives were tested for their antimicrobial activity against meat-associated bacterial contaminants and chicken meat as a whole. Isolates assigned to Carnobacteriaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Listeriaceae, and Moraxellaceae were substantially inhibited in the pilot tests. Moreover, treatments of pyrazine-susceptible isolates resulted in 4-log reductions in bacterial cell counts. The effect was more pronounced when the model contaminants were exposed to higher concentrations of 5-isobutyl-2,3-dimethylpyrazine. In a first small-scale application with processed chicken meat, it was demonstrated that the antimicrobial effects of 2-isobutyl-3-methylpyrazine can be improved by additionally lowering the water activity on the meat surface when maltodextrin is used as a carrier substance. At low pyrazine dosages, the number of viable bacteria was decreased up to 95% in comparison to the corresponding controls. A complementary imaging method that was developed to assess the efficacy on the product, reinforced the applicability of this two-component system.",

The N-terminal part of FadB' comprises an NAD(+) binding site and is responsible for 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity converting (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA to acetoacetyl-CoA. Enoyl-CoA hydratase activity was detected spectrophotometrically with trans-crotonyl-CoA. (S)-3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity was measured in both directions with acetoacetyl-CoA and 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA. FadB' was found to be strictly stereospecific to (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA and to prefer NAD(+). The K m value for acetoacetyl-CoA was 48 μM and V max 149 μmol mg(-1) min(-1). NADP(H) was utilized at a rate of less than 10% in comparison to activity with NAD(H). FadB' exhibited optimal activity at pH 6-7 and the activity decreased at alkaline and acidic pH values. Acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA and CoA were found to have an inhibitory effect on FadB'. This study is a first report on biochemical properties of purified (S)-stereospecific 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase/enoyl-CoA hydratase with the inverted domain order from R. eutropha H16. In addition to fundamental information about FadB' and fatty acid metabolism, FadB' might be also interesting for biotechnological applications.",

In this article the action of crude extracts of thermophilic microorganisms (Thermotoga neapolitana, Geobacillus thermantarcticus and Thermoanaerobacterium thermostercoris) is studied using as substrate hemicellulose from one of the most interesting biomass crops, the giant reed (Arundo donax L.). This biomass can be cultivated without competition and a huge amount of rhizomes remains in the soil at the end of cropping cycle (10-15 years) representing a further source of useful molecules. Optimization of the procedure for preparation of the hemicellulose fraction from rhizomes of Arundo donax, is studied. Polysaccharidases from crude extracts of thermophilic microorganisms revealed to be suitable for total degradative action and/or production of small useful oligosaccharides from hemicelluloses from A. donax. Xylobiose and interesting tetra- and pentasaccharide are obtained by enzymatic action in different conditions. Convenient amount of raw material was processed per mg of crude enzymes. Raw hemicelluloses and pretreated material show antioxidant activity unlike isolated tetra- and pentasaccharide. The body of results suggest that rhizomes represent a useful raw material for the production of valuable industrial products, thus allowing to increase the economic efficiency of A. donax cultivation.",

Average zeta potential of SNBCs was -21 mV suggesting some biomolecules capped the nanoparticles imparting a net negative charge over it. FTIR analysis also showed that biomolecules were involved in stabilization. SNBCs showed strong antibacterial activity against both Gram positive (Bacillus subtilis) and Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli). SNBCs also showed strong antifungal activity as assessed against Schizosaccharomyces pombe. In the case of E. coli the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of SNBCs was 4 μg/ml while in B. subtilis it was 8 μg/ml. In the case of E. coli the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of SNBCs was 8 μg/ml while in B. subtilis it was 32 μg/ml. The SNBCs exerted its antibacterial and antifungal activity through generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) inside the cell.",

Full factorial design, statistical analysis, and regression model equation were used to optimize the selected cultural parameters for maximum ethanol production. The result showed that fermentation at 38°C and 200 rpm for 48 h would be ideal for the bacteria to produce maximum amount of ethanol from glycerol. At these optimum conditions, ethanol production, yield and productivity were 25.4 g/l, 0.53 g/l/h, and 1.12 mol/mol-glycerol, repectively. Ethanol production increased to 26.5 g/l while yield and productivity decreased to 1.04 mol/mol-glycerol and 0.37 g/l/h, respectively, after 72 h.

An important part of the unique surface structure of the mycolata is the presence of long chain α-alkyl-β-hydroxy fatty acids, the mycolic acids. In order to investigate the adaptive changes in the mycolic acid composition, we investigated the composition of mycolic acids during the response both to osmotic stress caused by NaCl and to 4-chlorophenol in Rhodococcus opacus PWD4. This bacterium was chosen as it is known to adapt to different kinds of stresses. In addition, it is a potential biocatalyst in bioremediation as well as for biotechnological applications. In the present study, cells of R. opacus PWD4, grown in liquid cultures, responded to toxic concentrations of NaCl by increasing the ratio between mycolic acids and membrane phospholipid fatty acids (MA/PLFA-ratio). Cells reacted to both NaCl and 4-chlorophenol by decreasing both the average chain length and the unsaturation index of their mycolic acids. These changes in mycolic acid composition correlated with increases in cell surface hydrophobicity and saturation of membrane fatty acids, demonstrating the relation between mycolic acid and phospholipid synthesis and their contribution to cell surface properties of R. opacus PWD4.",

In this study, we establish a novel strategy for locus-specific integration of exogenous DNA via carboxin-resistance reconstitution by a point-mutation (H245L) on succinate dehydrogenase subunit Mosdi1. Independent transformants derived from the same reconstitution construct showed consistent fluorescent signal and undiversified phenotypes, including hyphae growth, conidiation and pathogenicity, in M. oryzae. Meanwhile, 96 % of all transformants integrate correctly into the Mosdi1 locus as a single copy.

    "abstract": "Recombinant Escherichia coli is a desirable platform for the production of many biological compounds including poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates), a class of naturally occurring biodegradable polyesters with promising biomedical and material applications. Although the controlled production of desirable polymers is possible with the utilization of fatty acid feedstocks, a central challenge to this biosynthetic route is the improvement of the relatively low polymer yield, a necessary factor of decreasing the production costs. In this study we sought to address this challenge by deleting arcA and ompR, two global regulators with the capacity to inhibit the uptake and activation of exogenous fatty acids. We found that polymer yields in a ΔarcA mutant increased significantly with respect to the parental strain. In the parental strain, PHV yields were very low but improved 64-fold in the ΔarcA mutant (1.92–124 mg L−1) The ΔarcA mutant also allowed for modest increases in some medium chain length polymer yields, while weight average molecular weights improved by approximately 1.5-fold to 12-fold depending on the fatty acid substrate utilized. These results were supported by an analysis of differential gene expression, which showed that the key genes (fadD, fadL, and fadE) encoding fatty acid degradation enzymes were all upregulated by 2-, 10-, and 31-fold in an ΔarcA mutant, respectively. Additionally, the short chain length fatty acid uptake genes atoA, atoE and atoD were upregulated by 103-, 119-, and 303-fold respectively, though these values are somewhat inflated due to low expression in the parental strain. Overall, this study demonstrates that arcA is an important target to improve PHA production from fatty acids.",

    "abstract": "Biotransformation of fatty acid methyl esters to dicarboxylic acids has attracted much attention in recent years; however, reports of sebacic acid production using such biotransformation remain few. The toxicity of decanoic acid is the main challenge for this process. Decane induction has been reported to be essential to activate the enzymes involved in the α,ω-oxidation pathway before initiating the biotransformation of methyl decanoate to sebacic acid. However, we observed the accumulation of intermediates (decanoic acid and 10-hydroxydecanoic acid) during the induction period. In this study, we examined the effects of these intermediates on the biotransformation process. The presence of decanoic acid, even at a low concentration (0.2 g/L), inhibited the transformation of 10-hydroxydecanoic acid to sebacic acid. Moreover, about 24-32% reduction in the decanoic acid oxidation was observed in the presence of 0.5-1.5 g/L 10-hydroxydecanoic acid. To eliminate these inhibitory effects, we applied substrate-limiting conditions during the decane induction process, which eliminated the accumulation of decanoic acid. Although the productivity of sebacic acid (34.5 ± 1.10 g/L) was improved, by 28% over that achieved using the previously methods, after 54 h, the accumulation of 10-hydroxydecanoic acid was still detected. The accumulation of 10-hydroxydecanoic acid even under the decane limiting conditions could be an evidence that oxidation of 10-hydroxydecanoic acid could be the rate-limiting step in this process. The improvement of this reaction should be an important objective for further development of the production of sebacic acid using biotransformation.",

Hence, we investigated responsible components of the PgsBCA complex in B. subtilis for over-production of PGA. In particular, we constructed genomic pgsBCA gene-deletion mutants of B. subtilis. And also, we assembled high copy-number plasmids harboring σA-dependent promoter, leading to high-level expression of all combinations of pgsBCA, pgsBC, pgsBA, pgsCA, pgsB, pgsC, and/or pgsA genes. Subsequently, PGA production of the transformed B. subtilis mutant was determined in batch fermentation using medium supplemented with l-glutamate. PGA production by the transformants introduced with pgsBC genes (lacking the genomic pgsBCA genes) was 26.0 ± 3.0 g L−1, and the enantiomeric ratio of d- and l-glutamic acid (d/l-ratio) in the produced PGA was 5/95. In contrast, d/l-ratio of produced PGA by the transformants introduced with pgsBCA genes (control strains) was 75/25. In conclusion, B. subtilis without pgsA gene could over-produce PGA with an l-rich enantiomeric ratio.",

    "abstract": "Ruminal thiamine deficiencies occur when dairy cows are overfed with high-concentrate diet, and thiamine supplementation has been proved to attenuate high-concentrate diet induced SARA. However, there is limited knowledge of the relationship between thiamine supplementation in high-concentrate diets and ruminal fungi. In order to investigate the impacts of thiamine supplementation on ruminal fungi, twelve Chinese Holstein dairy cows were randomly assigned into three treatments: control diet (CON; 20% starch, dry matter basis), high-concentrate diet (HC; 33.2% starch, dry matter basis) and high-concentrate diet supplemented with 180 mg thiamine/kg dry matter intake. Dry matter intake and milk production were recorded during the experimental periods. On day 21, rumen fluid samples were collected at 3 h postfeeding and ruminal pH, thiamine concentration and volatile fatty acids were measured. Metagenome sequencing method was conducted to detect ruminal fungi composition. Feeding HC significantly decreased dry matter intake, milk production, ruminal pH, ruminal acetate and thiamine concentration, however, significantly increased propionate and isovalerate (P < 0.05). These changes were inversed by thiamine supplementation (P < 0.05). Totally, seven phyla and almost 1050 species of rumen fungi were identified across all samples in which especially, 3 genera and 10 species of strictly anaerobic fungi phylum Neocallimastigomycota was found. Principal coordinate analysis indicated that feeding HC and thiamine supplementation caused a significant inverse in ruminal fungi composition. Feeding HC significantly decreased the abundance of fungi compared with CON (P < 0.05) while thiamine supplementation significantly increased the abundance of ruminal fungi (P < 0.05). These results indicated that thiamine supplementation may effectively attenuate rumen metabolic disorder caused by HC diet through buffering the ruminal pH, shifting the rumen fermentation pattern and increasing the abundance of ruminal fungi. The findings in this study could therefore contribute to the further understanding of the mechanism of thiamine's function in dairy cows.",

Microbe has the ability of adsorbing heavy metal, among which lactic acid bacteria are promising microbes to adsorb and remove Pb2+. The purpose of this study was to screen lactic acid bacteria from Ya'an pickle water to effectively remove Pb2+. The 7 strains having strong ability to effectively remove Pb2+ were detected. These strains were identified by microscopic examination and 16S rDNA sequencing, 4 strains of Lactobacillus plantarum and 3 strains of Lactobacillus brevis were obtained. Then the bacteria had a blind adsorption effect on Pb2+. After microwave digestion, the Pb2+ concentration was measured by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The highest removal reached 82.25%. The adsorption mechanism of lactic acid bacteria was mainly divided into biosorption and bioaccumulation. The 7 strains of lactic acid bacteria could provide potential for detoxification of contaminated foods and reduction of the Pb2+ accumulation in the human diet and animal feed. At the same time, this study was helpful to further understand the mechanism of Pb2+ being adsorbed by lactic acid bacteria.",

It is characterized by acute watery diarrhea, dehydration and vomiting in swine of all ages and is especially fatal for neonatal and postweaning piglets. The spike protein of PEDV plays an important role in mediating virus attachment and fusion to target cells, and recent studies also reported that the neutralizing epitopes of the spike protein were mainly located in the S1 subunit, which makes it a candidate for vaccine development and clinical diagnosis. In this study, we successfully constructed an immune phage display single-domain antibody library with a library size of 3.4 × 106. A single-domain antibody, named S7, specific for the spike protein of PEDV was identified from the phage display single-domain antibody library. S7 could be expressed in a soluble form in E. coli, bound to the spike protein of PEDV in ELISA and stained the PEDV virus in Vero cells, but it showed no neutralization activity on PEDV. These results indicated the potent application of the S7 antibody as an imaging probe or as a candidate for the development of a diagnostic assay.",

Three ensiling treatments were applied: a control (CK), addition of a fungus (FU) at 105 thallus-forming units per gram, and addition of compound enzyme (EN) at 0.033 mg/g (containing cellulase and xylanase at activities of 90 filter paper units and 6000 IU per gram, respectively). Compared with the CK, the FU and EN treatments decreased the pH after 30 days fermentation (P <0.05). Both FU and EN treatments increased the lactate, crude protein, and water-soluble carbohydrate contents (P <0.05), whereas reduced the acetate, ADF and NDF contents as well as the ammonia nitrogen to total nitrogen ratio in silage after 30 days of ensilaging (P <0.05), compared with those for the CK, while no changes were found in the dry matter and dry matter recovery (P > 0.05). The fungal inoculant increased the in vitro digestibility of dry matter, NDF and ADF in silage after 30 days fermentation (P <0.05). In conclusion, the rumen fungus Piromyces sp.

In this study, we provide new insights into the structure and composition of the rice root-associated microbiomes as well as the effect on crop of the Rhodopseudomonas palustris(R. palustris) PSB06 and CGA009 at the rice seedling stage with seed immersion and root irrigation. Compare with CK group, the length of stem, the peroxidase (POD), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in PSB06 treatment group was significantly higher, while the length of stem in CGA009 treatment group was significantly higher. The POD and SOD activities in CGA009 treatment groups only were higher slightly than the CK group. In the study, the dominant phyla were Proteobacteria (51.95-61.66%), Bacteroidetes (5.40-9.39%), Acidobacteria (4.50-10.52%), Actinobacteria (5.06-8.14%), Planctomycetes (2.90-4.48%), Chloroflexi (2.23-5.06%) and Firmicutes (2.38-7.30%), accounted for 87% bacterial sequences. The principal coordinate analysis (pCoA) and mantel results showed the two application actions of R. palustris CGA009 and PSB06 had significant effects on rice rhizosphere bacterial communities (p < 0.05). The PSB06 can significantly promote the rice growth and enhance stress resistance of rice at the seedling stage, while the R. palustris CGA009 has no significant effect on rice. Dissimilarity test and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) results showed that the TN and pH were the key factors affecting rice rhizosphere bacterial community in the seedling stage. This study will provide some guidance advices for the study of the microecological regulation of photosynthetic bacteria on crops.",

All of the tested parameters were observed to have a substantive effect on both hydrogen yield and (specific) production rates. A final experiment incorporating the best scenario for each tested parameter showed a marked increase in the H2 production rate compared to each individual parameter.

We cloned the putative glucoamylase of C. crescentus CB15 (CauloGA) gene. The CauloGA gene product that was expressed in E. coli was prone to forming inclusion bodies; however, most of the gene product was expressed in a soluble and active form when it was expressed as a fusion protein with Staphylococcus Protein A. The fusion protein was purified using an IgG Sepharose column and was identified as the active GA. The optimum temperature and pH for the activity of this GA toward maltotriose as a substrate were approximately 40°C and 5.0, respectively, and a differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) analysis revealed that the melting temperature (Tm) of CauloGA was 42.9°C. The kinetic analyses with maltotriose and other maltodextrins as the substrates indicated that CauloGA has higher kcat and smaller Km values at 30°C with both substrates compared with other GAs at lower substrate concentration. However, the enzyme activities toward the substrates decreased as the substrate concentrations increased at concentrations higher than approximately 10-fold the Km. The function-based identification of thermolabile Caulobacter GA contributes to the understanding of the maltodextrin-degradation system of C. crescentus as well as the bacterial GA's function-structure relationship.",

    "abstract": "Disruption of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 by high-pressure homogenization in a French press is discussed for the release of arginine deiminase (ADI). The enzyme release response of the disruption process was modelled for the experimental factors of biomass concentration in the broth being disrupted, the homogenization pressure and the number of passes of the cell slurry through the homogenizer. For the same data, the response surface method (RSM), the artificial neural network (ANN) and the support vector machine (SVM) models were compared for their ability to predict the performance parameters of the cell disruption. The ANN model proved to be best for predicting the ADI release. The fractional disruption of the cells was best modelled by the RSM. The fraction of the cells disrupted depended mainly on the operating pressure of the homogenizer. The concentration of the biomass in the slurry was the most influential factor in determining the total protein release. Nearly 27 U/mL of ADI was released within a single pass from slurry with a biomass concentration of 260 g/L at an operating pressure of 510 bar. Using a biomass concentration of 100 g/L, the ADI release by French press was 2.7-fold greater than in a conventional high-speed bead mill. In the French press, the total protein release was 5.8-fold more than in the bead mill. The statistical analysis of the completely unseen data exhibited ANN and SVM modelling as proficient alternatives to RSM for the prediction and generalization of the cell disruption process in French press.",

    "abstract": "Although dynamics of the complex microbial ecosystem populating the gastrointestinal tract of animals has profound and multifaceted impacts on host's metabolism and health, it remains unclear whether it is the intrinsic or extrinsic factors that play a more dominant role in mediating the composition of intestinal microbiota. To address this, we studied the impacts of two strikingly different diets on a herbivorous fish, grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus): a high-protein, low-fiber formula feed, and low-protein, high-fiber Sudan grass. After a 16-week feeding trial, microbial profiles of midgut and hindgut segments in both groups were compared. Bacterial composition was significantly different between the midguts of both groups, but not between the hindguts of two groups. Both PerMANOVA and VPA analyses suggested that gut segments explain a higher proportion of variation in intestinal microbiota than diet. Overall, our results suggest that intestinal compartments are a stronger determinant than diet in shaping the intestinal microbiota. Specifically, whereas diet has a strong impact on the composition of microbiota in proximal gut compartments, this impact is much less pronounced distally, which is likely to be a reflection of a limited ability of some microbial taxa to thrive in the anoxic environment in distal segments.",

Yesso scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis), one of the most important maricultured scallops in northern China, has recently suffered massive summer mortalities, which causes huge production losses. The knowledge about the interactions between the Yesso scallop and its microbiota is important to develop the strategy for the disease prevention and control. In the present study, the bacterial communities in hemolymph, intestine, mantle and adductor muscle were compared between the healthy and diseased Yesso scallop based on the high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene. The results indicated obvious difference of the composition rather than the diversity of the bacterial communities between the healthy and diseased Yesso scallop. Vibrio, Francisella and Photobacterium were found to overgrow and dominate in the mantle, adductor muscle and intestine of the diseased scallops, respectively. The prediction of bacterial community metagenomes and the variations of KEGG pathways revealed that the proportions of the pathways related with neurodegenerative diseases and carbohydrate metabolism both increased significantly in the mantle and hemolymph of the diseased scallops. The abundance of the metabolism pathways including carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism decreased significantly in the intestine of diseased scallops. The results suggested that the changes of bacterial communities might be closely associated with the Yesso scallop's disease, which was helpful for further investigation of the pathogenesis as well as prevention and control of the disease in Yesso scallop.",

Further study showed that aspartate could be used as the precursor of NADH de novo synthesis in C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824. When 2 g/L aspartate was added, the transcription levels of essential genes (nadA, nadB and nadC) for NADH de novo synthesis were significantly higher than that of without aspartate addition. The levels of intracellular NAD+, NADH, total NAD(H) and the ratio of NADH/NAD+ were also significantly increased, which were 63.9 ± 8.0%, 85.0 ± %, 77.7 ± 8.0% and 12.7 ± 2.9% higher than those of without aspartate addition, respectively. Furthermore, the butanol production was improved by overexpressing the NADH de novo synthesis genes, and the fermentation performance could be further enhanced by strengthening the VB1 biosynthesis and NADH de novo synthesis pathway simultaneously.

    "abstract": "As the importance of reducing carbon emissions as a means to limit the serious effects of global climate change becomes apparent, synthetic biologists and metabolic engineers are looking to develop renewable sources for transportation fuels and petroleum-derived chemicals. In recent years, microbial production of high-energy fuels has emerged as an attractive alternative to the traditional production of transportation fuels. In particular, the Baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a highly versatile microbial chassis, has been engineered to produce a wide array of biofuels. Nevertheless, a key limitation of S. cerevisiae is its inability to utilize xylose, the second most abundant sugar in lignocellulosic biomass, for both growth and chemical production. Therefore, the development of a robust S. cerevisiae strain that is able to use xylose is of great importance. Here, we engineered S. cerevisiae to efficiently utilize xylose as a carbon source and produce the advanced biofuel isobutanol. Specifically, we screened xylose reductase (XR) and xylose dehydrogenase (XDH) variants from different xylose-metabolizing yeast strains to identify the XR-XDH combination with the highest activity. Overexpression of the selected XR-XDH variants, a xylose-specific sugar transporter, xylulokinase, and isobutanol pathway enzymes in conjunction with the deletions of PHO13 and GRE3 resulted in an engineered strain that is capable of producing isobutanol at a titer of 48.4 ± 2.0 mg/L (yield of 7.0 mg/g D-xylose). This is a 36-fold increase from the previous report by Brat and Boles and, to our knowledge, is the highest isobutanol yield from D-xylose in a microbial system. We hope that our work will set the stage for an economic route for the production of advanced biofuel isobutanol and enable efficient utilization of lignocellulosic biomass.",

The results showed that paclitaxel had a good inhibitory activity on human breast cancer MCF-7 cells and showed a concentration- dependent relationship with an IC50 of about 15 μg/mL in the sulforhodamine B assay. At the same time, paclitaxel exerted a weak inhibitory activity on cervical cancer Hela cells. In addition, paclitaxel not only inhibited the invasion of HIV-1 pseudovirus into cells, but also exhibited inhibitory activity to a certain extent after viral invasion of the cells. At a paclitaxel concentration of 20 μg/mL, the inhibition of HIV-1 pseudovirus reached about 66%. The inhibition of HIV-1 protease activity was concentration-dependent. At a concentration of 20 μg/mL, the inhibitory effect of paclitaxel on HIV-1 protease was similar to that of the positive control pepstatin A, being 15.8%. The HIV-1 integrase inhibiting activity of paclitaxel was relatively weak. Paclitaxel significantly up-regulated the expression of interleukin-6.",

This paper concerns the statistical optimization of fermentation parameters and media to ensure consistent and improved Y. lipolytica protein production. A strain of Y. lipolytica A-101 was observed to be proficient in producing single cell protein, amino acids, and vitamin B12 while utilizing biofuel waste instead of a complete YPD medium for yeast growth. A fractional fractal design experiment was then applied, and the two fermentation parameters of temperature and pH were recognized to have a significant effect on the protein and amino acid production. Subsequently, the response surface methodology with a three-level complete factorial design was employed to optimize these influential parameters. Therefore, five different measuring systems were utilized to construct a quadratic model and a second-order polynomial equation. Optimal levels of parameters were then obtained by analysis of the model and the numerical optimization method. When the Y. lipolytica A-101 was cultivated at optimized pH (5.0) using biofuel waste as a medium, the protein concentration was increased to 8.28—a 44% enhancement as compared to the original (3.65). This study has thus demonstrated a beneficial way to cultivate Y. lipolytica A-101 on biofuel waste for enhanced production of single cell protein and amino acids for use in human diet and in animal feed.",

A total of 12 mid-lactation Holstein dairy cows with similar parity, days in milk were randomly divided into 2 groups receiving either a total mixed ration (TMR) as the control group or this TMR and 120 g/d/head ART as the ART group. The milk samples were collected weekly to determine the contents, and end-of-trial (week 8) milk samples were used to identify microbial species and metabolite profiles by 16S rRNA sequencing and LC-MS analyses, respectively. We observed that the milk fat content significantly increased by ART treatment (P < 0.05). The bacterial community richness was significantly lower in the ART group (P < 0.05), while the diversity showed no difference (P > 0.05). Compared with its abundance in the control (CON) group, Firmicutes was significantly decreased, whereas Proteobacteria was significantly increased. Furthermore, in the ART group, the relative abundances of the genera Aerococcus, Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium_1 and Facklamia were significantly lower (P < 0.01). Metabolomics analysis revealed that ART significantly increasing the concentrations of glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids and flavonoids compared with those in the CON group. An enrichment analysis of the different metabolites showed that ART mainly affected glycerophospholipid metabolism and the pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis pathways. These findings revealed that ART supplementation could affect the milk microbiota and metabolites, that glycerophospholipids and glycerolipids could be potential biomarkers in the milk response to ART feed in dairy cows, and that ART changes substances in milk by maintaining lipid metabolism in the mammary gland.",

    "abstract": "Abstract To enhance the competitiveness of industrial lignocellulose ethanol production, robust enzymes and cell factories are vital. Lignocellulose derived streams contain a cocktail of inhibitors that drain the cell of its redox power and ATP, leading to a decrease in overall ethanol productivity. Many studies have attempted to address this issue, and we have shown that increasing the glutathione (GSH) content in yeasts confers tolerance towards lignocellulose inhibitors, subsequently increasing the ethanol titres. However, GSH levels in yeast are limited by feedback inhibition of GSH biosynthesis. Multidomain and dual functional enzymes exist in several bacterial genera and they catalyse the GSH biosynthesis in a single step without the feedback inhibition. To test if even higher intracellular glutathione levels could be achieved and if this might lead to increased tolerance, we overexpressed the genes from two bacterial genera and assessed the recombinants in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) with steam pretreated spruce hydrolysate containing 10% solids. Although overexpressing the heterologous genes led to a sixfold increase in maximum glutathione content (18 µmol g drycellmass −1 ) compared to the control strain, this only led to a threefold increase in final ethanol titres (8.5 g L − 1 ). As our work does not conclusively indicate the cause-effect of increased GSH levels towards ethanol titres, we cautiously conclude that there is a limit to cellular fitness that could be accomplished via increased levels of glutathione.",

Agricultural Jiaosu (AJ), which originates from organic wastes, has the potential to be a substitute for synthetic fungicides. In this study, the characteristics of AJ and its antifungal activity against Botrytis cinerea were investigated for the first time. AJ was rich in lactic acid (4.46 g/L), acetic acid (1.52 g/L), Lactobacillus (72.45%) and Acetobacter (15.23%), which was a microbial ecosystem consisting of acid-based substances (AS) and beneficial microorganisms (BM). The results of the antifungal assays suggested that B. cinerea was effectively inhibited by AJ, with the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 9.24%. AJ showed the strongest and most-lasting inhibitory effect compared to cell-free supernatant and microbial solution of AJ, indicating that AS and BM and their synergistic effect contributed to the antifungal activity of AJ. Two-step inhibition’ is an antifungal mode of AJ. Firstly, AS not only inhibited the pathogen directly but also provided a dominant niche for BM of AJ. Then, BM in AJ, especially Acetobacter, proliferated and metabolized acetic acid continuously. Thus, AJ achieved high-efficiency and long-acting inhibition. AJ is a promising biological agent considering its features of an eco-friendly, low-cost and easy-to-operate biological agent in rural areas.",

In the present work, we describe a growth selection system for a- and α-type cells aimed at the crossbreeding of industrial yeasts, and performed hybridizations with sake yeast strains Kyokai No. 6, No. 7 and No. 9 to examine the feasibility of this approach. We successfully generated both a- and α-type strains from all parental strains, and acquired six types of hybrids by outcrossing. One of these hybrid strains was subjected to continuous crossbreeding, yielding the multi-hybrid strain, which inherited the genetic characteristics of Kyokai No. 6, No. 7 and No. 9. Notably, because all of the genetic modifications of the yeast cells were introduced using plasmids, these traits can be easily removed. The approach described here has the potential to markedly accelerate the crossbreeding of industrial yeast strains with desirable properties.",

Very often these traits are correlated and should, therefore, be evaluated together rather than as single traits. In order to unravel the genetic architecture of multiple traits of Agaricus bisporus and the genetic correlations among traits, we have investigated a total of six agronomic and quality traits through multi-trait QTL analyses in a mixed-model. Traits were evaluated in three heterokaryon sets. Significant phenotypic correlations were observed among traits. For instance, earliness (ER) correlated to firmness (FM), cap color, and compost colonization, and FM correlated to scales (SC). QTLs of different traits located on the same chromosomes genetically explains the phenotypic correlations. QTL detected on chromosome 10 mainly affects three traits, i.e., ER, FM and SC. It explained 31.4 % phenotypic variation of SC on mushroom cap (heterokaryon Set 1), 14.9 % that of the FM (heterokaryon Set 3), and 14.2 % that of ER (heterokaryon Set 3). High value alleles from the wild parental line showed beneficial effects for several traits, suggesting that the wild germplasm is a valuable donor in terms of those traits. Due to the limitations of recombination pattern, we only made a start at understanding the genetic base for several agronomic and quality traits in button mushrooms.",

Flow cytometric analysis employing membrane integrity indicators like propidium iodide (PI) and thiazole orange (TO) indicated a greater sensitivity of Arthrobacter cells to cesium than to strontium.

As a result, hydrogenase-displaying yeasts produced black precipitates in PtCl4 2− solution. Based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations, the constructed yeasts were found to successfully produce the precipitates of Pt(0) through the reduction of Pt(II).

MG1, an endophytic fungus isolated from Vitis vinifera, can independently produce resveratrol, indicating that this species contains the key genes for resveratrol biosynthesis. Identification of these key genes is essential to understand the resveratrol biosynthesis pathway in this strain, which is currently unknown in microorganisms. qRT-PCR is an efficient and widely used method to identify the key genes related to unknown pathways at the level of gene expression. Verification of stable reference genes in this strain is essential for qRT-PCR data normalization, although results have been reported for other Alternaria sp. strains. In this study, nine candidate reference genes including TUBA, EF1, EF2, UBC, UFD, RPS5, RPS24, ACTB and 18S were evaluated for expression stability in a diverse set of six samples representing different growth periods. We compared cell culture conditions and an optimized condition for resveratrol production. The comparison of the results was performed using four statistical softwares. A combination of TUBA and EF1 was found to be suitable for normalization of Alternaria sp. MG1 in different developmental stages, and 18S was found to be the least stable. The reference genes verified in this study will facilitate further research to explore gene expression and molecular mechanisms as well as the improvement of secondary metabolite yields in Alternaria sp.

    "abstract": "The maturation and development of T cells were not completed until T cells were selected in thymus. It was not until the early 1960s that j.f.a.p. discovered the importance of thymus in T cell development. Twelve healthy piglets were randomly divided into two groups, the experimental group (LGG group) and the control group (saline group). The LGG group piglets were given 1 ml LGG (6 × 109 CFU/ml) per day. The saline group was given 1 ml of normal saline per day. The piglets were slaughtered at 30 days and 45 days, respectively, and the MLN, jejunum and ileum PPs, LP of the piglets were taken. The expression of CD3+CD4+ T lymphocytes was detected by flow cytometry, and intestinal villi development was observed by intestinal paraffin section. The results showed that the flow cytometry results at 30 days and 45 days showed that the CD3+CD4+ T lymphocytes in the MLN group were significantly different from those in the saline group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01).The CD3+CD4+ T lymphocytes in the jejunum PP of piglets in LGG group were significantly different from those in saline group (P < 0.05). The CD3+CD4+ T lymphocytes in the ileum PP of the LGG group were significantly different from those in the saline group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). CD3+CD4+ T lymphocytes and normal saline in the piglets of the LGG group There was a significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.001, P < 0.05). P < 0.001). HE staining results showed the length of the LGG group ileal villi in piglets at 30 days, 45 days was significantly different from that in normal saline group (P < 0.01, P < 0.01). LGG can also regulate the proliferation of T lymphocytes in the intestine of early weaned piglets at 30 days and 45 days increase the number of CD3+CD4+ T lymphocytes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive bacterium, commonly found in food, water or sewage. This microorganism is capable of forming biofilm on different surfaces such as steel, glass, polypropylene etc. Recently an increase in cases of listeriosis has been noted, making L. monocytogenes the important health threat. Therefore, there is a need for rapid and sensitive detection of this pathogen. This study aimed to compare the number of L. monocytogenes cells recovered from the biofilm (prepared on steel and polypropylene) using the detection and amplification of the hlyA gene (droplet digital PCR, ddPCR) and the classical culture method. The research material consisted of 96 L. monocytogenes strains. A total of 58 isolates were obtained from clinical samples and 38 isolates derived from the municipal sewage treatment plant. Additionally, the reference strain ATCC ® 19111™ (WDCM00020) was used. The Pearson correlation coefficient for the results obtained by the classical culture-based method and ddPCR was 0.864 and 0.725, for biofilms produced on AISI 304 stainless steel surface and the polypropylene surface, respectively. Correlations were statistically significant (p ≤ 0.001), indicating that the ddPCR technique is an effective tool for the assessment of bacteria number in the biofilm.",

    "abstract": "An exhaustive screening program was applied for scoring a promising L-asparaginase producing-isolate. The recovered isolate was identified biochemically and molecularly and its L-asparaginase productivity was optimized experimentally and by Response Surface Methodology. The produced enzyme was characterized experimentally for its catalytic properties and by bioinformatics analysis for its immunogenicity. The promising L-asparaginase producing-isolate was selected from 722 recovered isolates and identified as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and deposited at Microbiological Resources Centre (Cairo Mircen) under the code EMCC2297. This isolate produces both intracellular (type I) and extracellular (type II) L-asparaginases with about 4.7 fold higher extracellular L-asparaginase productivity. Bioinformatics analysis revealed clustering of Stenotrophomonas maltophiliaL-asparaginase with those of Pseudomonas species and considerable closeness to the two commercially available L-asparaginases of E. coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi. Fourteen antigenic regions are predicted for Stenotrophomonas maltophiliaL-asparaginase versus 16 and 18 antigenic regions for the Erwinia chrysanthemi and E. coliL-asparaginases. Type II L-asparaginase productivity of the test isolate reached 4.7 IU/ml/h and exhibited maximum activity with no metal ion requirement at 37 °C, pH 8.6, 40 mM asparagine concentration and could tolerate NaCl concentration up to 500 mM and retain residual activity of 55% at 70 °C after half an hour treatment period. Application both of random mutation by gamma irradiation and Response Surface Methodology that determined 38.11 °C, 6.89 pH, 19.85 h and 179.15 rpm as optimum process parameters could improve the isolate L-asparaginase productivity. Maximum production of about 8 IU/ml/h was obtained with 0.4% dextrose, 0.1% yeast extract and 10 mM magnesium sulphate. In conclusion L-asparaginase of the recovered Stenotrophomonas maltophilia EMCC2297 isolate has characters enabling it to be used for medical therapeutic application.",

Cobweb infections by a conidiogenous Cladobotryum -type fungus identified by morphology and ITS sequences as Hypomyces odoratus were observed in the year 2015 on primordia and young and mature fruiting bodies of Agaricus xanthodermus in the wild. Progress in development and morphologies of fruiting bodies were affected by the infections. Infested structures aged and decayed prematurely. The mycoparasites tended by mycelial growth from the surroundings to infect healthy fungal structures. They entered from the base of the stipes to grow upwards and eventually also onto lamellae and caps. Isolated H. odoratus strains from a diseased standing mushroom, from a decaying overturned mushroom stipe and from rotting plant material infected mushrooms of different species of the genus Agaricus while Pleurotus ostreatus fruiting bodies were largely resistant. Growing and grown A. xanthodermus and P. ostreatus mycelium showed degrees of resistance against the mycopathogen, in contrast to mycelium of Coprinopsis cinerea . Mycelial morphological characteristics (colonies, conidiophores and conidia, chlamydospores, microsclerotia, pulvinate stroma) and variations of five different H. odoratus isolates are presented. In pH-dependent manner, H. odoratus strains stained growth media by pigment production yellow (acidic pH range) or pinkish-red (neutral to slightly alkaline pH range).",

The changing of many specific bacterial genus such as Lactobacillus , Porphyromonadaceae , Bacteroides and Escherichia might closely related to the recovery of intestinal inflammatory response.

Although GATA TFs involved in abiotic stress in plants and some fungi have been analyzed, information regarding GATA TFs in Aspergillus oryzae is extremely poor. In this study, we identified and functionally characterized seven GATA proteins from A. oryzae 3.042 genome, including a novel AoSnf5 GATA TF with 20-residue between the Cys-X 2 -Cys motifs which was found in Aspergillus GATA TFs for the first time. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that these seven A . oryzae GATA TFs could be classified into six subgroups. Analysis of conserved motifs demonstrated that Aspergillus GATA TFs with similar motif compositions clustered in one subgroup, suggesting that they might possess similar genetic functions, further confirming the accuracy of the phylogenetic relationship. Furthermore, the expression patterns of seven A. oryzae GATA TFs under temperature and salt stresses indicated that A. oryzae GATA TFs were mainly responsive to high temperature and high salt stress. The protein–protein interaction network of A. oryzae GATA TFs revealed certain potentially interacting proteins. The comprehensive analysis of A. oryzae GATA TFs will be beneficial for understanding their biological function and evolutionary features and provide an important starting point to further understand the role of GATA TFs in the regulation of distinct environmental conditions in A. oryzae .",

    "abstract": "In the bio-based polymer industry, putrescine is in the spotlight for use as a material. We constructed strains of Escherichia coli to assess its putrescine production capabilities through the arginine decarboxylase pathway in batch fermentation. N-Acetylglutamate (ArgA) synthase is subjected to feedback inhibition by arginine. Therefore, the 19th amino acid residue, Tyr, of argA was substituted with Cys to desensitize the feedback inhibition of arginine, resulting in improved putrescine production. The inefficient initiation codon GTG of argA was substituted with the effective ATG codon, but its replacement did not affect putrescine production. The essential genes for the putrescine production pathway, speA and speB, were cloned into the same plasmid with argAATG Y19C to form an operon. These genes were introduced under different promoters; lacIp, lacIqp, lacIq1p, and T5p. Among these, the T5 promoter demonstrated the best putrescine production. In addition, disruption of the puuA gene encoding enzyme of the first step of putrescine degradation pathway increased the putrescine production. Of note, putrescine production was not affected by the disruption of patA, which encodes putrescine aminotransferase, the initial enzyme of another putrescine utilization pathway. We also report that the strain KT160, which has a genomic mutation of YifEQ100TAG, had the greatest putrescine production. At 48 h of batch fermentation, strain KT160 grown in terrific broth with 0.01 mM IPTG produced 19.8 mM of putrescine.",

    "abstract": "Severe early defoliation has become an important factor restricting the development of the pear industry in southern China. However, the assembly patterns of microbial communities and their functional activities in response to the application of bioorganic fertilizer (BIO) or humic acid (HA) in southern China's pear orchards remain poorly understood, particularly the impact on the early defoliation of the trees. We conducted a 3-year field experiment (2017-2019) in an 18-year-old 'Cuiguan' pear orchard. Four fertilization schemes were tested: local custom fertilization as control (CK), CK plus HA (CK-HA), BIO, and BIO plus HA (BIO-HA). Results showed that BIO and BIO-HA application decreased the early defoliation rate by 50-60%, and increased pear yield by 40% compared with the CK and CK-HA treatments. The BIO and BIO-HA application significantly improved soil pH, available nutrient content, total enzyme activity and ecosystem multifunctionality, and also changed the structure of soil bacterial and fungal communities. The genus Acidothermus was positively correlated with the early defoliation rate, while the genus Rhodanobacter was negatively correlated. Additionally, random forest models revealed that the early defoliation rate could be best explained by soil pH, ammonium content, available phosphorus, and total enzyme activity. In conclusion, application of BIO or BIO mixed with HA could have assembled distinct microbial communities and increased total enzyme activity, leading to significant improvement of soil physicochemical traits. The increased availability of soil nutrient thus changed leaf nutrient concentrations and alleviated the early defoliation rate of pear trees in acid red soil in southern China.",

In the present study, the effects and regulatory mechanisms of ammonium nitrate (AN) on the color characteristics of MPs were investigated. The concentration of intracellular pigments was significantly decreased when subjected to AN. The hue and lightness value indicated AN altered the total pigments appearance from original red to orange. The HPLC analysis for six major components of MPs showed that the production of rubropunctatin or monascorubrin, was significantly reduced to the undetectable level, whereas the yields of monascin, ankaflavin, rubropunctamine and monascorubramine, were apparently increased with AN supplement. To be noted, via real-time quantitative PCR strategy, the expression level of mppG , closely relative to orange pigments biosynthesis, was significantly down-regulated. However, the expression of mppE , involved in yellow pigments pathway, was up-regulated. Moreover, the broth pH value was dropped to 2.5–3.5 in the fermentation process resulted from AN treatment, along with the increased extracellular polysaccharide biosynthesis. Taken together, the change of MPs categories and amounts by AN might be the driving force for the color characteristics variation in M. purpureus M9. The present study provided useful data for producing MPs with different compositions and modified color characteristics.",

Due to their ubiquitous nature, biofilms are of great concern for environment as well as human health. In the present study, an integrated process for the co-production of a cocktail of carbohydrases from a natural variant of Aspergillus niger was designed. The enzyme cocktail was found to have a noteworthy potential to eradicate/disperse the biofilms of selected pathogens. For application of enzymes as an antibiofilm agent, the enzyme productivities were enhanced by statistical modelling using response surface methodology (RSM). The antibiofilm potential of the enzyme cocktail was studied in terms of (i) in vitro cell dispersal assay (ii) release of reducing sugars from the biofilm polysaccharides (iii) the effect of enzyme treatment on biofilm cells and architecture by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Potential of the enzyme cocktail to disrupt/disperse the biofilm of selected pathogens from biopolymer surfaces was also assessed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) analysis. Further, their usage in conjunction with antibiotics was assessed and it was inferred from the results that the use of enzyme cocktail augmented the efficacy of the antibiotics. The study thus provides promising insights into the prospect of using multiple carbohydrases for management of heterogeneous biofilms formed in natural and clinical settings.",

We found the contents of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), available potassium (AK), available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP), and NH 4 + -N were increased after straw mulching and nitrogen application in alkaline purple soil, so did the amoA genes abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaeal (AOA) and bacterial (AOB). Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis revealed that Thaumarchaeote (448-bp T-RF) was dominated the AOA communities, whereas Nitrosospira sp (111-bp T-RF) dominated the AOB communities. The community compositions of both AOA and AOB were altered by straw mulching and nitrogen application in alkaline purple soil, however, the AOB communities was more responsive than AOA communities to the straw mulching and nitrogen application. Further analysis indicated that SOC and AP were the main factors affecting the abundance and community compositions of AOA and AOB in alkaline purple soil. The present study reported that straw mulching and nitrogen strategies differently shape the soil ammonia oxidizers community structure and abundance, which should be considered when evaluating agricultural management strategies regarding their sustainability and soil quality.",

In silico analysis suggested that MtCel6A is a GH6 CBH and belongs to CBHII family, which is structurally similar to Cel6A of Humicola insolens. The recombinant MtCel6A is expressed as active inclusion bodies, and the molecular mass of the purified enzyme is ~ 45 kDa. The rMtCel6A is active in a wide range of pH (4-12) and temperatures (40-100 °C) with optima at pH 10.0 and 60 °C. It exhibits T1/2 of 6.0 and 1.0 h at 60 and 90 °C, respectively. The rMtCel6A is an extremozyme with organic solvent, salt and alkali tolerance. The Km, Vmax, kcat and kcat/Km values of the enzyme are 3.2 mg mL-1, 222.2 μmol mg-1 min-1, 2492 s-1 and 778.7 s-1 mg-1 mL-1, respectively. The product analysis of rMtCel6A confirmed that it is an exoenzyme that acts from the non-reducing end of cellulose. The addition of rMtCel6A to the commercial cellulase mix (Cellic CTec2) led to 1.9-fold increase in saccharification of the pre-treated sugarcane bagasse. The rMtCel6A is a potential CBH that finds utility in industrial processes such as in bioethanol, paper pulp and textile industries.",

Extracellular enzymes are thought to play an important role in their predation and also provide resources for discovering new antibacterial molecules. We previously isolated a myxobacterium, Corallococcus silvisoli c25j21 GDMCC 1.1387, which is predatory to plant pathogenic bacteria. In this study, we identified an endolysin-like GH19 glycoside hydrolase, C25GH19B, from the genome of c25j21.

C25GH19B showed lysozyme activity with the optimal reaction conditions at 40 °C and pH 4.5–5.0. Moreover, C25GH19B showed bacteriolytic activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative plant pathogenic bacteria. Our research provides not only a candidate enzyme for the development of novel biocontrol agents but also an experimental basis for further study on the function and mechanisms of extracellular enzymes in myxobacterial predation.",

Unveiling this knowledge is crucial for understanding the tolerance mechanism of H. bogdanii to alkaline stress. The aim of this study was to investigate how endophytic fungi affect secondary metabolites of H. bogdanii under alkaline stress at different concentrations. Endophyte-infected (E +) and endophyte-free (E-) individuals of H. bogdanii were used as materials in this study. The method of indoor vermiculite aseptic planting was adopted. After mixed alkali stress treatment, the roots, stems, and leaves of the plants were collected to measure the indicators related to secondary metabolites. The results showed that endophytic fungi improved the alkali resistance of H. bogdanii by improving the related indicators of secondary metabolites. endophytic fungi significantly increased the contents of phosphorus, polyphenols, and alkaloids, and the activities of polyphenol oxidase and acid phosphatase, and significantly reduced flavonoid content. The content of polyphenols and alkaloids in stems, polyphenol oxidase activity in stems and leaves, and acid phosphatase activity in leaves were significantly affected. The findings of this study may aid in amplifying the alkali resistance mechanism of endophytic fungi to H. bogdanii as well as provide insights into improving the alkali resistance of other plants.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Although urinary tract infections (UTIs) affect many people, they are usually a disease observed in women. UTIs happen when exogenous and endogenous bacteria enter the urinary tract and colonize there. Cystitis and pyelonephritis occur when bacteria infect the bladder and the kidneys, respectively. UTIs become much serious if the bacteria causing the infection are antibiotic resistant. Since the pathogenic microorganisms have been adopted to current antibiotics via genetic variations, UTIs have become an even more severe health problem. Therefore, there is a great need for the discovery of novel antibiotics. Genome mining of nonpathogenic and pathogenic Escherichia coli strains for investigating secondary metabolites were conducted by the antiSMASH analysis. When the resulting secondary metabolites were examined, it was found that some of the siderophores are effective in UTIs. In conclusion, since the siderophore production in E. coli is directly related to UTIs, these molecules can be a good target for development of future pharmaceutical approaches and compounds. Siderophores can also be used in industrial studies due to their higher chelating affinity for iron.",

Pseudomonas putida LWPZF is a plant growth-promoting bacterium isolated from the rhizosphere soil of Cercidiphyllum japonicum. Inoculation treatment with LWPZF could significantly promote the growth of C. japonicum seedlings. P. putida LWPZF has a variety of plant growth-promoting properties, including the ability to solubilize phosphate, synthesize ACC deaminase and IAA. The P. putida LWPZF genome contained a circular chromosome (6,259,530 bp) and a circular plasmid (160,969 bp) with G+C contents of 61.75% and 58.25%, respectively. There were 5632 and 169 predicted protein-coding sequences (CDSs) on the chromosome and the plasmid respectively. Genome sequence analysis revealed lots of genes associated with biosynthesis of IAA, pyoverdine, ACC deaminase, trehalose, volatiles acetoin and 2,3-butanediol, 4-hydroxybenzoate, as well as gluconic acid contributing phosphate solubilization. Additionally, we identified many heavy metal resistance genes, including arsenate, copper, chromate, cobalt-zinc-cadmium, and mercury. These results suggest that P. putida LWPZF shows strong potential in the fields of biofertilizer, biocontrol and heavy metal contamination soil remediation. The data presented in this study will allow us to better understand the mechanisms of plant growth promotion, biocontrol, and anti-heavy metal of P. putida LWPZF.",

This study was aimed to identify different NTM species by sequencing the rpoB gene and evaluating the effectiveness of argH and cya gene markers. In total 64 clinical isolates suspected to NTM were collected. The identification of the isolates was done by standard conventional methods and PCR-based rpoB gene and sequence analysis. PCR sequencing of argH and cya genes was performed to evaluate the efficacy of these genes in identifying and differentiating different species and subspecies of NTM. Among 64 isolates tested, 51 (79.68%) were detected by conventional tests as NTM. The results of rpoB sequence analysis revealed that the 56 clinical isolates were identified in 10 species of NTM and 8 remaining isolates which showed ambiguous results by rpoB sequencing, application of argH and cya sequencing could detect these isolates. Furthermore, by using cya gene sequencing, M. abscessus subspecies were properly differentiated. Although the rpoB sequencing as a standard method, is beneficial for detecting various species of NTM, however, based on our findings, argH and cya gene markers have a superb ability to discriminate closely related species.

Based on alignment of the 16 S rRNA sequence with other reference relatives, ALW1 showed the closest relationship with Microbulbifer aggregans CCB-MM1 T . The cell morphology and some basic physiological and biochemical parameters of ALW1 cells were characterised. ALW1 is a Gram-negative, rod- or oval-shaped, non-spore-forming and non-motile bacterium. The DNA–DNA relatedness values of ALW1 with type strains of M. gwangyangensis (JCM 17,800), M. aggregans (JCM 31,875), M. maritimus (JCM 12,187), M. okinawensis (JCM 16,147) and M. rhizosphaerae (DSM 28,920) were 28.9%, 43.3%, 41.2%, 35.4% and 45.6%, respectively. The major cell wall sugars of ALW1 were determined to be ribose and galactose, which differed from other closely related species. These characteristics indicated that ALW1 could be assigned to a separate species of the genus Microbulbifer . The complete genome of ALW1 contained one circular chromosome with 4,682,287 bp and a GC content of 56.86%. The putative encoded proteins were categorised based on their functional annotations.

    "abstract": "Acacia hydaspica possesses varied pharmacological attributes. We aimed to examine the antimicrobial potential and isolate the active antimicrobial metabolites. The plant extract was fractionated and the antimicrobial activity of the crude extract, fractions and compounds was tested by agar well diffusion and agar tube dilution and broth dilution methods. Bacterial strains selected for bioactivity testing were Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii while selected strains from kingdom fungi were Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Fusarium solani and Aspergillus. The active compounds were isolated from Acacia hydaspica by bioassay-guided fractionation and identified by nuclear magnetic resonance and spectroscopic techniques. S. aureus cell surface proteins, Autolysins (Atl), Clumping factor A (ClfA), and Fibronectin Binding Proteins (FnBP), were molecularly docked with Catechin 3-O-gallate (CG) and Methyl gallate (MG) and binding energy and molecular interactions between the proteins and compounds were analyzed. Ethyl acetate (AHE) and Butanol (AHB) fractions of A. hydaspica were the most active fractions against tested microbial strains. Therefore, both were subjected to bioassay-directed fractionation which led to the isolation of one pure active antimicrobial AHE and one active pure compound from AHB fraction besides active enriched isolates. Methyl-gallate (MG) and catechin-3-gallate (CG) are active compounds extracted from AHE and AHB fractions respectively. In antibacterial testing MG significantly inhibited the growth of E. coli (MIC50 = 21.5 µg/ml), B. subtilus (MIC50 = 23 µg/ml) and S. aureus (MIC50 = 39.1 µg/ml) while moderate to low activity was noticed against other tested bacterial strains. Antifungal testing reveals that MG showed potent antifungal activity against F. solani (MIC50 = 33.9 µg/ml) and A. niger (MIC50 = 41.5 µg/ml) while lower antifungal activity was seen in other tested strains. AHB fractions and pure compound (CG) showed specific antibacterial activity against S. aureus only (MIC50 = 10.1 µg/ml) while compound and enriched fractions showed moderate to no activity against other bacterial and fungal strains respectively. Molecular docking analysis revealed that CG interacted more strongly with the cell surface proteins than MG. Among these proteins, CG made a stronger complex with ClfA (binding affinity - 9.7) with nine hydrophobic interactions and five hydrogen bonds. Methyl gallate (MG) and catechin 3-O-gallate (CG) are the major antimicrobial compound from A. hydaspica that inhibit the growth of specific microbes. The occurrence of MG and CG endorse the traditional antimicrobial applicability of A. hydaspica, and it can be a legitimate alternative to control specific microbial infections.",

In the present study, we firstly identified the enzymatic characteristics of two Gdhs (GdhA and GdhB). The results showed that both GdhA and GdhB prefers NADPH as a coenzyme and have higher affinity for 2-OG than glutamate. The growth characteristics of gdhAΔ mutant and gdhBΔ mutant, gdhABΔ mutant showed GdhA serves as the main conduit for ammonium assimilation, and GdhB is the main glutamate- metabolizing enzyme in C. glutamicum. The full-genome transcriptomic analysis was used to investigate physiological response of C. glutamicum to the glutamate as nitrogen source, and gdh deletion. The results showed that the nitrogen starvation response was elicited when glutamine served as the sole nitrogen source. gdhAΔBΔ double deletion trigger a partially deregulated nitrogen starvation response, in which genes involved in nitrogen assimilation showed obviously upregulated in a certain extent. On the other hand, the genes of phosphotransferase system (PTS) and glycolysis pathway, most genes in pentose phosphate pathway were significantly upregulated, indicating that gdh deficiency initiated the enhancement of the absorption and metabolism of carbon sources.

Fresh AM was ensiled in the mini-silos (3.5 kg) and treated with (1) no additive (control), (2) 5% molasses, (3) 10% molasses, (4) 1 × 104 CFU of Saccharomyces cerevisiae [SC]/g of fresh silage, (5) 1 × 104 CFU of SC/g of fresh silage + 5% molasses, (6) 1 × 104 CFU of SC/g of fresh silage + 10% molasses, (7) 1 × 108 CFU of SC/g of fresh silage, (8) 1 × 108 CFU of SC/g of fresh silage + 5% molasses, and (9) 1 × 108 CFU of SC/g of fresh silage + 10% molasses for 60 days. The lowest concentrations of NDF and ADF were related to treatments no. 6 and 5, respectively (p < 0.0001). The ash content as well as sodium, calcium, potassium, phosphorus and magnesium were highest in treatment no 2. Silages containing 10% molasses (no. 3) had the highest and lowest lactic (p < 0.0001) and butyric (p < 0.0001) acids, respectively. The highest amount of potential gas production was observed in treatments no. 5 and 6, respectively (p < 0.0001). Total yeast was decreased with increasing molasses in the silages (p < 0.0001). Acid-base buffering capacity was also highest in treatments no. 6 and 5, respectively (p = 0.0003). In general, due to the fibrous nature of AM, it is recommended to add molasses at levels of 5 or 10% when ensiling. The silages containing SC at a lower level (1 × 104 CFU) along with higher levels of molasses (10% of DM) had better ruminal digestion-fermentation characteristics compared to other silages.

    "abstract": "The complex regulatory network in Bacillus, known as quorum sensing, offers many opportunities to modify bacterial gene expression and hence to control bioprocesses. One target regulated by this mechanism is the activity of the PsrfA promoter, which is engaged in the formation of lipopeptide surfactin. It was hypothesised that deletion of rapC, rapF and rapH, encoding for prominent Rap-phosphatases known to affect PsrfA activity, would enhance surfactin production. Therefore, these genes were deleted in a sfp+ derivative of B. subtilis 168 with subsequent evaluation of quantitative data. Up to the maximum product formation of the reference strain B. subtilis KM1016 after 16 h of cultivation, the titers of the rap deletion mutants did not exceed the reference. However, an increase in both product yield per biomass YP/X and specific surfactin productivity qsurfactin was observed, without any considerable effect on the ComX activity. By extending the cultivation time, a 2.7-fold increase in surfactin titer was observed after 24 h for strain CT10 (ΔrapC) and a 2.5-fold increase for CT11 (ΔrapF) compared to the reference strain KM1016. In addition, YP/X was again increased for strains CT10 and CT11, with values of 1.33 g/g and 1.13 g/g, respectively. Interestingly, the effect on surfactin titer in strain CT12 (ΔrapH) was not as distinct, although it achieved the highest promoter activity (PsrfA-lacZ).

    "abstract": "Abstract Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a more dangerous form of chronic non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In the current investigation, the influence of citicoline on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NASH was examined, both alone and in combination with Lactobacillus (probiotic). NASH was induced by feeding HFD (10% sugar, 10% lard stearin, 2% cholesterol, and 0.5% cholic acid) to rats for 13 weeks and received single i.p. injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 30 mg/kg) after 4 weeks. Citicoline was given at two dose levels (250 mg and 500 mg, i.p.) at the beginning of the sixth week, and in combination with an oral suspension of Lactobacillus every day for eight weeks until the study’s conclusion. HFD/STZ induced steatohepatitis as shown by histopathological changes, elevated serum liver enzymes, serum hyperlipidemia and hepatic fat accumulation. Moreover, HFD convinced oxidative stress by increased lipid peroxidation marker (MDA) and decreased antioxidant enzymes (GSH and TAC). Upregulation of TLR4/NF-kB and the downstream inflammatory cascade (TNF-α, and IL-6) as well as Pentaraxin, fetuin-B and apoptotic markers (caspase-3 and Bax) were observed. NASH rats also had massive increase in Bacteroides spp., Fusobacterium spp., E. coli, Clostridium spp., Providencia spp., Prevotella interrmedia , and P. gingivalis while remarkable drop in Bifidobacteria spp . and Lactobacillus spp. Co-treatment with citicoline alone and with Lactobacillus improve histopathological NASH outcomes and reversed all of these molecular pathological alterations linked to NASH via upregulating the expression of Nrf2/HO-1 and downregulating TLR4/NF-kB signaling pathways. These results suggest that citicoline and lactobacillus may represent new hepatoprotective strategies against NASH progression.",

Although lignocellulose-degrading enzymes are involved in the early stages of host infection, the parasitic life cycle of this fungus has not been fully understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the activities of laccase (Lac), manganese peroxidase (MnP), and lignin peroxidase (LiP) from I. obliquus cultivated in Kirk's medium. The fungus was subjected to genome sequencing, and genes related to wood degradation were identified. The draft genome sequence of this fungus comprised 21,203 predicted protein-coding genes, of which 134 were estimated to be related to wood degradation. Among these, 47 genes associated with lignin degradation were found to have the highest number of mnp genes. Furthermore, we cloned the cDNA encoding a putative MnP, referred to as IoMnP1, and characterized its molecular structure. The results show that IoMnP1 has catalytic properties analogous to MnP. Phylogenetic analysis also confirmed that IoMnP1 was closely related to the MnPs from Pyrrhoderma noxium, Fomitiporia mediterranea, and Sanghuangporus baumii, which belong to the same family of Hymenochaetaceae. From the above results, we suggest that IoMnP1 is a member of MnPs.",

However, little is known about its ability to consume the precursors cinnamic and p-coumaric acid. In this study, we demonstrate that Y. lipolytica can consume these precursors through multiple pathways that are partially dependent on the cultivation medium. By monitoring the aromatic acid concentrations over time, we found that cinnamic acid is converted to p-coumaric acid. We identified potential proteins with a trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase activity in Y. lipolytica and constructed a collection of 15 knock-out strains to identify the genes responsible for the reaction. We identified YALI1_B28430g as the gene encoding for a protein that converts cinnamic acid to p-coumaric acid (designated as TCM1). By comparing different media compositions we found that complex media components (casamino acids and yeast extract) induce this pathway. Additionally, we discover the conversion of p-coumaric acid to 4-hydroxybenzoic acid. Our findings provide new insight into the metabolic capabilities of Y. lipolytica and hold great potential for the future development of improved strains for flavonoid production.",

Pleurotus eryngii is an important edible and medicinal fungus belonging to the Basidiomycota phylum and can grow on a variety of natural substrates. In the present study, genome-wide profiling of P. eryngii identified 10 genes encoding its laccase isoenzymes. Conservative sequence analysis demonstrated that all PeLacs possess classical laccase structural domains. Phylogenetic analysis yielded four major subgroups, the members of which are similar with respect to conserved gene organization, protein domain architecture, and consensus motifs. The 10 PeLacs formed three groups together with 12 PoLacs in Pleurotus ostreatus, indicating that they share a high level of evolutionary homology. Cis-responsive element analysis implied that PeLacs genes play a role in growth and development and lignocellulose degradation. Targeted overexpression of PeLac5 reduced the time to primordia formation and their development to fruiting bodies. Gene expression patterns in the presence of different lignocellulosic substrates indicate that three PeLacs genes (2, 4, and 9) are key to lignocellulose degradation. This work presents the first inventory of laccase genes in P. eryngii and preliminarily explores their functions, which may help to uncover the manner by which these proteins utilize substrates.",

This study aimed to discover how fatty acid affect cognitive function by regulating intestinal flora in obesity. Obese subjects were recruited for cognitive function assessment, and participants were divided into obese group with cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 49) and obese cognitively normal group (Non_MCI, n = 55). In the erythrocyte membrane, the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), linoleic acid (C18:2 n-6) and arachidonic acid (C20:4 n-6) and n-6/n-3 ratio was higher in the MCI group than in the Non_MCI group. However, the α-linolenic acid (C18:3 n-3) percentage of the erythrocyte membrane was lower in the MCI group. We found that Coriobacteriales_Incertae_Sedis was positively correlated with erythrocyte membrane C20:4 n-6 and n-6 PUFA and negatively correlated with cognitive scores in obese patients. In addition, several of the functional pathways we predicted were significantly different in the MCI and Non_MCI groups. Higher levels of n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ratio in the erythrocyte membranes may influence the inflammatory response in the organism causing obesity induced cognitive damage. Moreover, high levels of n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ratio may also affect the intestinal flora of obese patients, which in turn may affect the cognitive function of obese patients.",

Nitrilase catalysed processes for the synthesis of pharmaceutically important acids from their corresponding nitriles are promising alternative over the cumbersome, hazardous, and energy demanding chemical processes. Nitrilase of Nocardia globerula NHB-2 (NitNHB2) is expressed in presence of isobutyronitrile in the growth medium (1.0% glucose, 0.5% peptone, 0.3% beef extract, and 0.1 % yeast extract, pH 7.5). NitNHB2 hydrolyses 4-cyanopyridine (4-CP) to INA without accumulation of isonicotinamide, which is common in the reaction catalysed via fungal nitrilases. The NitNHB2 suffers from substrate inhibition effect and hydrolysing activity up to 250 mM 4-CP was recorded. Complete conversion of 200 mM 4-CP to INA was achieved in 40 min using resting cell concentration corresponding to 10 U mL -1 nitrilase activity in the reaction. Substrate inhibition effect in the fed batch reaction (200 mM substrate feed/40min) led to formation of only 729 mM INA. In a fed batch reaction (100 mM 4-CP/20min), substrate inhibition effect was encountered after 7 th feed and a total of 958 mM INA was produced in 400 min. The fed batch reaction scaled up to 1 L and 100% hydrolysis of 700 mM of 4-CP to INA at 35°C achieved in 140 min. The rate of INA production was 21.1 g h -1 mg DCW -1 . This is the fastest biotransformation process ever reported for INA production with time and space productivity of 36 g L -1 h -1 using a bacterial nitrilase.",

In this study, the mechanism of light-enhanced ketone reduction was investigated in detail using several inhibitors of photosynthetic electron transport and of enzymes of the Calvin cycle. It is demonstrated that light intensity and photosynthesis inhibitors significantly affect the ketone reduction activity in Synechococcus. This indicates that the reduction correlates well with photosynthetic activity. Moreover, ketone reduction in Synechococcus specifically depends upon NADPH and not NADH. These results also suggest that cyanobacteria have the potential to be utilized as biocatalytic systems for direct usage of light energy in various applications such as syntheses of useful compounds and remediation of environmental pollutants.",

The proportion of denitrifying bacteria in the total isolates was more than 6-fold larger with FSC isolation (57.1%) compared with the APD method (9.2%). Denitrifying bacteria belonging to Alphaproteobacteria and Bacilli were commonly isolated using both methods, whereas those belonging to Betaproteobacteria, which had been found to be active in the denitrification-inductive paddy soil, were isolated only with the FSC method. On the other hand, Actinobacteria were only isolated using the APD method. The mean potential denitrification activity of the FSC isolates was higher than that of the APD isolates. Overall, FSC isolation was confirmed to be an excellent method for studying denitrifying bacteria compared with the standard agar plate dilution method.",

Therefore, the aim of this study was to establish genetic relatedness between faecal coliforms and enterococci isolated from the river water and riverbed sediments of Apies River to better understand the genetic similarity of microorganisms between the sediment and water phases. Indicator bacteria were subjected to a molecular study, which consisted of PCR amplification and sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA gene using specific primers for faecal coliforms and enterococci, respectively. Results revealed that the Apies River had high faecal pollution levels with enterococci showing low to moderate correlation coefficient (r2 values ranged from 0.2605 to 0.7499) compared to the faecal coliforms which showed zero to low correlation (r2 values ranged from 0.0027 to 0.1407) indicating that enterococci may be better indicator than faecal coliforms for detecting faecal contamination in riverbed sediments. The phylogenetic tree of faecal coliforms revealed a 98% homology among their nucleotide sequences confirming the close genetic relatedness between river water and riverbed sediment isolates. The phylogenetic tree of the enterococci showed that Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium are the predominant species found in both river water and riverbed sediments with bootstrap values of ≥99%. A high degree of genetic relatedness between sediment and water isolates indicated a possible common ancestry and transmission pathway.

    "abstract": "The zygomycete fungus Lichtheimia ramosa H71D, isolated from sugarcane bagasse compost, was identified by applying phylogenetic analysis based on the DNA sequence of the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS), and subsequent secondary structure analysis of ITS2. L. ramosa H71D was able to grow over a wide range of temperatures (25-45 °C), manifesting optimal growth at 37 °C. A 64 kDa xylanase (named LrXynA) was purified from the culture supernatant of L. ramosa H71D grown on 2% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), as the only carbon source. LrXynA displayed optimal activity at pH 6 and temperature of 65 °C. The enzyme retained more than 50% of its maximal activity over a broad range of pH values (4.5-7.5). Enzyme half-life (t½) times at 55, 65 and 75 °C were 80, 25, and 8 min, respectively. LrXynA showed higher affinity (k M of 2.87 mg/mL) and catalytic efficiency (k cat /k M of 0.651 mg s/mL) towards Beechwood xylan in comparison to other substrates such as Birchwood xylan, Oat-spelt xylan, CMC, Avicel and Solka floc. The predominant final products from LrXynA-mediated hydrolysis of Beechwood xylan were xylobiose and xylotriose, suggesting that the enzyme is an endo-β-1,4 xylanase. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging of sugar cane bagasse (SCB) treated with LrXynA, alone or in combination with commercial cellulases, showed a positive effect on the hydrolysis of SCB. To our knowledge, this is the first report focusing on the biochemical and functional characterization of an endo-β-1,4 xylanase from the thermotolerant and fast-growing fungus Lichtheimia ramosa.",

    "abstract": "Increased interest in fullerene C60 and derivatives in recent years implies an intensification of their environmental spread. Yet, the potential risks for living organisms are largely unknown, including the interaction of C60 with fungal organisms. This may be especially relevant for mycotoxigenic fungi since C60 may both scavenge and produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), and oxidative stress induces mycotoxin production in fungi. Therefore, this study examined effects of environmentally plausible concentrations of C60 (0, 10, 50, and 100 ng/mL) on Aspergillus flavus growth and aflatoxin production in culture media. In addition, ROS-dependent oxidative stress biomarkers-thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), reduced and oxidised glutathione ratio, superoxide dismutase isoenzymes, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase were determined in mycelia. Nanoparticles of fullerene C60 (nC60) did not exhibit strong antifungal activity against A. flavus. At the same time, nC60 caused an antiaflatoxigenic effect at 10-100 ng/mL, and 50 ng/mL unexpectedly enhanced aflatoxin production. The TBARS content, reduced and oxidised glutathione ratio, and copper, zinc superoxide dismutase activity suggest that 10 ng/mL nC60 exerted antioxidative action and reduced aflatoxin B1 production within fungal cells. Detected prooxidative effects of 50 ng/mL fullerene exceeded cellular defenses and consequently enhanced aflatoxin B1 production. Finally, the results obtained with 100 ng/mL nC60 point to prooxidative effects, but the absence of increase in aflatoxin output may indicate additional, presumably cytotoxic effects of nC60. Thus, a range of rather low levels of nC60 in the environment has a potential to modify aflatoxin production in A. flavus. Due to possible implications, further studies should test these results in environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Microbial degradation in the rumen and dietary availability of methionine amino acid have been reported as limiting in dairy ruminants. The aim of the present study was to examine the post-ruminal effects of feeding ruminants different concentrations of rumen-protected methionine (RPM) in low crude protein diets using the long-term rumen simulation method (Rusitec) followed by in vitro abomasum and ileum digestibility technique. The experiment contained four treatment groups: (1) high protein, without RPM supplementation (HP); (2) low protein, without RPM supplementation (LP); (3) low protein supplementation with low RPM (LPLM); and (4) low protein supplementation with high RPM (LPHM) mixed per 20 ± 0.04 g basal diet in every fermenter. The results showed that the LPLM and LPHM groups had significantly higher disappearance of crude protein and neutral detergent fiber in the abomasum and ileum than the HP treatment (P < 0.05) and were the same as the LP group (P > 0.05). The proportions of short-chain fatty acids and total volatile fatty acids in the abomasum and ileum were the same between the LPHM and HP groups (P > 0.05); however, the LPLM group was found to be significantly (P < 0.05) lower than the HP group and similar to the LP group (P > 0.05). Rusitec pH before or after changing feed bags and daily ammonia nitrogen production in the abomasum and ileum were non significantly (P > 0.05) different among all groups. In conclusion, RPM supplementation with low crude protein diets promoted post-ruminal digestibility and production of volatile fatty acids.",

Among the six pairs of primers that we designate here, NS5 was the most efficient with a high sensitivity of up to 3.3 ng/μl and reproducible specificity on eight pathogen samples that were used as negative controls. The real-time fluorescence reverse transcription LAMP detection process can be completed within 35 min.

During pre-treatments of (ligno) cellulose through thermic and/or enzymatic processes, complex mixtures of oligo saccharides with beta 1,4-glycosidic bonds can be produced. In this paper, the capability of C. acetobutylicum to ferment glucose and cellobiose, alone and in mixtures was studied. Kinetic studies indicated that a diauxic growth occurs when both glucose and cellobiose are present in the medium. In mixtures, D-glucose is the preferred substrate even if cells were pre grown with cellobiose as the substrate. After the complete consumption of glucose, the growth kinetics exhibits an adaptation time, of few hours, before to be able to use cellobiose. Because of this diauxic phenomenon, the nature of the carbon source deriving from a cellulose hydrolysis pre-treatment could strongly influence the kinetic performances of a fermentation process with C. acetobutylicum.",

Natural products from microorganism are regarded as the important substitution antimicrobial agents of antibiotics. We isolated a new strain, Bacillus sp.

Additionally, the growth of salmon was effectively promoted when fed with inactivated strain GFP-2 as the inhibition agent of pathogenic bacteria. The genes encoding antimicrobial peptides like LCI, YFGAP and hGAPDH and gene clusters for secondary metabolites and bacteriocins, such as difficidin, bacillibactin, bacilysin, surfactin, butirosin, macrolactin, bacillaene, fengycin, lanthipeptides and LCI, were predicted in the genome of Bacillus sp.

The gene encoding β-1,3-1,4-glucanase was successfully cloned from the genome and this protein was detected in the culture supernatant of Bacillus sp. GFP-2 by the antibody produced in rabbit immunized with the recombinant β-1,3-1,4-glucanase, indicating that this strain could express β-1,3-1,4-glucanase, which might partially contribute to its antimicrobial activities.

RNA extraction was performed on these samples, as well as on the respective pellets derived from liquid cultures brain heart infusion. After evaluating RNA integrity, complementary DNA was synthesized, followed by the relative quantification each of the genes of interest. Mean mRNA expression of the five genes found in abscesses and in cultures differed significantly, with respective values of: nanH 811.50 ± 198.27 and 359.35 ± 75.45 (p = 0.009); cpp 856.31 ± 385.11 and 154.54 ± 94.34 (p = 0.0039); plD 922.70 ± 450.73 and 212.41 ± 153.10 (p = 0.016); sodC 1,293.53 ± 564.75 and 223.63 ± 145.58 (p = 0.016); spaC 1,157.10 ± 525.13 and 214.26 ± 125.70 (p = 0,016).

    "abstract": "With volatile fatty acids as substrates, the typical polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) production by mixed culture always includes two steps: PHA-storing culture enrichment via aerobic dynamic feeding strategy and PHA accumulation under nutrient-limited condition. To simplify the PHA-production steps, the enrichment and accumulation step were coupled in a SBR. At start-up period, to investigate the effect of settling selection, one acetate-fed SBR was operated by settling selection-double growth limitation (SS-DGL) strategy, while the other was operated by DGL strategy. The results showed that the stable operation in SBR1 was obtained at about 21, 12 days faster than SBR2, implying the settling selection accelerated the start-up process. After omitting the settling selection under the stable operation, the SBR1 was run above 15 days. The results showed that the performance was not substantial altered. Therefore, the settling selection affected the start-up process but not the stable operation. At operational period, based on the sharp decreasing of oxygen uptake rate (OUR), the poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) content was improved 13%, from 70 to 83% by feed-on-demand control-double growth limitation (FD-DGL). And the harvested volumetric productivity was 5.0 gPHB/L/day, almost 1-folder improvement. That was to say, the PHB production in a SBR of coupling the enrichment and accumulation step was improved by feed-on-demand control. Meanwhile, the FD experiment can keep steady running for 10 SRTs. Therefore, the SS-DGL/FD-DGL strategy was a promising method for PHA production.",

The Km and kcat values were 0.38 mg mL−1 and 70 s−1, respectively, using soluble starch as a substrate.

Thin layer chromatography revealed that only glucose was produced as the product of starch hydrolysis. The amylase from L. incrustata is a glucoamylase with promising characteristics such as temperature stability over an extended period, high substrate affinity and stability to a range of chemicals.

This reaction is an essential step in the biocatalytic production of the food supplement vitamin C from D-glucose or D-gluconic acid. As 2,5-DKG reductase is usually produced recombinantly, it is of interest to establish an efficient process for 2,5-DKG reductase production that also satisfies food safety requirements.

Our results indicate that both systems are suitable for 2,5-DKG reductase expression. Maximum production yields were obtained with Lb. plantarum/pSIP609 by pH control at 6.5. With 262 U per litre of broth, this represents the highest heterologous expression level so far reported for 2,5-DKG reductase from C. glutamicum.

Cordycepin produced by C. militaris has also been found to protect the liver. Moreover, deep ocean water (DOW) was proven to increase the functional compounds of functional fungi-fermented products. However, the regulation of the metals in DOW is still unclear. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of DOW and certain major ions on the production of cordycepin and adenosine of C. militaris. The results indicated that, compared with using ultra-pure water (UPW), using DOW to cultivate C. militaris in a submerged culture increases the production of biomass and adenosine (p < 0.05). In the results of solid culture, the concentration of DOW exhibits a dose effect on cordycepin production. DOW contains ions that can improve the effectiveness of cordycepin, such as Mg2+, Na+, Ca2+, Fe2+, and NO3 −, whereas the ion Cl− features an inhibitory effect. Moreover, Mg2+, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Fe2+, and SO4 2−can increase the production of adenosine, whereas Cl− cannot. However, the synthetic water made from various types of sodium salts (MgCl2, NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, FeCl2) had nearly the same effect on cordycepin production as that of DOW.",

    "abstract": "In this study, a novel rDNA based plasmid was developed for display of heterologous proteins on the cell surface of Yarrowia lipolytica using the C-terminal end of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored Y. lipolytica cell wall protein 1 (YlCWP1). mCherry was used as a model protein to assess the efficiency of the constructed plasmid. Y. lipolytica transformants harbouring the expression cassettes showed a purple colour phenotype on selective YNB-casamino plates as compared to control cells indicating that mCherry was displayed on the cells. Expression of mCherry on cells of Y. lipolytica was confirmed by both fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry. Furthermore, SDS-PAGE analysis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-time-of (TOF)-mass spectrometry (MS) peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) confirmed that the protein cleaved from the yeast cells using enterokinase was mCherry. Efficient cleavage of mCherry reported in this work offers an alternative purification method for displayed heterologous proteins on Y. lipolytica cells using the plasmid constructed in this study. The developed displaying system offers great potential for industrial production and purification of heterologous proteins at low cost.",

Although non-allosteric d -LDHs from Lactobacilli have been extensively studied, the catalytic properties of allosteric d -LDHs from Gram-negative bacteria except for Escherichia coli remain unknown. We characterized the catalytic properties of d -LDHs from three Gram-negative bacteria, Fusobacterium nucleatum (FNLDH), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PALDH), and E. coli (ECLDH) to gain an insight into allosteric mechanism of d -LDHs. While PALDH and ECLDH exhibited narrow substrate specificities toward pyruvate like usual d -LDHs, FNLDH exhibited a broad substrate specificity toward hydrophobic 2-ketoacids such as 2-ketobutyrate and 2-ketovalerate, the former of which gave a 2-fold higher k cat /S 0.5 value than pyruvate. Whereas the three enzymes consistently showed hyperbolic shaped pyruvate saturation curves below pH 6.5, FNLDH and ECLDH, and PALDH showed marked positive and negative cooperativity, respectively, in the pyruvate saturation curves above pH 7.5. Oxamate inhibited the catalytic reactions of FNLDH competitively with pyruvate, and the PALDH reaction in a mixed manner at pH 7.0, but markedly enhanced the reactions of the two enzymes at low concentration through canceling of the apparent homotropic cooperativity at pH 8.0, although it constantly inhibited the ECLDH reaction. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and certain divalent metal ions such as Mg 2+ also markedly enhanced the reactions of FNLDH and PALDH, but none of them enhanced the reaction of ECLDH. Thus, our study demonstrates that bacterial d -LDHs have highly divergent allosteric and catalytic properties.",

Yarrowia lipolytica, an oleaginous yeast, is considered as a model for bio-oil production due to its ability to accumulate a large amount of lipids. However, the function of lysine acetylation in this organism is elusive. Here, we performed a global acetylproteome analysis of Y. lipolytica ACA-DC 50109. In total, 3163 lysine acetylation sites were identified in 1428 proteins, which account for 22.1% of the total proteins in the cell. Fifteen conserved acetylation motifs were detected. The acetylated proteins participate in a wide variety of biological processes. Notably, a total of 65 enzymes involved in lipid biosynthesis were found to be acetylated. The acetylation sites are distributed in almost every type of conserved domains in the multi-enzymatic complexes of fatty acid synthetases. The provided dataset probably illuminates the crucial role of reversible acetylation in oleaginous microorganisms, and serves as an important resource for exploring the physiological role of lysine acetylation in eukaryotes.",

The virulence of the recombinant B. bassiana strain (Bb-AaIT) against Aedes albopictus adults (which occurs via penetration through the cuticle during spore germination or by conidia ingestion), and the larvae (by conidia ingestion) was measured with bioassays. The median lethal concentration (LC50) of Bb-AaIT against A. albopictus larvae was 313.3-fold lower on day 4 and 11.3-fold lower on day 10 than that of the wild type (WT). Through conidia feeding or body contact, Bb-AaIT killed 50% of adult female mosquitoes at 3.9- or 1.9-fold reduced concentrations on day 4 and at 2.1- or 2.4-fold reduced concentrations on day 10. Compared with the results for the WT, the median lethal time (LT50) of Bb-AaIT was reduced by 28.6% at 1 × 107 conidia ml−1 and 34.3% at 1 × 106 conidia ml−1 in the larvae bioassay by conidia ingestion, while it decreased 32.3% at 1 × 107 conidia ml−1 by conidia ingestion and 24.2% at 1 × 108 conidia ml−1 by penetrating through the cuticle in the adult bioassay. All the differences were significant. Our findings indicated that Bb-AaIT had higher virulence and faster action than the WT in killing the larval and adult mosquitoes, and therefore, it is valuable for development as a commercial mosquito pesticide.",

Six bacterial strains were selected for this study: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Listeria monocytogenes, Klebsiella pneumonia and Bacillus subtilis. After synthesis, serial twofold dilutions of β-casein 197 were added to select for sensitive bacteria. The disk diffusion method and analysis of bacterial staining were used to identify antibacterial effect, while DNA-binding, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were used to explore antimicrobial mechanisms. Disk diffusion showed that E. coli, S. aureus and Y. enterocolitica were sensitive to the β-casein 197. In addition, live/dead fluorescent staining also confirmed antibacterial effects. Scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy revealed affected extracellular and intracellular structure for three species of bacteria, while a DNA-binding assay showed that the antimicrobial activity did not occur through DNA binding. This study suggests that β-casein 197 has antimicrobial activity against common pathogenic bacteria in newborns with infection.

In this study, four types of extracellular water-soluble yellow pigments (Y1-Y4) were generated by submerged fermentation with Monascus ruber CGMCC 10910, of which Y3 and Y4 had strong yellow fluorescence. The composition of the pigment mixtures was closely related to the fermentation temperature. The dominating pigments changed from Y1 to Y3 and Y4 when fermentation temperature increased from 30 to 35 °C. Increasing the temperature to 35 °C changed the metabolic pathways of the pigments, which inhibited the biosynthesis of Y1 and enhanced the biosynthesis of Y3 and Y4. Moreover, the yield of Y1 reduced insignificantly, while the yields of Y3 and Y4 increased by 98.21 and 79.31% respectively under two-stage temperature fermentation condition. The expression levels of the relative pigment biosynthetic genes, such as MpFasA2, MpFasB2, MpPKS5, mppR1, mppB, and mppE, were up-regulated at 35 °C. The two-stage temperature strategy is a potential method for producing water-soluble Monascus yellow pigments with strong yellow fluorescence.",

    "abstract": "Corynebacterium glutamicum is an important industrial producer of various amino acids and other metabolites. The C. glutamicum genome encodes seven sigma subunits (factors) of RNA polymerase: the primary sigma factor SigA (σA), the primary-like σB and five alternative sigma factors (σC, σD, σE, σH and σM). We have developed in vitro and in vivo methods to assign particular sigma factors to individual promoters of different classes. In vitro transcription assays and measurements of promoter activity using the overexpression of a single sigma factor gene and the transcriptional fusion of the promoter to the gfpuv reporter gene enabled us to reliably define the sigma factor dependency of promoters. To document the strengths of these methods, we tested examples of respective promoters for each C. glutamicum sigma factor. Promoters of the rshA (anti-sigma for σH) and trxB1 (thioredoxin) genes were found to be σH-dependent, whereas the promoter of the sigB gene (sigma factor σB) was σE- and σH-dependent. It was confirmed that the promoter of the cg2556 gene (iron-regulated membrane protein) is σC-dependent as suggested recently by other authors. The promoter of cmt1 (trehalose corynemycolyl transferase) was found to be clearly σD-dependent. No σM-dependent promoter was identified. The typical housekeeping promoter P2sigA (sigma factor σA) was proven to be σA-dependent but also recognized by σB. Similarly, the promoter of fba (fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase) was confirmed to be σB-dependent but also functional with σA. The study provided demonstrations of the broad applicability of the developed methods and produced original data on the analyzed promoters.",

In this study, a xylanase gene (xyn10A), predicted to encode a hydrolase domain of GH10, a linker region and a CBM1 domain, was cloned from a superior lignocellulose degrading strain Aspergillus fumigatus Z5 and successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris X33. Xyn10A has a specific xylanase activity of 34.4 U mg-1, and is optimally active at 90 °C and pH 6.0. Xyn10A shows quite stable at pHs ranging from 3.0 to 11.0, and keeps over 40% of xylanase activity after incubation at 70 °C for 1 h. Removal of CBM1 domain has a slight negative effect on its thermostability, but the further cleavage of linker region significantly decreased its stability at high temperature. The transfer of CBM1 and linker region to another GH10 xylanase can help to increase the thermostability. In addition, hydrolase domains between the two Xyn10A proteins naturally formed a dimer structure, which became more thermostable after removing the CBM1 or/and linker region. This thermostable Xyn10A is a suitable candidate for the highly efficient fungal enzyme cocktails for biomass conversion.",

The fast amplification reaction without betaine was established and capable of performing DNA replication within 25 min. Based on the novel probe-free labeling methods, we established a lateral flow assay to capture the specific loop-mediated isothermal amplification amplicons which were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate and biotin. And the final detection time of this system was within 40 min. The false positive results of the lateral flow assay induced by primer dimer tagged with fluorescein isothiocyanate and biotin were eliminated by Taq single strand DNA binding protein (4 ng/μL). Simultaneously, the efficiency of the fast loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay was achieved. By injection of Taq SSB into the amplification assay as a replacement for betaine, the novel probe-free method could detect Cronobacter species with high specificity and sensitivity at the detection limit in PIF of 101 cfu/g. Our overall strategy has excellent potential in the rapid diagnosis of Cronobacter species label-free by integrating loop-mediated isothermal amplification and lateral flow assay.",

Recombinant EntP inhibited growth of a variety of bacteria, including pathogenic species known to cause nosocomial infections, often with multidrug-resistant strains. In addition, recombinant EntP demonstrated broad antimicrobial activities in both high salt medium and human plasma and was stable at high temperatures.

    "abstract": "Abstract The present study investigated the anti-atherosclerotic potential of myricitrin in hypercholesterolemic rats. Rats were divided into the following groups: sham (standard food), control [1% high-cholesterol diet (HCD)], 1 μM myricitrin + 1% HCD, 10 μM myricitrin + 1% HCD, 100 μM myricitrin + 1% HCD, and the positive control (10 mg/kg body weight atorvastatin). The dose was given to rats via oral gavage for 45 consecutive days. Feeding of rats with 1% HCD caused substantial increases in the levels of LDL, cholesterol, and triglycerides (TG), while high-density lipoprotein (HDL) was reduced. However, rats supplemented with myricitrin had reduced levels of cholesterol, LDL, and TG to near-normal levels, whereas HDL was increased. Catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (Gpx), and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels were substantially reduced in the HCD-fed rats compared with sham rats. However, the rats supplemented with 100 μM myricitrin showed &gt; 50% increases in these levels. Lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were reduced following myricitrin treatment. The aortic cell wall area was significantly increased by 14.5% in HCD-fed rats. However, rats supplemented with 1, 10, and 100 μM myricitrin showed significant reductions in the aortic cell wall area of 2.3%, 4%, and 27.5%, respectively. This is the first report of the anti-atherosclerotic and hypolipidemic effects of myricitrin in hypercholesterolemic rats. Myricitrin decreased the level of total serum cholesterol and the role of aortic atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic rats.",

    "abstract": "The impact of pH coupled to process design for the conversion of the energy crop Arundo donax to ethanol was assessed in the present study under industrially relevant solids loadings. Two main process strategies were investigated, i.e. the traditional simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF) and a HYBRID design, where a long high temperature enzymatic hydrolysis step was carried out prior to continued low temperature SSCF, keeping the same total reaction time. Since acetic acid was identified as the major inhibitor in the slurry, the scenarios were investigated under different fermentation pH in order to alleviate the inhibitory effect on, in particular, xylose conversion. The results show that, regardless of fermentation pH, a higher glucan conversion could be achieved with the HYBRID approach compared to SSCF. Furthermore, it was found that increasing the pH from 5.0 to 5.5 for the fermentation phase had a large positive effect on xylose consumption for both process designs, although the SSCF design was more favored. With the high sugar concentrations available at the start of fermentation during the HYBRID design, the ethanol yield was reduced in favor of cell growth and glycerol production. This finding was confirmed in shake flask fermentations where an increase in pH enhanced both glucose and xylose consumption, but also cell growth and cell yield with the overall effect being a reduced ethanol yield. In conclusion this resulted in similar overall ethanol yields at the different pH values for the HYBRID design, despite the improved xylose uptake, whereas a significant increase in overall ethanol yield was found with the SSCF design.",

    "abstract": "Protected by extracellular polymers, microbes within biofilms are significantly more resistant to disinfectants. Current research has been instrumental in identifying nitric oxide donors and hydrogels as potential disinfectant additives. Nitric oxide (NO) donors are considered a very promising molecule as biofilm dispersal agents and hydrogels have recently attracted a lot of interest due to their biocompatible properties and ability to form stable thin films. When the NO donor MAHMA NONOate was dissolved in phosphate saline buffer, it was able to reduce the biomass of well-established biofilms up to 15% for at least 24 h of contact time. Encapsulation of MAHMA NONOate and molsidomine within a hydrogel composed of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) has shown a synergistic effect in dispersing well-established biofilms: after 2 h of exposure, moderate but significant dispersion was measured. After 6 h of exposure, the number of cells transitioning from the biofilm to the planktonic state was up to 0.6 log higher when compared with non-treated biofilms. To further explore the transport processes of NO donors within hydrogels, we measured the nitric oxide flux from gels, at 25°C for a composite of 0.1 µM MAHMA NONOate-CNC. Nitric oxide diffuses up to 500 µm from the hydrogel surface, with flux decreasing according to Fick's law. 60% of NO was released from the hydrogel composite during the first 23 min. These data suggest that the combined treatments with nitric oxide donor and hydrogels may allow for new sustainable cleaning strategies.",

Results showed that the biomass production of C. vulgaris in dairy wastewater can be enhanced by pretreatment and using supplementation with synthetic media. A recipe combining pretreated dairy wastewater (40 %) and synthetic medium (60 %) exhibited an improved growth of C. vulgaris. The effects of dairy wastewater on the ultrastructure of C. vulgaris cells were distinct compared to that of cells grown in synthetic medium. The C. vulgaris growth in both synthetic medium and manure wastewater without supplementing synthetic medium was lower than the growth in dairy manure supplemented with synthetic medium.

    "abstract": "To improve the temperature characteristics and catalytic efficiency of a glycoside hydrolase family (GHF) 11 xylanase from Aspergillus oryzae (AoXyn11A), its variants were predicted based on in silico design. Firstly, Gly21 with the maximum B-factor value, which was confirmed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation on the three-dimensional structure of AoXyn11A, was subjected to site-saturation mutagenesis. Thus, one variant with the highest thermostability, AoXyn11AG21I, was selected from the mutagenesis library, E. coli/Aoxyn11A G21X (X: any one of 20 amino acids). Secondly, based on the primary structure multiple alignment of AoXyn11A with seven thermophilic GHF11 xylanases, AoXyn11AY13F or AoXyn11AG21I-Y13F, was designed by replacing Tyr13 in AoXyn11A or AoXyn11AG21I with Phe. Finally, three variant-encoding genes, Aoxyn11A G21I, Aoxyn11A Y13F and Aoxyn11A G21I-Y13F, were constructed by two-stage whole-plasmid PCR method, and expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115, respectively. The temperature optimum (T opt) of recombinant (re) AoXyn11AG21I-Y13F was 60 °C, being 5 °C higher than that of reAoXyn11AG21I or reAoXyn11AY13F, and 10 °C higher than that of reAoXyn11A. The thermal inactivation half-life (t 1/2) of reAoXyn11AG21I-Y13F at 50 °C was 240 min, being 40-, 3.4- and 2.5-fold longer than those of reAoXyn11A, reAoXyn11AG21I and reAoXyn11AY13F. The melting temperature (T m) values of reAoXyn11A, reAoXyn11AG21I, reAoXyn11AY13F and reAoXyn11AG21I-Y13F were 52.3, 56.5, 58.6 and 61.3 °C, respectively. These findings indicated that the iterative mutagenesis of both Gly21Ile and Tyr13Phe improved the temperature characteristics of AoXyn11A in a synergistic mode. Besides those, the catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) of reAoXyn11AG21I-Y13F was 473.1 mL mg-1 s-1, which was 1.65-fold higher than that of reAoXyn11A.",

To enhance the production of the volatile natural hydrocarbon isoprene, released by plants, animals and bacteria, the Kudzu isoprene synthase (kIspS) gene has been heterologously expressed in Bacillus subtilis DSM 402 and Bacillus licheniformis DSM 13 using the pHT01 vector. As control, the heterologous expression of KIspS in E. coli BL21 (DE3) with the pET28b vector was used. Isoprene production was analyzed using Gas Chromatography Flame Ionization Detector. The highest isoprene production was observed by recombinant B. subtilis harboring the pHT01-kIspS plasmid which produced 1434.3 μg/L (1275 µg/L/OD) isoprene. This is threefold higher than the wild type which produced 388 μg/L (370 μg/L/OD) isoprene, when both incubated at 30 °C for 48 h and induced with 0.1 mM IPTG. Additionally, recombinant B. subtilis produced fivefold higher than the recombinant B. licheniformis, which produced 437.2 μg/L (249 μg/L/OD) isoprene when incubated at 37 °C for 48 h induced with 0.1 mM IPTG. This is the first report of optimized isoprene production in B. licheniformis. However, recombinant B. licheniformis showed less isoprene production. Therefore, recombinant B. subtilis is considered as a versatile host for heterologous production of isoprene.",

The hydrolytic pathway from ginsenoside Rb1 to compound K via Rd and F2 is the most important because Rb1 is the most abundant component in ginseng extract. However, the enzymatic conversion of ginsenoside Rd to F2 is a limiting step in the hydrolytic pathway because of the relatively low activity for Rd. A V209 residue obtained from error-prone PCR was related to Rd-hydrolyzing activity, and a docking pose showing an interaction with Val209 was selected from numerous docking poses. W361F was obtained by rational design using the docking pose that exhibited 4.2-fold higher activity, 3.7-fold higher catalytic efficiency, and 3.1-fold lower binding energy for Rd than the wild-type enzyme, indicating that W361F compensated for the limiting step. W361F completely converted Rb1 to compound K with a productivity of 843 mg l-1 h-1 in 80 min, and showed also 7.4-fold higher activity for the flavanone, hesperidin, than the wild-type enzyme. Therefore, the W361F variant SS-BGL can be useful for hydrolysis of other glycosides as well as compound K production from Rb1, and semi-rational design is a useful tool for enhancing hydrolytic activity of β-glycosidase.",

Basidiomycetes usually have more than one gene for laccase, but until now, this feature has not been demonstrated in a marine-derived fungus. Peniophora sp. CBMAI 1063 is a basidiomycete fungus isolated from a marine sponge that exhibits the ability to secrete significant amounts of laccase in saline conditions. In the present study, we identified laccase sequences from the transcriptome of Peniophora sp. CBMAI 1063 and used them to perform different molecular in silico analyses. The results revealed the presence of at least eight putative genes, which may encode ten different laccases with peptide lengths ranging from 482 to 588 aa and molecular weights ranging from 53.5 to 64.4 kDa. These laccases seem to perform extracellular activities, with the exception of one that may represent an intracellular laccase. The 10 predicted laccases expressed by Peniophora sp. CBMAI 1063 in laccase-induced media showed different patterns of N-glycosylation and isoelectric points and are divided into two classes based on the residue associated with the regulation of the redox potential of the enzyme. None of the predicted laccases showed more than 61% similarity to other fungal laccases. Based on the differences among the laccases expressed by Peniophora sp. CBMAI 1063, this marine-derived basidiomycete represents a valuable resource with strong potential for biotechnological exploitation.",

Based on experimental data, an empirical model was developed to directly describe the relationship between methane production, microorganism amount and wall-shear stress. The results showed that DO concentration decreased significantly along the biofilm depth under varied wall-shear stress, and the DO reduction rate was positively related to the intensity of wall-shear stress. The dominant archaea species in mature biofilms were similar whereas the proportions showed remarkable differences. The abundance of Methanospirillum in biofilms cultured at 2.0 Pa wall-shear stress was 53.08% more than that at 1.29 Pa.

These strains were tested in shake-flask cultures on media containing glycerol and seven different carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, galactose, mannose, xylose, arabinose, and rhamnose. An interesting and applicationally useful phenomenon was observed. This work presents a new approach to the conventional microbiological method of producing fumaric acid. In the presence of 40 g/l glycerol as the sole carbon source, fumaric acid production reached 0.16–6.1 g/l after 192 h. When monosaccharides were used as a single carbon source, the maximum fumaric acid concentration was much higher; for example, 19.8 g/l was achieved when 40 g/l xylose was used. In the co-fermentation of xylose (40 g/l) and glycerol (20 g/l), post-culture broth contained approx. 28.0 g/l of fumaric acid with a process yield of 0.90 g/g after 168 h. The production of fumaric acid by Rhizopus oryzae was also increased in the dual presence of glycerol and monosaccharides like fructose, galactose, and mannose. However, results obtained on glucose-glycerol-based medium did not follow this trend, showing instead complete utilization of glucose with significant glycerol consumption, but unexpectedly low final amounts of fumaric acid and process yields. Understanding how Rhizopus oryzae utilize various carbon sources may provide alternative avenues of fumaric acid fermentation.",

Thus, we sought to establish a novel rapid detecting method for target pathogen. A set of multiple cross displacement amplification (MCDA) primers was designed to recognize 10 different regions of the pgaD gene, which was conservative and specific for the bacterium. In the MCDA system, amplification primers D1 and R1 were 5'-labeled with FITC (fluorescein) and biotin, respectively. Numerous FITC- and biotin-attached duplex amplicons were formed during the amplification stage, which were detected by nanoparticles-based lateral flow biosensors (LFB) through immunoreactions (FITC on the duplex and anti-FITC on the LFB test line) and biotin/streptavidin interaction (biotin on the duplex and streptavidin on the nanoparticles). The results showed that the optimized reaction condition of MCDA-LFB method was 62 °C within 25 min. There was no cross reaction with non-A. baumannii species and the non-Acinetobacter genera, and the detection limit for DNA samples was 100 fg/reaction. For 135 sputum samples, the detection results showed that the detection ability of MCDA-LFB assay was superior to the culture methods and conventional PCR. Therefore, MCDA-LFB assay could be a potential tool for the rapid detection of A. baumannii in clinical samples and low resource areas.",

    "abstract": "This study was demonstrated with a coculture fermentation system using sugar beet pulp (SBP) as a carbon source combining the cellulose-degrading bacterium Clostridium cellulovorans with microbial flora of methane production (MFMP) for the direct conversion of cellulosic biomass to methane (CH4). The MFMP was taken from a commercial methane fermentation plant and extremely complicated. Therefore, the MFMP was analyzed by a next-generation sequencing system and the microbiome was identified and classified based on several computer programs. As a result, Methanosarcina mazei (1.34% of total counts) and the other methanogens were found in the MFMP. Interestingly, the simultaneous utilization of hydrogen (H2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) for methanogenesis was observed in the coculture with Consortium of C. cellulovorans with the MFMP (CCeM) including M. mazei. Furthermore, the CCeM degraded 87.3% of SBP without any pretreatment and produced 34.0 L of CH4 per 1 kg of dry weight of SBP. Thus, a gas metabolic shift in the fermentation pattern of C. cellulovorans was observed in the CCeM coculture. These results indicated that degradation of agricultural wastes was able to be carried out simultaneously with CH4 production by C. cellulovorans and the MFMP.",

P. aduncum seedlings were inoculated by spores of R. clarus and C. etunicatum and then, development parameters, root colonization, lipoxygenase (LOX) activity, and essential oil (OE) chemical composition were monitored at 30, 60 and 90 days' post-inoculation (dpi). The inoculation had influenced the plant height and root length at 30 and 90 dpi and microscopic analysis of roots showed the presence of hyphae, arbuscules and vesicles in the inoculated plants. Phenylpropanoids and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons were the main compounds in the EO. In the leaves, the concentration of phenylpropanoids showed a decrease, mainly at 60 dpi, with increased sesquiterpene hydrocarbon production. The main compounds were dillapiole, myristicin, and germacrene D; the dillapiole concentration decreased in all treatments. LOX activity had an increase in the leaves and roots at 90 dpi. These results suggest that alterations in the secondary metabolites of P. aduncum can be induced by its mechanisms of resistance during AMF interaction.",

    "abstract": "Non-hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (PAM) and partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) are commonly used polymers in various industrial applications, including in oil and gas production operations. Understanding the microbial utilization of such polymers can contribute to improved recovery processes and help to develop technologies for polymer remediation. Microbial communities enriched from oilfield produced water (PW) and activated sludge from Alberta, Canada were assessed for their ability to utilize PAM and HPAM as nitrogen and carbon sources at 50 °C. Microbial growth was determined by measuring CO2 production, and viscosity changes and amide concentrations were used to determine microbial utilization of the polymers. The highest CO2 production was observed in incubations wherein HPAM was added as a nitrogen source for sludge-derived enrichments. Our results showed that partial deamination of PAM and HPAM occurred in both PW and sludge microbial cultures after 34 days of incubation. Whereas viscosity changes were not observed in cultures when HPAM or PAM was provided as the only carbon source, sludge enrichment cultures amended with HPAM and glucose showed significant decreases in viscosity. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis indicated that microbial members from the family Xanthomonadaceae were enriched in both PW and sludge cultures amended with HPAM or PAM as a nitrogen source, suggesting the importance of this microbial taxon in the bio-utilization of these polymers. Overall, our results demonstrate that PAM and HPAM can serve as nitrogen sources for microbial communities under the thermophilic conditions commonly found in environments such as oil and gas reservoirs.",

Conventional vaccines against these pathogens generally employ formalin-inactivated culture supernatants. However, immunization with the culture supernatant and full length toxin subjects the animal to antigenic load and often have adverse effect due to incomplete inactivation of the toxins. In the present study, an epitope-based vaccine against Clostridium perfringens Etx, comprising 40-62 amino acid residues of the toxin in translational fusion with heat labile enterotoxin B subunit (LTB) of E. coli, was evaluated for its protective potential. The ability of the fusion protein rLTB.Etx40-62 to form pentamers and biologically active holotoxin with LTA of E. coli indicated that the LTB present in the fusion protein retained its biological activity. Antigenicity of both the components in the fusion protein was retained as anti-fusion protein antisera detected both the wild type Etx and LTB in Western blot analysis. Immunization of BALB/c mice with the fusion protein resulted in a significant increase in all isotypes, predominantly IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b. Anti-fusion protein antisera neutralized the cytotoxicity of epsilon toxin both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, the results demonstrate the potential of rLTB.Etx40-62 as a candidate vaccine against C. perfringens.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotics abuse has caused increased bacterial resistance, which severely limits the application of antibiotics to the treatment of bacterial infections. Therefore, it is urgent to develop new antibacterial drugs through other sources. Dracontomelon dao (Blanco) Merr. & Rolfe (Ren Mianzi in Chinese) is a traditional medicinal material derived from Anacardiaceae with a long history of treating various infectious diseases, such as decubitus and skin ulcers. Recent research has indicated that different extracts from the leaves of D. dao, especially the ethyl acetate (EtOAc) fraction containing flavonoids and phenolic acids, exhibit potent antibacterial activities. In this research, the combined anti-drug-resistant bacterial activities of these active ingredients were investigated. Six samples (S1-S6) were obtained from the EtOAc fraction of D. dao leaves. Microcalorimetric measurements and principal component analysis were performed on the in vitro samples. The results showed that all six samples had notable antibacterial activities. Specifically, sample S6 exhibited a prominent antibacterial effect, with an IC50 value of 84.3 μg mL-1, which was significantly lower than that of other samples. The relative contents of main flavonoids and phenolic acids in S6 sample were confirmed by UPLC/Q-TOF-MS. In conclusion, sample S6 from the EtOAc fraction of D. dao leaves could be used as a potential antimicrobial resource in the treatment of infectious diseases. This work provides an insight into the effect of traditional Chinese medicine on drug-resistant bacteria. Moreover, the purification and characterization of the chemical compounds from the sample S6 deserve further analysis.",

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a multisystem chronic epidemic that prolongs inflammation in wounds and is associated with impaired healing. This study aimed to investigate the effect of an ethanol extract from Lactobacillus plantarum TWK10 (TWK10)-fermented soymilk on wound healing. The anti-inflammatory effects of the ethanol extract of TWK10-fermented soymilk on lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage cells were examined. The ethanol extract of TWK10-fermented soymilk (100 µg/mL) significantly decreased nitric oxide production from 11.34 ± 0.74 μM to 8.24 ± 2.02 µM (p < 0.05) and enhanced proliferation in Detroit 551 cells cultured in high-glucose medium; the cell number peaked at 128.44 ± 7.67% (compared to the untreated control) at 600 µg/mL. An ethanol extract of TWK10-fermented soymilk + vaseline-treated rat model of streptozotocin-induced diabetic wounds was generated herein, and the following groups were formed herein: normal control (NC), blank control (BC), low dose group (LD, 0.24 mg/wound), intermediate dose (MD, 0.48 mg/wound), and high dose (HD, 2.40 mg/wound). On day 14 after wound infliction, the wound area in the LD, MD, and HD groups was significantly decreased to 10.2, 8.4, and 8.5% respectively (p < 0.05). Moreover, in the LD, MD, and, HD groups, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin 6, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 were downregulated in the wounded skin. These results show that the topical application of the ethanol extract of TWK10-fermented soymilk is beneficial for enhancing wound healing and for the closure of diabetic wounds.",

    "abstract": "Survival of inoculated fungal strains in a new environment plays a critical role in functional performance, but few studies have focused on strain-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) methods for monitoring beneficial fungi. In this study, the Trichoderma guizhouense strain NJAU 4742 (transformed with the gfp gene and named gfp-NJAU 4742), which exhibits a growth-promoting effect by means of phytohormone production and pathogen antagonism, was selected as a model to design strain-specific primer pairs using two steps of genomic sequence comparison to detect its abundance in soil. After a second comparison with the closely related species T. harzianum CBS 226-95 to further differentiate the strain-specific fragments that had shown no homology to any sequence deposited in the databases used in the first comparison, ten primer pairs were designed from the whole genome. Meanwhile, 3 primer pairs, P11, P12 and P13, were also designed from the inserted fragment containing the gfp gene. After verification testing with three types of field soils, primer pairs P6, P7 and P8 were further selected by comparison with P11, P12 and P13. A practical test using a pot experiment showed that stable colonization of gfp-NJAU 4742 in pepper rhizosphere soil could be detected using primer pairs P6 and P7, showing no significant difference from the results of primers P11 and P12. Hence, the strategy described here for designing fungal-strain-specific primers may theoretically be used for any other fungi for which the whole genome sequence is available in a database, and the qPCR methodology developed can also be used to further monitor the population dynamics of different strains based on the designed primers.",

    "abstract": "Paraffinic n-alkanes (C22-C30), crucial portions of residual oil, are generally considered to be difficult to be biodegraded owing to their general solidity at ambient temperatures and low water solubility, rendering relatively little known about metabolic processes in different methanogenic hydrocarbon-contaminated environments. Here, we established a methanogenic C22-C30 n-alkane-degrading enrichment culture derived from a high-temperature oil reservoir production water. During two-year incubation (736 days), unexpectedly significant methane production was observed. The measured maximum methane yield rate (164.40 μmol L-1 d-1) occurred during the incubation period from day 351 to 513. The nearly complete consumption (> 97%) of paraffinic n-alkanes and the detection of dicarboxylic acids in n-alkane-amended cultures indicated the biotransformation of paraffin to methane under anoxic condition. 16S rRNA gene analysis suggested that the dominant methanogen in n-alkane-degrading cultures shifted from Methanothermobacter on day 322 to Thermoplasmatales on day 736. Bacterial community analysis based on high-throughput sequencing revealed that members of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes exhibiting predominant in control cultures, while microorganisms affiliated with Actinobacteria turned into the most dominant phylum in n-alkane-dependent cultures. Additionally, the relative abundance of mcrA gene based on genomic DNA significantly increased over the incubation time, suggesting an important role of methanogens in these consortia. This work extends our understanding of methanogenic paraffinic n-alkanes conversion and has biotechnological implications for microbial enhanced recovery of residual hydrocarbons and effective bioremediation of hydrocarbon-containing biospheres.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains are distinct from general Staphylococcus strains with respect to the composition of the membrane, ability to form a thicker biofilm, and, importantly, ability to modify the target of antibiotics to evade their activity. The agr gene is an accessory global regulator of gram-positive bacteria that governs virulence or resistant mechanisms and therefore an important target for the control of resistant strains. However, the mechanism by which agr impacts resistance to β-lactam antibiotics remains unclear. In the present study, we found the Δ agr mutant strain having higher resistance to high concentrations of β-lactam antibiotics such as oxacillin and ampicillin. To determine the influence of variation in the microenvironment of cells between the parental and mutant strains, fatty acid analysis of the supernatant, total lipids, and phospholipid fatty acids were compared. The Δ agr mutant strain tended to produce fewer fatty acids and retained lower amounts of C16, C18 fatty acids in the supernatant. Phospholipid analysis showed a dramatic increase in the hydrophobic longer-chain fatty acids in the membrane. To target membrane, we applied several surfactants and found that sorbitan monolaurate (Span20) had a synergistic effect with oxacillin by decreasing biofilm formation and growth. These findings indicate that agr deletion allows for MRSA to resist antibiotics via several changes including constant expression of mecA , fatty acid metabolism, and biofilm thickening.",

However, the expression profile and role of miR-1179 is yet to be explored in human oral cancer. Consistently, this study was undertaken to explore the molecular role of miR-1179 in regulation of the human oral cancer development and progression. The results showed miR-1179 to be significantly ( p &lt; 0.05) overexpressed in all the oral cancer cell lines relative to normal cells. The repression of miR-1179 transcript levels not only suppressed the proliferation of oral cancer cells but also increased their sensitivity to vincristine. The decline in proliferative rates was attributed to induction of autophagy in oral cancer cells as confirmed by transmission electron microscopic analysis. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of LC3B-II increased and that of beclin 1 decreased while LC3B-I expression remained constant upon miR-1179 inhibition. Inhibition of miR-1179 caused significant decrease in the migration and invasion of the oral cancer cells. The migration and invasion found to be 47% and 32% for SCC-9 and 24% and 28% for SCC-25 cells upon miR-1179 inhibition. At molecular level, the miR-1179 was shown to exert its anticancer effects via deactivation of MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signalling cascades.

Plant defensins are small cationic, cysteine-rich peptides with a stabilized tertiary structure by disulfide-bridges and characterized by a wide range of biological functions. The heterologous expression of Egyptian maize defensin (MzDef) in Escherichia coli and subsequent purification by glutathione affinity chromatography yielded 2 mg/L of recombinant defensin peptide. The glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-tagged MzDef of approximately 30 kDa in size (26 KDa GST + ~ 4 KDa MzDef peptide) was immunodetected with anti-GST antibodies. The GST-tag was successfully cleaved from the MzDef peptide by thrombin, and the removal was validated by the Tris-Tricine gel electrophoresis. The MzDef induced strong growth inhibition of Rhizoctonia solani , Fusarium verticillioides , and Aspergillus niger by 94.23%, 93.34%, and 86.25%, respectively, whereas relatively weak growth inhibitory activity of 35.42% against Fusarium solani was recorded. Moreover, strong antibacterial activities were demonstrated against E . coli and Bacillus cereus and the moderate activities against Salmonella enterica and Staphylococcus aureus at all tested concentrations (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, and 3.2 µM) . Furthermore, the in vitro MTT assay exhibited promising anticancer activity against all tested cell lines (hepatocellular carcinoma, mammary gland breast cancer, and colorectal carcinoma colon cancer) with IC 50 values ranging from 14.85 to 29.85 µg/mL.

We quantitatively determined the antimicrobial potency of different PE surfaces, which had been conversed to diamond-like carbon (DLC-PE) and doped with silver ions (Ag-DLC-PE). Bacterial adhesion and planktonic growth of various strains of S. epidermidis on Ag-DLC-PE were compared to untreated PE by quantification of colony forming units on the adherent surface and in the growth medium as well as semiquantitatively by determining the grade of biofilm formation by scanning electron microscopy. (1) A significant (p < 0.05) antimicrobial effect could be found for Ag-DLC-PE. (2) The antimicrobial effect was positively correlated with the applied fluences of Ag (fivefold reduced bacterial surface growth and fourfold reduced bacterial concentration in the surrounding medium with fluences of 1 × 1017 vs. 1 × 1016 cm−2 under implantation energy of 10 keV). (3) A low depth of Ag penetration using low ion energies (10 or 20 vs. 100 keV) led to evident antimicrobial effects (fourfold reduced bacterial surface growth and twofold reduced bacterial concentration in the surrounding medium with 10 or 20 keV and 1 × 1017 cm−2 vs. no reduction of growth with 100 keV and 1 × 1017 cm−2).

    "abstract": "The production of aroma compounds by the microbial fermentation of whey was studied. Seven strains of the yeast Wickerhamomyces pijperi were used for the fermentation of glucose-added whey (whey-g). Twelve aroma compounds (isobutanol, isoamyl alcohol, 2-phenylethanol, acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, isoamyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, ethyl propionate, ethyl hexanoate and ethyl benzoate) were identified in the fermented broth using headspace gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. The major components were ethyl acetate (several tens to hundreds ppm), acetaldehyde (several tens ppm) and isoamyl alcohol (about 10 ppm). The strong fruity odor of ethyl benzoate (about 1 ppm) was detected in the broth of W. pijperi YIT 8095 and YIT 12779. The balance of aroma compounds produced was varied depending on the media used, and ethyl benzoate was only produced when using whey-g. The variation in the production of the aroma compounds over time using W. pijperi YIT 12779 at various culture temperatures (from 15-30°C) was also studied. From the results we propose that W. pijperi could be used as a novel microorganism for production of aroma compounds from whey.",

Cellulases have been widely used in many industrial applications ranging from food industry to the production of second generation ethanol. In an effort to develop new strategies to minimize the costs of enzyme production we describe the development of a Pichia pastoris strain able to coproduce two different cellulases. For that purpose the eglII (endoglucanase II) and cbhII (cellobiohydrolase II) genes from Trichoderma reesei were fused in-frame separated by the self-processing 2A peptide sequence from the foot-and-mouth disease virus. The protein fusion construct was placed under the control of the strong inducible AOX1 promoter. Analysis of culture supernatants from methanol-induced yeast transformants showed that the protein fusion was effectively processed. Enzymatic assay showed that the processed enzymes were fully functional with the same catalytic properties of the individual enzymes produced separately. Furthermore, when combined both enzymes acted synergistically on filter paper to produce cellobiose as the main end-product. Based on these results we propose that P. pastoris should be considered as an alternative platform for the production of cellulases at competitive costs.",

The Chinese medicine, the Baofukang suppository is widely used in the clinic for its antimicrobial activity and is therefore of great interest as a potential antifungal drug for the prevention of VVC. We evaluated the cytotoxic activity of the Baofukang suppository using the VK2/E6E7 vaginal epithelial cell (VEC) line. When treated with the Baofukang suppository, all of the immunocompetent cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-17) by infected VK2/E6E7 cells was statistically up-regulated (P < 0.05), except IL-4 (11.70 ± 1.82 vs. 14.88 ± 4.72, P = 0.343) compared to the infected control cells. The secretion of non-B IgG also exhibited the same trend. Our scanning electron microscopy results revealed that C. albicans can invade VECs by both induced endocytosis and active penetration. The Baofukang suppository could effectively inhibit the adhesion, hyphal formation, and proliferation, as well as notably restore the vaginal epithelial cell morphology, viability, and enhance the local immune function of the VECs. These preliminary results suggest promising antimicrobial properties of the Baofukang suppository, which may be efficacious as an antifungal therapy candidate via up-regulating Th1 cellular immunity, the Th17-axis of the innate immune response, and the secretion of vaginal epithelial-derived IgG. These combined effects collectively restore the immune function of the infected VECs against C. albicans in vitro.",

Pathogenicity is enhanced by the ability of S. epidermidis to associate into biofilms, where it avoids attacks by the host and antibiotics. To test the effect of oxygen on metabolism and biofilm generation, cells were cultured at different oxygen concentrations ([O2]). As [O2] decreased, S. epidermidis metabolism went from respiratory to fermentative. Remarkably, the rate of growth decreased at low [O2] while a high concentration of ATP ([ATP]) was kept. Under hypoxic conditions bacteria associated into biofilms. Aerobic activity sensitized the cell to hydrogen peroxide-mediated damage. In the presence of metabolic inhibitors, biofilm formation decreased. It is suggested that at low [O2] S. epidermidis limits its growth and develops the ability to form biofilms.",

Anserine is a functional dipeptide containing methylhistidine and β-alanine, and is present in the brain and skeletal muscle of birds and mammals. Glucosamine is an amino sugar used in the synthesis of glycosylated proteins and lipids. We evaluated the effects of anserine and glucosamine on RA. Rats were assigned into the control group, RA group, anserine group (1 mg/kg), glucosamine group (200 mg/kg), or anserine plus glucosamine group (anserine, 1 mg/kg + glucosamine, 200 mg/kg). Treatment was continued for 45 consecutive days and was administered orally. The serum levels of catalase, glutathione peroxidase (Gpx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH), lipid peroxidation, uric acid, nitric oxide, ceruloplasmin, zinc, copper, prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 were assayed. The mRNA and protein levels of nuclear factor (NF)-κB and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in synovial tissue were also determined. Anserine plus glucosamine significantly increased the catalase, SOD, Gpx, GSH, and zinc levels compared to the control, anserine, and glucosamine groups. Also, anserine plus glucosamine significantly reduced the PGE 2 , MMP-3, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels compared to the control, anserine, and glucosamine groups. Furthermore, anserine plus glucosamine significantly reduced the mRNA and protein levels of NF-κB and iNOS compared to the control, anserine, and glucosamine groups. Therefore, supplementation of anserine plus glucosamine shows therapeutic potential for RA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The effect of Aso volcanic limonite was explored in anaerobic digestion using waste sewage sludge (WSS). In this study, methane and hydrogen sulfide were remarkably inhibited when Aso limonite was mixed with WSS as well as a significant reduction of ammonia. Although pH was lowered after adding Aso limonite, methane was still inhibited in neutralized pH condition at 7.0. Hydrolysis stage was not influenced by Aso limonite as supported by the result that a high protease activity was still detected in the presence of the material. However, acidogenesis stage was affected by Aso limonite as indicated by the different productions of organic acids. Acetic acid, was accumulated in the presence of Aso limonite due to the inhibition of methane production, except in the highest concentration of Aso limonite which the production of acetate may be inhibited. Besides, the production of propionate and butyrate reduced in accordance to the increased concentration of Aso limonite. In addition, Archaeal activity (methanogens) in WSS with Aso limonite was low in agreement with the low methane production. Thus, these results indicate that Aso limonite influences the acidogenesis and methanogenesis processes, by which the productions of methane and ammonia were inhibited. On the other hand, in the contactless of Aso limonite during the anaerobic digestion of WSS (Aso limonite was placed in the area of headspace in the vial), Aso limonite had the adsorptive ability for hydrogen sulfide from WSS, but not for methane. This contactless system of Aso limonite may be a practical means to remove hydrogen sulfide without inhibiting methane production as an important bioenergy source.",

Currently, the study of sites contaminated by the spillage of equipment PCBs containing have been considered targeted areas for the study of bacterial communities with potential for PCBs degradation. There in isolation of bacterial strains is vital for use in biodegradable processes, such as bacterial bioaugmentation, which accelerates the development of phenomena such as natural attenuation of contaminated sites. The objective of this study was to assess biodiversity of bacteria contained in anthropogenic contaminated soils (H S and H P ) with PCBs compared to a control sample without contaminant and the modified forest (F) and agricultural (A) soil in the laboratory with 100 mg L −1 PCB. For the analysis of 16S rRNA genes amplified from DNA extracted from the soils evaluated, the latest generation of Illumina Miseq and Sanger sequencing for the cultivable strains were detected. The bacteria identified as the most abundant bacterial phyla for H S and H P soil was Proteobacteria (56.7%) and Firmicutes (22.9%), which decreased in F and A soils. The most abundant bacterial genera were Burkholderia, Bacillus, Acinetobacter, Comamonas and Cupriavidus. Several species identified in this study, such as Bacillus cereus , Burkholderia cepacia , Comamonas testosteroni and Acinetobacter pittii have been reported as PCBs degraders. Finally, by means of a principal component analysis (PCA), a correlation between the physical and chemical characteristics of the soils in relation to the relative abundances of the bacteria identified was obtained. The C/N ratio was directly related to the control soil (without contaminant), while SOM maintained a relationship with F and A soils and the bacterial abundances were directly related to Hs and Hp soils due to the presence of aroclor 1260. Bacteria with the ability to tolerate high concentrations of this pollutant are considered for future use in biostimulation and bioaugmentation processes in contaminated soils.",

SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the molecular weight of BG FH1 and BG FH2 was 93 kDa and 52 kDa, respectively, and the enzyme activity was 5.6 U/mg and 11.5 U/mg, respectively. The optimal reaction temperature of the enzymes was 60 ℃, and the enzymes were stable with a temperature lower than 70 ℃.

Thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that BG FH1and BG FH2 had hydrolysis activity toward cellobiose and could hydrolyze cellobiose into glucose. In addition, both enzymes exhibited transglycoside activity, which could use glucose to synthesize cellobiose and cellotriose, and preferentially synthesize alcohol.

We observed that glycolate can be accumulated extracellularly when two genes encoding the glycolate dehydrogenase of cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 were inactivated. This inspired us to explore the oxygenase function of Rubisco for production of glycolate, an important industrial chemical, from CO 2 by engineered cyanobacteria. Since the oxygenase activity of Rubisco is generally low in CO 2 -rich carboxysome of cyanobacteria, we introduced Form II Rubisco, which cannot be assembled in carboxysome, into the cytoplasm of cyanobacteria. Heterologous expression of a Form II Rubisco from endosymbiont of tubeworm Riftia pachyptila (RPE Rubisco) significantly increased glycolate production. We show that the RPE Rubisco is expressed in the cytoplasm. Glycolate production increased upon addition of NaHCO 3 but decreased upon supplying CO 2 . The titer of glycolate reached 2.8 g/L in 18 days, a 14-fold increase compared with the initial strain with glycolate dehydrogenase inactivated. This is also the highest glycolate titer biotechnologically produced from CO 2 ever reported.

This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of producing ethanol by Lactiplantibacillus casei used the ethanologen engineering strain L. casei E1 as a starter culture and cane molasses as substrate medium. The effects of environmental factors on the metabolism of L. casei E1 were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system, and the gene expression of key enzymes in carbon source metabolism was detected using quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). Results showed that the strain could grow well, ferment sugar quickly in cane molasses. By fermenting this bacterium anaerobically at 37 °C for 36 h incubation in 5 °BX molasses when the fermenter's pH was controlled at 6.0, ethanol yield reached 13.77 g/L, and carbohydrate utilization percentage was 78.60%.

In addition, the metabolism of sugars, especially fructose, would be inhibited by elevating acidity. Our findings support the theoretical basis for exploring Lactic acid bacteria as a starter culture for converting sugarcane molasses into ethanol.",

However, the knowledge on the bacterial communities of the different components of the system is limited. In this study, we investigated the bacterial community structure in paddy soil and ditch sediment by using high-throughput sequencing technology. The results showed that compared with the ditch sediment, the content of NH 4 + -N in paddy soil decreased by 62.31%, and the content of AP (available phosphorus) increased by 172.02% ( P &lt; 0.05). The most abundant phyla in paddy soil and ditch sediment were Proteobacteria , Bacteroidetes and Chloroflexi , whose relative abundance was above 65%. Among the dominant genera, the relative abundance of an uncultured bacterium genus of Saprospiraceae and an uncultured bacterium genus of Lentimicrobiaceae in paddy soil was significantly lower than ditch sediment ( P &lt; 0.05). Alpha diversity indicated that the bacterial diversity of paddy soil and ditch sediment was similar. The bacterial community structure was affected by the relative abundance of bacteria, not the species of bacteria. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that the bacterial communities in paddy soil and ditch sediment were correlated with physicochemical properties. Our findings showed that the bacterial community structure was distinct in paddy soil and ditch sediment under rice-crab co-culture probably due to their different management patterns. These results can provide theoretical support for improving rice-crab co-culture technology.",

Veins, petioles of inoculated leaves and rootstock stems were stained with callose specific dye. Results from fluorescence microscope observation, pharmacological test, and PCR detection of SMV coat protein gene (SMV- CP ) showed the role of callose in long-distance transportation of SMV through phloem during infection of soybean seedlings. When the inhibitor of callose synthesis 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DDG) was used, the accumulation of callose fluorescence could hardly be detected in the resistant rootstocks. These results indicate that callose deposition in phloem restricts the long-distance transport of SMV, and that the accumulation of callose in phloem is a main contributing factor for resistance to this virus in soybean.",

This study aims to improve the thermostability of dextranase AoDex in glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 49 that derived from Arthrobacter oxydans KQ11. Some mutants were predicted and constructed based on B-factor analysis, PoPMuSiC and HotMuSiC algorithms, and four mutants exhibited higher heat resistance. Compared with the wild-type, mutant S357P showed the best improved thermostability with a 5.4-fold increase of half-life at 60 °C, and a 2.1-fold increase of half-life at 65 °C. Furthermore, S357V displayed the most obvious increase in enzymatic activity and thermostability simultaneously. Structural modeling analysis indicated that the improved thermostability of mutants might be attributed to the introduction of proline and hydrophobic effects, which generated the rigid optimization of the structural conformation. These results illustrated that it was effective to improve the thermostability of dextranase AoDex by rational design and site-directed mutagenesis. The thermostable mutant of dextranase AoDex has potential application value, and it can also provide references for engineering other thermostable dextranases of the GH49 family.",

Based on transglycosylation, starch branching enzymes (1,4-α-glucan branching enzymes, GBEs, EC 2.4.1.18) can be used to regulate the digestibility of starch. In this study, a GBE gene from Bacillus licheniformis (bl-GBE) was cloned, expressed, purified, and characterized. Sequence analysis and structural modeling showed that bl-GBE belong to the glycoside hydrolase 13 (GH13) family, with which its active site residues were conserved. The bl-GBE was highly active at 80 °C and a pH range of 7.5–9.0, and retained 90% of enzyme activity at 70 °C for 16 h. bl-GBE also showed high substrate specificity (80.88 U/mg) on potato starch. The stability and the changes of the secondary structure of bl-GBE at different temperature were determined by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The CD data showed a loss of 20% of the enzyme activity at high temperatures (80 °C), due to the decreased content of the α -helix in the secondary structure. Furthermore, potato starch treated with bl-GBE (300 U/g starch) showed remarkable increase in stability, solubility, and significant reduction viscosity. Meanwhile, the slowly digestible starch content of bl-GBE modified potato starch increased by 53.03% compared with native potato starch. Our results demonstrated the potential applications of thermophilic bl-GBE in food industries.",

    "abstract": "Commercial carotenoid production is dominated by chemical synthesis and plant extraction, both of which are unsustainable and can be detrimental to the environment. A promising alternative for the mass production of carotenoids from both an ecological and commercial perspective is microbial synthesis. To date, C30 carotenoid production in Bacillus subtilis has been achieved using plasmid systems for the overexpression of biosynthetic enzymes. In the present study, we employed a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-Cas9 (CRISPR-Cas9) system to develop an efficient, safe, and stable C30 carotenoid-producing B. subtilis strain, devoid of plasmids and antibiotic selection markers. To this end, the expression levels of crtM (dehydrosqualene synthase) and crtN (dehydrosqualene desaturase) genes from Staphylococcus aureus were upregulated by the insertion of three gene copies into the chromosome of B. subtilis. Subsequently, the supply of the C30 carotenoid precursor farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), which is the substrate for CrtMN enzymes, was enhanced by expressing chromosomally integrated Bacillus megaterium-derived farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS), a key enzyme in the FPP pathway, and abolishing the expression of farnesyl diphosphate phosphatase (YisP), an enzyme responsible for the undesired conversion of FPP to farnesol. The consecutive combination of these features resulted in a stepwise increased production of C30 carotenoids. For the first time, a B. subtilis strain that can endogenously produce C30 carotenoids has been constructed, which we anticipate will serve as a chassis for further metabolic engineering and fermentation optimization aimed at developing a commercial scale bioproduction process.",

    "abstract": "Parageobacillus thermoglucosidasius is a thermophilic Gram-positive bacterium, which is a promising host organism for sustainable bio-based production processes. However, to take full advantage of the potential of P. thermoglucosidasius, more efficient tools for genetic engineering are required. The present study describes an improved shuttle vector, which speeds up recombination-based genomic modification by incorporating a thermostable sfGFP variant into the vector backbone. This additional selection marker allows for easier identification of recombinants, thereby removing the need for several culturing steps. The novel GFP-based shuttle is therefore capable of facilitating faster metabolic engineering of P. thermoglucosidasius through genomic deletion, integration, or exchange. To demonstrate the efficiency of the new system, the GFP-based vector was utilised for deletion of the spo0A gene in P. thermoglucosidasius DSM2542. This gene is known to be a key regulator of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis, and it was therefore hypothesised that the deletion of spo0A in P. thermoglucosiadius would produce an analogous sporulation-inhibited phenotype. Subsequent analyses of cell morphology and culture heat resistance suggests that the P. thermoglucosidasius ∆spo0A strain is sporulation-deficient. This strain may be an excellent starting point for future cell factory engineering of P. thermoglucosidasius, as the formation of endospores is normally not a desired trait in large-scale production.",

For the present analysis, pit mud samples from different spatial locations within fermentation cellars were collected, and the yeast communities therein were assessed via culture-based and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) approaches. These analyses revealed significant differences in the composition of yeast communities present in different layers of pit mud. In total, 29 different yeast species were detected, and principal component analyses revealed clear differences in microbial diversity in pit mud samples taken from different cellar locations. Culture-dependent strategies similarly detected 20 different yeast species in these samples.

In contrast, culture-based approaches led to the identification of Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Debaryomyces hansenii in these pit mud samples, whereas they were not detected using DGGE fingerprints profiles. An additional HS-SPME-GC-MS-based analysis of the volatile compounds present in fermented grains samples led to the identification of 66 such compounds, with the highest levels of volatile acids, esters, and alcohols being detected in fermented grains from lower layer samples. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) suggested they were significant correlations between pit mud yeast communities and associated volatile compounds in fermented grains.",

The yeast strain kiy1 was newly isolated from unpasteurized honey for arabitol production. Based on internal transcribed spacer sequence analysis, the isolated strain was identified as Zygosaccharomyces siamensis. In this study, the effects of different substrates and sugar concentrations on arabitol production were investigated. When three types of carbon sources (glycerol, fructose, and glucose) were used, glucose was the most suitable substrate for arabitol production (68.7 g/L). Maximum arabitol production (101.4 g/L) was observed at a glucose concentration of 30%, and the highest arabitol production yield was 0.34 g/g of initial glucose. In the time-course production of sugar alcohols by strain kiy1, glucose was completely consumed for 8 days. The concentration of arabitol exceeded that of glycerol after 3 days, and the final arabitol concentration reached 83.6 g/L after 10 days. The maximum production rate was 16.7 g/L/day. The yeast produced glycerol as an intracellular sugar alcohol in the early stage of culture and switched its metabolism to arabitol production after the middle stage. Z. siamensis kiy1 possessed an NADP+-dependent arabitol dehydrogenase, which indicated that it probably produces arabitol via ribulose from glucose. These results suggest that the novel yeast strain, Z. siamensis kiy1, is promising for arabitol production. The proposed arabitol production approach can contribute toward its production at the industrial scale.",

Flow cytometry results showed that CD8 + titers in the group that only received NDV-VLP was higher than other group. However, serum ELISA results did not show a significantly (p ≥ 0.05) higher NDV antibody titer in NDV-VLPs immunized mice compared to the boosted group. Besides, HI results of SPF chickens vaccinated with NDV-VLPs and boosted with B1 live vaccine were significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher than those that only received NDV-VLPs. Interestingly, after challenging with NDV sub-genotype VII, all the chickens that were solely vaccinated with NDV-VLPs remained alive (six out of six), whereas two out of six chickens that were vaccinated with NDV-VLPs and also received the B1 live vaccine boost died. In conclusion, our results strongly indicated that the T-cell immune response in an NDV host is more important than the B-cell response. Also, the results of the present study revealed that to completely protect chickens against velogenic NDV strains, a vaccine comprising specific epitopes of velogenic strain is needed.",

Several antimicrobial agents cannot penetrate biofilm layers and cannot eradicate microbial infection. Therefore, the aim of this study is the biological synthesis of silver and copper nanoparticles to assess their activities on bacterial attachment and on the viability of dormant cells within the biofilm matrix. Ag-NPs and Cu-NPs were biosynthesized using Streptomyces isolate S29. The biologically synthesized Ag-NPs and Cu-NPs exhibited brown and blue colors and were detected by UV/Vis spectrophotometry at 476 and 594 nm, respectively. The Ag-NPs showed an average size of 10–20 nm as indicated by TEM, and 25–35 nm for Cu-NPs. Both Ag-NPs and Cu-NPs were monodispersed with a polydispersity index of 0.1–0.546 and zeta potential were − 29.7, and − 33.7 mv, respectively. The biologically synthesized Ag-NPs and Cu-NPs significantly eliminated bacterial attachment and decreased the viable cells in the biofilm matrix as detected by using crystal violet and tri-phenyl tetrazolium chloride assays. Furthermore, Ag-NPs and Cu-NPs significantly eradicated mature biofilms developed by various Gram-negative pathogens, including A. baumannii , K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa standard strains and clinical isolates. Data were also confirmed at the molecular level with prominent elimination of biofilm gene expression carO, bssS and pelA in A. baumannii , K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, respectively compared to untreated cells under the same conditions. As indicated, Ag-NPs and Cu-NPs could be used as adjuvant therapy in eradication of antibiotic resistance and biofilm matrix associated with Gram-negative bacterial infection. Graphical Abstract",

Cap is the most antigenic structural protein and an ideal candidate for the development of vaccines and diagnostic reagents. This study generated a monoclonal antibody (MAb) specific to PCV3 Cap, MAb CCC160, for diagnosis and pathogenesis studies of this novel virus. The MAb specifically recognized PCV3-infected swine lymph node tissue in an immunohistochemical analysis confirming its clinical diagnostic potential. In addition, a novel linear B-cell epitope recognized by MAb CCC160 was identified at the amino acid region 120-134 of Cap. Nuclear localization analysis of PCV3 Cap revealed a potential nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the middle region (aa 131-143) in addition to the dominant N-terminal NLS that is already known. A cell viability assay further demonstrated that the cytotoxicity of PCV3 Cap is correlated with its nuclear localization, indicating a crucial role of Cap in the pathogenic mechanism of PCV3. A full-length construct of PCV3 Cap was successfully expressed using a baculovirus expression system and purified recombinant proteins self-assembled into virus-like particles (VLPs). The protein constitution of the VLPs was confirmed by MAb CCC160 recognition, indicating the correct conformation and specificity of VLP and exhibiting the linear epitope aa 120-134 on the VLP surface. These results provide insights for developing diagnostic tools and potential VLP vaccines for PCV3, revealing its pathogenesis and antigenic properties.",

However, depending on the pulping process conditions, the release of monosaccharides also generates a range of compounds that negatively affect microbial fermentation. In the present study, we investigated whether endogenous yeasts in SSL-based ethanol plant could represent a source of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains with a naturally acquired tolerance towards this inhibitory environment. Two isolation processes were performed, before and after the re-inoculation of the plant with a commercial baker’s yeast strain. The isolates were clustered by DNA fingerprinting and a recurrent Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, different from the inoculated commercial baker’s yeast strain, was isolated. The strain, named TMB3720, flocculated heavily and presented high furaldehyde reductase activity. During fermentation of undiluted SSL, TMB3720 displayed a 4-fold higher ethanol production rate and 1.8-fold higher ethanol yield as compared to the commercial baker’s yeast. Another non- Saccharomyces cerevisiae species, identified as the pentose utilizing Pichia galeiformis , was also recovered in the last tanks of the process where the hexose to pentose sugar ratio and the inhibitory pressure are expected to be the lowest.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Benthic species of algae and cyanobacteria (i.e., those that grow on surfaces), may provide potential advantages over planktonic species for some commercial-scale biotechnological applications. A multitude of different designs of photobioreactor (PBR) are available for growing planktonic species but to date there has been little research on PBR for benthic algae or cyanobacteria. One notable advantage of some benthic cyanobacterial species is that during their growth cycle they become positively buoyant, detach from the growth surface and form floating mats. This 'self-harvesting' capability could be advantageous in commercial PBRs as it would greatly reduce dewatering costs. In this study we compared the growth rates and efficiency of 'self-harvesting' among three species of benthic cyanobacteria; Phormidium autumnale ; Phormidium murrayi and Planktothrix sp .. Phormidium autumnale produced the greatest biomass and formed cohesive mats once detached. Using this strain and an optimised MLA media, a variety of geometries of benthic PBRs (bPBRs) were trialed. The geometry and composition of growth surface had a marked effect on cyanobacterial growth. The highest biomass was achieved in a bPBR comprising of a vertical polyethylene bag with loops of silicone tubing to provide additional growth surfaces. The productivity achieved in this bPBR was a similar order of magnitude as planktonic species, with the additional advantage that towards the end of the exponential phase the bulk of the biomass detached forming a dense mat at the surface of the medium.",

    "abstract": "Diketopiperazines (DKPs) are cyclic dipeptides, representing an abundant class of biologically active natural compounds. Despite their widespread occurrence in nature, little is known about their degradation. In this study, the enzymatical and microbial cleavage of DKPs was investigated. Peptidase catalyzed hydrolysis of certain DKPs was formerly reported, but could not be confirmed in this study. While testing additional peptidases and DKPs no degradation was detected, indicating peptidase stability of the peptide bond in cyclic dipeptides. Besides confirmation of the reported degradation of cyclo(l-Asp-l-Phe) by Paenibacillus chibensis (DSM 329) and Streptomyces flavovirens (DSM 40062), cleavage of cyclo(l-Asp-l-Asp) by DSM 329 was detected. Other DKPs were not hydrolyzed by both strains, demonstrating high substrate specificity. The degradation of cyclo(l-Asp-l-Phe) by DSM 40062 was shown to be inducible. Three strains, which are able to hydrolyze hydantoins and dihydropyrimidines, were identified for the degradation of DKPs: Leifsonia sp. K3 (DSM 27212) and Bacillus sp. A16 (DSM 25052) cleaved cyclo(dl-Ala-dl-Ala) and cyclo(l-Gly-l-Phe), and Rhizobium sp. NA04-01 (DSM 24917) degraded cyclo(l-Asp-l-Phe), cyclo(l-Gly-l-Phe) and cyclo(l-Asp-l-Asp). The first enantioselective cleavage of cyclo(dl-Ala-dl-Ala) was detected with the newly isolated strains Paenibacillus sp. 32A (DSM 27214) and Microbacterium sp. 40A (DSM 27211). Cyclo(l-Ala-d-Ala) and cyclo(l-Ala-l-Ala) were completely degraded, whereas the enantiomer cyclo(d-Ala-d-Ala) was not attacked. Altogether, five bacterial strains were newly identified for the cleavage of DKPs. These bacteria may be of value for industrial purposes, such as degradation of undesirable DKPs in food and drugs and production of (enantiopure) dipeptides and amino acids.",

The concentration of the attached bacteria was quantified by determining the viable colony forming unit (CFU/cm(2)) numbers.

However, better xylose fermenting strains are required to reach complete xylose uptake in simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF) of lignocellulosic hydrolyzates. In the current study, haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains expressing a heterologous xylose pathway including either the native xylose reductase (XR) from P. stipiti s, a mutated variant of XR (mXR) with altered co-factor preference, a glucose/xylose facilitator (Gxf1) from Candida intermedia or both mXR and Gxf1 were assessed in SSCF of acid-pretreated non-detoxified wheat straw. The xylose conversion in SSCF was doubled with the S. cerevisiae strain expressing mXR compared to the isogenic strain expressing the native XR, converting 76% and 38%, respectively. The xylitol yield was less than half using mXR in comparison with the native variant. As a result of this, the ethanol yield increased from 0.33 to 0.39 g g -1 when the native XR was replaced by mXR. In contrast, the expression of Gxf1 only slightly increased the xylose uptake, and did not increase the ethanol production. The results suggest that ethanolic xylose fermentation under SSCF conditions is controlled primarily by the XR activity and to a much lesser extent by xylose transport.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria have the potential to produce bulk and fine chemicals and members belonging to Nostoc sp. have received particular attention due to their relatively fast growth rate and the relative ease with which they can be harvested. Nostoc punctiforme is an aerobic, motile, Gram-negative, filamentous cyanobacterium that has been studied intensively to enhance our understanding of microbial carbon and nitrogen fixation. The genome of the type strain N. punctiforme ATCC 29133 was sequenced in 2001 and the scientific community has used these genome data extensively since then. Advances in bioinformatics tools for sequence annotation and the importance of this organism prompted us to resequence and reanalyze its genome and to make both, the initial and improved annotation, available to the scientific community. The new draft genome has a total size of 9.1 Mbp and consists of 65 contiguous pieces of DNA with a GC content of 41.38% and 7664 protein-coding genes. Furthermore, the resequenced genome is slightly (5152 bp) larger and contains 987 more genes with functional prediction when compared to the previously published version. We deposited the annotation of both genomes in the Department of Energy's IMG database to facilitate easy genome exploration by the scientific community without the need of in-depth bioinformatics skills. We expect that an facilitated access and ability to search the N. punctiforme ATCC 29133 for genes of interest will significantly facilitate metabolic engineering and genome prospecting efforts and ultimately the synthesis of biofuels and natural products from this keystone organism and closely related cyanobacteria.",

    "abstract": "The use of the recombinant expression platform Pichia pastoris to produce pharmaceutically important proteins has been investigated over the past 30 years. Compared to mammalian cultures, expression in P. pastoris is cheaper and faster, potentially leading to decreased costs and process development times. Product yields depend on a number of factors including the secretion signal chosen for expression, which can influence the host cell response to recombinant protein production. VRC01, a broadly neutralising anti-HIV antibody, was expressed in P. pastoris, using the methanol inducible AOX1 promoter for both the heavy and light chains. Titre reached up to 3.05 μg mL-1 in small scale expression. VRC01 was expressed using both the α-mating factor signal peptide from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the murine IgG1 signal peptide. Surprisingly, using the murine IgG1 signal peptide resulted in higher yield of antibody capable of binding gp140 antigen. Furthermore, we evaluated levels of secretory stress compared to the untransformed wild-type strain and show a reduced level of secretory stress in the murine IgG1 signal peptide strains versus those containing the α-MF signal peptide. As bottlenecks in the secretory pathway are often the limiting factor in protein secretion, reduced levels of secretory stress and the higher yield of functional antibody suggest the murine IgG1 signal peptide may lead to better protein folding and secretion. This work indicates the possibilities for utilising the murine IgG1 signal peptide for a range of antibodies, resulting in high yields and reduced cellular stress.",

Gammaproteobacteria (20–31.8%), Bacilli (20–35.7%), Betaproteobacteria (4.5–21%) and Actinobacteria (0–18.2%) were dominant, and their diversity was not affected over the whole period. Thirteen dominant isolates from each STM exposures (78 isolates) were applied to determine their resistance prevalence against eight classes of antibiotics. Increased STM resistance (53.8–69.2%) and multi-drug resistance (MDR) (46.2–61.5%) were observed in the STM exposures (0.1–50 mg L−1), compared to exposure without STM (15.3 and 0%, respectively). Based on their variable minimum inhibitory concentration results, 40 differentiated isolates from various STM exposures were selected to check the prevalence of nine aminoglycoside resistance genes (aac(3)-II, aacA4, aadA, aadB, aadE, aphA1, aphA2, strA and strB) and two class I integron genes (3′-CS and IntI). STM resistance genes (aadA, strA and strB), a non-STM resistance gene (aacA4) and integron genes (3′-CS and Int1) were distributed widely in all STM exposures, compared to the exposure without STM. This new culture-based stepwise increasing antibiotic approach reveals that biological systems treating wastewater with lower STM dose (0.1 mg L−1) could lead to notably increased levels of STM resistance, MDR, and resistant gene determinants, which were sustainable even under higher STM doses (> 25 mg L−1).",

Almost complete saccharification of birch was possible with 80 mg enzyme preparation/gsolids (12 FPU/gsolids), while the saccharification yield for spruce was only 70%, even when applying 60 FPU/gsolids. As the cellulose content is enriched by OS, the yield of glucose was higher than in their steam-exploded counterparts. The hydrolysate was a transparent liquid due to the absence of phenolics and was also free from inhibitors. OS pretreatment holds potential for use in a large-scale, closed-loop biorefinery producing fuels from the cellulose fraction and platform chemicals from the hemicellulose and lignin fractions respectively.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic determination of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria is very important for diagnosis and treatment, but sometimes this procedure needs further genetic evaluation. Whole-genome sequencing plays a critical role in deciphering and advancing our understanding of bacterial evolution, transmission, and surveillance of antimicrobial resistance. In this study, whole-genome sequencing was performed on nineteen clinically extraintestinal Escherichia coli isolates from chicken, cows and swine and showing different antimicrobial susceptibility. A total of 44 different genes conferring resistance to 11 classes of antimicrobials were detected in 15 of 19 E. coli isolates (78.9%), and 22 types of plasmids were detected in 15/19 (78.9%) isolates. In addition, whole-genome sequencing of these 19 isolates identified 111 potential virulence factors, and 53 of these VFDB-annotated genes were carried by all these 19 isolates. Twelve different virulence genes were identified while the most frequent ones were gad (glutamate decarboxylase), iss (increased serum survival) and lpfA (long polar fimbriae). All isolates harbored at least one of the virulence genes. The findings from comparative genomic analyses of the 19 diverse E. coli isolates in this study provided insights into molecular basis of the rising multi-drug resistance in E. coli.",

    "abstract": "Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) with significant protective effects on cardiovascular is the active ingredient of traditional Chinese medicine Rhizoma Chuanxiong (RC). However, many studies have reported the low content of TMP in RC. The endophytes of medicinal plants have the biosynthetic potential to produce the same or similar active metabolites as the host, while few reports were conducted to explore the endophytic bacteria of Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort. and its productive capacity for the important ingredient TMP. The present paper focuses on the isolation and identification of TMP producing endophytic bacteria from RC. In this study, the endophytic bacteria were isolated from the rhizome of Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort. (Umbelliferae). Yeast extract peptone glucose medium (YP) was used for fermentation medium (37 °C, 220 rpm agitation, 144 h). GC and GC/MS were performed to determine and verify the product, the fermentation characteristics were investigated. Morphological observation, physiological and biochemical indexes combining with 16S rRNA sequence analysis were carried out to identify the endophytic bacteria. As a result, five strains of endophytic Bacillus subtilis were firstly isolated and identified from RC, named as LB3, LB3-2-1, LB6-2, LB4, LB5 respectively. All five strains of endophytic B. subtilis produced TMP, while LB5 had the highest production of 10.69 g/L at the 144 h fermentation. This work demonstrates the fact that the endophytic B. subtilis of RC can produce a high level of TMP, indicating the endophytic B. subtilis might play a role in the accumulation of TMP during the growth period of RC.",

    "abstract": "Wheat bran is an effective raw material for preparation xylooligosaccharides; however, current research mainly focuses on alkali extraction and enzymatic hydrolysis methods. Since ester bonds are destroyed during the alkali extraction process, xylanase and arabinofuranosidase are mainly used to hydrolyze xylooligosaccharides. However, alkali extraction costs are very high, and the method also causes pollution. Therefore, this study focuses on elucidating a method to efficiently and directly degrade destarched wheat bran. First, an acidic acetyl xylan esterase (AXE) containing a carbohydrate-binding module-1 (CBM1) domain was cloned from Talaromyces leycettanus JCM12802 and successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris. Characterization showed that the full-length acetyl xylan esterase AXE + CBM1 was similar toe uncovered AXE with an optimum temperature and pH of 55 °C and 6.5, respectively. Testing the acetyl xylan esterase and xylanase derived from Neocallimastix patriciarum in a starch-free wheat bran cooperative experiment revealed that AXE + CBM1 and AXE produced 29% and 16% reducing sugars respectively, compared to when only NPXYN11 was used. In addition, introduced the CBM1 domain into NPXYN11, and the results indicated that the CBM1 domain showed little effect on NPXYN11 properties. Finally, the systematically synergistic effects between acetyl xylan esterase and xylanase with/without the CBM1 domain demonstrated that the combined ratio of AXE + CBM1 coming in first and NPXYN11 + CBM1 s increased reducing sugars by almost 35% with AXE and NPXYN11. Furthermore, each component's proportion remained the same with respect to xylooligosaccharides, with the largest proportion (86%) containing of 49% xylobiose and 37% xylotriose.",

Most LAB strains and associations revealed significant inhibitory effects in MRS against Gram-positive and Gram-negative test-organisms at different Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations (determined specifically for each LAB strain and each association). Some LAB strains and communities inhibited the growth of pathogenic test-organisms depending on both ions concentrations and cultivation conditions. Interestingly, the presence of Mg ions in medium significantly decreased the antimicrobial activity of LAB communities against pathogenic test-organisms; on the other hand, the combined mixture of ions essentially increased the inhibitory effect in case of time-spaced cultivation. In contrast, the inhibitory effects of many associations were significantly increased at the presence of Mg2+ and especially ions combination in case of simultaneous cultivation. The addition of ions combination didn't affect antibacterial activity of LAB isolates. The results allow us to conclude that Ca and Mg ions had inducible effects on antibacterial activity in case of simultaneous cultivation. This probably can be prospective for creation of new antimicrobial preparations and their possible application.",

However, these Dendrobium plants are similar in shape to be easily confused, leading to extreme difficulties for identification based on their morphological and chemical features. In this study, the rDNA ITS region sequence analysis was developed for rapid and accurate identification of thirteen wild and cultivated Dendrobium species belonging to two sections Formosae and Chrysotoxae. By cloning and sequencing the rDNA ITS region genes from 13 Dendrobium species, the phylogenetic relationships among them were analyzed. Results showed that the variation of the ITS region, together with the lengths and Guanine and Cytosine contents of ITS, 5.8s rDNA, ITS1 and ITS2 sequences occurred in the tested Dendrobium species, and which from section Chrysotoxae was higher than that from section Formsae. Phylogenetic analysis based on neighbor-joining and maximum p-arsimony trees indicated that the Dendrobium species of sections Formosae and Chrysotoxae could be well divided into two groups. A majority of Dendrobium species exhibited distinctive ITS2 secondary structures, while for those with close genetic relationships were similar. Therefore, the ITS2 region sequence analysis is simple, quick, and highly reliable that can be used as an effective tool for molecular identification and classification, as well as the reconstruction of the phylogeny of wild and cultivated Dendrobium species belonging to different sections.",

The prevalence of E. canis infection has been increasing in recent years. The World Health Organization has been warned about antibiotics resistance and one of the way to prevent this situation is found new compound with this property. Doxycycline is the treatment of choice for this tick-borne disease. Adverse effects are noted in dogs that are sensitive to this drug. Antibiotic resistance may also occur. The present study aimed to evaluate the anti-Ehrlichia properties of the essential oil of the aerial parts of Ageratum conyzoides L. in infected DH82 cells, as well as its anti-Ehrlichia activity associated with doxycycline using the checkerboard assay. A. conyzoides is a native plant from northeast Brazil with many reports of ethnopharmacological applications. The essential oil of A. conyzoides was extracted from the aerial parts of the plant using the hydrodistillation method. E. canis-infected DH82 cells were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium), maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2, and standardized at a 70% infection rate for the initiation of treatment protocols. The tests were first carried out with the aim of defining the IC50. The combined effect of doxycycline and A. conyzoides essential oil was then determined using the checkerboard dilution technique (checkerboard method) in which the IC50 was 200 µg/mL. The doxycycline reduction index from the combined effect was 4.90 times resulting in a synergistic effect. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first alternative treatment (alternative therapy) based on bioactive molecules that have antibacterial activity against E. canis.",

    "abstract": "α-Arbutin is an effective skin-whitening cosmetic ingredient and hyperpigmentation therapy agent. It can be synthesized by one-step enzymatic glycosylation of hydroquinone (HQ), but limited by the low yield. Amylosucrase (Amy-1) from Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris 8004 was recently identified with high HQ glycosylation activity. In this study, whole-cell transformation by Amy-1 was optimized and process scale-up was evaluated in 5000-L reactor. In comparison with purified Amy-1, whole-cell catalyst of recombinant E. coli displays better tolerance against inhibitors (oxidized products of HQ) and requires lower molar ratio of sucrose and HQ to reach high conversion rate (> 99%). Excess accumulation of glucose (0.6–1.0 M) derived from sucrose hydrolysis inhibits HQ glycosylation rate by 46–60%, which suggests the importance of balancing HQ glycosylation rate and sucrose hydrolysis rate by adjusting the activity of whole-cell catalyst and HQ-fed rate. Using optimal conditions, 540 mM of final concentration and 95% of molar conversion rate were obtained within 13–18 h in laboratory scale. For industrial scale-up production, 398 mM and 375 mM of final concentration with high conversion rates (~ 95%) were obtained in 3500-L and 4000-L of reaction volume, respectively. These yields and productivities (4.5–4.9 kg kL−1 h−1) were the highest by comparing to the best we known. Hence, high-yield production of α-arbutin by batch-feeding whole-cell biotransformation was successfully achieved in the 5000-L reaction scale.",

    "abstract": "Clostridium carboxidivorans can produce acids and/or alcohols through syngas fermentation. In that C1-gas fermentation process, the production of acids takes place at higher pH (acetogenesis) (e.g., around 6.00), while the conversion of accumulated acids into alcohols (solventogenesis) is more favourable at a lower pH (e.g., 4.75-5.00). The pH drop, when switching from acetogenesis to solventogenesis, can either be natural-and result from the production of acids-or artificial. In the latter case, for the acidification process, a strong acid (HCl) was added to a syngas fermenting bioreactor in this study, while NaOH was added to increase the pH whenever needed. Cycles of high and low pH were applied in order to switch from acetogenic to solventogenic stages. This pH adjustment procedure leads to the accumulation of salts. The possible inhibitory effect exerted by changes in salinity in the bioreactor was estimated in batch bottles assays, carried out with different salinities (media with different concentrations of sodium chloride) using C. carboxidivorans and CO as a carbon source. At NaCl concentrations below 9 g/L, maximum growth rates around 0.055 h-1 were obtained, whereas increasing the concentration of sodium chloride had a negative effect on bacterial growth and CO consumption. In the case of the most concentrated bottles, above 15 g/L NaCl no relevant growth was observed. Also, the IC50, i.e. concentration yielding 50% growth inhibition, was estimated, and reached a value of 11 g/L sodium chloride.",

    "abstract": "Codon usage frequency influences protein structure and function. The frequency with which codons are used potentially impacts primary, secondary and tertiary protein structure. Poor expression, loss of function, insolubility, or truncation can result from species-specific differences in codon usage. \"Codon harmonization\" more closely aligns native codon usage frequencies with those of the expression host particularly within putative inter-domain segments where slower rates of translation may play a role in protein folding. Heterologous expression of Plasmodium falciparum genes in Escherichia coli has been a challenge due to their AT-rich codon bias and the highly repetitive DNA sequences. Here, codon harmonization was applied to the malarial antigen, CelTOS (Cell-traversal protein for ookinetes and sporozoites). CelTOS is a highly conserved P. falciparum protein involved in cellular traversal through mosquito and vertebrate host cells. It reversibly refolds after thermal denaturation making it a desirable malarial vaccine candidate. Protein expressed in E. coli from a codon harmonized sequence of P. falciparum CelTOS (CH-PfCelTOS) was compared with protein expressed from the native codon sequence (N-PfCelTOS) to assess the impact of codon usage on protein expression levels, solubility, yield, stability, structural integrity, recognition with CelTOS-specific mAbs and immunogenicity in mice. While the translated proteins were expected to be identical, the translated products produced from the codon-harmonized sequence differed in helical content and showed a smaller distribution of polypeptides in mass spectra indicating lower heterogeneity of the codon harmonized version and fewer amino acid misincorporations. Substitutions of hydrophobic-to-hydrophobic amino acid were observed more commonly than any other. CH-PfCelTOS induced significantly higher antibody levels compared with N-PfCelTOS; however, no significant differences in either IFN-γ or IL-4 cellular responses were detected between the two antigens.",

To clarify the effect of soluble arsenic on the live biomass and bioxidative activity in heaps, toxicological assays were performed using a synthetic feed solution given by a mine company. The microorganisms had previously been isolated from two heap samples at up to 66 m depth, and cultured using specific media for chemolithotrophic acidophiles (pH 1-2) and moderate thermophiles (48°C), for arsenic tolerance assay. The four media with the highest biomass were selected to assay As-resistance; one culture (Q63h) was chosen to assay biooxidative activity, using a heap sample that contained chalcopyrite and covellite. We found that 0.5 g/L of As does not affect living biomass or biooxidative activity on Cu sulfides, but it dissolves Cu, while As precipitates as arsenic acid (H3AsO4·½H2O). The arsenic tolerant community, as identified by 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis, was composed of three main metabolic groups: chemolithotrophs (Leptospirillum, Sulfobacillus); chemolithoheterotrophs and organoheterotrophs as Acidovorax temperans, Pseudomonas alcaligenes, P. mendocina and Sphingomonas spp. Leptospirillum spp. and S. thermosulfidooxidans were the dominant taxa in the Q63-66 cultures from the deepest sample of the oldest, highest-temperature heap. The results indicated arsenic resistance in the microbial community, therefore specific primers were used to amplify ars (arsenic resistance system), aio (arsenite oxidase), or arr (arsenate respiratory reduction) genes from total sample DNA. Presence of arsB genes in S. thermosulfidooxidans in the Q63-66 cultures permits H3AsO4-As(V) detoxification and strengthens the community's response to As.",

While the existence of subpopulations is a commonly accepted fact, their appearance and impact on process performance still remains rather unclear. During cell cycling, distinct subpopulations differing in cell division state and DNA content appear which contribute individually to the efficiency of the bioprocess. To identify stressed or impaired subpopulations, we analyzed the interplay of growth rate, cell cycle and phenotypic profile of subpopulations by using flow cytometry and cell sorting in conjunction with mass spectrometry based global proteomics. Adjusting distinct growth rates in chemostats with the model strain Pseudomonas putida KT2440, cells were differentiated by DNA content reflecting different cell cycle stages. The proteome of separated subpopulations at given growth rates was found to be highly similar, while different growth rates caused major changes of the protein inventory with respect to e.g. carbon storage, motility, lipid metabolism and the translational machinery. In conclusion, cells in various cell cycle stages at the same growth rate were found to have similar to identical proteome profiles showing no significant population heterogeneity on the proteome level. In contrast, the growth rate clearly determines the protein composition and therefore the metabolic strategy of the cells.",

To enhance our understanding of their metabolic versatility, this study explores the changes in the proteome and physiology of Pseudomonas putida F1 resulting from its growth on benzoate, a moderate toxic compound that can be catabolized, and citrate, a carbon source that is assimilated through central metabolic pathways. A series of repetitive batch cultivations were performed to ensure a complete adaptation of the bacteria to each of these contrasting carbon sources. After several growth cycles, cell growth stabilized at the maximum level and exhibited a reproducible growth profile. The specific growth rates measured for benzoate (1.01 ± 0.11 h-1) and citrate (1.11 ± 0.12 h-1) were similar, while a higher yield was observed for benzoate (0.6 and 0.3 g cell mass per g of benzoate and citrate, respectively), reflecting the different degrees of carbon reduction in the two substrates. Comparative proteomic analysis revealed an enrichment of several oxygenases/dehydrogenases in benzoate-grown cells, indicative of the higher carbon reduction of benzoate. Moreover, the upregulation of all 14 proteins implicated in benzoate degradation via the catechol ortho-cleavage pathway was observed, while several stress-response proteins were increased to aid cells to cope with benzoate toxicity. Unexpectedly, citrate posed more challenges than benzoate in the maintenance of pH homeostasis, as indicated by the enhancement of the Na+/H+ antiporter and carbonic anhydrase. The study provides important mechanistic insights into Pseudomonas adaptation to varying carbon sources that are of great relevance to bioremediation efforts.",

    "abstract": "2-Keto-l-gulonic acid (the precursor of vitamin C) is bio-converted from l-sorbose by mixed fermentation of Ketogulonicigenium vulgare and a helper strain. The helper strain promotes the conversion of 2-KLG by enhancing the growth of K. vulgare, but its growth is greatly inhibited by high concentration of l-sorbose, which consequently influence the 2-KLG production. The aim of this study is to obtain l-sorbose-tolerant helper strain (LHS) by experimental evolution for reduced l-sorbose-inhibition-effect and enhanced 2-KLG productivity in high concentration of l-sorbose. After three steps screening by using our devised screening strategy, three strains (i.e., Bc 21, Bc 47, Bc 50) with high resistance to high concentration of l-sorbose were obtained. The fermentation tests by co-culturing Bc 21 and K. vulgare 418 showed that the production of 2-KLG was increased by 17.9% in 11% l-sorbose medium than that in 8% after 55 h of fermentation and the conversion rate was 89.5%. The results suggested that Bc 21 could be an ideal helper strain for 2-KLG production under high concentration of l-sorbose and demonstrated the feasibility of using experimental evolution to breed LHS for vitamin C production.",

    "abstract": "The discovery and creation of biocatalysts for plant biomass conversion are essential for industrial demand and scientific research of the plant cell wall. α-1,2 and α-1,3-L-arabinofuranosidases are debranching enzymes that catalyzing hydrolytic release of α-L-arabinofuranosyl residues in plant cell wall. Gene database analyses shows that GH62 family only contains specific α-L-arabinofuranosidases that play an important role in the degradation and structure of the plant cell wall. At present, there are only 22 enzymes in this group has been characterized. In this study, we cloned a novel α-1,3-arabinofuranosidase gene (poabf62a) belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 62 from Penicillium oxalicum sp. 68 and expressed it in Pichia pastoris. The molecular mass of recombinant PoAbf62A was estimated to be 32.9 kDa. Using p-nitrophenyl-α-l-arabinofuranoside (pNPαAbf) as substrate, purified PoAbf62A exhibited an optimal pH of 4.5 and temperature of 35 °C. Results of methylation and 13C NMR analyses showed that PoAbf62A was exclusively α-1,3-arabinofuranosidase, specific for cleavage of α-1,3-arabinofuranosyl residues, and with the absence of activity towards α-1,2-arabinofuranose and α-1,5-arabinofuranose. Therefore, PoAbf62A exhibits high activity on sugar beet arabinan and wheat arabinoxylan, because their branched side chain are decorated with α-1,3-arabinofuranose. On the other hand, there is a lack of activity with linear-α-L-1,5-arabinan and xylan that only contained α-L-1,5-arabinofuranose or β-1,4-xylose. The α-1,3-arabinofuranosidase activity identified here provides a new biocatalytic tool to degrade hemicellulose and analyze the structure of plant cell walls.",

In this work, we investigated the responses of microorganisms in a membrane bioreactor (MBR) to transient shock loads of QACs with different alkyl chain length and their impacts on MBR performance. Results showed that QACs affected microbial viability and caused damage to key enzymes (e.g., ammonium monooxygenase and nitrite oxidoreductase), inhibiting organic matter degradation and nitrogen removal. The presence of QACs also caused negative influences on dehydrogenase activity, catalase and superoxide dismutase, thus increasing the production of reactive oxygen species. Moreover, QACs with longer alkyl chains and/or benzyl groups bonded to the nitrogen atom could induce a more severe damage to cell integrity and microbial viability. The interaction with QACs also induced the release of organic matters and the changes of adhesion properties of microbial products, resulting in aggravated membrane fouling in MBRs. Our results demonstrate the acute negative effects of QACs on activated sludge, and special attention should be paid to the performance of biological wastewater treatment processes subject to the shock loads of QAC-bearing industrial streams.",

To prove the suitability of honey as a sample for the bee viruses detection, the set of different sample types taken directly from the hives we comparatively tested. The study included 30 samples of domestic and 5 samples of imported honey. Additionally, we tested 40 sets of samples including live bees, dead bees, and the honey taken from four apiaries for the evaluation of honey suitability for the virus detection, Two out of the six most common bee viruses were detected in the samples of honey from the market. Black queen cell virus (BQCV) genome was found in 24 domestic honey samples and Kashmir bee virus (KBV) genome was detected in one sample of imported honey. The nucleotide sequences of 24 BQCV isolates showed the highest identity (86.4%) with strains from Europe at the polyprotein gene, whilst the Serbian isolates between each other showed 98.5% similarity. By comparative testing of the different type of samples, in three out of four apiaries BQCV genome was detected in both bees and honey. Evaluating the suitability of honey for the detection of the viral disease by simultaneous testing of live, dead bees, and honey from the same hive, it was shown that the honey can be successfully used for the detection of BQCV. Since, as of yet, there has been no evidence of KBV circulation in Serbia, after its detection in imported honey, there is a substantial risk of its introduction and consequently the need for its surveillance. Therefore, the programs of bee diseases screening should be included in the regular control procedures for the international trade. In addition to this benefit, honey gives an opportunity to beekeepers for continuous monitoring of bees' health status.",

The use of probiotic cultures and its success in commercial scale is relying on the techniques employed to ensure that the potential cultures with desired functional activity are stable and viable for longer period. The present study was undertaken to statistically evaluate the effect of lyoprotectant in the suspension media containing sucrose and reconstituted skim milk on the viability of Lactobacillus acidophilus strains. The central composite rotatable design of response surface methodology was used in evaluating the survival rate and viability even after 24 months' storage of three different lyophilized strains of L. acidophilus. We also determined the exclusive use of lyoprotectant on the survival of the lyophilized strains throughout the study period without altering any of the culture conditions. The most conspicuous result to emerge from the data is that the suspension medium composed of minimal amount of sucrose (~ 1.2%) in the reconstituted skim milk (6%) was evident in maintaining a higher survival rate of lyophilized culture during 2-year storage. From this investigation, the optimized suspension media used to obtain the lyophilized concentrate of L. acidophilus could be recommended in designing dietary supplement with minimal modification for industrial application. This might reduce the manufacturing cost as well as storage loss occurring both in pharma and food sector.",

    "abstract": "The harnessing of biocatalysts from extreme environment hot spring niche for biomass conversion is significant and promising owing to the special characteristics of extremozymes attributed by intriguing biogeochemistry and extreme conditions of these environments. Hence, in the present study 38 bacterial isolates obtained from hot springs of Manikaran (~ 95 °C), Kalath (~ 50 °C) and Vasist (~ 65 °C) of Himachal Pradesh were screened for glycosyl hydrolases by in situ enrichment technique using lignocellulosic biomass (LCB). Based on their hydrolytic potential 5 isolates were selected and they were Bacillus tequilensis (VCB1, VCB2 and VSDB4), and B. licheniformis (KBFB2 and KBFB3). Cellulolytic activity assayed by growth under submerged fermentation showed that B. tequilensis VCB1 had maximum FPA activity (3.38 IU ml-1) in 48 h, while B. licheniformis KBFB3 excelled for endoglucanase (EGA of 4.81 IU ml-1 in 24 h) and cellobiase (0.71 IU ml-1 in 48 h) activities. Among all the thermophilic biocatalysts evaluated, highest exoglucanase (0.06 IU ml-1) activity was observed in B. tequilensis VSDB4 while endoglucanase of B. licheniformis KBFB3 showed optimum specific activity at pH 7 and 70 °C. Further, the presence of celS, celB and xlnB genes in the isolates suggest their possible role in biomass conversion. Protein profiling by SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that cellulase isoforms migrated with molecular masses of 75 kDa. The endoglucanase activity of promising strain B. licheniformis KBFB3 was enhanced in the presence of Ca2+, mercaptoethanol and sodium hypochlorite whereas moderately inhibited by Cu2+, Zn2+, urea, SDS and H2O2. The results of this study indicate scope for the possible development of novel biocatalysts with multifunctional thermostable glycosyl hydrolases from hot springs for efficient hydrolysis of the complex lignocellulosic biomass into simple sugars and other derived bioproducts leading to biomass valorization.",

    "abstract": "Acetone monooxygenase (ACMO) is a unique member of the Baeyer–Villiger monooxygenase (BVMO) family based on its ability to act on small ketones, such as acetone. Herein, we performed a kinetic analysis of ACMO from the propane-utilizing bacterium Gordonia sp. strain TY-5 to assess its preference for smaller ketone substrates. Steady state kinetic analysis of ACMO with a range of linear (C3–C7) and cyclic ketones (C4–C6) reveals that the enzyme elicits the highest catalytic efficiency towards butanone and cyclobutanone. Stopped-flow and inhibition studies further revealed that ACMO has a relatively weak binding affinity for the coenzyme with a dissociation constant of 120 μM. We show through mutagenesis that sequence variation in the residue that coordinates to the 2′-phosphate of NADP(H) partially accounts for the weaker binding affinity observed. As for shown for related BVMOs, NADP+ stabilizes the C4a-peroxyflavin intermediate in ACMO; however, the rate of its formation is considerably slower in ACMO. The observed rate constant for NADPH-dependent flavin reduction was 60 s−1 at 25 °C, and experiments performed with 4(R)-[4-2H]NADPH confirm that the C4-pro-R-hydride from the nicotinamide ring is transferred to the FAD. The latter experimental result suggests that the nicotinamide ring rotates within the active site to carry out its two functional roles: reduction of the FAD cofactor and stabilization of the C4a-peroxyflavin adduct.",

Interestingly, free-form Cys itself as a simple monomeric amino acid was recently shown to function in a novel antioxidative system (cysteine/cystine shuttle system) in Escherichia coli. However, as for Cys-containing dipeptides, the biological functions, effects, and even contents have still remained largely elusive. The potential functions should be a part of cellular redox system and important in basic and applied biology. For its progress, establishment of reliable quantitation method is the first. However, such accurate analysis is unexpectedly difficult even in Cys, because thiol compounds convert through disulfide-exchange and air oxidation during sample preparation. Addressing this problem, in this study, thiol molecules like Cys-containing dipeptides were derivatized by using monobromobimane (thiol-specific alkylating reagent) and detected as S-bimanyl derivatives by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Sample separation was processed with a C18 column (2.1 mm × 150 mm, 1.7 μm) and with water-acetonitrile gradient mobile phase containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid at flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in the multiple reaction monitoring in positive/negative mode with electrospray ionization. The derivatization could indeed avoid the unfavorable reactions, namely, developed the method reflecting their correct contents on sampling. Furthermore, the method was successfully applied to monitoring Cys-containing dipeptides in E. coli Cys producer overexpressing bacD gene. This is the first report of the quantitative analysis of Cys-containing dipeptides, which should be useful for further study of fermentative production of Cys-containing dipeptides.",

    "abstract": "Current technologies for targeted characterization and manipulation of viral RNA primarily involve amplification or ultracentrifugation with isopycnic gradients of viral particles to decrease host RNA background. The former strategy is non-compatible for characterizing properties innate to RNA strands such as secondary structure, RNA-RNA interactions, and also for nanopore direct RNA sequencing involving the sequencing of native RNA strands. The latter strategy, ultracentrifugation, causes loss in genomic information due to its inability to retrieve unassembled viral RNA. To address this, we developed a novel application of current nucleic acid hybridization technologies for direct characterization of RNA. In particular, we modified a current enrichment protocol to capture whole viral native RNA genomes for downstream RNA assays to circumvent the abovementioned problems. This technique involves hybridization of biotinylated baits at 500 nucleotides (nt) intervals, stringent washes and release of free native RNA strands using DNase I treatment, with a turnaround time of about 6 h 15 min. RT-qPCR was used as the primary proof of concept that capture-based purification indeed removes host background. Subsequently, capture-based purification was applied to direct RNA sequencing as proof of concept that capture-based purification can be coupled with downstream RNA assays. We report that this protocol was able to successfully purify viral RNA by 561- to 791-fold. We also report that application of this protocol to direct RNA sequencing yielded a reduction in human host RNA background by 1580-fold, a 99.91% recovery of viral genome with at least 15× coverage, and a mean coverage across the genome of 120×. This report is, to the best of our knowledge, the first description of a capture-based purification method for assays that involve direct manipulation or characterisation of native RNA. This report also describes a successful application of capture-based purification as a direct RNA sequencing strategy that addresses certain limitations of current strategies in sequencing RNA viral genomes.",

Though considerable work has been done on the elucidation of bikaverin biosynthesis pathway in Fusarium fujikuroi, very few reports are available regarding its bioproduction in F. oxysporum. We are hereby proposing a putative metabolic pathway for bikaverin bioproduction in a wild F. oxysporum strain by cross-linking the pigment profiles we obtained under two different fermentation conditions with literature. Naphthoquinone pigments were extracted with a pressurized liquid extraction method, and characterized by HPLC-DAD and UHPLC-HRMS. The results led to the conclusions that the F. oxysporum LCP531 strain was able to produce bikaverin and its various intermediates, e.g., pre-bikaverin, oxo-pre-bikaverin, dinor-bikaverin, me-oxo-pre-bikaverin, and nor-bikaverin, in submerged cultures in various proportions. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the isolation of these five bikaverin intermediates from F. oxysporum cultures, providing us with steady clues for confirming a bikaverin metabolic pathway as well as some of its regulatory patterns in the F. oxysporum LCP531 strain, based on the previously reported model in F. fujikuroi. Interestingly, norbikaverin accumulated along with bikaverin in mycelial cells when the strain grew on simple carbon and nitrogen sources and additional cofactors. Along bikaverin production, we were able to describe the excretion of the toxin beauvericin as main extrolite exclusively in liquid medium containing complex nitrogen and carbon sources, as well as the isolation of ergosterol derivate in mycelial extracts, which have potential for pharmaceutical uses. Therefore, culture conditions were also concluded to trigger some specific biosynthetic route favoring various metabolites of interest. Such observation is of great significance for selective production of pigments and/or prevention of occurrence of others (aka mycotoxins).",

The intracellular production of ammonia in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) by metabolic engineering is difficult because yeast strongly assimilates ammonia, and the knockout of genes enabling this assimilation is lethal. Therefore, we attempted to produce ammonia outside the yeast cells by displaying a glutaminase (YbaS) from Escherichia coli on the yeast cell surface. YbaS-displaying yeast successfully produced 3.34 g/L ammonia from 32.6 g/L glutamine (83.2% conversion rate), providing it at a higher yield than in previous studies. Next, using YbaS-displaying yeast, we also succeeded in producing ammonia from glutamine in soybean residues (okara) produced as food waste from tofu production. Therefore, ammonia production outside cells by displaying ammonia-lyase on the cell surface is a promising strategy for producing ammonia from food waste as a novel energy resource, thereby preventing food loss.",

However, little is known about how P. sinese plantation and fermented manures of P. sinese -feed livestock affect the composition of soil bacterial and fungal communities. In this study, 16S rRNA/ITS1 gene-based Illumina Miseq sequencing was employed to compare the bacterial and fungal community structure among soils that had been subjected to uncultivated control (CK), 2-year P. sinese plantation (P), and P. sinese plantation combined with the use of organic manures (P-OM) in a “ P. sinese —breeding industry” ecological agriculture farm. The results found microbial communities were altered by P. sinese plantation and fertilization. The P. sinese plantation resulted in increased Actinobacteria and Planctomycetes abundance. Comparatively, significant increased abundance of Chloroflexi , Firmicutes , Nitrospirae , and Euryarchaeota , and genes related with nitrogen and carbon metabolic pathways based on PICRUSt prediction was observed in P-OM soil. Fungal compositions suggested a markedly increased abundance of Ascomycota in P soil. Potential organic matter decomposers Candida , Thermoascus , and Aspergillus were enriched in P soil, indicating the enhanced role of fungi in litter decomposition. Redundancy analysis suggested that soil properties (NH 4 + -N, total nitrogen, organic matter content, and soil water content) significantly correlated with the changes of microbial compositions ( P &lt; 0.05). These results highlight the divergence of microbial communities occurs during P. sinese -based plantation, implying functional diversification of soil ecosystem in P. sinese fields.",

    "abstract": "Miraculin, derived from the miracle fruit (Synsepalum dulcificum), is a taste-regulating protein that interacts with human sweet-taste receptors and transforms sourness into sweet taste. Since miracle fruit is cultivated in West Africa, mass production of miraculin is limited by regional and seasonal constraints. Here, we investigated mass production of recombinant miraculin in carrot (Daucus carota L.) callus cultures using an air-lift bioreactor. To increase miraculin expression, the oxidative stress-inducible SWPA2 promoter was used to drive the expression of miraculin gene under various stress treatments. An 8 h treatment of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and salt (NaCl) increased the expression of miraculin gene by fivefold compared with the untreated control. On the other hand, abscisic acid, salicylic acid, and methyl jasmonate treatments showed no significant impact on miraculin gene expression compared with the control. This shows that since H2O2 and NaCl treatments induce oxidative stress, they activate the SWPA2 promoter and consequently up-regulate miraculin gene expression. Thus, the results of this study provide a foundation for industrial-scale production of recombinant miraculin protein using transgenic carrot cells as a heterologous host.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ammonia is used as a fertilizer for agriculture, chemical raw material, and carrier for transporting hydrogen, and with economic development, the demand for ammonia has increased. The Haber–Bosch process, which is the main method for producing ammonia, can produce ammonia with high efficiency. However, since it consumes a large amount of fossil energy, it is necessary to develop an alternative method for producing ammonia with less environmental impact. Ammonia production from food by-products is an appealing production process owing to unused resource usage, including waste, and mild reaction conditions. However, when food by-products and biomass are used as feedstocks, impurities often reduce productivity. Using metabolic profiling, glucose was identified as a potential inhibitor of ammonia production from impure food by-products. We constructed the recombinant Escherichia coli , in which glucose uptake was reduced by ptsG gene disruption and amino acid catabolism was promoted by glnA gene disruption. Ammonia production efficiency from okara, a food by-product, was improved in this strain; 35.4 mM ammonia was produced (47% yield). This study might provide a strategy for efficient ammonia production from food by-products.",

Affibody molecules targeting H-Ras (Zras122, Zras220, and Zras521) or Raf-1 (Zraf322) were introduced into the MH7A synovial cell line using two delivery methods: transfection with plasmids encoding the affibody molecules or direct introduction of affibody protein using a cell-penetrating peptide reagent. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production by MH7A cells were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay after stimulation with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Cell proliferation was also analyzed. Phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was analyzed by western blot. All affibody molecules could inhibit IL-6 and PGE2 production in TNF-α-stimulated MH7A cells. The inhibitory effect was stronger when affibody molecules were delivered as proteins via a cell-penetrating peptide reagent than when plasmid-DNA encoding the affibody moelcules was transfected into the cells. Plasmid-expressed Zras220 inhibited phosphorylation of ERK in TNF-α-stimulated MH7A cells. Protein-introduced Zraf322 inhibited the production of IL-6 and PGE2 and inhibited cell proliferation in MH7A cells. These findings suggest that affibody molecules specific for H-Ras and Raf-1 can affect intracellular signal transduction through the MAP kinase pathway to inhibit cell proliferation and production of inflammatory mediators by synovial cells.",

Using a novel piggery wastewater treatment system termed \"UASB + SHARON + ANAMMOX\" constructed in our laboratory, we investigated microbial community dynamics using the Illumina MiSeq method, taking activated sludge samples at ~2-week intervals during a ~300-day period. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) were further investigated by quantification of AOB amoA genes and construction of gene clone libraries. Major changes in bacterial community composition and dynamics occurred when running manner was changed from continuous flow manner (CFM) to sequencing batch manner (SBM), and when effluent from an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor for practical treatment of real piggery wastewater was used as influent; differences among these three experimental groups were significant (R (2) = 0.94, p < 0.01). When running manner was changed from CFM to SBM, relative abundance of the genus Nitrospira decreased sharply from 18.1 % on day 116 to 1.5 % on day 130, and to undetectable level thereafter. Relative abundance of the genus Nitrosomonas increased from ~0.67 % during the CFM period to 8.0 % by day 220, and thereafter decreased to a near-constant ~1.6 %. Environmental factors such as load ammonia, effluent ammonia, effluent nitrite, UASB effluent, pH, and DO levels collectively drove bacterial community dynamics and contributed to maintenance of effluent NH4 (+)-N/NO2 (-)-N ratio ~1. Theses results might provide useful clues for the control of the startup processes and maintaining high efficiency of such bioreactors.",

Among protopanaxadiol (PPD)-type ginsenosides, minor ginsenosides such as ginsenoside (G)-F2, G-Rh2, compound (C)-Mc1, C-Mc, C-O, C-Y, and C-K are known to be more pharmacologically active constituents than major ginsenosides such as G-Rb1, G-Rb2, G-Rc, and G-Rd. A novel ginsenoside Rc-hydrolyzing β-glucosidase (BG-1) from Armillaria mellea mycelia was purified as a single protein band with molecular weight of 121.5 kDa on SDS-PAGE and a specific activity of 17.9 U mg−1 protein. BG-1 concurrently hydrolyzed α-(1 → 6)-arabinofuranosidic linkage at the C-20 site or outer β-(1 → 2)-glucosidic linkage at the C-3 site of G-Rc to produce G-Rd and C-Mc1, respectively. The enzyme also hydrolyzed outer and inner glucosidic linkages at the C-3 site of G-Rd to produce C-K via G-F2, and inner glucosidic linkage at the C-3 site of C-Mc1 to produce C-Mc. C-Mc was also slowly hydrolyzed α-(1 → 6)-arabinofuranosidic linkage at the C-20 site to produce C-K with reaction time prolongation. Finally, the pathways for formation of C-Mc and C-K from G-Rc by BG-1 were G-Rc → C-Mc1 → C-Mc and G-Rc → G-Rd → G-F2 → C-K, respectively. The optimum reaction conditions for C-Mc and C-K formation from G-Rc by BG-1 were pH 4.0–4.5, temperature 45–60 °C, and reaction time 72–96 h.

A much higher current was produced at pH 7.0 than at pH 5.5 and 4.0, correlating with an increased population ratio of Geobacter species to the total bacteria growing on the electrode. Most intracellular metabolites related to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were present at a higher level at pH 7.0 than at pH 5.5 and 4.0, and the levels of metabolites correlated well with the obtained current densities. A high intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP)/adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ratio at pH 7.0, compared to at pH 5.5 and 4.0, likewise supported current production.

Baffled cylindrical flask used for Escherichia coli K12 IFO3301 shake culture maintained lower CO 2 concentrations in the headspace than conventional flasks; therefore, CO 2 accumulation in the culture broth could be suppressed. Cell growth in baffled cylindrical flask (with k L a equivalent to that of the Erlenmeyer flask) was about 1.3 and 1.4 times that in the Erlenmeyer and Sakaguchi flasks, respectively. This study focused on the batch culture at the flask scale and designed the headspace environment with low CO 2 accumulation.

Therefore, to investigate the effect of the intestinal microflora structure on the growth performance of pigs, samples from Duroc (n = 10), Landrace (n = 9) and Yorkshire (n = 21) pigs under the same diet and feeding conditions were collected. The fecal microbial composition was profiled via 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing. We also analyzed their growth performance. We found that Duroc and Landrace pigs had significant differences in average daily gain (ADG), feed efficiency ratio (FER), growth index (GI), and number of days taken to reach 100 kg ( P &lt; 0.05 ). Moreover, through analysis of the intestinal flora, we also identified 18 species of intestinal flora with significant differences between Duroc and Landrace pigs ( P &lt; 0.05 ). To eliminate the influence of genetic background, the differential intestinal flora of 21 Yorkshire pigs with differences in growth performance was analyzed. The results showed that there were significant correlations between Barnesiella , Dorea , Clostridium and Lactobacillus and pig growth performance. To explore the effect of the intestinal flora on the growth performance of pigs at the molecular level, Lactobacillus , which is the most abundant in the intestine, was selected for isolation and purification and cocultured with intestinal epithelial cells. qPCR was used to determine the effect of Lactobacillus on MC4R gene expression in intestinal epithelial cells. The results showed that Lactobacillus inhibited MC4R gene expression in these cells. The results provide a useful reference for further study of the relationship between the intestinal flora and pig growth performance.",

The results showed that the nucleotide sequences 16S rRNA region are highly similar to those of V. alginolyticus , V. azureus , V. fluvialis, V. natriengens and V. orientalis, which were published on Genbank and other, ranging from 98.05 to 100%. The digestive tract has the most common Vibrio strains ( V. alginolyticus [16] V. azureu s [7] and V. fluvialis ). Thereout, 25 of 30 strains of Vibrio contained 1 to 3 toxin genes, except V. parahaemolyticus . Six parameters were used to measure the DNA polymorphism of 33 homologous DNA sequences in this Vibrio bacteria population. The results indicated that number of separate polymorphic sites (S), total number of mutant sites (Eta), number of haplotype (h), haplotype diversity (Hd), average number of nucleotide differences (k), nucleotide diversity (Pi) were 98 (S), 103 (Eta), 9 (h), 0.887 ± 0.032 (Hd), 25.789 (k) and 17.980 × 10–3 ± 0.003 (Pi), respectively (P &lt; 0,05). The G + C content above 1434 sites positions of nucleotide sequences accounted for 0.542. The phylogenetic tree showed that these strains are divided into six groups. As observed, the appearance of isolated Vibrio on 3 organs of fish ( S. ocellatus ) hemorrhagic are V. azureus (27,67%), V. alginolyticus (50%), V. orientalis (6,67%) and V. fluvialis (16,67%). Through this result, we found that the diversity of Vibrio species that appeared on the red drum was used in the 16S rRNA region and the presence of toxin genes in these Vibrio species.",

The results showed that X. badius mycelium grew well at a wide pH range of 5.00 ~ 9.00. Although the mycelium remained viable, mycelial growth of X. badius was significantly inhibited with increasing salt and drought stresses. Furthermore, a soilless experiment in Petri dishes was performed to investigate the potential of X. badius to induce beneficial effects on seed germination and seedling growth of annual ryegrass ( Lolium multiflorum Lam.) under salt and drought stresses. Seed priming with X. badius enhanced the seedling growth of L. multiflorum Lam. under NaCl-induced salt stress and PEG-induced drought stress. However, X. badius did not significantly improve the seed germination under non-stress and mild stress conditions. It suggested that X. badius inoculation with seeds was not essential for seed germination under non-stress and mild stress conditions, but contributed highly to seedling growth under severe stress conditions. Therefore, seed priming with X. badius on ryegrass could be an effective approach to enhance plant tolerance against drought and salt stresses. X. badius could be a good candidate for the inoculation of ectomycorrhizal plants cultivation programs in mild saline and semiarid areas.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A novel approach targeting self-inducible surfactin synthesis under oxygen-limited conditions is presented. Because both the nitrate (NarGHI) and nitrite (NasDE) reductase are highly expressed during anaerobic growth of B. subtilis , the native promoter P srfA of the surfactin operon in strain B. subtilis JABs24 was replaced by promoters P narG and P nasD to induce surfactin synthesis anaerobically. Shake flask cultivations with varying oxygen availabilities indicated no significant differences in native P srfA expression. As hypothesized, activity of P narG and P nasD increased with lower oxygen levels and surfactin was not produced by P srfA ::P narG as well as P srfA ::P nasD mutant strains under conditions with highest oxygen availability. P narG showed expressions similar to P srfA at lowest oxygen availability, while maximum value of P nasD was more than 5.5-fold higher. Although the promoter exchange P srfA ::P narG resulted in a decreased surfactin titer at lowest oxygen availability, the strain carrying P srfA ::P nasD reached a 1.4-fold increased surfactin concentration with 696 mg/L and revealed an exceptional high overall Y P/X of 1.007 g/g. This value also surpassed the Y P/X of the reference strain JABs24 at highest and moderate oxygen availability. Bioreactor cultivations illustrated that significant cell lysis occurred when the process of “anaerobization” was performed too fast. However, processes with a constantly low agitation and aeration rate showed promising potential for process improvement, especially by employing the strain carrying P srfA ::P nasD promoter exchange. Additionally, replacement of other native promoters by nitrite reductase promoter P nasD represents a promising tool for anaerobic-inducible bioprocesses in Bacillus .",

However, the community of nitrification process in anammox-inoculated wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has not been elucidated. In this study, ammonia oxidation (AO) and nitrite oxidation (NO) rates were analyzed with the incubation of activated sludge from Xinfeng WWTPs (Taiwan, China), and the community composition of nitrification communities were investigated by high-throughput sequencing. Results showed that both AO and NO had strong activity in the activated sludge. The average rates of AO and NO in sample A were 6.51 µmol L-1 h-1 and 6.52 µmol L-1 h-1, respectively, while the rates in sample B were 14.48 µmol L-1 h-1 and 14.59 µmol L-1 h-1, respectively. The abundance of the nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) Nitrospira was 0.89-4.95 × 1011 copies/g in both samples A and B, the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) was 1.01-9.74 × 109 copies/g. In contrast, the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) was much lower than AOB, only with 1.28-1.53 × 105 copies/g in samples A and B. The AOA community was dominated by Nitrosotenuis, Nitrosocosmicus, and Nitrososphaera, while the AOB community mainly consisted of Nitrosomonas and Nitrosococcus. The dominant species of Nitrospira were Candidatus Nitrospira defluvii, Candidatus Nitrospira Ecomare2 and Nitrospira inopinata. In summary, the strong nitrification activity was mainly catalyzed by AOB and Nitrospira, maintaining high efficiency in nitrogen removal in the anammox-inoculated WWTPs by providing the substrates required for denitrification and anammox processes.",

In the last decade, rice-crab co-culture has rapidly expanded in China. Under this model, crabs are raised in rice fields instead of in traditional aquaculture ponds. In this study, we cultured two varieties of Chinese mitten crabs (Changjiang and Liaohe) in an alkaline region in northwest China and used Illumina MiSeq sequencing to compare the intestinal bacterial alpha diversity and community structure between traditional and co-culture aquaculture models, between two crab varieties, and between female and male crabs. Significant variations in intestinal bacterial communities were found between crab varieties and between female and male crabs but not between aquaculture models. These results show that rice-crab co-culture operations did not obviously impact the crab intestinal bacterial community compared with traditional pond aquaculture. Firmicutes was the most abundant bacterial phylum in the crab intestines (78%, relative abundance). Three dominant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) represented 73.2% of Firmicutes sequences and 56.8% of all sequences. A dominant OTU assigned as Firmicutes that was negatively correlated with crab body length, width, and weight was found in the source water for the experimental area. The results of this study suggest that the aquaculture of Chinese mitten crabs in alkaline regions requires more study to improve cultivation techniques.",

    "abstract": "5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) has broad potential applications in the medical, agricultural and food industries. Several strategies have been implemented successfully to try to improve ALA synthesis. Nonetheless, the low yield has got in the way of large-scale bio-manufacture of 5-ALA. In this study, we explored strain engineering strategies for high-level 5-ALA production in Corynebacterium glutamicum F343 using the C4 pathway. Initially, the glutamate dehydrogenase-encoding gene gdhA was deleted to reduce glutamate yield. Then the C4 pathway was introduced in the gdhA mutant strain F2-A (∆gdhA + hemA), resulting in a 5-ALA yield of up to 3.2 g/L. Furthermore, the accumulations of downstream metabolites such as heme, porphobilinogen, and protoporphyrin IX, were decreased. After evaluating the mechanisms of this synthetic pathway by RNA-Seq, the results showed that genes involved in both the C5 pathway and heme pathways were down-regulated in strain F2-A (∆gdhA + hemA). Interestingly, upstream genes of succinyl-CoA in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, such as icd, lpdA, were up-regulated, while its downstream genes, including sucC, sucD, sdhB, sdhA, sdhCD, were down-regulated. These changes amplify the sources of succinyl-CoA and reduce its expenditure, before pulling the carbon flux to produce 5-ALA. Furthermore, the down-regulation of most genes of the heme pathway could reduce the drainage of 5-ALA, which further enhance its accumulation. To alleviate competition between glyoxylate and the TCA cycle, the isocitrate dehydrogenase-encoding gene aceA was also knocked out, resulting in 3.86 g/L of 5-ALA. Finally, the fermentation conditions were optimized, resulting in a maximum 5-ALA yield of 5.6 g/L. Overall, the blocking of the glutamate synthesis pathway could be a powerful strategy to re-allocate the carbon flux to produce 5-ALA. It could also enable the efficient synthesis of other TCA derivatives in C. glutamicum.",

Alfalfa forages were treated with or without cellulase + ɑ-galactosidase (CEGA), cellulase + LP (CELP), or ɑ-galactosidase + LP (GALP). After 56 days of ensiling, all treated silages exhibited improved fermentation quality, as reflected by decreased pH, ammonium-N and increased lactic acid levels compared to the control silage ( P &lt; 0.05). Enzymatic treatment improved nutrient value by increasing crude protein levels and decreasing neutral detergent fibre (NDF) levels ( P &lt; 0.05). Silage treatment significantly altered the bacterial community, as determined by PCoA ( P &lt; 0.05). Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) dominated the bacterial community of the treated silage after ensiling. The dominant bacteria changed from Garciella , Enterococcus , Lactobacillus and Pediococcus in the control silage to Lactobacillus and Pediococcus in the CEGA silage and Lactobacillus in the CELP and GALP silages. Collectively, these results suggest that treatment with both enzymes alone and in combination with inoculants greatly increased the abundance of LAB, with Enterococcus , Lactobacillus and Pediococcus observed in the silage treated with enzymes alone (CEGA) and Lactobacillus observed in the silage treated with a combination of enzymes and inoculants (CELP and GALP).",

In this study, for the first time, natural media of date kernel from Bam city was used as the BAF reactor media, with a meshing sand filter separated by a standard metal grid from the natural filter section used at the end of the reactor. This can be considered an innovation in the media and filtration. Aeration in the related reactor with 160 cm height was performed bilaterally as up-flow and continuously by nozzles throughout the reactor media. In this work, the actual effluent of the hospital wastewater treatment plant was employed as the inflow wastewater to the reactor, and its organic and inorganic parameters were measured before and after the treatment by the BAF reactor. The backwashing process was also studied in three ways: bottom backwashing (TB), top backwashing (BB), and top and bottom backwashing (TBBS), to determine the amount of water consumed and to achieve the desired result. According to the results obtained in this study, the removal efficiencies of inorganic and microbial contaminants, amoxicillin and azithromycin were obtained as follows: BOD5: 98.48%, COD: 92.42%, [Formula: see text]: 99.4%, P: 93.3%, Coliforms: 97%, Color: 42.8%, Turbidity: 95%, Sulphate: 30%, TSS: 98.9%, Amoxicillin: 20% and azithromycin: 13%. In the backwashing process, the amount of water consumed in these three TB, BB, and TBBS methods were obtained 300, 164, and 118 L, respectively, So, TBBS method was selected as the optimal method. Based on the results obtained in this study, it is concluded that the BAF process with natural date kernel has a high efficiency in removing organic and inorganic contaminants from hospital wastewater, also the concentration of most of the effluent parameters was less or in accordance with EPA standard.",

All isolates were identified by the conventional biochemical tests. Then, the antibiotic resistance of these isolates was determined using the disk diffusion method according to the CLSI guidelines. Also, the E.test was performed to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of imipenem. The mutations of this gene were recognized by the amplification of this region and subsequently sequenced. Sequencing of the genomic region upstream of oprD these regions were done in the 29 clinical strains. Statistical analysis was done by the statistical software SPSS-18. Seventy (77.7%) of isolates had MIC ≥ 16 and were resistant to imipenem. Mutations of the upstream of the oprD gene and its promoters were seen in 25 (86.2%) isolates and 4 isolates had no mutation. One isolate had a base substitution A→Cat nt 25 in the coding region and this isolate had a point mutation leading to an amino acid change at positions 9 (I→L). Our study results indicated that none of the strains had mutation in Shine-Dalgarno and the point mutations were the most common mutations upstream of the oprD coding region among P. aeruginosa isolates. Mutations were observed in imipenem-resistant isolates and it seems this mechanism is effective in resistance of isolates to imipenem and this confirmed that the indiscriminate use of antibiotic should be controlled.",

The current study involved the induction of agitated micro-shoot cultures with the aim to investigate the growth-promoting as well as phytochemicals enhancement role of yeast extract (YE) and pectin (PE). The results showed that both elicitors induced a considerable physiological response. Biomass accumulation was observed maximum (DW: 18.3 g/L) against PE (10 mg/L) compared to YE and control. Eleven secondary phytocompounds were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. PE (50 mg/L) was found to be effective in elicitation of rosmarinic acid (680.20 µg/g), chlorogenic acid (294.12 µg/g), apigenin (579.61 µg/g) and quercetin (596.89 µg/g). However, maximum caffeic acid (359.52 µg/g) and luteolin (546.12 µg/g accumulation was noted in PE (1 mg/L) treatment. Harpagide, aucubin, harpagoside and 8-O-acetyl-harpagoside production was suppressed by both elicitors except for YE (100 mg/L). Catalpol accumulation in micro-shoot cultures was also downregulated except in response to YE (50 and 100 mg/L). Antioxidant activity and anti-inflammatory activity remained higher under PE (50 mg/L) and YE (100 mg/L) respectively. Therefore, results suggested that Ajuga integrifolia micro-shoot cultures treated with yeast extract and pectin might be an efficient bio-factory to produce commercially potent specific secondary metabolites.",

The co-cultivability of the selected bacterial isolates was determined in nutrient-rich medium, as well as in BTEX amended mineral salts solution using Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) and CFU determinations. BTEX biodegradation capacity of the two-strain consortium was assessed in mineral salts solution, where a series of BTEX depletions and supplementations occurred, as well as in a real, BTEX polluted environmental sample (contaminated groundwater) in the presence of the autochthonous bacterial community. The obtained results indicated that the developed bacterial consortium is very efficient in BTEX biodegradation. Under laboratory conditions, the acclimatized bacterial consortium completely degraded the BTEX mixture with a concentration as high as 20 mg l-1 in a mineral salt medium within a short span of 6 h. Close to in situ groundwater conditions (incubated at 15 °C under static conditions in the absence of light), groundwater microcosms containing the autochthonous bacterial community inoculated with the developed bacterial consortium showed more efficient toluene, o-, m-and p-xylene biodegradation capacity than microcosms containing solely the native microbial population originally found in the groundwater. In the inoculated microcosms, after 115 h of incubation the concentration (~ 1.7 mg l-1 each) of o-, m- and p-xylene decreased to zero, whereas in the non-inoculated microcosms the concentration of xylene isomers was still 0.2, 0.3 and 0.3 mg l-1, respectively. The allochthonous bioaugmentation of the contaminated groundwater with the obtained inoculant was successful and manifested in a better BTEX degradation rate. Our results suggest that the obtained bacterial consortium can be a new, stable and efficient bioremediation agent applicable in the synergistic elimination of BTEX compounds from contaminated sites.",

    "abstract": "Here a stable glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs) system was operated by anaerobic-aerobic mode in the sequencing batch reactor. We focused on the metabolic mechanisms of PHAs storage from GAOs. Our system showed the classic characteristic of glycogen accumulating metabolism (GAM). Glycogen consumption was followed by acetic acid uptake to synthesize poly-β-hydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) during the anaerobic period, and glycogen was synthesized by PHAs degradation in the aerobic stage. Microbial community structure indicated that Candidatus Contendobacter was the most prevalent GAOs. We found that the ethylmalonyl-CoA (EMC) pathway was the crucial pathway supplying the core substance propionyl-CoA for poly-β-hydroxyvalerate (PHV) synthesis in Candidatus Contendobacter. All genes in EMC pathway were mainly located in Candidatus Contendobacter by gene source analysis. The key genes expression of EMC pathway increased with Candidatus Contendobacter enrichment, further validating that propionyl-CoA was synthesized by Candidatus Contendobacter predominantly via EMC pathway. Our work revealed the novel mechanisms underlying PHV synthesis through EMC pathway and further improved the intercellular storage metabolism of GAOs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Trichosporon asahii is a pathogenic fungus that causes deep-seated fungal infections in immunocompromised patients. Established methods for generating gene-deficient T. asahii mutants exist, but the frequency of obtaining transformants by electroporation remains low. In the present study, we optimized the conditions for gene transfer by electroporation using a ku70 gene-deficient mutant with high recombination efficiency. Introducing a DNA fragment by electroporation into T. asahii cells on Sabouraud dextrose agar to generate a cnb1 gene-deficient mutant and incubating for 1 day led to the growth of approximately 100 transformants. When the incubation period was extended to 2 days or 5 days, however, only 2 or no transformants, respectively, were grown. The highest number of transformants was grown by electroporation when a square wave at 1.8 kV (9 kV/cm) was applied for 5 ms. In addition, the number of transformants increased with an increase in the length of the homologous region, and transformants did not grow when the homologous region was less than 500 base pairs. A DNA fragment was produced for deletion of the cnb1 gene by joint PCR, and the cnb1 gene-deficient mutant was obtained by introducing the DNA fragment by electroporation. These results indicate that DNA fragments produced by joint PCR can be used to generate gene-deficient mutants of T. asahii through gene transfer by electroporation. Graphical Abstract",

Sequence analysis of BcelFp revealed that it could be classified into glycoside hydrolase family 5 (GH5). The gene encoding a 323-amino acid protein was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme was purified, and its molecular weight was approximate 37 kDa. The recombinant BcelFp exhibited an optimal activity at 95 oC and pH 5.5 and showed high thermostability. The endoglucanase had high selectivity for cleaving the outer glucose moiety at the C3 carbon of ginsenoside Rb1, Rb2, Rc and Rd, which produced stronger pharmacologically active gypenoside XVII (GypXVII), Compound O (CO), Compound Mc1 (CMc1) and F2, respectively. The Km values for Rb1, Rb2, Rc and Rd were 3.66 ± 0.04 µM, 4.02 ± 0.12 µM, 5.95 ± 0.03 µM, 0.67 ± 0.006 µM, respectively. The kcat/Km value of BcelFp for ginsenoside Rd was 27.91 mM-1s-1, which was much higher than that of the previously enzymes.

A new therapeutic strategy to ease this crisis is to repurpose non-antibacterial compounds to increase aminoglycosides sensibility against multidrug resistant E.coli pathogens. Based on high throughput screening technology, we profile the antimicrobial activity of tavaborole, a first antifungal benzoxaborole drug for onychomycosis treatment, and investigate the synergistic interaction between tavaborole and aminoglycosides, especially tobramycin and amikacin. Most importantly, by resistance accumulation assay, we found that, tavaborole not only slowed resistance occurrence of aminoglycosides, but also reduced invasiveness of E.coli in combination with tobramycin. Mechanistic studies preliminary explored that tavaborole and aminoglycosides lead to mistranslation, but would be still necessary to investigate more details for further research. In addition, tavaborole exhibited low systematic toxicity in vitro and in vivo, and enhanced aminoglycoside bactericidal activity in mice peritonitis model. Collectively, these results suggest the potential of tavaborole as a novel aminoglycosides adjuvant to tackle the clinically relevant drug resistant E. coli and encourages us to discover more benzoxaborole analogues for circumvention of recalcitrant infections.",

In present study, the characteristics and diversity of gut microbiota in fine purebred boars from three-way crossbred \"Duroc×Landrace×Yorkshire\" pigs were investigated using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. The results showed that the three breeds of boars shared similar gut microbiota, yet there remain slight differences at the family/genus level. At the family level, Ruminococcaceae, Streptococcaceae and Lactobacillaceae have the highest abundance in Landrace, while Rikenellaceae and f_p_251_o5 have the highest abundance in Duroc. The abundance of Prevotellaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Spirochaetaceae in intestinal of Yorkshire were higher than that of Landrace and Duroc. In addition, ten and six biomarkers were identified in the microbiota across breeds and months of age, respectively. Moreover, we evaluated the effect of gut microbiota on boar semen quality, revealing that Duroc had the strongest sperm vitality, significantly associated with the genus Rikenellaceae_PC9_gut_group. In addition, the spermatogenesis ability and sperm production improved gradually along with increase of age. In conclusion, this study provides a reference for understanding the gut microbiota composition of purebred boars used for three-way crosses and their impact on semen performance.",

    "abstract": "The demand for industrial genetically modified host cells were increased with the growth of the biopharmaceutical market. Numerous studies on improving host cell productivity have shown that altering host cell growth and viability through genetic engineering can increase recombinant protein production. During the last decades, it was demonstrated that overexpression or downregulation of some microRNAs in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells as the host cell in biopharmaceutical manufacturing, can improve their productivity. The selection of microRNA targets has been based on their previously identified role in human cancers. MicroRNA-32 (miR-32), which is conserved between humans and hamsters (Crisetulus griseus), was shown to play a role in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis in some human cancers. In this study, we investigated the effect of miR-32 overexpression on the productivity of CHO-VEGF-trap cells. Our results indicated that stable overexpression of miR-32 could dramatically increase the productivity of CHO cells by 1.8-fold. It also significantly increases cell viability, batch culture longevity, and cell growth. To achieve these results, following the construction of a single clone producing an Fc-fusion protein, we transfected cells with a pLexJRed-miR-32 plasmid to stably produce the microRNA and evaluate the impact of mir-32 overexpression on cell productivity, growth and viability in compare with scrambled control. Our findings highlight the application of miRNAs as engineering tools and indicated that miR-32 could be a target for engineering CHO cells to increase cell productivity.",

This experimental study evaluated the chemical constituents of polyphenols in Pu-erh (PTP) and Dian Hong tea (DHTP). It also investigated the co-regulatory effects of PTP and DHTP on intestinal flora and liver tissues in mice using 16 S rRNA gene and transcriptome sequencing. The results revealed that DHT had higher concentrations of EGC (epigallocatechin), C (catechin), EC (epicatechin), and EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate). In contrast, PT had higher concentrations of GA (gallic acid), ECG (epicatechin-3-gallate), TF (theaflavin), and TB (theabrownin). PTP and DHTP consumption significantly reduced the rates of weight gain in mice. Microbial community diversity was significantly higher in PTP and DHTP-treated mice than in the control group. Notably, beneficial microbes such as Lactobacillus increased significantly in PTP-treated mice, whereas Lachnospiraceae increased significantly in DHTP-treated mice. Both PTP and DHTP improved the activity of the antioxidant enzymes (SOD) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in the liver. The transcriptome analysis revealed that the beneficial effects of PTP and DHTP were due to changes in various metabolic pathways, the majority of which were related to antioxidant and lipid metabolism. This study discovered that PTP and DHTP had beneficial effects in mice via the gut-liver axis.",

We previously reported that Bacillus paralicheniformis SR14, a SeNPs-producing bacteria, could improve intestinal antioxidative function in vitro. To further analyze the biological characteristics of SR14, whole genome sequencing was used to reveal the genetic characteristics in selenite reduction and sugar utilization. The results reviewed that the genome size of SR14 was 4,448,062 bp, with a GC content of 45.95%. A total of 4300 genes into 49 biological pathways was annotated to the KEGG database. EC: 1.1.1.49 (glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase) and EC: 5.3.1.9 (glucose-6-phosphate isomerase), were found to play a potential role in glucose degradation and EC:2.7.1.4 (fructokinase) might be involved in the fructose metabolism. Growth profile and selenite-reducing ability of SR14 under different sugar supplements were determined and the results reviewed that glucose had a better promoting effect on the reduction of selenite and growth of bacteria than fructose, sucrose, and maltose. Moreover, RT-qPCR experiment proved that glucose supplement remarkably promoted the expressions of thioredoxin, fumarate reductase, and the glutathione peroxidase in SR14. Analysis of mRNA expression showed levels of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and fructokinase significantly upregulated under the supplement of glucose. Overall, our data demonstrated the genomic characteristics of SR14 and preliminarily determined that glucose supplement was most beneficial for strain growth and SeNPs synthesis.",

Due to various environmental factors, dengue cases surged rapidly at the global level in recent decades, with 193245 cases in 2021 and an increment of 110473 cases in 2022. There is no antidote available against dengue and other flaviviruses. In the absence of a dengue vaccine or specific antiviral, medicinal plants or their products can be the only choice for its effective management. Ocimum sanctum is known as ''The Incomparable One,'' ''Mother Medicine of Nature'' and ''Queen of Herbs'' in Ayurveda, and is considered an \"elixir of life\" supreme in both healthcare and spiritual terms. In present study eugenol was isolated in O.sanctum. Eugenol (1-hydroxy-2-methoxy-4-allylbenzene) has been substantially responsible for its therapeutic potential. High-performance thin-layer chromatography, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy were applied to identify the compound. The Rf value of isolated compound was same in the chromatogram (0.69 + 0.05) with compare to standard. The safe dose of plant and eugenol were found as < 31.25 μg/ml and < 15.62 µg/ml. The anti-dengue activity was assessed in C6/36 cell lines, their effect was determined through Quantitative PCR. The NMR of the isolated eugenol showed similar properties as the commercial marker compound. The eugenol and SFE extract of O. sanctum showed the inhibition of 99.28% and completely against Dengue-2, respectively. Docking study exposed that the interaction of eugenol with NS1 and NS5 dengue protein showed the binding energy as - 5.33 and - 5.75 kcal/mol, respectively. The eugenol from the O. sanctum plant has the potential to be a good source of future treatment medications for dengue illness, as well as a valuable tool in its successful management.",

In this respect, selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) were biosynthesized using Fenugreek seeds aqueous extract. Bio-mediated SeNPs were characterized using XRD, FTIR, UV-Vis, TEM, and EDX. XRD confirmed the crystalline nature with six characteristic peaks corresponding to Se-nanocrystals. TEM showed spherical-shaped SeNPs with 34.02-63.61 nm diameter. FTIR verified the presence of different bio-functional groups, such as, N-H, O-H, C-N, and C-NH2 acting as stabilizing/reducing agents during the biosynthesis. Bio-mediated SeNPs exhibited excellent biocidal activity against F. oxysporum and F. moniliforme, with MIC of 0.25 and 1.7 mg/mL, respectively. Direct treatment of F. oxysporum with SeNPs led to significant deformation and lysis of the fungal hyphae within 18 h. The treatment of infected fruits with MIC of SeNPs reduced the infection signs by 100% and preserved the fresh-like appearance of treated fruits for 25 and 35 days when stored at 25 °C and 5 °C, respectively. Therefore, SeNPs is considered efficacious fungicidal against Fusarium spp. in-vitro and in-vivo. The treatment of tomato fruits with MIC of SeNPs positively affected its chemical properties, as well as decreased weight loss %, confirming the barrier effect of SeNPs, thus increasing fruits' shelf-life. Bio-mediated SeNPs appeared safe towards normal HSF and OEC cell lines with IC50> 300 μg/mL. Overall results recommend the usage of bio-mediated SeNPs as safe powerful bioagent against Fusarium infection, maintaining tomato quality, and providing protection from post-harvest invasion and/or destroying existing infections.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is a major threat in infectious diseases due to its varied infection types and increased resistance. S. aureus could form persister cells under certain condition and could also attach on medical apparatus to form biofilms, which exhibited extremely high resistance to antibiotics. 3-Acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA) is a well-studied anti-tumor and antioxidant drug. This study is aimed to determine the antimicrobial effects of AKBA against S. aureus and its persister cells and biofilms. The in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of AKBA was assessed by micro-dilution assay, disc diffusion assay and time-killing assay. Drug combination between AKBA and conventional antibiotics was detected by checkerboard assay. And the antibiofilm effects of AKBA against S. aureus were explored by crystal violet staining combined with SYTO/PI probes staining. Next, RBC lysis activity and CCK-8 kit were used to determine the cytotoxicity of AKBA. In addition, murine subcutaneous abscess model was used to assess the antimicrobial effects of AKBA in vivo. Our results revealed that AKBA was found to show effective antimicrobial activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) with the minimal inhibitory concentration of 4-8 µg/mL with undetectable cytotoxicity. And no resistant mutation was induced by AKBA after 20 days of consecutive passage. Further, we found that AKBA could be synergy with gentamycin or amikacin against S. aureus and its clinical isolates. By crystal violet and SYTO9/PI staining, AKBA exhibited strong biofilm inhibitory and eradication effects at the concentration of 1 ~ 4 µg/mL. In addition, the effective antimicrobial effect was verified in vivo in a mouse model. And no detectable in vivo toxicity was found. These results indicated that AKBA has great potential to development as an alternative treatment for the refractory S. aureus infections.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The industrial applications of the κ-carrageenases have been restricted by their poor thermostability. In this study, based on the folding free energy change (ΔΔG) and the flexibility analysis using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for the alkaline κ-carrageenase KCgCD from Pseudoalteromonas porphyrae (WT), the mutant S190R was identified with improved thermostability. After incubation at 50 °C for 30 min, the residual activity of S190R was 63.7%, 25.7% higher than that of WT. The T m values determined by differential scanning calorimetry were 66.2 °C and 64.4 °C for S190R and WT, respectively. The optimal temperature of S190R was 10 °C higher than that of WT. The κ-carrageenan hydrolysates produced by S190R showed higher xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity compared with the untreated κ-carrageenan. MD simulation analysis of S190R showed that the residues (V186–M194 and P196–G197) in F5 and the key residue R150 in F3 displayed the decreased flexibility, and residues of T169–N173 near the catalytic center displayed the increased flexibility. These changed flexibilities might be the reasons for the improved thermostability of mutant S190R. This study provides a useful rational design strategy of combination of ΔΔG calculation and MD simulation to improve the κ-carrageenase’s thermostability for its better industrial applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells are widely employed as host cells for biopharmaceutical production. The manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals poses several challenges, including restricted growth potential and inadequate productivity of the host cells. MicroRNAs play a crucial role in regulating gene expression and are considered highly promising tools for cell engineering to enhance protein production. Our study aimed to evaluate the effects of miR-107, which is recognized as an onco-miR, on erythropoietin-producing CHO cells (CHO-hEPO). To assess the impact of miR-107 on CHO cells, a DNA plasmid containing miR-107 was introduced to CHO-hEPO cells through transfection. Cell proliferation and viability were assessed using the trypan blue dye exclusion method. Cell cycle analysis was conducted by utilizing propidium iodide (PI) staining. The quantification of EPO was determined using an immunoassay test. Moreover, the impact of miR-107 on the expression of downstream target genes was evaluated using qRT-PCR. Our findings highlight and underscore the substantial impact of transient miR-107 overexpression, which led to a remarkable 2.7-fold increase in EPO titers and a significant 1.6-fold increase in the specific productivity of CHO cells (p &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, this intervention resulted in significant enhancements in cell viability and growth rate (p &lt; 0.05). Intriguingly, the overexpression of miR‑107 was linked to the downregulation of LATS2, PTEN, and TSC1 genes while concurrently driving upregulation in transcript levels of MYC, YAP, mTOR, and S6K genes within transgenic CHO cells. In conclusion, this study collectively underscores the feasibility of utilizing cancer-associated miRNAs as a powerful tool for CHO cell engineering. However, more in-depth exploration is warranted to unravel the precise molecular intricacies of miR-107's effects in the context of CHO cells.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The immunotherapeutic application of interleukin-2 (IL-2) in cancer treatment is limited by its off-target effects on different cell populations and insufficient activation of anti-tumor effector cells at the site of the tumor upon tolerated doses. Targeting IL-2 to the tumor microenvironment by generating antibody-cytokine fusion proteins (immunocytokine) would be a promising approach to increase efficacy without associated toxicity. In this study, a novel nanobody-based immunocytokine is developed by the fusion of a mutant (m) IL-2 with a decreased affinity toward CD25 to an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) specific nanobody, denoted as VGRmIL2-IC. The antigen binding, cell proliferation, IFN-γ-secretion, and cytotoxicity of this new immunocytokine are evaluated and compared to mIL-2 alone. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic properties are analyzed. Flow cytometry analysis shows that the VGRmIL2-IC molecule can selectively target VEGFR2-positive cells. The results reveal that the immunocytokine is comparable to mIL-2 alone in the stimulation of Primary Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) and cytotoxicity in in vitro conditions. In vivo studies demonstrate improved pharmacokinetic properties of VGRmIL2-IC in comparison to the wild or mutant IL-2 proteins. The results presented here suggest VGRmIL2-IC could be considered a candidate for the treatment of VEGFR2-positive tumors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Tuberculosis (TB) poses significant challenges due to its high transmissibility within populations and intrinsic resistance to treatment, rendering it a formidable respiratory disease with a substantial susceptibility burden. This study was designed to identify new potential therapeutic targets for TB and establish a diagnostic model. mRNA expression data for TB were from GEO database, followed by conducting differential expression analysis. The top 50 genes with differential expression were subjected to GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. To establish a PPI network, the STRING database was utilized, and hub genes were identified utilizing five algorithms (EPC, MCC, MNC, Radiality, and Stress) within the cytoHubba plugin of Cytoscape software. Furthermore, a hub gene co-expression network was constructed using the GeneMANIA database. Consistency clustering was performed on hub genes, and ssGSEA was utilized to analyze the extent of immune infiltration in different subgroups. LASSO analysis was employed to construct a diagnostic model, and ROC curves were used for validation. Through the analysis of GEO data, a total of 159 genes were identified as differentially expressed. Further, GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed that these genes were mainly enriched in viral defense, symbiotic defense, and innate immune response-related pathways. Hub genes, including DDX58, IFIT2, IFIH1, RSAD2, IFI44L, OAS2, OAS1, OASL, IFIT1, IFIT3, MX1, STAT1, and ISG15, were identified using cytoHubba analysis of the PPI network. The GeneMANIA analysis unmasked that the co-expression rate of hub genes was 81.55%, and the physical interaction rate was 12.27%. Consistency clustering divided TB patients into two subgroups, and ssGSEA revealed different degrees of immune infiltration in different subgroups. LASSO analysis identified IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFIH1, RSAD2, OAS1, OAS2, and STAT1 as eight immune-related key genes, and a diagnostic model was constructed. The ROC curve demonstrated that the model exhibited excellent diagnostic performance. DDX58, IFIT2, IFIH1, RSAD2, IFI44L, OAS2, OAS1, OASL, IFIT1, IFIT3, MX1, STAT1, and ISG15 were hub genes in TB, and the diagnostic model based on eight immune-related key genes exhibited good diagnostic performance.",

Thirty-nine endophytic bacterial strains, belonging to two phyla, five genera and sixteen species, were isolated, and Firmicutes, Bacillus and Metabacillus indicus were the dominant taxa at the phylum, genus and species level, respectively. High-throughput sequencing revealed 39 phyla and 574 genera of endophytic bacteria, and the dominant phylum was Proteobacteria, while the dominant genus was Ralstonia. The results also indicated that the endophytic bacteria of S. thunbergii included various groups with nitrogen fixation, salt tolerance, pollutant degradation, and antibacterial properties but also contained some pathogenic bacteria. Additionally, the endophytic bacterial community shared a large number of groups with the epiphytic bacteria and bacteria in the surrounding seawater, but the three groups of samples could be clustered separately. In conclusion, there are a variety of functional endophytic bacteria living in S. thunbergii, and the internal condition of algae is a selective factor for the formation of endophytic bacterial communities.

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) stands as the most common cancer type, arising from various causes, and responsible for a substantial number of cancer-related fatalities. Recent advancements in viral metagenomics have empowered scientists to delve into the intricate diversity of the virosphere, viral evolution, interactions between viruses and their hosts, and the identification of viral causes behind disease outbreaks, the development of specific symptoms, and their potential role in altering the host's physiology. The present study had the objective of \"Molecular Characterization of HBV, HCV, anelloviruses, CMV, SENV-D, SENV-H, HEV, and HPV viruses among individuals suffering from HCC.\" A total of 381 HCC patients contributed 10 cc of blood each for this study. The research encompassed the assessment of tumor markers, followed by molecular characterization of HBV, HCV, Anelloviruses (TTV, TTMV, and TTMDV), SENV-H and SENV-D viruses, HEV, CMV, and HPV, as well as histopathological examinations. The outcomes of this study revealed that majority of the HCC patients 72.4% (276/381) were male as compared to females. HCV infection, at 76.4% (291 out of 381), exhibited a significant association (p < 0.05) with HCC. Most patients displayed singular lesions in the liver, with Child Pugh Score Type B being the predominant finding in 45.2% of cases. Plasma virome analysis indicated the prevalence of TTMDV (75%), followed by TTMV (70%) and TTV (42.1%) among anelloviruses in HCC patients. Similarly, SENV-H (52%) was followed by SENV-D (20%), with co-infections at 15%. The presence of CMV and HEV among the HCC patients was recorded 5% each however 3.5% of the patients showed the presence of HPV. In conclusion, this study underscores that HCC patients serve as reservoirs for various pathogenic and non-pathogenic viruses, potentially contributing to the development, progression, and severity of the disease.",

The antibacterial potency of the postbiotic was evaluated using the agar well-diffusion method, and MIC and MBC tests were conducted for different treatments. The results of the study showed that the postbiotic prepared in food environments such as milk and cheese whey can have antibacterial and antifungal properties similar to the postbiotic prepared in the MRS culture medium. However, it is possible to enrich food matrices such as milk and cheese whey and make further adjustments in terms of pH settings. Additionally, the thermal process was able to create a nanoscale postbiotic, which is a significant achievement for the application of postbiotics in the food and pharmaceutical industries.

The present study aimed at the production, purification, and characterization of L- asparaginase from S. maltophilia EMCC2297 isolate. The microbial production of L-asparaginase by the test isolate could be increased by pre-exposure to chloramphenicol at 200 µg/ml concentration. S. maltophilia EMCC2297 L-asparaginase could be purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulphate precipitation and the purified form obtained by gel exclusion chromatography showed total activity of 96.4375 IU/ml and specific activity of 36.251 IU/mg protein. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that the purified form of the enzyme is separated at an apparent molecular weight of 17 KDa. Michaelis-Menten constant analysis showed a Km value of 4.16 × 10 − 2 M with L-asparagine as substrate and Vmax of 10.67 IU/ml.

    "abstract": "Bacterial contamination is the most prevalent infectious complication of blood transfusion in the developed world. To mitigate this, several ultraviolet light-based pathogen reduction technologies (PRTs), some of which require photo-chemicals, have been developed to minimize infection transmission. Relative to UV light, visible 405-nm light is safer and has shown potential to be developed as a PRT for the in situ treatment of ex vivo human plasma and platelet concentrates, without the need for photo-chemicals. This study investigates the effect of 405-nm light on human plasma, with focus on the compatibility of antimicrobial light doses with essential plasma clotting factors. To determine an effective antimicrobial dose that is compatible with plasma, prebagged human plasma (up to 300 mL) was seeded with common microbial contaminants and treated with increasing doses of 405-nm light (16 mW cm-2; ≤ 403 J cm-2). Post-exposure plasma protein integrity was investigated using an AOPP assay, in vitro coagulation tests, and ELISA-based measurement of fibrinogen and Protein S. Microbial contamination in 300 mL prebagged human plasma was significantly reduced (P ≤ 0.05) after exposure to ≤ 288 J cm-2, with microbial loads reduced by > 96.2%. This dose did not significantly affect the plasma protein quality parameters tested (P > 0.05). Increased doses (≥ 345 J cm-2) resulted in a 4.3% increase in clot times with no statistically significant change in protein activity or levels. Overall, this study has demonstrated that the effective microbicidal 405 light dose shows little to no negative effect on plasma quality.",

    "abstract": "Abstract α-Amylase plays a crucial role in the industrial degradation of starch. The genus Jeotgalibacillus of the underexplored marine bacteria family Caryophanaceae has not been investigated in terms of α-amylase production. Herein, we report the comprehensive analysis of an α-amylase (AmyJM) from Jeotgalibacillus malaysiensis D5 T (= DSM28777 T = KCTC33550 T ). Protein phylogenetic analysis indicated that AmyJM belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 13 subfamily 5 (GH13_5) and exhibits low sequence identity with known α-amylases, with its closest counterpart being the GH13_5 α-amylase from Bacillus sp. KSM-K38 (51.05% identity). Purified AmyJM (molecular mass of 70 kDa) is stable at a pH range of 5.5–9.0 and optimally active at pH 7.5. The optimum temperature for AmyJM is 40 °C, where the enzyme is reasonably stable at this temperature. Similar to other α-amylases, the presence of CaCl 2 enhanced both the activity and stability of AmyJM. AmyJM exhibited activity toward raw and gelatinized forms of starches and related α-glucans, generating a mixture of reducing sugars, such as glucose, maltose, maltotriose, maltotetraose, and maltopentaose. In raw starch hydrolysis, AmyJM exhibited its highest efficiency (51.10% degradation) in hydrolyzing raw wheat starch after 3-h incubation at 40 °C. Under the same conditions, AmyJM also hydrolyzed tapioca, sago, potato, rice, and corn raw starches, yielding 16.01–30.05%. These findings highlight the potential of AmyJM as a biocatalyst for the saccharification of raw starches, particularly those derived from wheat.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a commonly found Gram-negative bacterium in healthcare facilities and is renowned for its ability to form biofilms and its virulence factors that are controlled by quorum sensing (QS) systems. The increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant strains of this bacterium poses a significant challenge in the field of medicine. Consequently, the exploration of novel antimicrobial agents has become a top priority. This research aims to optimize chitosan derived from white shrimp (Metapenaeus affinis) using the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) computational approach. The objective is to investigate chitosan's potential as a solution for inhibiting QS activity and biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa ATCC 10,145. Under optimized conditions, chitin was treated with NaOH (1.41 M) for 15.75 h, HCl (7.49% vol) for 2.01 h, and at a deacetylation temperature of 81.15 °C. The resulting chitosan exhibited a degree of deacetylation (DD%) exceeding 93.98%, as confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectral analysis, indicating its high purity. The extracted chitosan demonstrated a significant synergistic antibiotic effect against P. aeruginosa when combined with ceftazidime, enhancing its bactericidal activity by up to 15-fold. In addition, sub-MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) concentrations of extracted chitosan (10 and 100 µg/mL) successfully reduced the production of pyocyanin and rhamnolipid, as well as the swimming motility, protease activity and biofilm formation ability in comparison to the control group (P < 0.05). Moreover, chitosan treatment downregulated the RhlR and LasR genes in P. aeruginosa when compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The optimized chitosan extract shows significant potential as a coating agent for surgical equipment, effectively preventing nosocomial infections caused by P. aeruginosa pathogens.",

This study was aimed to assess the effect of Moringa oleifera seeds and probiotics ( Pediococcus acidilactici BX-B122 and Bacillus coagulans BX-B118) as feed supplements on GHG production and fermentation profile from steers and sheep. The treatments included diets containing 0, 6, 12, and 18% of M. oleifera seeds meal and a mixture of probiotic bacteria (0.2 ml/g of diet). Total biogas production, CH 4 , CO, and H 2 S emission from animals (up to 48 h), rumen fermentation profile, and CH 4 conversion efficiency were recorded using standard protocols. Results showed interaction among M. oleifera seeds and probiotics on asymptotic biogas production and total biogas production up to 48 h ( P &lt; 0.05). The rate of CH 4 emission in steers was reduced from 0.1694 to 0.0447 ml/h using 6 and 18% of M. oleifera seeds ( P &lt; 0.05). Asymptotic CO and the rate of CO production were increased ( P &lt; 0.05) by supplementing different doses of M. oleifera seeds and probiotics.

Streptomyces lasso peptides have been known for their antimicrobial, anticancer, and antiviral properties. However, understanding their role in the morphology and production of secondary metabolites remains limited. We identified a previously unknown lasso peptide gene cluster in the genome of Streptomyces sp. L06. This gene cluster (LASS) produces two distinct lasso peptides, morphosin-1 and − 2. Notably, morphosin-2 is a member of a new subfamily of lasso peptides, with BGCs exhibiting a similar structure. When LASS was expressed in different Streptomyces hosts, it led to exciting phenotypic changes, including the absence of spores and damage in aerial mycelium development. In one of the hosts, LASS even triggered antibiotic formation. These findings open up a world of possibilities, suggesting the potential role of morphosins in shaping Streptomyces' morphological and biochemical development.",

Biotechnological production of EG from xylose, a pentose present in lignocellulose biomass hydrolysates, has been achieved by the engineering of bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae, and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with synthetic pathways. In the present work, the Dahms pathway was employed to construct Komagataella phaffii strains capable of producing EG from xylose. Different combinations of the four enzymes that compose the synthetic pathway, namely, xylose dehydrogenase, xylonate dehydratase, dehydro-deoxy-xylonate aldolase, and glycolaldehyde reductase, were successfully expressed in K. phaffii. Increased production of EG (1.31 g/L) was achieved by employing a newly identified xylonate dehydratase (xylD-HL). This xylonate dehydratase allowed 30% higher EG production than a previously known xylonate dehydratase (xylD-CC). Further strain engineering demonstrated that K. phaffii possesses native glycolaldehyde reduction and oxidation activities, which lead to pathway deviation from EG to glycolic acid (GA) production. Finally, cultivation conditions that favor the production of EG over GA were determined.",

The results of recent researches consider the relationship between microbiota and the immune system as a double-edged sword. Considering that the relationship between the composition of intestinal microbiota and the immunological and clinical status of the body has been confirmed, it is very important to investigate the effect of each genus and species of bacteria on the state of the immune system. The current study was determined using 16S rRNA gene sequencing to explore the 4 selected gut microbiota from 25 people suffering from rheumatism (RA group) with a time interval of at least 3 years from the onset of the disease and 25 Healthy people by real time PCR. Gut dysbiosis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is identified alongside key serological and clinical markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), immunofluorescence (IF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (Anti-CCP), white blood cell count (WBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), Platelet count (PLT), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), creatinine (Cr), and hemoglobin (Hb). Additionally, data from individuals with incomplete or unverified records were excluded from the study to ensure accuracy and reliability. Bacteroides fragilis, Roseburia faecis and Fusobacterium nucleatum genera showed a much lower median in Rheumatoid arthritis patients in comparison with healthy people (P > 0.001, p = 0.002, P < 0.001 respectively). While the difference in the median of E. coli genera was not significant in the two studied groups (p = 0.31). In such a way that the change in the Gut normal flora homeostasis and the reduction of beneficial bacteria such as Bacteroides fragilis, Roseburia faecis, Fusobacterium nucleatum genera, may stimulate the immune system to initiate autoimmunity.",

Staphylococcus aureus is a global problem due to its ability to form biofilms and resistance mechanisms. Phage endolysin is one of the most promising methods for combating antibiotic resistance. ZAM-MSC chimeric endolysin has three domains derived from SAL1 and lysostaphin, which target the peptide bridge of peptidoglycan. In this study purified ZAM-MSC (with yield of 30 mg/lit) had bactericidal activity against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) at low concentrations (2.38 μg/ml and 1.88 μg/ml, respectively). The antibacterial spectrum revealed that ZAM-MSC was active against diverse Staphylococci. it has maintained 100% stability after 24 h incubation in pH 5 to 10 against S. aureus, as well as demonstrated significant thermostability and maintained nearly its full activity at different temperatures (4–42 °C) up to 1 day of incubation. The anti-biofilm activity of various concentrations of ZAM-MSC against MSSA and MRSA biofilms was not dose-dependent, and antibiofilm activity was observed even at low concentrations (14 μg/ml). Further, the molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the ZAM-MSC chimer and its parent proteins remained dynamically stable, showing similar flexibility despite the size and hydrogen bond number differences. In conclusion, the study reveals that chimeric ZAM-MSC is a distinctive enzyme with exceptional biochemical properties and rapid lytic activity against Staphylococci.",

Protein extraction efficiency was studied at pHs between 7.6 and 10.4 and salt concentrations between 3.4 × 10 -2 and 1.2 M. The optimum extraction efficiency was pH 10.0 and 1.0 M NaCl. Napin and cruciferin were the most prevalent proteins in the isolate. The isolate exhibited high in vitro digestibility (74.9 ± 0.80%) and lysine content (5.2 ± 0.2 g/100 g of protein). No differences in the efficiency of extraction, SDS-PAGE profile, digestibility, lysine availability, or amino acid composition were observed between protein extracted with thin stillage and that extracted with NaCl solution. The use of thin stillage, in lieu of water, for protein extraction would decrease the energy requirements and waste disposal costs of the protein isolation and biofuel production processes.",

Since no maximum allowable limits are set for Alternaria toxins in food and feed, prevention of Alternaria infestations and mycotoxin spoilage is the only way to avoid health risks. Thus, the understanding of mycotoxin biosynthesis is essential. For that purpose, a reliable batch process in a 2 L bioreactor was established which enables the study of several parameters influencing the production of the mycotoxins alternariol (AOH), alternariol monomethylether (AME) and tenuazonic acid (TA) by A. alternata DSM 12633. Modified Czapek-Dox medium was used with glucose as carbon source and ammonium and nitrate as nitrogen sources. Consumption of carbon and nitrogen sources as well as formation of the three mycotoxins were monitored; the average data of five independent fermentations was plotted and fitted using a logistic equation with four parameters. Maximum mycotoxin concentrations of 3.49 ± 0.12 mg/L AOH, 1.62 ± 0.14 mg/L AME and 38.28 ± 0.1 mg/L TA were obtained. In this system the effect of different aeration rates (0.53 vvm-0.013 vvm) was tested which exerted a great influence on mycotoxin production. The use of the semi-synthetic Czapek-Dox medium allowed the exchange of carbon and nitrogen sources for acetate and aspartic acid. The use of acetate instead of glucose resulted in the sole production of alternariol whereas the exchange of ammonium and nitrate for aspartate enhanced the production of both AOH and AME while TA production was not affected.",

    "abstract": "Abstract To enhance the value-added use of methanol-containing raw glycerol derived from biodiesel fuel production, the effect of methanol supplementation on glyceric acid (GA) production by Gluconobacter spp. was investigated. We first conducted fed-batch fermentation with Gluconobacter frateurii NBRC103465 using raw glycerol as a feeding solution. GA productivity decreased with increasing dihydroxyacetone (DHA) formation when the raw glycerol contained methanol. The results of this experiment and comparative experiments using a synthetic solution modeled after the raw glycerol indicate that the presence of methanol caused a change in the concentrations of GA and DHA, two glycerol derivatives produced during fermentation. Other Gluconobacter spp. also decreased GA production in the presence of 1% ( v / v ) methanol. In addition, purified membrane-bound alcohol dehydrogenase (mADH) from Gluconobacter oxydans , which is a key enzyme in GA production, showed a decrease in dehydrogenase activity toward glycerol as the methanol concentration increased. These results strongly suggest that the observed decrease in GA production by Gluconobacter spp. resulted from the methanol-induced inhibition of mADH-mediated glycerol oxidation.",

    "abstract": "The enhanced global biodiesel production is also yielding increased quantities of glycerol as main coproduct. An effective application of glycerol, for example, as low-cost substrate for microbial growth in industrial fermentation processes to specific products will reduce the production costs for biodiesel. Our study focuses on the utilization of glycerol as a cheap carbon source during cultivation of the thermoplastic producing bacterium Ralstonia eutropha H16, and on the investigation of carbohydrate transport proteins involved herein. Seven open reading frames were identified in the genome of strain H16 to encode for putative proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate-carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PEP-PTS). Although the core components of PEP-PTS, enzyme I (ptsI) and histidine phosphocarrier protein (ptsH), are available in strain H16, a complete PTS-mediated carbohydrate transport is lacking. Growth experiments employing several PEP-PTS mutants indicate that the putative ptsMHI operon, comprising ptsM (a fructose-specific EIIA component of PTS), ptsH, and ptsI, is responsible for limited cell growth and reduced PHB accumulation (53%, w/w, less PHB than the wild type) of this strain in media containing glycerol as a sole carbon source. Otherwise, the deletion of gene H16_A0384 (ptsN, nitrogen regulatory EIIA component of PTS) seemed to largely compensate the effect of the deleted ptsMHI operon (49%, w/w, PHB). The involvement of the PTS homologous proteins on the utilization of the non-PTS sugar alcohol glycerol and its effect on cell growth as well as PHB and carbon metabolism of R. eutropha will be discussed.",

    "abstract": "There is a need to elucidate the product specific features of the metabolic stress response of the host cell to the induction of recombinant protein synthesis. For this, the method of choice is transcriptomic profiling which provides a better insight into the changes taking place in complex global metabolic networks. The transcriptomic profiles of three fed-batch cultures expressing different proteins viz. recombinant human interferon-beta (rhIFN-β), Xylanase and Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP) were compared post induction. We observed a depression in the nutrient uptake and utilization pathways, which was common for all the three expressed proteins. Thus glycerol transporters and genes involved in ATP synthesis as well as aerobic respiration were severely down-regulated. On the other hand the amino acid uptake and biosynthesis genes were significantly repressed only when soluble proteins were expressed under different promoters, but not when the product was expressed as an inclusion body (IB). High level expression under the T7 promoter (rhIFN-β and xylanase) triggered the cellular degradation machinery like the osmoprotectants, proteases and mRNA degradation genes which were highly up-regulated, while this trend was not true with GFP expression under the comparatively weaker ara promoter. The design of a better host platform for recombinant protein production thus needs to take into account the specific nature of the cellular response to protein expression.",

The 45°C heat-treated cells expressing lacZ showed maximum beta-galactosidase activity as well as chloroform/SDS-treated cells to increase membrane permeability.

The simple biocatalyst was applied for 3-HPA production by using Klebsiella pneumoniae dhaB genes. 3-HPA was stoichiometrically produced with the complete consumption of glycerol at a high production rate of 8.85 mmol 3-HPA/g dry cell/h. The amount of 3-HPA production increased by increasing the concentrations of biocatalyst and glycerol. Furthermore, it could convert biodiesel-derived crude glycerol to 3-HPA.",

The NZ2114 killed over 99.9% of tested S. suis CVCC 606 in Mueller–Hinton medium within 4 h when treated with 4 × MIC. It caused only less than 0.25% hemolytic activity in the concentration of 256 μg/ml. Additionally, NZ2114 exhibited potent in vivo activity to S. suis. All mice were survival when the dosage was low to 0.2 mg/kg. Over 99% of S. suis cells were killed within 4 h in blood, lung, liver and spleen with dosage of 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg in mice peritonitis models and no pathogen were detected after 24 h of treatment. Further, no pathological phenomenon in lung and low level of inflammatory cytokines in blood were detected.

    "abstract": "We propose an alternative GMO based strategy to obtain Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant strains with a slight reduction in their ability to produce ethanol, but with a moderate impact on the yeast metabolism. Through homologous recombination, two truncated Pdc2p proteins Pdc2pΔ344 and Pdc2pΔ519 were obtained and transformed into haploid and diploid lab yeast strains. In the pdc2Δ344 mutants the DNA-binding and transactivation site of the protein remain intact, whereas in pdc2Δ519 only the DNA-binding site is conserved. Compared to the control, the diploid BY4743pdc2Δ519 mutant strain reduced up to 7.4% the total ethanol content in lab scale-vinifications. The residual sugar and volatile acidity was not significantly affected by this ethanol reduction. Remarkably, we got a much higher ethanol reduction of 10 and 15% when the pdc2Δ519 mutation was tested in a native and a commercial wine yeast strain against their respective controls. Our results demonstrate that the insertion of the pdc2Δ519 mutation in wine yeast strains can reduce the ethanol concentration up to 1.89% (v/v) without affecting the fermentation performance. In contrast to non-GMO based strategies, our approach permits the insertion of the pdc2Δ519 mutation in any locally selected wine strain, making possible to produce quality wines with regional characteristics and lower alcohol content. Thus, we consider our work a valuable contribution to the problem of high ethanol concentration in wine.",

    "abstract": "The exploitation of rare-earth-element (REE) mines has resulted in severe ammonia nitrogen pollution and induced hazards to environments and human health. Screening microorganisms with the ammonia nitrogen-degrading ability provides a basis for bioremediation of ammonia nitrogen-polluted environments. In this study, a bacterium with the outstanding ammonia nitrogen-degrading capability was isolated from the tailings of REE mines in southern Jiangxi Province, China. This strain was identified as Burkholderia fungorum Gan-35 according to phenotypic and phylogenetic analyses. The optimal conditions for ammonia–nitrogen degradation by strain Gan-35 were determined as follows: pH value, 7.5; inoculum dose, 10%; incubation time, 44 h; temperature, 30 °C; and C/N ratio, 15:1. Strain Gan-35 degraded 68.6% of ammonia nitrogen under the optimized conditions. Nepeta cataria grew obviously better in the ammonia nitrogen-polluted soil with strain Gan-35 than that without inoculation, and the decrease in ammonia–nitrogen contents of the former was also more obvious than the latter. Besides, strain Gan-35 exhibited the tolerance to high salinities. In summary, strain Gan-35 harbors the ability of both ammonia–nitrogen degradation at high concentrations and promoting plant growth. This work has reported a Burkholderia strain with the ammonia nitrogen-degrading capability for the first time and is also the first study on the isolation of a bacterium with the ammonia nitrogen-degrading ability from the tailings of REE mines. The results are useful for developing an effective method for microbial remediation of the ammonia nitrogen-polluted tailings of REE mines.",

    "abstract": "Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury mainly occurs following hepatic resection and liver transplantation and cause severe liver damage, organ injuries, and dysfunction. Pro-inflammatory cytokines that promote injury are released when kupffer cell activates after getting induced by I/R. Repercussions of oxidative stress and cardiac function against isoproterenol based myocardial infarction are caused by flavonol glycosides which are found in high concentrations in Inula racemosa (Ir).The root was deemed to have analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects, and no report has been published about the liver-protective activity against hepatic I/R. Therefore, the present study was aimed to understand the therapeutic impact of Ir in hepatic I/R injury. Male albino, Wistar strain rats were used and were grouped into four total phenolic content, free radical scavenging activity and serum enzymes were determined. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis were also carried out. Inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL-6) and protein expression of p53, bax, and bcl-2 were determined. The administration of extracts of Ir significantly increased total phenolic and free radical scavenging activity. Altered cellular morphology, cytokines and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were returned to near normal level. IL-6 and TNF-α levels were reduced more than 25% following treatment. Also, the protein expression of p53, bax, and bcl-2 were also returned to near normal level. Taking all these data together, it is suggested that the extracts of Ir may be a potential therapeutic agent for providing several beneficial effects in hepatic I/R injury.",

Compared to the parent strain, the expression of VHb increased the glucose consumption rate of the transformant. Moreover, in cellulase-inducing medium total protein secretion of the VHb expressing strain was 2.2-fold of the parental strain and the filter paper cellulase activity was increased by 58% under oxygen-limiting conditions. In summary, our results demonstrate that VHb has beneficial effects on improving total protein secretion and cellulase activity of T. reesei in submerged fermentation.",

Thus K. marxianus has great potential for engineering to produce various materials under aerobic cultivation conditions. In this study, we engineered K. marxianus to produce and secrete a single-chain antibody (scFv), a product that is highly valuable but has historically proven difficult to generate at large scale. scFv production was obtained with strains carrying either plasmid-borne or genomically integrated constructs using various combinations of promoters (P MDH1 or P ACO1 ) and secretion signal peptides (KmINUss or Scα-MFss). As the wild-type K. marxianus secretes endogenous inulinase predominantly, the corresponding INU1 gene was disrupted using a Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR)-associated protein (CRISPR-Cas9) system to re-direct resources to scFv production. Genomic integration was used to replace INU1 with sequences encoding a fusion of the INU1 signal peptide to scFv; the resulting construct yielded the highest scFv production among the strains tested. Optimization of growth conditions revealed that scFv production by this strain was enhanced by incubation at 30 °C in xylose medium containing 200 mM MgSO4. These results together demonstrate that K. marxianus has the potential to serve as a host strain for antibody production.",

The newly developed method is based on the fluorescence enhancement by a new chelating agent, which forms a complex with EuCl3 and DPA. The results showed that 1,2-cyclohexanediamine-N,N,N'N'-tetraacetic acid (CyDTA) greatly enhanced the fluorescence intensity in all selected chelating agents. The optimal composition of the fluorescence complex DPA-Eu-CyDTA had a detection limit of 0.3 nM of DPA. Metal ions in high concentrations, including Cu2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Al3+, and Zn2+, might lower the detection sensitivity, which could be eliminated by diluting the sample with the metal ions below 10 μM. The maximum release of DPA was achieved by heating treatments at 121 °C for at least 10 min for two types of Bacillus endospores. The spore concentrations and corresponding released DPA fluorescence intensities were linearly associated (coefficient R2 = 0.9993 and 0.9995 for Bacillus subtilis MA139 and Bacillus licheniformis BL20386, respectively). The detection limit for both strains reached approximately 6800 spores/mL.

In this study, expression optimization of cholesterol oxidase from Streptomyces sp. SA-COO was investigated in Escherichia coli host strains. Various parameters that may influence the yield of a recombinant enzyme were evaluated individually. The optimal host strain, culture media, induction time, Isopropyl ß-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside concentration, as well as post-induction incubation time and temperature were determined in a shaking flask mode. Applying the optimized protocol, the production of recombinant cholesterol oxidase was significantly enhanced from 3.2 to 158 U/L. Under the optimized condition, the enzyme was produced on a large-scale, and highly expressed cholesterol oxidase was purified from cell lysate by column nickel affinity chromatography. Km and Vmax values of the purified enzyme for cholesterol were estimated using Lineweaver-Burk plot. Further, the optimum pH and optimum temperature for the enzyme activity were also determined. We report a straightforward and easy protocol for cholesterol oxidase production which can be performed in any laboratory.",

    "abstract": "The effects of packaging atmosphere, storage temperature and oregano essential oil (EO) on growth of Listeria monocytogenes on ready-to-eat smoked turkey were studied. Smoked turkey slices were inoculated with a strain of Listeria monocytogenes Scott A (5.95, 5.28 and 5.26 log CFU/g) then vacuum packaged (VP), modified atmosphere packaging (MAP: 40% CO2 and 60% N2) and MAP with oregano essential oil (MAPEO), respectively. The treated slices were then stored at 0, 5, 10 and 15 °C for 179.88 days and the L. monocytogenes Scott A's growth and microbial shelf life were monitored. The combination of MAP or MAPEO and storage temperature did not allow growth of L. monocytogenes higher than log 1 CFU/g during all storage periods. While in VP temperature combinations, the multiplication of bacteria were ≥ 1 log CFU/g. In VP, MAP and MAPEO smoked turkey, the growth of L. monocytogenes increased regardless of storage temperature. In MAPEO samples the inoculum in the product was suppressed by ca. 5 log CFU/g at 0, 10 and 15 °C at 180, 117 and 81 days of storage, respectively. The inhibition of L. monocytogenes in ready-to-eat smoked turkey by the combinations of MAP and MAPEO was enhanced by storage at 0 or 5 °C. The MAPEO system can be used effectively to control growth of pathogen in processed food when maintaining fixed temperature measures is difficult.",

L-Glycine and L-alanine are acted as sole carbon and nitrogen sources for acidogenic bacteria. One amino acid is oxidized and another one is reduced for acetate production via pyruvate by oxidative deamination process in the Stickland reactions. Herein, we have developed a kinetic model for the Stickland reactions-coupled methanogenesis (SRCM) and simulated objectively to maximize the rate of methane production. We collected the metabolic information from enzyme kinetic parameters for amino acid catabolism of Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 and methanogenesis of Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A. The SRCM model of this study consisted of 18 reactions and 61 metabolites with enzyme kinetic parameters derived experimental data. The internal or external metabolic flux rate of this system found to control the acidogenesis and methanogenesis in a methanogenic culture. Using the SRCM model, flux distributions were calculated for each reaction and metabolite in order to maximize the methane production rate from the glycine-alanine pair. Results of this study, we demonstrated the metabolic behavior, metabolite pairing while mutually interact, and advantages of syntrophic metabolism of amino acid-directed methane production in a methanogenic starter culture.",

    "abstract": "Classical swine fever (CSF) is a contagious disease that causes a high mortality to domestic and wild pigs. Its causative agent is an enveloped Pestivirus named Classical Swine Fever Virus (CSFV). Due to the huge economic affectations produced by this disease to porcine industry, several vaccines have been developed using principally the CSFV E2 glycoprotein. Recently, a subunit vaccine based on this structural protein of the CSFV fused to the porcine CD154 molecule as immunomodulator named E2-CD154 was assayed by us. This chimeric protein was produced in the Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK-293) cell line. In this work, the growth and the expression profiles of HEK-293 E2-CD154 cells in four commercially available culture media were studied. The oligosaccharide structures in the N-glycosylation patterns of the E2-CD154 protein produced by this cell line in 10 L fermenters with two different culture media were also analyzed. In addition, the neutralizing antibody response generated in mice vaccinated with these antigens was assayed. Our results suggest that the culture media CDM4HEK293 and SFM4HEK293 which are recommended for HEK-293 growth are the best choice to growth the cell clone expressing the E2-CD154 protein. The glycosylation pattern and the neutralizing antibody response generated by the E2-CD154 protein were independent of the culture medium used which demonstrates the high reproducibility and consistency among protein batches produced by HEK-293 cells even in different culture conditions.",

By microscopy, the hyphae, chlamydospores and spores produced by S. indica were observed in roots cortex of L. multiflorum seedlings. In comparison with the non-inoculated seedlings, seedlings inoculated with X. badius and S. indica showed significant increase in growth parameters with plant height, basal diameter, biomass accumulation, relative growth rate, leaf relative water content and chlorophyll content. Also, we found that seedlings inoculated with S. indica exhibited a greater growth-promotion as compared with X. badius-inoculated seedlings. No significant influence of the two fungus application has been observed with respect to seed germination. It suggested that well establishments of mutualistic symbiosis between L. multiflorum and X. badius or S. indica were not so essential to seed germination but contributed highly to the survival and growth of the seedlings.",

In this study, the relationship amongst the phytoplankton species composition and abiotic environmental factors on seasonal changes in the community composition of free-living and attached bacteria in Lake Erhai were studied. Using Illumina high-throughput sequencing, we found that the impact of environmental factors on both the free-living and attached bacterial community composition was greater than that of the phytoplankton community, amongst which total phosphorus, Secchi disk, water temperature, dissolved oxygen and conductivity strongly influenced bacterial community composition. Microcystis blooms associated with subdominant Psephonema occurred during the summer and autumn, and Fragilaria , Melosira and Mougeotia were found at high densities in the other seasons. Only small numbers of algal species-specific bacteria, including Xanthomonadaceae ( Proteobacteria ) and Alcaligenaceae ( Betaproteobacteria ), were tightly coupled to Microcystis and Psephonema during Microcystis blooms. Redundancy analysis showed that although the composition of the bacterial communities was controlled by species composition mediated by changes in phytoplankton communities and abiotic environmental factors, the impact of the abiotic environment on both free-living and attached bacterial community compositions were greater than the impact of the phytoplankton community. These results suggest that the species composition of both free-living and attached bacterial communities are affected by abiotic environmental factors, even when under strong control by biotic factors, particularly dominant genera of Microcystis and Psephonema during algal blooms.",

    "abstract": "Cordyceps cicadae is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine for treating palpitations and eye diseases. It contains several bioactive compounds such as adenosine, N6-(2-hydroxyethyl)-adenosine (HEA), and polysaccharide. Those bioactive compounds have been reported to perform anti-oxidation and anti-inflammatory properties and provide renal protection. In this study, we researched different fermentation conditions in order to enhance the biomass, adenosine, HEA, and polysaccharide productions of C. cicadae NTTU 868. Solid fermentation was carried out with different grain substrates (barley, oat, rice and wheat). Various submerged fermentation scales were used to produce the C. cicadae NTTU 868 mycelium. The results of solid fermentation revealed that C. cicadae NTTU 868 produced higher adenosine and HEA concentrations in oat rather than in other substrates. C. cicadae NTTU 868 mycelium had obtained the highest concentrations of adenosine and HEA on Day 2 as using the small-scale submerged fermentation. Furthermore, potato dextrose broth with extra 0.2% of yeast extract was able to result in higher HEA concentration. In conclusion, using submerged fermentation to culture C. cicadae NTTU 868 resulted in more efficient adenosine, HEA, and polysaccharide productions than using solid-fermentation, especially when 0.2% of yeast extract was used in the PDB. Importantly, this can be easily scaled-up in the fermentation industry.",

In this study, a newly developed lipophilic fluorescent dye LipidGreen1 was used to quantify intracellular PHB. LipidGreen1 stained viable colonies by adding the dye into the medium which enabled the effective selection of PHB-positive cells. Furthermore, the fluorescence intensity of LipidGreen1 maintained its fluorescence intensity much longer than that of Nile red. The fluorescence intensities of intracellular PHB stained by LipidGreen1 accurately agreed with PHB contents measured by gas chromatography. In addition, internalization of LipidGreen1 in Escherichia coli cell was not necessary to obtain quantitative measurements. PHB-synthase mutants were differentiated by fluorescence intensities with a good correlation to increased levels of PHB production. These results show that LipidGreen1 is sensitive and accurate in high-throughput screening of newly isolated and genetically modified bacteria with enhanced PHB production.",

    "abstract": "Microbial biotechnology and biotransformations promise to diversify the scope of the biorefinery approach for the production of high-value products and biofuels from industrial, rural and municipal waste feedstocks. In addition to bio-based chemicals and metabolites, microbial biomass itself constitutes an obvious but overlooked by-product of existing biofermentation systems which warrants fuller attention. The probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii is used to treat gastrointestinal disorders and marketed as a human health supplement. Despite its relatedness to S. cerevisiae that is employed widely in biotechnology, food and biofuel industries, the alternative applications of S. boulardii are not well studied. Using a biorefinery approach, we compared the bioethanol and biomass yields attainable from agriculturally-sourced grass juice using probiotic S. boulardii (strain MYA-769) and a commercial S. cerevisiae brewing strain (Turbo yeast). Maximum product yields for MYA-769 (39.18 [±2.42] mg ethanol mL(-1) and 4.96 [±0.15] g dry weight L(-1)) compared closely to those of Turbo (37.43 [±1.99] mg mL(-1) and 4.78 [±0.10] g L(-1), respectively). Co-production, marketing and/or on-site utilisation of probiotic yeast biomass as a direct-fed microbial to improve livestock health represents a novel and viable prospect for rural biorefineries. Given emergent evidence to suggest that dietary yeast supplementations might also mitigate ruminant enteric methane emissions, the administration of probiotic yeast biomass could also offer an economically feasible way of reducing atmospheric CH4.",

Application of continuous fermentation of a mixture of glucose and xylose and in situ acid removal by reverse electro enhanced dialysis (REED) was investigated as a method to alleviate potassium and end-product inhibition and consequently enhance the sugar consumption rates and butyric acid productivity. It was found that glucose and xylose were not inhibitory up to a concentration of 50 and 37 g L−1 respectively, and that they were consumed at comparable rates when fermented alone. However, continuous fermentation of a mixture of glucose and xylose resulted in a significantly decreased xylose consumption rate compared to that of glucose alone, supporting the conclusion that C. tyrobutyricum has a lower affinity for xylose than for glucose. Potassium ions negatively affected the effective maximum growth rate of C. tyrobutyricum at concentrations higher than 5 g L−1 exhibiting a non-competitive type of inhibition. Continuous fermentation of a glucose and xylose mixture with simultaneous acid removal by REED resulted in a two to threefold increase of the glucose consumption rate, while the xylose consumption rate was enhanced sixfold compared to continuous fermentation without in situ acid removal. Similarly, butyric acid productivity was enhanced by a factor of 2–3, while the yield remained unaffected.",

    "abstract": "The proteinase K subfamily enzymes, thermophilic Aqualysin I (AQN) from Thermus aquaticus YT-1 and psychrophilic serine protease (VPR) from Vibrio sp. PA-44, have six and seven salt bridges, respectively. To understand the possible significance of salt bridges in the thermal stability of AQN, we prepared mutant proteins in which amino acid residues participating in salt bridges common to proteinase K subfamily members and intrinsic to AQN were replaced to disrupt the bridges one at a time. Disruption of a salt bridge common to proteinase K subfamily enzymes in the D183N mutant resulted in a significant reduction in thermal stability, and a massive change in the content of the secondary structure was observed, even at 70°C, in the circular dichroism (CD) analysis. These results indicate that the common salt bridge Asp183-Arg12 is important in maintaining the conformation of proteinase K subfamily enzymes and suggest the importance of proximity between the regions around Asp183 and the N-terminal region around Arg12. Of the three mutants that lack an AQN intrinsic salt bridge, D212N was more prone to unfolding at 80°C than the wild-type enzyme. Similarly, D17N and E237Q were less thermostable than the wild-type enzyme, although this may be partially due to increased autolysis. The AQN intrinsic salt bridges appear to confer additional thermal stability to this enzyme. These findings will further our understanding of the factors involved in stabilizing protein structure.",

In particular, after the typical paper recycling loop, the newspaper waste (NW) could be further valorized as feedstock in biorefinering industry since it still contains up to 70 % polysaccharides. In this study, two different physicochemical methods—ammonia fiber expansion (AFEX) and extractive ammonia (EA) were tested for the pretraetment of NW. Furthermore, based on the previously demonstrated ability of the recombinant enzymes endocellulase rCelStrep, α-l-arabinofuranosidase rPoAbf and its evolved variant rPoAbf F435Y/Y446F to improve the saccharification of different lignocellulosic pretreated biomasses (such as corn stover and Arundo donax), in this study these enzymes were tested for the hydrolysis of pretreated NW, with the aim of valorizing the lignocellulosic fractions of the MSW. In particular, a mixture of purified enzymes containing cellulases, xylanases and accessory hemicellulases, was chosen as reference mix and rCelStrep and rPoAbf or its variant were replaced to EGI and Larb. The results showed that these enzymatic mixes are not suitable for the hydrolysis of NW after AFEX or EA pretreatment. On the other hand, when the enzymes rCelStrep, rPoAbf and rPoAbf F435Y/Y446F were tested for their effect in hydrolysis of pretreated NW by addition to a commercial enzyme mixture, it was shown that the total polysaccharides conversion yield reached 37.32 % for AFEX pretreated NW by adding rPoAbf to the mix whilst the maximum sugars conversion yield for EA pretreated NW was achieved 40.80 % by adding rCelStrep. The maximum glucan conversion yield obtained (45.61 % for EA pretreated NW by adding rCelStrep to the commercial mix) is higher than or comparable to those reported in recent manuscripts adopting hydrolysis conditions similar to those used in this study.",

Former use of the herbicide 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile (dichlobenil) has caused pollution of ground and surface water resources by the stable degradation product 2,6-dichlorobenzamide (BAM) in several parts of Europe, which has resulted in the costly closure of several drinking water wells. One strategy for preventing this in future is bioaugmentation using bacterial degraders. BAM-degrading Aminobacter sp. MSH1 was therefore formulated into dried beads and tests undertaken to establish their potential for use in the remediation of polluted soil, sand and water. The formulation procedure included freeze drying, combined with trehalose addition for cell wall protection, thus ensuring a high amount of viable cells following prolonged storage at room temperature. The beads were round-shaped pellets with a diameter of about 1.25 mm, a dry matter content of approximately 95 % and an average viable cell content of 4.4 × 109 cells/g bead. Formulated MSH1 cells led to a similar, and frequently even faster, BAM mineralisation (20–65 % 14CO2 produced from 14C-labelled BAM) in batch tests conducted with sand, water and different soil moisture contents compared to adding free cells. Furthermore, the beads were easy to handle and had a shelf life of several months.",

    "abstract": "Extractive fermentation in a nonionic surfactant aqueous solution provides a promising and efficient method to produce Monascus pigments. The behaviour of pigment secretion during the extractive cultivation was investigated in the present work. The results revealed that the secretion of intracellular pigment was limited by its saturation concentration in the nonionic surfactant aqueous solution. The intracellular pigment was completely extracted to the outside of the cell at a low cell density and high concentration of Triton X-100 (TX) in fermentation broth; otherwise, a restriction for pigment extraction would occur. The decrement of the intracellular orange and yellow pigments was inconsistent with the increment of extracellular pigments with an increase in the TX concentration. It could be inferred that the intracellular orange pigment was converted to extracellular yellow pigment during the transmembrane secretion process, which might be attributed to the enzyme catalysis in the non-aqueous phase solution. This study helps explain the mechanism of variation of pigment characteristic and extraction capacity in extractive fermentation.",

The first set of breakthrough experiment was performed for a laboratory sand column using leaching solutions of deionized water and mineral salt medium (MSM) of 200 mM with reference to KCl solution by employing Pseudomonas putida as a model bacterium. In the second set of experiment, the ionic strengths of leaching solutions immediately after bacterial pulse were lowered to tenfold and 100-fold diluted system (2 and 20 mM MSM) to focus on the influence of physicochemical factor. Results have shown that bacterial retention occurred in the sand column due to the physical deposition and physicochemical attachment. The physicochemical attachment was attributed to the high ionic strength (200 mM MSM) of leaching solution and the formation of primary energy minimum. Replacing the 200 mM leaching solution with the lower ionic strengths after pulse resulted in the increased tailing of breakthrough curve due to the detachment from the attached bacteria. The detachment could be well explained by DLVO theory, which showed the formation of energy barrier and disappearance of the secondary minimum as the ionic strength gradually decreased. Analysis of mass recovery revealed that 12-20% of the attachment was due to physical and physicochemical attachment, respectively, where the latter consisted of 25-75% of irreversible and reversible attachment respectively.",

Until today they are mostly produced from corresponding aldoses using strong chemical oxidizing agents. An environmentally friendly and more selective process could be achieved by using natural resources such as seaweed or pectin as raw material. These contain large amounts of uronic acids as major constituents such as glucuronic acid and galacturonic acid which can be converted into the corresponding aldaric acids via an enzyme-based oxidation using uronate dehydrogenase (Udh). The Udh from Agrobacterium tumefaciens (UdhAt) features the highest catalytic efficiency of all characterized Udhs using glucuronic acid as substrate (829 s−1 mM−1). Unfortunately, it suffers from poor thermostability. To overcome this limitation, we created more thermostable variants using semi-rational design. The amino acids for substitution were chosen according to the B factor in combination with four additional knowledge-based criteria. The triple variant A41P/H101Y/H236K showed higher kinetic and thermodynamic stability with a T 50 15 value of 62.2 °C (3.2 °C improvement) and a ∆∆GU of 2.3 kJ/mol compared to wild type.

While none of vaginal swabs were positive for N. gonorrhoeae and T. pallidum, 18.8% (25/133) of the swabs were positive for Chlamydia spp. and 17.3% of the swabs (23/133) were positive for Mycoplasma species.

In China, most hospitals do not detect C. trachomatis and Mycoplasma spp. in women with sexually transmitted infections and fertility problems. This study strongly suggests that C. trachomatis and Mycoplasma spp. should be routinely tested in women with sexually transmitted infections and infertility in China, and that antimicrobial resistance of these organisms should be monitored.

The wild S. bambusicola is endangered due to its harsh breeding conditions and long growth cycle. It is one of the effective ways to utilize the resources sustainably to produce hypocrellin by fermentation of S. bambusicola. PB90 is a protein elicitor isolated from Phytophthora boehmeriae to induce the useful metabolites production in fungi. In this work, PB90 was selected to promote the synthesis hypocrellin by S. bambusicola. To evaluate the effect of PB90 on S. bambusicola, it was found that the induced cells showed decreased biomass, increased cell wall permeability, rapid induction of secondary metabolites, and significant increase of some enzyme activities, which confirmed a strong activation of phenylalanine/flavonoid pathways. Studies on signal molecules and gene expression level in S. bambusicola treated with PB90 have found that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nitric oxide (NO) are necessary signal molecules involved in the synthesis of hypocrellin in elicited cells, and increased their signal levels through mutual reaction. We have showed for the first time, the response mechanism of hypocrellin biosynthesis from S. bambusicola to PB90, which may be not only establish a theoretical foundation for the application of PB90 to the mass production of S. bambusicola, but can also motivate further research on the application of PB90 to the conservation and sustainable utilization of other medical fungi.",

By analyzing the genome, we identified six genes that code for proteins with a Phasin_2 domain. To understand the role of A. brasilense Sp7 PhaP1 (PhaP1 Abs ) on PHB synthesis, the phaP1 gene (AMK58_RS17065) was deleted. The morphology of the PHB granules was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the PHB produced was quantified under three different C:N ratios in cultures subjected to null or low-oxygen transfer. The results showed that PhaP1 Abs is involved in PHB granules morphology and in controlling early biopolymer accumulation. Using RT-PCR it was found that phasin genes, except phaP4 , are transcribed in accordance with the C:N ratio used for the growth of A. brasilense. phaP1 , phaP2 and phaP3 genes were able to respond to the growth conditions tested.

The cells of A . citreus remained viable in medium up to 40 g caprolactam/l. The degradation of 10 g caprolactam/l by A. citreus , when supplied as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen lead to the formation of 6-aminocaproic acid which was detected in broth and there was also an increase in the ammonium content. One of the other metabolites found to consistently accumulate in extracellular medium during the utilization of caprolactam by A. citreus was glutamic acid, though not reported in case of other caprolactam-degrading bacteria. A. citreus could metabolise caprolactam to form non toxic products such as 6-aminocaproic acid and glutamic acid which are amino acids of physiological and commercial importance. In the presence of 6-aminocaproic acid, the rate of caprolactam utilization by A. citreus was decreased but not inhibited and the viable count of cells was found to increase using both the substrates simultaneously.

Its powerful biocontrol function is inseparable from its successful colonization of poplar trees. Bacterial biofilms can ensure the long-term colonization of a host. To explore the mechanism of action of biofilms in the biocontrol process, we manipulated various exogenous factors to explore the morphology of the JK-SH007 biofilm in vitro. The addition of glycerol and MgSO4 to TSB medium stimulated biofilm production, increased the resistance of JK-SH007 to disease, enhanced the survival of JK-SH007 in nutrient-poor environments and maintained the antagonistic ability of JK-SH007 against the poplar canker pathogen. Therefore, we constructed and optimized a biofilm-forming system to produce a large number of stable JK-SH007 biofilms. The optimized system showed that the optimal incubation time for JK-SH007 biofilm formation was 14 h, the optimal temperature of the static culture was 25 °C, and the optimal pH was 5. The optimal medium for biofilm formation was TSB medium, 1% glycerol and 50 mM MgSO4. RT-qPCR experiments showed that an increase in the expression of the suhB gene promoted JK-SH007 biofilm formation, while an increase in the expression level of the ropN gene inhibited JK-SH007 biofilm formation. The possible mechanism by which JK-SH007 was inhibited by biofilm formation under natural culture was revealed. These results indicate the importance of adding nutrients to JK-SH007 biocides produced on a commercial scale. This is the first report of JK-SH007 producing a long-lasting biofilm that guarantees antagonism.",

Here, VNP was utilized as a delivery vehicle of the anti-tumor protein Lipidated azurin, Laz, which is produced by the meningitis-causing bacterium Neisseria meningitides . In brain cancer cells, Laz has been demonstrated to induce apoptosis through an interaction with the tumor suppressor protein p53. In this study, the laz gene, including its signal sequence, was cloned downstream of a hypoxia inducible promoter (HIP-1), before being electroporated into VNP. Successful ectopic expression and export of the Laz protein by VNP under hypoxic conditions were confirmed by Western blot analysis of the cell-free culture medium. Effective expression of Laz by VNP was investigated in two glioblastoma cell lines: LN-229 and U-373, with the latter line carrying a mutated version of p53; as well as in the breast cancer line MCF-7. Cytotoxicity of the VNP-Laz was assessed by determining the fluorescence of the apoptotic marker caspases 3/7. Compared to the purified Laz, VNP-Laz, significantly induced apoptosis in MCF-7, LN-229 and, to a much lower extent in U-373 cells, suggesting a p53-linked mechanism.

Here, we describe a simple and rapid protein purification strategy in which the SUMO tag and Ulp1 protease are surface-displayed separately on Escherichia coli cells. After protein induction, the cells are harvested, resuspended in cleavage buffer, and incubated together for cleavage. In this approach, the surface-displayed Ulp1 cleaves the membrane-anchored SUMO fusion protein, resulting in the release of the target protein from the C-terminal of SUMO into the solution. The bacterial cells harboring SUMO and Ulp1 on their surfaces can be easily removed by centrifugation. To evaluate the purification method, we used red fluorescent protein (mCherry). Purified mCherry protein (7.72 ± 1.05 mg from 1 L of bacterial culture) was obtained after only 30 min of incubation. The protein purity was higher than 80%, and could be further improved (&gt; 90%) by simple ultrafiltration. This study offers a promising and simple strategy for the purification of recombinant protein in its native form that requires only cleavage and centrifugation steps.",

Set up for transfection, semi-solid media optimization, mini-pool screening, and single cell cloning media development were performed, and final clones were obtained with higher productivity in fed-batch culture mode using rich formulated media comparing with lean formulated media. Developed methods may remove the requirements for cell adaptation to production media after cell line development, and relieve the clonality issues associated with changing the culture media.

The coupling of multiple enzymes has been shown to increase the biosynthetic product yield. Different clustering strategies have particular advantages as the spatial organization of multiple enzymes creates biocatalytic cascades with a higher efficiency of biochemical reaction. However, there are also some drawbacks, such as misfolding and the variable stability of interaction domains, which may differ between particular biosynthetic reactions and the host organism. Here, we compared different protein-based clustering strategies, including direct fusion, fusion mediated by intein, and noncovalent interactions mediated through small coiled-coil dimer-forming domains. The clustering of enzymes through orthogonally designed coiled-coil interaction domains increased the production of resveratrol in Escherichia coli more than the intein-mediated fusion of biosynthetic enzymes. The improvement of resveratrol production correlated with the stability of the coiled-coil dimers. The coiled-coil fusion-based approach also increased mevalonate production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , thus demonstrating the wider applicability of this strategy.",

    "abstract": "Affected by the inner properties and the external environmental conditions, medicinal and edible lotus seeds are susceptible to mildew with fungal infection under suitable temperature and humidity conditions, leading to the production and contamination of various mycotoxins, along with threats to its quality and safety. In this study, the changes of water content (Cw) and water activity (Aw) of lotus seeds stored at 25 °C and different relative humidity conditions, as well as the correlation between them and mildew of this edible and medicinal material were studied, aiming to explore the safe Cw and Aw control points for screening out the suitable storage conditions from mildew. Blank (without fungal conidia) and experimental (artificially added with Aspergillus flavus conidia) groups of lotus seeds were stored at 25 °C and relative humidity of 40%, 50%, 60% and 70% for about 30 days, respectively. The mildew was observed and the changes of Cw, Aw, together with the production of aflatoxins were measured. Results showed that no mildew was found and aflatoxins were not detected in lotus seeds when they were stored for 30 days at 25 °C and relative humidity of 40%, 50% and 60% with Cw < 12% and Aw < 0.6. While, when the relative humidity was up to 70%, the Cw and Aw values rose quickly, and the Cw exceeded the officially-permitted level (14%). Although no mildew was observed, AFB1 was still detected, increasing the potential risk of lotus seeds regarding aflatoxins. For warranting the quality with economic and safe storage, lotus seeds are suggested to be stored at 25 °C and relative humidity lower than 60% with 12% and 0.6 as the safe Cw and Aw control points, respectively, to prevent medicinal and edible products from mildew and the contamination of aflatoxins.",

    "abstract": "Glaucoma is well-known clinical eye conditions that damage the optic nerve due to abnormal pressure conditions in eye. Hesperidin is well-known glycoside widely present in the citrus fruits, and its aglycone form is known as hesperetin. Hesperidin is major flavone found in orange fruits. Hypotensive effect of hesperidin in acute and chronic glaucoma rats, glutamate level in vitreous humour and glutathione (GSH) level in aqueous humour were determined following 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg of hesperidin treatment. Acetazolamide (5 mg/kg) was used as positive control. Hesperidin treatment significantly reduced the increased intraocular pressure (IOP) level in dextrose induced ocular hypertension than saline treated rats. The effect of hesperidin was comparable to the positive control acetazolamide. Similarly, hesperidin treatment significantly reduced the IOP level in prednisolone acetate induced ocular hypertension than saline treated rats. In the aqueous humour, hesperidin treatment increased the glutathione level 125%, 184.4% and 231.2% at 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg of hesperidin respectively. In the vitreous humour, hesperidin treatment reduced the glutamate level 9.9%, 13.2% and 25.3% at 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg of hesperidin respectively. Histopathological analysis of normal saline treated rats showed morphological alteration in ciliary bodies. However, rats treated with hesperidin showed the reduced level of morphological alteration in ciliary bodies. Taking all these data together, it is suggested that the hesperidin supplementation was effective against glaucoma in experimental rats.",

It is controversial whether biogas plants might harbor some pathogenic clostridial species, which represent a biological risk. Moreover, the inhabitance of Clostridium hard-cheese spoiling species in anaerobic digesters can be problematic for hard-cheese manufacturing industries, due to the issue of cheese blowing defects. This study investigated the effect of mesophilic anaerobic digestion processes on the Clostridium consortia distribution over time. Specifically, three lab-scale CSTRs treating agricultural biomass were characterized by considering both the whole microbial community and the cultivable clostridial spores. It is assessed an overall reduction of the Clostridium genus during the anaerobic digestion process. Moreover, it was evidenced a slight, but steady decrease of the cultivable clostridial spores, mainly represented by two pathogenic species, C . perfringens and C. bifermentans , and one hard-cheese spoiling species, C. butyricum . Thus, it is revealed an overall reduction of the clostridial population abundance after the mesophilic anaerobic digestion treatment of agricultural biomass.",

Garcinone-E is one among most active xanthones showing potential anticancer activity against various human cancer cell lines. Therefore, the current study was performed to explore the anticancer potency of naturally occurring garcinone-E xanthone against human HeLa cervical cancer cells. The underlying mechanism of action was also tried to be explored via testifying its induction of programmed cell death, arrest of cell cycle, suppression of cell migration, cell invasion and cell adhesion. MTT assay was implemented to estimate the viability of HeLa cells after garcinone-E exposure and clonogenic assay was used to analyze the effect on clonogenic potential. Acridine orange/ethidium bromine (AO/EB) staining assay was performed for monitoring of programmed cell death along with western blotting. Flow cytometric studies were carried out to analyze cell cycle check points. Transwell chambers assays were carried out for studying the impact of garcinone-E on migration and invasion potency of HeLa cells. Western blotting was used to study the expressions of apoptosis linked proteins in HeLa cells. Results indicated that garcinone-E remarkably decreased the viability to minimum in HeLa cells in both dose and time-reliant manner. The clonogenic capacity of HeLa cells was efficiently reduced by garcinone exposure. AO/EB staining showed that the anti-viability action of garcinone-E was apoptosis allied which was supported by western blotting as well. The cell cycle check points study indicated cell cycle arrest at G2/M-phase. HeLa cell migration and invasion were reduced efficiently after being subjected to garcinone-E treatment in a dose reliant fashion. In conclusion, garcinone-E has a remarkable potential to act as anti-cervical cancer chemopreventive provided further in vivo studies are required.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) have gained increased attention among researchers in both academic and industrial fields owing to simple production in E. coli. The E. coli periplasm has been the site of choice for the expression of scFv molecules due to its oxidizing milieu facilitating correctly formation of disulfide bonds. Hence, the recovery of high-yield and biologically active species from the periplasmic space is a critical step at beginning of downstream processing. TES (Tris/EDTA/Sucrose) as a simple and efficient extraction method has been frequently used but under varied extraction conditions, over literature. This study, for the first time, aimed to interrogate the effects of four independent variables (i.e., Tris–HCl concentration, buffer’s pH, EDTA concentration, and incubation time) and their potential interactions on the functional extraction yield of an scFv antibody from the periplasmic space of E. coli . The results indicated that the Tris–HCl concentration and pH are the most significant variables in the TES method and displayed a positive effect at their lower values on the functional extraction yield. Besides, the statistical analysis revealed 4 significant interactions between different variables. Here is the first report on the successful application of a design of experiment based on a central composite design to establish a generic and optimal TES extraction condition. Accordingly, an optimal condition for TES extraction of scFv molecules from the periplasm of HB2151 at the exponential phase was developed as follows: 50 mM Tris–HCl at pH 7.2, 0.53 mM EDTA, and an incubation time of 60 min.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) copolymer, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate- co -3-hydroxyvalerate) [P(3HB- co -3HV)], was biosynthesized from biphenyl as the sole carbon source using Alcaligenes (currently Achromobacter ) denitrificans A41. This strain is capable of degrading polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and biphenyl. This proof-of-concept of the conversion of aromatic chemicals such as the environmental pollutant PCBs/biphenyl to eco-friendly products such as biodegradable polyester PHA was inspired by the uncovering of two genes encoding PHA synthases in the A. denitrificans A41 genome. When the carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio was set at 21, the cellular P(3HB- co -3HV) content in strain A41 reached its highest value of 10.1% of the cell dry weight (CDW). A two-step cultivation protocol improved the accumulation of P(3HB- co -3HV) by up to 26.2% of the CDW, consisting of 13.0 mol % 3HV when grown on minimum salt medium without nitrogen sources. The highest cellular content of P(3HB- co -3HV) (47.6% of the CDW) was obtained through the two-step cultivation of strain A41 on biphenyl as the sole carbon source. The purified copolymer had ultra-high molecular weight (weight-average molecular weight of 3.5 × 10 6 ), as revealed through gel-permeation chromatography. Based on the genomic information related to both polymer synthesis and biphenyl degradation, we finally proposed a metabolic pathway for the production of P(3HB- co -3HV) associated with the degradation of biphenyl by strain A41.",

    "abstract": "Glioma causes significant mortality across the world and the most aggressive type of brain cancer. The incidence of glioma is believed to increase in the next few decades and hence more efficient treatment strategies need to be developed for management of glioma. Herein, we examined the anticancer effects of Indirubin against a panel of human glioma cells and attempted to explore the underlying mechanisms. The results of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay showed that Indirubin could inhibit the growth of all the glioma cells but the lowest IC50 of 12.5 µM was observed against the U87 and U118 glioma cells. Additionally, the cytotoxic effects of Indirubin were comparatively negligible against the normal astrocytes with an IC50 of > 100 µM. Investigation of mechanism of action, revealed that Indirubin exerts growth inhibitory effects on the U87 and U118 glioma cells by autophagic and apoptotic cell death. Annexin V/PI staining assay showed that apoptotic cell percentage increased dose dependently. Apoptosis was associated with increase in Bax decrease in Bcl-2 expressions. Additionally, the expression of autophagic proteins such as LC3II, ATG12, ATG15 and Beclin 1 was also increased. Wound heal assay showed that Indirubin caused remarkable decrease in the migration of the U87 and U118 cells indicative of anti-metastatic potential of Indirubin. Taken together, these results suggest that Indirubin exerts potent anticancer effects on glioma cells and may prove essential in the management of glioma.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Heterotrimeric G-proteins are key elements of signal transduction pathways, which participate in regulating multiple biological processes in fungi including growth, conidiation, antagonism, and mycoparasitism. Among G protein subunits, Gα3 showed diverse regulatory functions in different fungi. In this study, we cloned a Gα3 subunit coding gene thga3 from T. harzianum Th33 that can antagonize Rhizoctonia solani and some other plant pathogenic fungi. A thga3 deletion strain Δ thga3 was generated using the double-crossover homologous recombination strategy, and R thga3 was generated by transforming thga3 -expressing vector into the protoplasts of Δ thga3 by the PEG/CaCl 2 -mediated method. The biological characteristics of wild-type Th33, Δ thga3 and R thga3 were evaluated. Compared with wild-type Th33, Δ thga3 showed 15%, 94%, and 23% decrease in hyphal growth, conidia yield, and chitinase activity, respectively, and Δ thga3 showed lower antagonistic and mycoparasitism abilities, while there were no significant differences between wild-type Th33 and R thga3 . The hyphal surface hydrophobicity of Δ thga3 significantly decreased compared with those of the wild-type Th33 and R thga3 . qRT-PCR analysis revealed that transcript abundance of the hydrophobin gene (tha_09745) of Δ thga3 decreased by 80% compared with that of wild-type Th33 and R thga3 . The results showed that thga3 positively regulates the growth, conidiation, hydrophobicity, chitinase activities, and mycoparasitism of Th33 towards R. solani . We hence deduced that the expression level of Tha_09745 is correlated to the hyphal hydrophobicity of Th33 and therefore affects the other biological characteristics of Th33. The findings of this report provide a foundation for elucidating the G-protein signal regulatory mechanisms of fungi.",

In this study, we investigated the cold-adaptation mechanism of a novel food spoilage LAB, Leuconostoc mesenteroides NH04 (NH04). L. mesenteroides was isolated from several spoiled cooked meat products at a high frequency in our factories. NH04 grew rapidly at low temperatures within the shelf-life period and resulted in heavy financial losses. NH04 grew more rapidly than related strains such as Leuconostoc mesenteroides NBRC3832 (NBRC3832) at 10°C. Proteome analysis of NH04 demonstrated that this strain produces a homolog of alkyl hydroperoxide reductase––AhpC––the expression of which can be induced at low temperatures. The expression level of AhpC in NH04 was approximately 6-fold higher than that in NBRC3832, which was grown under the same conditions. Although AhpC is known to have an anti-oxidative role in various bacteria by catalyzing the reduction of alkyl hydroperoxide and hydrogen peroxide, the involvement of AhpC in cold adaptation of food spoilage bacteria was unclear. We introduced an expression plasmid containing ahpC into NBRC3832, which grows slower than NH04 at 10°C, and found that expression of AhpC enhanced growth. These results demonstrated that AhpC, which likely increases anti-oxidative capacity of LAB, plays an important role in their rapid growth at low temperatures.",

During this process elongated plant cells such as fibers and tracheids have been found to break into segments at irregular cell wall regions known as dislocations or slip planes. Here we study whether cellulases bind to dislocations to a higher extent than to the surrounding cell wall. The binding of fluorescently labelled cellobiohydrolases and endoglucanases to filter paper fibers was investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy and a ratiometric method was developed to assess and quantify the abundance of the binding of cellulases to dislocations as compared to the surrounding cell wall. Only Humicola insolens EGV was found to have stronger binding preference to dislocations than to the surrounding cell wall, while no difference in binding affinity was seen for any of the other cellulose variants included in the study (H. insolens EGV variants, Trichoderma reesei CBHI, CBHII and EGII). This result favours the hypothesis that fibers break at dislocations during the initial phase of hydrolysis mostly due to mechanical failure rather than as a result of faster degradation at these locations.",

In this context, the goal of this study was the investigation of cellulolytic and proteolytic abilities of bacteria isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of a hippopotamus as well as from its composting process. It is important to highlight that hippopotamus gastrointestinal samples were a non-typical sources of efficient hydrolytic bacteria with potential for application in biotechnological industries, like biofuel production. Looking for this, a total of 159 bacteria were isolated, which were submitted to qualitative and quantitative enzymatic assays. Proteolytic analyzes were conducted through the evaluation of fluorescent probes. Qualitative assays for cellulolytic abilities revealed 70 positive hits. After quantitative analyzes, 44 % of these positive hits were selected, but five (5) strains showed cellulolytic activity up to 11,8 FPU/mL. Regarding to proteolytic activities, six (6) strains showed activity above 10 %, which overpassed results described in the literature. Molecular analyzes based on the identification of 16S rDNA, revealed that all the selected bacterial isolates were affiliated to Bacillus genus.

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, the strain together with five very similar isolates, was affiliated to the genus Chelatococcus (Ibrahim et al. in J Appl Microbiol 109:1579-1590, 2010). Rep-PCR genomic fingerprints and partial dnaK gene sequence also revealed that these isolates are very similar, but differ from other Chelatococcus type strains. The major fatty acids were similar to those of other strains of the genus Chelatococcus.

G+C content of DNA was 67.1 mol%, which is comparable with the other strains of Chelatococcus species. The physiological and phenotypic characteristics of the new strain MW9(T) are sufficient to differentiate it from previously described species in the genus Chelatococcus. Strain MW9(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Chelatococcus, for which the name Chelatococcus thermostellatus is proposed.

In the present work we have studied the B. cenocepacia protein BCAL2958, a member of the OmpA-like family of proteins, demonstrated as highly immunogenic in other pathogens and capable of eliciting strong host immune responses. The encoding gene was cloned and the protein, produced as a 6× His-tagged derivative, was used to produce polyclonal antibodies. Bioinformatics analyses led to the identification of sequences encoding proteins with a similarity higher than 96 % to BCAL2958 in all the publicly available Bcc genomes. Furthermore, using the antibody it was experimentally demonstrated that this protein is produced by all the 12 analyzed strains from 7 Bcc species. In addition, results are also presented showing the presence of anti-BCAL2958 antibodies in sera from cystic fibrosis patients with a clinical record of respiratory infection by Bcc, and the ability of the purified protein to in vitro stimulate neutrophils. The widespread production of the protein by Bcc members, together with its ability to stimulate the immune system and the detection of circulating antibodies in patients with a documented record of Bcc infection strongly suggest that the protein is a potential candidate for usage in preventive therapies of infections by Bcc.",

The dialysis-dilution method was very effective and the recovery rate of the renaturation was more than 80 %. The ELISA result suggested the nanobody had been well refolded showing a superior CTGF binding activity to the commercial mouse anti-CTGF-C mAb. In conclusion, the anti-CTGF-C nonobody had been successfully screened by phage display. The dialysis-dilution refolding method was very effective and the recovery rate reached over 80 %.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial quorum sensing signals N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) signals are able to regulate a diverse array of physiological activities, such as symbiosis, virulence and biofilm formation, depending on population density. Recently, it has been discovered that the bacterial quorum sensing (QS) signal molecules can induce extensive response of higher eukaryotes including plants and mammalian cells. However, little is known about the response of fungi reacting to these bacterial signals. Here we showed that Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as an ancient eukaryote and widely used for alcoholic beverage and bioethanol production, exposed to short-chain 3-OC6-HSL and long-chain C12-HSL appeared obvious changes in morphology and ethanol tolerance. AHLs could increase the frequency of cells with bipolar and multipolar buds, and these changes did not present distinct differences when induced by different types (3-OC6-HSL and C12-HSL) and varied concentrations (200 nM and 2 μM) of AHLs. Further investigation by flow cytometer displayed that the cells untreated by AHLs reduced cell size (decreased FSC) and enhanced intracellular density (increased in SSC), compared with the AHLs-induced cells after incubation 6 h. In addition, the long-chain C12-HSL could slightly increase the ethanol tolerance of S. cerevisiae while the short-chain HSL obviously decreased it. Our study would be valuable to further research on the interaction between prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes, and be reference for industrial production of bioethanol.",

Penicillium venetum was spotted onto the surface of the fruit or pericarps, as well as an aluminium plate to act as a control, before performing the plasma treatment. The results showed that viable cell number of P. venetum decreased with a decimal reduction time ( D value or estimated treatment time required to reduce viable cell number by 90%) of 0.967 min on the aluminium plate, 2.90 min and 1.88 min on the pericarps of ‘Kiyomi’ ( Citrus unshiu × C. sinensis ) and ‘Kawano-natsudaidai’ ( C. natsudaidai ) respectively, and 2.42 min on the surface of ‘Unshu-mikan’ ( C. unshiu ). These findings confirmed a fungicidal effect of the plasma not only on an abiotic surface (aluminium plate) but also on a biotic surface (citrus fruit). Further development of the instrument by combining sorting systems with the plasma device promises an efficient means of disinfecting citrus fruits during food processing.",

Consequently, reformulation of cheeses such as Edam to contain less sodium may contribute to lowering disease risk. However, sodium is essential for cheese manufacture, influencing starter culture bacteria activity and abundance during fermentation. This study aimed to assess the microbial diversity of reformulated Edam cheese samples with a reduced sodium content using culture-independent technique. The microbial diversity of samples produced using simple sodium reduction, as well as by substituting salt with a mineral salt compound containing potassium, were analysed in comparison to regular control Edam samples during manufacture and the subsequent 6-week ripening period using 16S rDNA metagenomics. In addition, a challenge test using Listeria ( List. ) innocua as a surrogate species for List. monocytogenes was performed. Reducing sodium content did not influence the microbiological composition of reformulated samples in comparison to that of regular samples. The starter culture bacteria dominated the microbial diversity and no increase in spoilage or potentially pathogenic bacterial growth was detected, including that of List. innocua . From a microbiological perspective, it can be concluded that lowering sodium content in Edam samples without affecting the microbial composition is achievable through simple sodium reduction and through implementation of a mineral salt replacement approach.",

Nylon bags containing the cotton by-products were incubated for 0, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72 h in the rumen, respectively. The relationship between nutrient degradability and free gossypol (FG) content were examined, and the differences in the composition and inferred gene function of the colonized microbiota were studied. As a result, CSM presented highest effective degradability of dry matter, neutral detergent fibre and acid detergent fibre, but the highest effective degradability of crude protein was found in WCS. Free gossypol disappearance rate increased significantly in the first 6 h, and it reached approximately 94% at 72 h of incubation among all samples. The level of FG did not affect nutrient degradability of cotton by-products. Significant differences were noted in attached bacterial community structure among cotton by-products after 24 h rumen incubation. Among the most abundant taxa at genus level, a greater abundance of Cercis gigantea and Succiniclasticum was observed in WCS samples, whereas the CSH and CSM samples contained a greater proportion of Prevotella 1 and Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group . The redundancy analysis revealed that the level of neutral detergent fibre, ether extract, and FG in cotton by-products were significantly positive related with the composition of the attached bacteria. Collectively, our results revealed the dynamics of degradation characteristics, and the difference in the composition of bacterial colonization. These findings are of importance for the targeted improvement of cotton by-products nutrient use efficiency in ruminants and further understanding of the gossypol degradation mechanism in the rumen.",

All birds were provided with a 56 d-feeding procedure, followed by the measurement of production performances, immune organs, blood anti-oxidant parameters, intestine epithelium development, and cecal microbiota. Results showed the feed conversion ratio significantly decreased after KLF supplement compared with CON ( P &lt; 0.05). KLF supplement partly promoted the anti-oxidant capacity on account of the increased activity of Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the decrease content of malondialdehyde (MDA). Further, as referred to the gastrointestinal development and bacteria, ratio of villus/crypt significantly increased of ileum in KLF treatment ( P &lt; 0.05) while a significant promition of bacterial diversity and partial representative probiotic bacteria ( P &lt; 0.05) after KLF supplementation. Moreover, correlation analysis indicated that probitics including Bifidobacterium, Butyricimonas, Lactobacillus and Streptococcus positively correlated with production performances . In conclusion, KLF supplement may promote feed efficiency and benefit the gastrointestinal health through improving gut bacterial diversity and probiotic bacteria. The KLF might be applied as a proper antibiotic alternative.",

Hence, there is an immense need for the discovery of alternative and efficient treatment for quick recovery of diseased fishes. In the present study, Suaeda maritima leaf extracts (hexane, diethyl ether, ethanol, and water) were screened for in vitro and in vivo antibacterial and antioxidant activities. Out of all the four extracts, ethanolic extract showed highest antibacterial activity against S. aureus (4.9 ± 1.3 mm), B. subtilis (1.6 ± 0.3 mm), K. pneumoniae (4.2 ± 1.8 mm), and P. aeruginosa (4.1 ± 1.2 mm). Similarly, antioxidant activity was also higher for ethanolic extract (500 µg/mL) based on DPPH radical scavenging ability (71.6 ± 1.4%) and reducing potential (149 μg/mL) assays. Further, ethanolic extract was purified consecutively via column chromatography and preparative TLC where an active fraction was selected based on highest antibacterial (10.1 ± 1.4 mm) and antioxidant properties (82.3 ± 2.8%). Active fraction was loaded onto mass spectroscopy and identified the presence of four active constituents such as 1,2,9,10-tetramethoxy-6-methyl-5,6,6a,7-tetrahydro-4H-dibenzo[de,g]quinolin-3-yl) methanol; 3',7-Dimethoxy-3-hydroxyflavone; Saponin and (19R)9acetyl19hydroxy10,14dimethyl20oxopentacyclo[11.8.0.0 &lt; 2,10 &gt; .0 &lt; 4,9 &gt; .0 &lt; 14,19 &gt;]henicos-17-yl-acetate.

The fingerlings were segregated into 5 groups, among which group 4 and 5 were treated with crude and purified extracts. Both the extracts were efficient in treating infected fingerlings and recorded 100% survival rate which is even better than group-3 treated with a synthetic antibiotic (77%). Hence, S. maritima leaf extract can be considered as a possible alternative medicine in aquaculture.",

Here, we identified the enzymes of Geomyces sp. B10I, which appear to be responsible for its biodegradation activity.

Partial purification of an extracellular mixture of the two enzymes, named hydrGB10I and chitGB10I, using ammonium sulfate precipitation and ionic exchange chromatography gave 14.16-fold purity. The amino acid sequence of the proteins obtained from the MALDI-TOF analysis determined the molecular mass of 77.2 kDa and 46.5 kDa, respectively. Conserved domain homology analysis revealed that both proteins belong to the class of hydrolases; hydrGB10I belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 81 superfamily, while chitGB10I contains the domain of the glycosyl hydrolase 18 superfamily. Phylogenetic analysis suggests a distinct nature of the hydrGB10I and chitGB10I of Geomyces sp. B10I when compared with other fungal polyester-degrading enzymes described to date.",

This wide range of uses makes these enzymes extremely attractive for novel biotechnology applications. Here, we undertook the kinetic characterization of LacMeta, a predicted as homotrimeric (~ 107,93 kDa) small laccase, and demonstrated that this enzyme performs best at an acidic pH (pH 3–5) towards ABTS as substrate and has a broad thermal spectrum (10–60 °C), which can promote high plastic action potential through dynamic environmental temperature fluctuations. This enzyme showed following kinetic parameters: k cat = 6.377 s −1 ± 0.303, K m = 4.219 mM, and V max = 24.43 µM/min (against ABTS as substrate). LacMeta almost completely degraded malachite green (50 mg/mL) in only 2 h. Moreover, the enzyme was able to degrade seven dyes from four distinct classes and it respectively achieved 85% and 83% decolorization of methylene blue and trypan blue with ABTS as the mediator. In addition, LacMeta showed potential for the degradation of two thirds of an agricultural fungicide: fentin hydroxide, thus demonstrating its biotechnological aptitude for bioremediation. The results of this study suggest that LacMeta has potential in textile wastewater treatment and that it could help in the bioremediation of other human/environmental toxins such as pesticides and antibiotic compounds belonging to the same chemical classes as the degraded dyes.

Currently, antimonial derivatives are the first line of treatment. Some of the members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of Leishmania are shown to be associated with no response to treatment. In this study, we evaluated ABCI4, ABCG2, ABCC7, ABCB4, and ABCC3 genes expression in Leishmania isolated from patients with non-healing cutaneous leishmaniasis and treatment response isolates. We selected 17 clinical isolates including 8 treatment failure and 9 treatment response samples from September 2020 to March 2021. The isolates were obtained from patients of Health Center Laboratory of Varzaneh, Isfahan, Iran with cutaneous leishmaniasis. The diagnosis was performed using microscopic observation. The samples were directly collected from the lesions. The expression profiling of genes was assessed using SYBR Green real-time PCR that was analyzed with delta-delta Ct. All treatment failure clinical isolates were L. major. Gene expression analysis in treatment failure isolates showed that the ABC transported genes had a different pattern in each isolate. Treatment failure has been reported for cutaneous leishmaniasis worldwide. Knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of treatment failure could solve this problem. ABC transporter genes are considered controversial over the mechanisms of treatment failure outcomes. In this study, we showed that ABC transporter genes could be considered one of the important mechanisms.",

After resting Sporosarcina pasteurii cells were introduced into the columns, a precipitation solution, which consisted of 500 mM CaCl2 and 500 mM urea, was introduced under continuous flow conditions. It was shown that hydraulic conductivity was decreased by formation of microbially induced CaCO3 precipitation from between 8.37 * 10-1 and 6.73 * 10-2 cm/s to between 3.69 * 10-1 and 1.01 * 10-2 cm/s. The lowest hydraulic conductivity was achieved in porous medium consisting of the smallest glass beads (0.25 mm in diameter) using the highest density of cell suspension (OD600 2.25). The number of the deposited cells differed depending on the glass bead size of the columns. According to the experiments, 7 * 10-9 g CaCO3 was produced by a single resting cell. The urease activity, which led CaCO3 precipitation, depended on presence of high number of cells deposited in the column because the nutrients were not included in the precipitation solution and consequently, the amount of CaCO3 precipitated was proportional with the cell number in the column.

    "abstract": "Abstract The production of industrial enzymes requires an efficient expression system with a suitable host. This study investigated the isolated Bacillus subtilis 007 as a host for expressing three enzymes with potential application in the food industry. Firstly, testing the P aprE and P 43 promoters and the corresponding 5’ untranslated regions revealed great differences in the production of the recently discovered β-galactosidase from Paenibacillus wnnyii . Expression controlled by the P aprE promoter yielded a significantly higher activity of 2515 µkat/L, compared to 56 µkat/L with the P 43 promoter. Modifications on the P aprE core promoter region or the spacer, the sequence between the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the start codon, did not improve β-galactosidase production. Since the aprE 5’ untranslated region contributes to a high mRNA stability, it was incorporated into the P 43 construct to determine whether mRNA stability is responsible for the differences observed in β-galactosidase production. Interestingly, mRNA stability was significantly improved and led to a nearly 50-fold higher β-galactosidase production of 2756 µkat/L. This strategy was successfully validated by the expression of two other enzymes: the cellobiose-2-epimerase from Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus and the β-glucosidase from Pyrococcus furiosus . These findings underscored the crucial role of post-transcriptional regulation and emphasized mRNA stability as a key role in recombinant enzyme production in B. subtilis 007.",

The fungal wet biomass grown on sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate (SCBH) was subjected to one-step in-situ (direct) acid transesterification to optimize its conversion to biodiesel using a 2-level factorial statistical design of experiments. The process optimization revealed that wet biomass and methanol were the most significant factors and in a short reaction time period of 5 min with low methanol: wet biomass ratio (10:1) influenced FAME production Statistical optimization studies showed that TB21 exhibited a higher FAME content of 76.5 and 38.1% (w/w) from wet and dry biomass, respectively when compared to wild type (48.1 and 24.5%). FAME productivity (0.55−1 h−1) and a yield (66 gL−1) were achieved when TB21 was grown on SCBH for 120 h at 30 °C. The FAME profile from the wet biomass of TB21 grown on SCBH had desirable amounts of saturated (77.7%), monounsaturated (7.2%), and polyunsaturated (2.4%) methyl esters. Physico-chemical properties of TB21-derived biodiesel were determined, namely, density(0.88 g cm−3), kinematic viscosity (4.1 mm s−2), iodine value (96.82), cetane number (55.31), free fatty acid content (0.15%), total acid number (0.3 NaOH mg g−1), meeting international (ASTM D6751, EN 14214) and Indian (IS 15607) standards. Thus, the direct one-pot in situ transesterification reaction using wet biomass of variant TB21 strain showed improved production and quality of biodiesel with potential large scale application using the low-cost substrate (SCBH).",

The primary aim is to understand how substrate choice impacts lipid and β-carotene production, critical for bioenergy and bioproducts. The study demonstrates that the choice of substrate significantly influences biomass yield, lipid content, and β-carotene levels. Among the substrates tested, glycerol yielded the highest biomass concentration of 5.31 g/L. Glucose led to the highest lipid content, with a yield of 35.8% (g lipids/g biomass), while acetic acid resulted in the highest lipid concentration, reaching 1.42 g/L. In terms of β-carotene production, glucose showed the highest content per cell at 63.3 mg/g, whereas glycerol led to the highest overall concentration of 202 mg/L. These findings highlight Y. lipolytica's versatility and potential as a flexible platform to produce lipids and β-carotene, which are essential for developing sustainable biofuels and bioproducts. The study underscores the significant variations in metabolite production based on substrate choice, emphasizing on the importance of tailored strategies to optimize industrial applications. Further research may explore optimizing fermentation conditions to enhance production yields, making this yeast a viable option for various biotechnological applications.",

S. aureus exports a variety of virulence factors, such as a novel set of extracellular serine protease-like proteins (Spls). Spls are expressed by most clinical isolates of S. aureus , but their pathophysiological substrates and role during the infection are largely unknown. Here we characterized the substrate and cleavage specificity of recombinantly expressed SplA and SplB proteins. We identified a group of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like modifying enzymes including deubiquitinating enzymes from human as well as from bacterial sources to be so far unknown SplA and SplB substrates. Distinct cleavage sites within these substrates for SplA (YLY ↓ T, FMY ↓ N) and SplB (VCD ↓ S) were identified by mass spectrometry and confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis of the target proteins. Since many cellular immune signaling pathways are tightly regulated by ubiquitination, the specific cleavage of ubiquitin modifying enzymes strongly suggests a specific role of Spls in manipulating immune signaling and in competing with other bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Aeromonas hydrophila, a Gram-negative bacterium, poses significant threats to aquaculture, leading to substantial economic losses. Its pathogenicity is primarily driven by a sophisticated quorum sensing (QS) system that regulates virulence factors. This study investigates saponins extracted from the sea cucumber Holothuria leucospilota as potential natural inhibitors of QS in A. hydrophila, offering a novel disease management strategy for aquaculture. Specimens of H. leucospilota were collected, and saponins were extracted from their Cuvierian tubules through a process of homogenization, solvent extraction, and purification. The saponin extract's minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against A. hydrophila were found to be 80 μg/mL and 30 μg/mL, respectively. Hemolysin, lipase, and protease are examples of QS-regulated virulence factors whose activities were found to be significantly reduced by sub-MIC levels of saponins. Additionally, swarming motility and biofilm formation were notably inhibited. A significant downregulation of the QS genes ahyI and ahyR was observed, indicating an effective disruption of the QS system.These findings suggest that saponins from H. leucospilota can inhibit the QS system in A. hydrophila, thereby reducing its pathogenicity. This disruption offers a promising method for controlling bacterial infections without directly killing the bacteria, potentially mitigating antibiotic resistance. The study highlights the potential of marine-derived compounds as natural QS inhibitors, contributing to environmentally friendly aquaculture practices. Overall, it provides evidence that sea cucumber saponins could serve as a novel class of anti-QS agents, presenting a new perspective on disease management in aquaculture and other bacterial infection contexts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aurantiochytrium are protists found in marine and estuarine environments, known for producing high quantities of omega-3 fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The commercial viability of this species is currently hindered by the lack of reliable screening methods for the rapid identification of strains with high DHA content. This study developed a high-throughput screening platform based on the sulfo-phospho-vanillin (SPV) reaction, which produces a pink chromophore upon reacting with C–C double bonds in lipids. Analysis of 200 strains derived through the UV mutagenesis of the Aurantiochytrium limacinum strain BL10 revealed 7 strains that exhibited significantly elevated SPV reactivity, compared to the naïve strain ( P &lt; 0.01). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed that in 4 of the 7 strains, DHA levels were significantly higher than those of the naïve strain. Among those 4 strains, the SPV reactivity values of two strains were precisely correlated with their DHA/DPA content. The SPV reaction protocol proposed in this paper has considerable potential for the high-throughput screening of Aurantiochytrium strains particularly those derived through UV mutagenesis.

    "abstract": "Cellulose, a linear glucan linked by β-1,4 glycosidic bonds, is the most abundant renewable polysaccharide on earth. Complete enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose liberates the readily metabolizable glucose that could be further converted to valuable biocommodities, and essential to this process are cellulases that hydrolyze the β-1,4 glycosidic bonds. Cellulases are among the most intensively studied and best understood enzymes, and many key residues have been uncovered and interrogated with respect to their functions in catalysis and/or substrate binding. However, it remains to be explored whether additional residues, especially in many poorly characterized cellulases such as processive endoglucanases, might also be functionally important. Here, we investigated a processive endoglucanase from an alkaliphilic bacterium Acetivibrio alkalicellulosi AaCel5A that consists of a glycohydrolase family 5 (GH5) domain and two tandem carbohydrate-binding module family 6 (CBM6) domains. Via structure-guided engineering, we uncovered the functional importance of a previously underexplored but relatively conserved histidine (histidine70 or His70). His70 itself appears to be largely dispensable for hydrolyzing β-1,4 glycosidic bonds, but it is important for efficient hydrolysis of short cellodextrins such as cellotriose, cellotetraose, and cellopentaose, likely through its ability to coordinate substrate binding. Our work thus provides important mechanistic insights into how processive endoglucanases may act on short cellodextrins.",

    "abstract": "Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), classified as a neglected tropical disease (NTD), is a significant public health concern caused by Leishmania protozoa. It is transmitted through the bites of infected female sandflies and manifests in various forms, ranging from localized skin ulcers to social stigma due to scarring. Numerous reports highlight the life-threatening side effects of glucantim, the first-line treatment for this disease, indicating a pressing need foralternative drugs. This experimental study aims to assess the anti-leishmanial effects of chitosan and chitosan- amphotericin B against Leishmania major (L. major) in vitro and in vivo. Chitosan and amphotricine B were purchased, and different concentrations were prepared. L. major promastigotes were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium. In vitro anti-leishmanial activity was assessed against the promastigotes of L. major using vital staining. For the in vivo assessment, lesion sizes were measured before and after ointment treatments in Bagg Albino mice (BALB/c). The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2 H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was utilized to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of chitosan and chitosan-amphotericin B at varying concentrations on the L929 cell line. Additionally, the in vitro hemolytic activity was measured using a spectrophotometric method. The in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that chitosan-amphotericin B exhibited superior inhibitory effects against L. major compared to either chitosan or amphotericin B alone, and even against the positive control, particularly at higher concentrations (P < 0.05). Furthermore, cytotoxicity tests indicated that both chitosan and amphotericin, whether used separately or in combination, had no cytotoxic effects on the L929 cell line or human blood samples in vitro and did not impact liver enzymes in vivo (P < 0.05). The findings from this in vitro and in vivo study highlighted the impressive anti-leishmanial effects of chitosan, which were further enhanced with the addition of amphotericin B.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Pseudomonas aeruginosa represents a critical global health threat, particularly affecting immunocompromised individuals, as well as patients with wounds and burn injuries. The increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa strains has significantly reduced the efficacy of conventional antimicrobial therapies, underscoring the urgent need for new, effective therapeutic alternatives. Plant-derived secondary metabolites have emerged as promising candidates due to their diverse bioactivities and favorable safety profiles. This study investigated the antimicrobial and anti-virulence potential of purified aqueous fractions of Ziziphus jujuba (ZJ) seeds against MDR P. aeruginosa clinical isolates. LC–ESI–MS/MS-MRM fingerprinting identified 33 compounds, including five predominant phenolics: 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, gallic acid, syringic acid, chlorogenic acid, and ferulic acid. One hundred clinical isolates were evaluated for antibiotic sensitivity and biofilm-forming ability. The ZJ fraction exhibited potent antibacterial activity, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1.56 mg/ml and significantly inhibited biofilm formation by approximately 70%. Additionally, quantitative real-time PCR showed a marked downregulation the key quorum-sensing genes lasI (45%), rhlI (42%), and rhlR (34%) ( p ≤ 0.05). These findings reveal, for the first time, that the aqueous fraction of Z. jujuba seeds not only inhibits bacterial proliferation, but also attenuates biofilm formation and virulence gene expression in MDR- P. aeruginosa. These results highlight the potential of ZJ fraction as a promising plant-based antimicrobial agent. Further in vivo investigations and mechanistic studies are warranted to validate its clinical applicability and therapeutic efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Probiotic treatment is an effective method for enhancing growth performance and improving intestinal flora in aquaculture species. This study examined the effects of three candidate-probiotics ( Bacillus , photosynthetic bacteria, and Lactobacillus ) on the rate of weight gain and the intestinal flora of abalone juveniles. Haliotis diversicolor was fed a probiotic-supplemented diet for 30 days. The abalones fed with Lactobacillus showed a more significant weight gain rate than those in the Bacillus , photosynthetic bacteria, and control groups. Through 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing, 12,490 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were obtained from the abalone intestinal tract microbiome. After a short feeding period (5 days), the Bacillus and photosynthetic bacteria-treated groups showed an increased abundance of Proteobacteria in the abalone digestive tract. In the Lactobacillus -treated group, the quantity of Proteobacteria decreased, and the abundance of Bacteroidot a increased. After 30 days of feeding, the abundance of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes at the phylum level was more significant in the Bacillus -treated group and photosynthetic bacteria-treated group than in the controls. The Lactobacillus -treated group showed an increase in the quantity of Proteobacteria and Chloroflexi. The dominant flora of the three probiotic treated groups changed slightly with respect to the control group. After a short period of feeding (5 days), the abundance of Rhodobacteraceae (at the genus level) in the abalone digestive tract increased in the Bacillus- and photosynthetic bacteria-treated groups, whereas in the Lactobacillus -treated group, Rhodobacteraceae decreased, and Maribacter increased in abundance. After 30 days of feeding, Bacteroidetes and Ruegeria were higher in the Bacillus -treated group than in the control group. Marinirhabdus and Bacteroidetes increased in the photosynthetic bacteria-treated group, and Roseivivax and Ruegeria increased in the Lactobacillus -treated group. The three probiotic-treated groups had higher microbial diversity than the control group. Therefore, our findings confirmed that adding Bacillus , photosynthetic bacteria, and Lactobacillus to the abalone diet increased abalones’ weight gain rate and altered their intestinal microbiome composition.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Polyglutamic acid (PGA), has several beneficial characteristics and advantageous uses. The microbial biopolymer is released from a variety of organisms, particularly Bacillus species. Soil samples from various sectors of Egypt were gathered and evaluated for the production of PGA. According to the current study results, isolate (L) was the most powerful producer and was identified by 16S rRNA as Bacillus licheniformis . A multi-factorial Plackett–Burman layout was used to optimize PGA bacterial synthesis. Mass spectrometry, thin-layer chromatography, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and amino acid analysis were employed to characterize the product. It was also investigated how the produced polymer was affected by low gamma irradiation doses. In comparison to Bacillus subtilis (ATCC6633), Bacillus licheniformis showed an over 33% inclination in PGA yield under optimal conditions. FTIR spectra demonstrated that PGA functional groups were successfully unchanged after exposure to low levels of gamma radiation similar to the doses given to cancer patients under radiotherapy. Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) showed 2 phase weight loss for gamma irradiated PGA, emphasizing that the polymer showed thermal stability after exposure to gamma radiation. These results were confirmed by Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Finally, the isolated Bacillus licheniformis strain can be considered as a prospective source of PGA for future industrial and medicinal uses. Additionally, this could be a promising result for the use of PGA as a drug carrier for cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy.",

In this study, we designed a multi-epitope vaccine candidate using the outer membrane protein K (OmpK) of A. baumannii. T-cell and B-cell epitopes were predicted, and the best epitopes were selected for multi-epitope design. For selecting the best epitopes, many in silico studies, as well as molecular docking of epitope-HLAs, were performed. The multi-epitope was designed using β-defensin as an adjuvant, PADRE sequence as an immunogenicity enhancer, and appropriate linkers. The tertiary structure of the multi-epitope was obtained using modeling and several molecular dynamics (MD)-based refinements. The sequence and/or 3D model of the multi-epitope was investigated for physicochemical, structural, in silico cloning, conformational B epitope prediction, immune response simulation, molecular docking for assay binding to toll-like receptors (TLRs), and deformability studies. The results showed that the multi-epitope construct is favorable in the case of immunogenicity, physicochemical properties, structure, binding to TLRs, solubility, stability, toxicity, allergenicity, and cross-reactivity. This multi-epitope vaccine candidate has the potential to elicit multiple immune responses against A. baumannii. However, in vitro and in vivo experimental tests are needed to validate its efficacy as a potential vaccine candidate.",

    "abstract": "Observational studies have suggested associations among the gut microbiome, immune cells, and the risk of malignant neoplasms of nasopharynx. However, the causality of these relationships remains unclear. Thus, we conducted multiple Mendelian Randomization analyses to estimate the causal association of gut microbiota with the risk of malignant neoplasms of nasopharynx and to evaluate the mediating effect of immune cells on this causal pathway. Genetic variants extracted from genome-wide association studies of human gut microbiota compositions (n = 211), immune cell traits (n = 731) and malignant neoplasms of nasopharynx served as instrumental variables for calculating causal associations and mediating effects. Four gut microbiota compositions and eight immune cell traits exhibited detrimental causal effects, while three gut microbiota compositions and fifteen immune cell traits demonstrated protective effects. Interestingly, the causal association of genus Candidatus Soleaferrea id.11350 was no longer significant after adjusting for two established immune cell traits (HLA DR + + monocyte %leukocyte and HLA DR + + monocyte % monocyte). Moreover, HLA DR + + monocyte %leukocyte exhibited a mediating effect (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59-0.96) on the causal pathway of genus Candidatus Soleaferrea id.11350-malignant neoplasms of nasopharynx, with a mediating proportion of 21.59%. To our knowledge, this study is the first to identify potential therapeutic targets and elucidate mechanistic insights for malignant neoplasms of nasopharynx interventions involving gut microbiota and immune cell traits; however, these findings warrant further validation through adequately powered randomized clinical trials (RCTs).",

Klebsiella pneumoniae , a leading cause of clinical infections and hospital-acquired diseases, is responsible for over 95% of infections within the Klebsiella genus. Phages targeting K. pneumoniae exhibit remarkable diversity, with numerous isolates identified against various serotypes of this pathogen. In this study, we described the isolation and characterization of a novel bacteriophage from hospital sewage, Henu2_3, which targeted clinical isolates of K1-type K. pneumoniae . Transmission electron microscopy revealed that phage Henu2_3 possessed an icosahedral head and podovirus morphotype. The phage genome comprises 42,878 base pairs with a G + C content of 53.97%, encoding 54 putative open reading frames. One-step growth curve analysis demonstrated that phage Henu2_3 has a latency period of 10 min and an average burst size of 215 phage particles per infected cell. Additionally, Henu2_3 exhibited remarkable stability, tolerating temperatures up to 60℃ and maintaining maximum viability across a broad pH range of 4 to 12. In vivo infection models demonstrated that phage Henu2_3 markedly enhanced animal survival and decreased bacterial burden in target organs. These properties highlight its potential as a therapeutic agent against K. pneumoniae infections.",

To investigate the causal relationship between skin microbiota, allergic diseases, and inflammation biomarkers using Mendelian randomization (MR). We integrated summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of skin microbiota inflammation biomarkers, and seven allergic diseases. Inverse variance weighting (IVW) served as the primary statistical method, with supplementary analyses using MR-Egger regression, weighted median, and Weighted mode. Sensitivity analyses, including Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept test and MR-PRESSO outlier detection, were conducted to validate and stabilize our findings. Two-step MR analyses were performed to identify potential mediating inflammation biomarkers between skin microbiota and allergic diseases.We identified 43 significant causal relationships between the skin microbiota and seven allergic diseases: allergic disease as a whole, asthma (adult, pediatric, allergic), allergic conjunctivitis, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, allergic urticaria and eczema, which included 20 protective and 23 risk causal relationships, respectively. Mediation analysis showed that specific biomarkers, such as C-C motif chemokine 19 and CD40L receptor levels, Interleukin-18 and TNF-β mediated these associations. This MR study provides robust evidence supporting causal relationships between specific skin microbiota taxa and allergic diseases, as well as potential mediating roles of inflammation biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Fungus-farming termites (Macrotermitinae), predominantly found in Africa, are eusocial insects with significant ecological roles. Historically, they have been valued in traditional medicine, human diets, and livestock feed. These termites share a long-standing symbiotic relationship with Termitomyces fungi, which has evolved over millions of years and is critical to their survival and ecological impact. This mutualism promotes a unique monoculture of Termitomyces in the fungus comb while suppressing fungal and bacterial antagonists, likely due to the comb's structural or chemical properties, sparking interest among researchers. In this study, we conducted an extensive examination of 11 fungus combs associated with five termite species collected in Senegal. Our analysis revealed significant antibacterial properties in the crude extracts of the combs, notably against multidrug-resistant strains. Chemical analyses led to the identification of dicrotalic acid (Meglutol) in the active fractions of two combs from agricultural areas. This compound, likely of plant origin, suggests a link between termite feeding habits and the antimicrobial potential of the combs. Although the exact bioactive compounds responsible for the antimicrobial activity have not yet been fully identified, the presence of various metabolites may explain the maintenance of Termitomyces monocultures and the suppression of pathogens. This also illustrates the complex ecological relationship between Termitomyces and termites, which may work together to produce natural bioactive compounds that suppress pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Antibiotic misuse has triggered a global health crisis due to the rise of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms. Recent studies suggest that nanoparticles (NPs), particularly silver nanoparticles, may provide a solution. However, their toxicity necessitates the development of novel carriers to enhance targeting while minimizing cytotoxicity. This study aimed to synthesize, characterize mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) incorporated with silver alone or combined with zinc, and evaluate their antibacterial, antibiofilm, and cytotoxic properties. Characterization through X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), revealed particle sizes between 413 and 560 nm. Antibacterial activity was assessed via the broth-dilution method against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25,923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25,922, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ATCC 33,591, and five multidrug-resistant pathogens (MDR). Two types of silver-incorporated mesoporous silica nanoparticles were synthesized: Ag/MCM-48 (10 mmol Ag) and Ag/Zn/MCM-48 (10 mmol Ag + 10 mmol Zn). The minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentrations ranged from 7.8 to 31.25 and 7.8 to 62.5 µg/mL, respectively. Ag/MCM-48 NPs exhibited 78% antibiofilm activity against MRSA ATCC 33,591, while Ag/Zn/MCM-48 NPs displayed up to 90% antibiofilm activity against MDR bacteria. Cytotoxicity assays revealed promising results, with CC 50 values of 169.16 ± 6.43 µg/mL and 19.95 ± 0.63 µg/mL for Ag/Zn/MCM-48 NPs and Ag/MCM-48 NPs against Vero cell line, respectively. The IC 50 values of Ag/Zn/MCM-48 and Ag/MCM-48 NPs were 62.17 ± 2.15 µg/mL and 3.58 ± 0.12 µg/mL against Caco -2 cell line, respectively. Accordingly, our synthesized silver/zinc incorporated mesoporous silica NPs present a safer antibacterial and antibiofilm agent with lower cytotoxicity than silver NPs, making them a promising alternative for combating MDR bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Subtilisin-like serine proteases (subtilases) are widely used in industrial applications, particularly in the detergents, due to their robust catalytic properties. The hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis KOD1 secretes TKSP, a highly stable subtilase capable of degrading pathogenic prion proteins under harsh conditions. TKSP is secreted as a precursor comprising an N-terminal propeptide (TKSPpro) fused to the catalytic domain. Although the TKSP precursor can be solubly expressed in Escherichia coli, TKSPpro, which transiently inhibits the catalytic domain, is rapidly cleaved. This releases active TKSP prematurely, leading to degradation of host proteins and severely limiting production yields. To address this issue, we developed a co-expression system in which the TKSP precursor is expressed alongside TKSpro, the propeptide of TKS, a homologous subtilase from T. kodakarensis KOD1. TKSpro is a potent inhibitor of its cognate catalytic domain due to its high structural rigidity and strong binding affinity. Co-expression with TKSpro enhanced TKSP expression levels by up to tenfold compared to expression without the propeptide. Crystallographic analysis of TKSpro in complex with TKSP lacking TKSPpro revealed that TKSpro binds complementarily to the catalytic domain, with the extended C-terminal region occupying the substrate-binding pocket. Mutational analysis further demonstrated that the structural rigidity and inhibitory potency of TKSpro correlates with TKSP expression yield in the co-expression system. This study demonstrates the importance of forming a stable inhibitory complex with an exogenous propeptide to suppress premature activation and enhance heterologous expression of cytotoxic subtilases in E. coli, providing a useful strategy for the production of proteolytically active enzymes.",

Response surface methodology was employed to optimize MgO synthesis and maximize nanoparticle yield. The results obtained from characterization (Uv, XRD, TEM, SEM, Zeta potential, EDX, DLS and FTIR) indicated the semispherical or quasi-spherical shape of MgO NPs with 53.3 nm in the mean size. The MgO NPs displayed antioxidant features, with the value of IC50 180.2 μg/mL. Additionally, MgO NPs had cancer therapy against the HeLa cervical cancerous cell line and (PC3) prostate cancerous cell line, where the IC50 was 179.4 µg/mL and 190.67 µg/mL correspondingly, while showing less toxicity toward the normal Vero cell line. The biosynthesized MgO NPs displayed significant antibacterial activity. The largest zone of inhibition was against Bacillus subtilis (27.57 mm, MIC 62.5 µg/mL), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (18.4 mm, MIC 62.5 µg/mL), Salmonella typhi (18.0 mm, MIC 125 µg/mL), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (16.8 mm, MIC 250 µg/mL). They also showed anti-biofilm activity against S. aureus ATCC 35556 and E. coli ATCC 25922 with inhibition of 69.6 and 55.5% respectively at 200 μg/mL. In addition, Biosynthesized MgO NPs demonstrated significant inhibitory activity against α-amylase as well as α-glucosidase enzymes, with IC50 76.71 μg/mL and 38.8 μg/mL, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The considerable contribution of ruminant livestock to methane emissions has become a major global concern in recent years. Although dietary approaches for reducing ruminant methane emissions have been explored, the sustainable potential of probiotics to influence rumen function and lower methane production has increasingly attracted research attention. While previous studies have focused on single or dual-strain probiotics, this study is among the first to evaluate the synergistic effects of quadric-strain formulations. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of multi-strain probiotic blends, each at two distinct concentrations on rumen fermentation, nutrient degradability, and methane emission in sheep using an in vitro gas production technique following a completely randomized design. The basal diet with no probiotic supplements served as a control, while the supplemented bacterial combinations were Bacillus licheniformis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, and Bifidobacterium bifidum (ABLB; at a ratio of 1:1:1:1) at levels of 2 × 10 9 (ABLB2) and 4 × 10 9 (ABLB4) CFU/g of feed, and Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Bacillus subtilis plus Bifidobacterium bifidum (CPSB; at a ratio of 1:1:1:1) at levels of 2 × 10 9 (CPSB2) and 4 × 10 9 (CPSB4) CFU/g of feed. Probiotic supplementation significantly improved in vitro dry matter and fiber degradability (IVDMD and IVCFD), with the most effective results observed in ABLB treatments. These blends also reduced methane production and ammonia-N concentrations, while increasing total volatile fatty acids (TVFA), indicating more efficient fermentation. Protozoa counts were notably lower in treated groups, supporting the role of probiotics in mitigating methane via microbial modulation ( P &lt; 0.01). Probiotic supplementation did not affect the values of pH ( P &gt; 0.05). Predictive values for metabolizable energy (ME), net energy for lactation (NEL), and organic matter digestibility (OMD) were improved across treatments. These findings highlight the potential of targeted probiotic formulations to enhance rumen efficiency and reduce environmental emissions in ruminant systems.",

The EG used in this study consists of a family 1 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) and a catalytic module. A comparison with family 1 CBMs revealed conserved amino acid residues and flexible amino acid residues. The flexible amino acid residues were at positions 18, 23, 26, and 27, through which the degrading activity for various cellulose structures in each biomass may have been optimized. To select the optimal combination of CBMs of EGs, a yeast mixture with comprehensively mutated CBM was constructed. The mixture consisted of yeasts codisplaying EG with mutated CBMs, in which 4 flexible residues were comprehensively mutated, CBH, and BG. The yeast mixture was inoculated in selection medium with newspaper as the sole carbon source. The surviving yeast consisted of RTSH yeast (the mutant sequence of CBM: N18R, S23T, S26S, and T27H) and wild-type yeast (CBM was the original) in a ratio of 1:46. The mixture (1 RTSH yeast and 46 wild-type yeasts) had a fermentation activity that was 1.5-fold higher than that of wild-type yeast alone in the early phase of saccharification and fermentation, which indicates that the yeast mixture with comprehensively mutated CBM could be used to select the optimal combination of CBMs suitable for the cellulose of each biomass.",

In addition, the results obtained by this method were compared with the results obtained by the Zirmil-beating cell disruption method and the QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit. The OD260/OD280 ratio and concentration of the DNA extracted using the CLU method were 2.02 and 282.8 µg/µL, respectively; when the incubation temperatures for lysozyme and RNase were adjusted to 37 °C, those values were 2.08 and 309.8 µg/µL, respectively. On the agarose gel, a major high-intensity, discrete band of more than 10 kb was found for the CLU method. However, the smearing intensity of degraded DNA was lower when the incubation temperatures were 60 °C for lysozyme and 30 °C for RNase than when incubation temperatures of 37 °C for lysozyme and 37 °C for RNase were used. The V3 variable region of the prokaryotic 16S rDNA was amplified, and an approximately 600-bp fragment was observed when the DNA extracted using the CLU method was used as a template. The CLU method is simple and cost effective, and it yields high-quality, unsheared, high-molecular-weight DNA, which is comparable to that obtained with a commercially available kit. The extracted DNA has potential for applications in critical molecular biology techniques.",

There are 16 known isozymes of α-CA in humans, which differ widely in their kinetics, subcellular localization and tissue-specific distribution. Several disorders are associated with abnormal levels of CA, and so the inhibition of CA has pharmacological application in the treatment of many diseases. Currently, searching for novel CA inhibitors (CAI) has been performed using in vitro methods, and so their toxicity remains unknown at the time of screening. To obtain potentially safer CAIs, a screening procedure using an in vivo assay seems to have more advantages. Here, we developed a yeast-based in vivo assay for the detection of inhibitors of the human CA isozyme II (hCAII). The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant deprived of its own CA (Δnce103 strain) can grow under a high CO2 condition (5% (v/v) CO2) but not at an ambient level. We constructed Δnce103 strains expressing various levels of hCAII from a plasmid harboring the hCAII gene arranged under the control of variously modified GAL1 promoter and relying on the expression of hCAII for growth under low CO2 condition. Using a multidrug-sensitive derivative of the Δnce103 strain expressing a low level of hCAII, we finally established a high throughput in vivo assay for hCAII inhibitors under a low CO2 condition. Cytotoxicity of the candidates obtained could be simultaneously determined under a high CO2 condition. However, their inhibitory activities against other CA isozymes remains to be established by further investigation.",

Here, we present a successful protocol for genetic transformation of cauliflower employing the process of agroinfection.

That shows a promising technical advance especially when compared to the results of previous literature reports (e.g. 8.7% reported efficiency using R. rhizogenes). The transgenic cauliflower was obtained from hairy roots via organogenic callus induction. The potential transformants were analysed at the genomic and proteomic levels and their transgenic character was fully confirmed.",

Due to the effects of chemical pesticides on human and environmental health, mutation in pathogens and resistance to various toxins besides the challenges with resistant cultivar production, the constant use of these methods are not recommended any longer. Thus, use of biological control agents along with the natural ingredient extracted from plants and application of peptide with antimicrobial activity, have been the focus of many researchers. In the present study, the antifungal activity of two plant extracts named Turmeric and Persian lilac in comparison with a chemical mixture and recombinant thanatin were evaluated against five following fungal plant pathogens; Geotrichum candidum, Botrytis cinerea, Rhizoctonia solani, Alternaria tenuissima and Gibberella fujikuroi. The results showed that, all treatments have antifungal activity against tested fungi. Both plant extracts were shown an acceptable antifungal activity against tested fungi but their inhibition effects was not comparable with chemical mixture. Turmeric showed a higher rate of mycelial inhibition than Persian lilac. Amongst all treatment, thanatin showed a great antifungal activity by its application at µg level under both in vitro and in vivo condition. Considering to the compatibility of thanatin with human health and environmental safety we could imagine a clear perspective for the application of this recombinant peptide in sustainable agriculture.",

The corresponding gene ( cphE al ) was identified from subclones of a genomic DNA gene library by heterologously expressing the functionally active enzyme in Escherichia coli . The nucleotide sequence of the gene (1260 base pairs) was determined indicating a theoretical mass of 43.6 kDa (mature CphE al ) plus a leader peptide of 2,6 kDa which corresponds well to the apparent molecular mass of 45 kDa as revealed by SDS-PAGE. The enzyme exhibited a high sequence identity of 91% with the extracellular cyanophycinase from P. anguilliseptica strain BI and carried an N-terminal Sec secretion signal peptide. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of cph E revealed a putative catalytic triad consisting of the serine motif GXSXG plus a histidine and a glutamate residue, suggesting a catalytic mechanism similar to serine-type proteases. The cyanophycinase (CphE al ) was heterologously produced in two different E. coli strains (Top10 and BL21(DE3)) from two plasmid vectors (pBBR1MCS-4 and pET-23a(+)). The signal peptide of CphE al was cleaved in E. coli , suggesting active export of the protein at least to the periplasm. Substantial enzyme activity was also present in the culture supernatants. The extracellular cyanophycinase activities in E. coli were higher than activities in the wild type P. alcaligenes DIP1 in complex LB medium. Highest extracellular enzyme production was achieved with E. coli BL21(DE3) expressing CphE al from pBBR1MCS-4. Using M9 minimal medium was less effective, but the relatively low cost of mineral salt media makes these results important for the industrial-scale production of dipeptides from cyanophycin.",

In this study, Bacillus subtilis was used as the model Gram-positive species to systematically investigate the effects of electrochemical currents on bacteria including the morphology, viability, and gene expression of planktonic cells, and viability of biofilm cells. The data suggest that weak electrochemical currents can effectively eliminate B. subtilis both as planktonic cells and in biofilms.

MAGIC-5 cells were also stimulated by an electrical potential of 1.0 V; cell damage, proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated by trypan blue staining, cell counting and in situ apoptosis detection, respectively. HIV-1 was found to be damaged to a greater extent by electrical stimulation than the cells. In particular, after application of a 1.0-V potential for 3 min, HIV-1LAI and HIV-1KMT infection were inhibited by about 90%, but changes in cell damage, proliferation and apoptosis were virtually undetectable. These results suggested that HIV-1 is significantly more susceptible to low electrical potential than cells.

However, despite all progress the improvement of protein production is an ongoing challenge and of high importance for cost-effective enzyme production. With the epMEGAWHOP mutagenesis protocol for vector backbone optimization we report a novel directed evolution based approach to increase protein production levels by randomly introducing mutations in the vector backbone. In the current study we validate the epMEGAWHOP mutagenesis protocol for three different expression systems. The latter demonstrated the general applicability of the epMEGAWHOP method. Cellulase and lipase production was doubled in one round of directed evolution by random mutagenesis of pET28a(+) and pET22b(+) vector backbones. Protease production using the vector pHY300PLK was increased ~4-times with an average of ~1.25 mutations per kb vector backbone. The epMEGAWHOP does not require any rational understanding of the expression machinery and can generally be applied to enzymes, expression vectors and related hosts. epMEGAWHOP is therefore from our point of view a robust, rapid and straight forward alternative for increasing protein production in general and for biotechnological applications.",

    "abstract": "A genetically engineered strain of Pichia pastoris expressing S-adenosylmethionine synthetase gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae under the control of AOX 1 promoter was developed. Induction of recombinant strain with 1% methanol resulted in the expression of SAM2 protein of ~ 42 kDa, whereas control GS115 showed no such band. Further, the recombinant strain showed 17-fold higher enzyme activity over control. Shake flask cultivation of engineered P. pastoris in BMGY medium supplemented with 1% L-methionine yielded 28 g/L wet cell weight and 0.6 g/L S-adenosylmethionine, whereas control (transformants with vector alone) with similar wet cell weight under identical conditions accumulated 0.018 g/L. The clone cultured in the bioreactor containing enriched methionine medium showed increased WCW (117 g/L) as compared to shake flask cultures and yielded 2.4 g/L S-adenosylmethionine. In spite of expression of SAM 2 gene up to 90 h, S-adenosylmethionine accumulation tended to plateau after 72 h, presumably because of the limited ATP available in the cells at stationery phase. The recombinant P pastoris seems promising as potential source for industrial production of S-adenosylmethionine.",

    "abstract": "Azotobacter chroococcum is a widespread free-living soil bacterium within the genus of Azotobacter known for assimilation of atmospheric nitrogen and subsequent conversion into nitrogenous compounds, which henceforth enrich the nitrogen content of soils. A. chroococcum SBUG 1484, isolated from composted earth, exhibits phenol oxidase (PO) activity when growing under nitrogen-fixing conditions. In the present study we provide incipient analysis of the crude PO activity expressed by A. chroococcum SBUG 1484 within comparative analysis to fungal crude PO from the white-rot fungus Pycnoporus cinnabarinus SBUG-M 1044 and tyrosinase (PPO) from the mushroom Agaricus bisporus in an attempt to reveal desirable properties for exploitation with future recombinant expression of this enzyme. Catalytic activity increased with pre-incubation at 35°C; however 70% of activity remained after pre-treatment at 50°C. Native A. chroococcum crude PO exhibited not only strong preference for 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, but also towards related methoxy-activated substrates as well as substituted ortho-benzenediols from over 40 substrates tested. Presence of CuSO4 enhanced crude phenol oxidase activity up to 30%, whereas NaN3 (0.1 mM) was identified as the most inhibiting substance of all inhibitors tested. Lowest inhibition of crude PO activity occurred after 60 minutes of incubation in presence of 15% methanol and ethanol with 63% and 77% remaining activities respectively, and presence of DMSO even led to increasing oxidizing activities. Substrate scope and inhibitor spectrum strongly differentiated A. chroococcum PO activity comprised in crude extracts from those of PPO and confirmed distinct similarities to fungal PO.",

    "abstract": "Two transketolase isogenes, MmTKL1 and MmTKL2, isolated from Moniliella megachiliensis were investigated for their roles in stress response and erythritol biosynthesis. The encoded proteins were highly homologous in amino acid sequence and domain structure. Two stress response elements (STREs) were found upstream of MmTKL1, while no STRE was found upstream of MmTKL2. In contrast, two Ap-1 elements were present upstream of MmTKL2, but none were detected upstream of MmTKL1. MmTKL2 partially complemented the aromatic amino acid auxotrophy of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae tkl1 deletion mutant, suggesting that at least one of the MmTKLs functioned as a transketolase in vivo. In response to short-term osmotic stress (20% glucose or 1.2 M NaCl) in Moniliella cells, MmTKL1 expression increased rapidly through the first 40 min before subsequently decreasing gradually, while MmTKL2 expression showed no significant change. In contrast, short-term oxidative stress (0.15 mM menadione) induced considerable increases in MmTKL2, while MmTKL1 expression remained low under the same conditions. Long-term osmotic stress (20% glucose) yielded increased expression of both genes starting at 12 h and continuing through 72 h. During either osmotic or oxidative stress, intracellular erythritol accumulation could clearly be correlated with the pattern of expression of either MmTKL1 or MmTKL2. These results strongly suggested that MmTKL1 is responsible primarily for the response to osmotic stress, while MmTKL2 is responsible primarily for the response to oxidative stress. Thus, we postulate that the two transketolase isoforms of M. megachiliensis play distinct and complementary roles in coordinating erythritol production in response to distinct environmental stresses.",

The mutated strain, designated as NCU116-1, was screened out by the ratio of hydrolytic zone diameter to colony diameter on skim milk plate. The proteinase activity (9116.1 U/ml) of NCU116-1 was increased by 31.9% compared with the parental strain. The extracellular enzymes produced by NCU116-1 included proteinase, pectase, glucoamylase, cellulase and amylase. The proteinase had the maximum activity at 50 °C. Its optimum temperature and pH value were approximately 45 °C and 8.0 respectively. Mn2+ was an activator of neutral proteinase. The glucoamylase had the maximum activity at 35 °C, and was activated by Cu2+, Fe3+ and Mn2+. Its optimum temperatures and pH value were 35 °C and 8.0 respectively. The pectinase had the maximum activity at 40 °C, and was activated by Ca2+ and Mn2+. Its optimum temperatures and pH value were 35-40 °C and 6.0 respectively. The optimum conditions of CCSKO extraction by AEM were also investigated. The results suggested that the best amount of enzyme solution and enzymolysis time were 20% (v/v) and 4 h, respectively. The oil extraction rate was 95.2% under these conditions. Thus, a suitable mutated strain was selected for CCSKO extraction by AEM and the optimum extraction conditions were determined.",

When protein expression was induced at constant temperature, the greatest amount of extracellular recombinant α-CGTase was produced at 25 °C. Higher or lower induction temperatures were not conducive to extracellular secretion of recombinant α-CGTase. To enhance extracellular secretion of α-CGTase by E. coli, a two-stage temperature control strategy was adopted. When expression was induced at 25 °C for 32 h, and then the temperature was shifted to 30 °C, the extracellular α-CGTase activity at 90 h was 45% higher than that observed when induction was performed at a constant temperature of 25 °C. Further experiments suggested that raising the induction temperature can benefit the transport of recombinant enzyme and compensate for the decreased rate of recombinant enzyme synthesis during the later stage of expression. This report provides a new method of optimizing the secretory expression of recombinant enzymes by E. coli.",

In this study, we explored the synergistic effects of temperature and original mineral compositions (OMCs, energy resources) on the sphalerite bioleaching process. The microbial community structure was monitored by 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology and showed clear segregation along temperature gradients and Shannon diversity decreased at high temperature. On the contrary, the physicochemical parameters (pH and [Fe3+]) in the leachate were significantly affected by the OMCs. Interestingly, the influence of temperature on zinc recovery was greater at relatively simpler OMCs level, whereas the influence of OMCs was stronger at lower temperature. In addition, using [Fe3+], pH, relative abundances of dominant OTUs of microbial community and temperature as variable parameters, several models were constructed to predict zinc leaching efficiency, providing a possibility to predict the metal recovery efficiency under temperature change and variable energy resources.",

Bacterial communities associated with biofilms were determined using epifluorescence microscopy and high-throughput sequencing. Results showed that sampling time and site had significant effects on the abundances of surface-associated bacteria. No significant differences were found in the number of surface-associated bacteria between two substrate types (filament vs. slide). Sequencing revealed microbial communities attached to artificial substrates in a hypereutrophic urban river were composed of 80,375 OTUs, and distributed in 47 phyla. Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria/Chloroplast were the two dominant phyla, followed by Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Taxonomic composition showed ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms, fecal indicator bacteria and pathogens enriched in attached microbial communities, especially the ammonia-oxidizing Nitrosomonas bacteria.

The two Trichoderma species have a tri cluster, which includes seven genes (tri14, tri12, tri11, tri10, tri3, tri4, and tri6) that encode transport and regulatory enzymes required for the biosynthesis of trichodermin. Here, we isolated T. brevicompactum 0248 transformants with disrupted tri11, tri4, or tri3 gene. We also described the effect of tri11, tri3, or tri4 deletion on the expression of other genes in the tri cluster. Targeted Δtri3 knockout mutant exhibited a sharp decline in the production of trichodermin, and trichodermol, which is a substrate for trichodermin production, accumulated. Thus, the results demonstrated that tri3 was responsible for the biosynthesis of trichodermin, and the tri3 gene-encoded enzyme catalyzed the acetylation reaction of the hydroxy group at C-4 of the trichodermin skeleton. In addition, tri4 and tri11 deletion mutants were generated to evaluate the roles of tri4 and tri11 in trichodermin biosynthesis, respectively. Deletion mutant strain Δtri4 or Δtri11 did not produce trichodermin in T. brevicompactum, indicating that tri4 and tri11 are essential for trichodermin biosynthesis. This is the first to report the function of tri3, tri4 and tri11 in T. brevicompactum, although the role of tri4 and tri11 has already been described for T. arundinaceum by Cardoza et al.

The switch in the operation mode did not alter the removal performance of BTF1. Comparatively, BTF2 was not successfully acclimated in the discontinuous operation mode. Once the mode had been switched to continuous mode, the removal efficiencies of BTF2 on all pollutants increased drastically and finally exceeded the values observed in BTF1, with the single exception of p-xylene. Principle coordinate analysis and analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) showed that the structure of the microbial communities differed considerably between both BTFs (R = 1.000, p < 0.01) as well as before and after the switch in BTF2 (R = 0.996, p < 0.01). The random forest model demonstrated that Mycobacterium, Burkholderia, and Comamonas were the three most important bacterial genera contributing to the differences in microbial communities between the two BTFs. Metagenomics inferred by PICUSt (phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states) indicated that BTF2 had high degradation potential for aromatic pollutants, although those genes involved in biofilm formation were less active in BTF2 than those in BTF1.",

The aim of this study was to describe the degradation profile of NMP by the action of a consortium (PM-06) obtained from the native microbial community of this residue. The degradation was analyzed in terms of the changes in the community dynamics, production of enzymes (endo-xylanase and endo-cellulase), physicochemical parameters, and substrate chemical and microstructural characteristics, to understand the mechanisms behind the process. The consortium PM-06 degraded 86.8 ± 3.3% of NMP after 192 h of growth. Scanning electron microscopy images, and the composition and weight of the residual solids, showed that degradation was sequential starting with the consumption of hemicellulose. Xylanase was the highest enzyme activity produced, with a maximum value of 12.45 ± 0.03 U mL−1. There were fluctuations in the pH during the NMP degradation, starting with the acidification of the culture media and finishing with a pH close to 8.5. The most abundant species in the consortium, at the moment of maximum degradation activity, were Aneurinibacillus migulanus, Paenibacillus macerans, Bacillus coagulans, Microbacterium sp. LCT-H2, and Bacillus thuringiensis. The diversity of PM-06 provided metabolic abilities that in combination helped to produce an efficient process. The consortium PM-06 generated a set of different tools that worked coordinated to increase the substrate availability through the solubilization of components and elimination of structural diffusion barriers. This is the first report about the degradation of NMP using a microbial consortium.",

However, proper methods are still missing to distinguish the two processes. Here, we introduce reverse stable isotope labelling (RIL) for assessing microbial activity in BAC filters. We incubated BAC samples from three different BAC filters (two granular activated carbon- and one extruded activated carbon-based) in a buffer amended with 13C-labelled bicarbonate. By monitoring the release of 12C-CO2 from the mineralization of DOC, we could demonstrate the successful application of RIL in analysing microbial DOC degradation during drinking water treatment. Changing the water flow rates through BAC filters did not alter the microbial activities, even though apparent DOC removal efficiencies changed accordingly. Microbial DOC degradation activities quickly recovered from backwashing which was applied for removing particulate impurities and preventing clogging. The size distributions of activated carbon particles led to vertical stratification of microbial activities along the filter beds. Our results demonstrate that reverse isotope labelling is well suited to measure microbial DOC degradation on activated carbon particles, which provides a basis for improving operation and design of BAC filters.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Young barley leaf extract (YBL) contains beneficial substances such as fructans, minerals, and vitamins. The effects of YBL administration on the human colonic microbiota and its production of metabolites were evaluated using an in vitro model culture system. Fermentations were started by inoculating fecal samples from nine healthy subjects, with or without 1.5% YBL. Bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing results confirmed that YBL administration significantly increased the relative abundances of bacteria related to the genus Bifidobacterium ( p = 0.001, paired t-test) and those of the genera Faecalibacterium , Roseburia , Unclassified Ruminococcaceae , and Lachnospira ( p = 0.013, p = 0.019, p = 0.028, and p = 0.034, respectively, paired t-test). Increased abundances of the latter genera corresponded to increased butyrate production in human colonic microbiota models following fermentation with 1.5% YBL, when compared to fermentation without 1.5% YBL ( p = 0.006, Dunnett’s test). In addition, YBL administration significantly increased the production levels of amino acids such as lysine, glutamate, serine, threonine, alanine, isoleucine, leucine, valine, and phenylalanine. Therefore, our results showed the health-promoting bifidogenic and butyrogenic effects of YBL.",

The aim of this study was to investigate whether S.t-ΔpGlux/pT-ClyA inhibits colon cancer growth and recurrence by promoting increased IL-1β production. The CT26 tumor mouse model was used, and mice were treated in the following ways: PBS, S.t-ΔpGlux/pT-ClyA(+) + IL-1βAb, SL, S.t-ΔpGlux/pT-ClyA(-), and S.t-ΔpGlux/pT-ClyA(+). Dynamic evaluation of the efficacy of S.t-ΔpGlux/pT-ClyA in the treatment of colon cancer was assessed by MRI. Western blot, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry analysis were used to investigate IL-1β-derived cells and IL-1β expression on tumor cells and immune cells to analyze the regulatory mechanism. IL-1β levels in tumors colonized by S.t-ΔpGlux/pT-ClyA were significantly increased and maintained at high levels compared to control treatments. This increase caused tumors to subside without recurrence. We examined the immune cells mediating S.t-ΔpGlux/pT-ClyA-induced tumor suppression and examined the major cell types producing IL-1β. We found that macrophages and dendritic cells were the primary IL-1β producers. Inhibition of IL-1β in mice treated with S.t-ΔpGlux/pT-ClyA using an IL-1β antibody caused tumor growth to resume. This suggests that IL-1β plays an important role in the treatment of cancer by S.t-ΔpGlux/pT-ClyA. We found that in St-ΔpGlux/pT-ClyA-treated tumors, expression of molecules involved in signaling pathways, such as NLRP3, ASC, Caspase1, TLR4, MyD88, NF-kB and IL-1β, were upregulated, while in ΔppGpp S. typhimurium treated animals, TLR4, MyD88, NF-kB and IL-1β were upregulated with NLRP3, ASC, and Caspase1 being rarely expressed or not expressed at all. Using S.t-ΔpGlux/pT-ClyA may simultaneously activate TLR4 and NLRP3 signaling pathways, which increase IL-1β expression and enhance inhibition of colon cancer growth without tumor recurrence. This study provides a novel platform for treating colon cancer.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Although membrane fouling is a major issue when operating membrane bioreactors (MBRs), information regarding MBR performance and the sludge microbiome after the development of fouling remains limited. For the present study, two MBRs were operated for approximately 1 month under conditions of membrane fouling to investigate the effects of highly stressed environments on the sludge microbiome. After the development of fouling, a Collimonas -related operational taxonomic unit (OTU) was highly dominant in both reactors (relative abundances were ⁓ 63%) and this predomination caused a precipitous decline in the diversity indices of the sludge microbiomes. Because the excessive predomination by limited numbers of OTUs can lead to reductions in the adaptability to environmental changes, monitoring microbial diversity may be a valuable indicator for maintaining the robustness of a sludge microbiome. While, the decrease in the abundance of the Collimonas -related OTU resulted in the predomination of distinct microorganisms in each of the reactors despite being operated under the same conditions; this finding indicates existence of strong pressure to perturb the microbiomes. Detailed analyses suggested that the availability of terminal electron acceptors and competitive interactions between microbes via the secretion of extracellular proteins appeared to differentiate the structures of the respective microbial communities. During the extracellular proteins were secreted in the sludge, considerable portion of microbes were dead and large amounts of biomolecules seemed to be released; resultantly facilitated the predomination of fermentative anaerobes in one reactor as they use organic substances but not inorganic terminal electron acceptors to generate ATP under anaerobic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Soybean mosaic virus (SMV) is one of the most destructive viral diseases in soybean and causes severe reduction of soybean yield and destroys the seed quality. However, the production of SMV resistant plants by transgenic is the most effective and economical means. Based on our previous yeast two-hybrid assay, the GmVma12 was selected as a strong candidate gene for further function characterization. Here we transformed soybean plants with a construct containing inverted repeat of- GmVma12 sequence to analyze the role of GmVma12 during SMV invasion. Totals of 33 T 0 and 160 T 1 plants were confirmed as positive transgenic plants through herbicide application, PCR detection and LibertyLink ® strip screening. Based on the segregation ratio and Southern Blot data, T 1 lines No. 3 and No. 7 were selected to generate T 2 plants. After SMV-SC15 inoculation, 41 T 1 and 38 T 2 plants were identified as highly resistant, and their quantification disease levels were much lower than non-transformed plants. The transcript level of GmVma12 in T 2 plants decreased to 70% of non-transformed plants. The expression level of SMV- CP transcript in T 2 transgenic plants was lower than that in non-transformed plants and SMV CP protein in T 2 plants could not be detected by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent assay, which indicated that SMV production would be inhibited in transgenic plants. Moreover, coat mottles of T 2 seeds were obliterated significantly. In conclusion, inverted repeat of the hairpin structure of GmVma12 interfered with the transcription of GmVma12 , which can induce resistance to SMV in soybean. This research lays the foundation for the mechanism of SMV pathogenesis, and provides new ideas for SMV prevention and control.",

A strain of the Gram-positive Eubacterium limosum was isolated previously for 8-PN production from more abundant precursor isoxanthohumol (IX) from hops. In this study, spent hops, an industrial side stream from the beer industry, was identified as interesting source of IX. Yet, hop-derived compounds are well-known antibacterial agents and the traces of a large variety of different compounds in spent hops interfered with growth and IX conversion. Critical factors to finally enable bacterial 8-PN production from spent hops, using a food and feed grade medium, were evaluated in this research. The use of bacterial resting cells and complex medium at a pH of 7.8–8 best fulfilled the requirements for 8-PN production and generated a solid basis for development of an economic process.",

PPD-based tests have reduced performance, however, in BCG vaccinees and in individuals with immune deficiencies. We compared the performance of skin testing with the recombinant DPPD protein against that of a standard PPD-based skin test. Our data indicates similar performance of DPPD and PPD (r 2 = 0.7689) among HIV-negative, active TB patients, all of whom presented greater than 10 mm induration following administration. In contrast to results demonstrating that PPD induced indurations greater than 5 mm (i.e., the recommended threshold for positive results in this population) in only half (19 of 38) of the HIV positive TB patients, 89.5% (34 of 38) of these participants developed indurations greater than 5 mm when challenged with DPPD. Importantly, none of the patients that were positive following PPD administration were negative following DPPD administration, indicating markedly improved sensitivity of DPPD among HIV-infected individuals. Our data indicate that DPPD has superior performance in skin testing than the current TST standard.",

The expressed PA-tagged 3CprME and 3prME polypeptides were partially purified by PA-tag affinity chromatography and had molecular weights of 85 and 75 kDa, respectively. Expressed proteins were separately verified using the following primary antibodies: the anti-PA tag antibody, DENV premembrane polyclonal antibody, and DENV envelope polyclonal antibody. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that these DENV-3CprME and 3prME formed rough, spherical DENV-LPs (DENV-LP/3CprME and DENV-LP/3prME), respectively, with a diameter of 30-55 nm. The heparin-binding assay demonstrated that these DENV-LPs contained the envelope protein domain III on their surfaces. Both DENV-LPs showed an affinity to sera from human dengue patients and immunized mice. Immunization of mice with DENV-LP/3prME significantly induced the level of antibodies compared with DENV-LP/3CprME.

It has been shown to possess remarkable biological and pharmacological activities including anticancer activity.

Results indicate that mukonal has potential to induce antiproliferative effects against MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3 cells with an IC50 of 7.5 µM. No significant toxicity of mukonal was observed in case of normal breast cells. The antiproliferative effects of mukonal were found to proceed via apoptosis, which was further supported by increased cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 and reduced expression of Bcl-2. Mukonal induced autophagic cells death in breast cancer cells as was evidenced by formation of autophagosomes and enhanced expressions of Beclin-1, LC3B-I and LC3B-II proteins. In vivo examination of anti-breast cancer property of mukonal indicated that it could potentially reduce tumor weight and volume in xenografted mice models. In conclusion, mukonal has a remarkable potential of inhibiting breast cancer via induction of apoptosis and autophagy. Mukonal also inhibited xenografted tumors models in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, mukonal may prove lead molecule in breast cancer drug discovery and treatment provided further investigations are recommended.",

This was further conjugated with folic acid to enhance targeting to specific tissue. The multiple drugs loaded in the NPs were two potent anticancer drugs doxorubicin and docetaxel. A complete characterization studies including micrographic analysis, zeta potential measurements, polydispersity index, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), encapsulation and loading efficiencies, stability and in vitro release studies were done. Cytoxicity studies were done with MTT 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, acridine orange/ethidium bromide and DAPI (4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride) staining procedures. Impediametric studies were also carried out to reinforce the reduction in cytotoxicity. Finally the cellular uptake of the NPs was seen. It was evident from the results that the multiple drugs loaded CuO NPs formed with PLGA coating were uniform, non-agglomerated in size ranging from 180 to 195 nm. The FTIR revealed no major changes in drug peaks. Encapsulation and loading efficiencies showed sufficient amount of drug being loaded into the NPs. The drug loaded NPs showed no change in size or zeta potential even after a period of 30 days. The cytotoxicity studies revealed significant reduction in toxicity after coating the surface treated with PLGA as evident from the microscopic analysis of cells. Hence the current study may be prioritized and further in vivo/in vitro studies may be carried out.",

A glycosylated laccase was purified from the fermentation broth of Cerrena unicolor CGMCC 5.1011 and corresponded to Lac2 based on MALDI-TOF MS/MS identification. Lac2 was stable at pH 5.0 and above, and was resistant to organic solvents. Lac2 displayed remarkable thermostability, with half-life time of 1.67 h at 70 ºC. Consistently, Lac2 was able to completely decolorize malachite green (MG) at high temperatures, whereas Lac7 from Cerrena sp.

In fact, several governments had to ration hand sanitizers in the retail outlets and over the counter chemist shops. Additionally, Indian government has put a cap on the prices of hand sanitizers. Currently, large sections of global and Indian population are grappling under financial crises. Therefore, mandatory hand sanitization has made an unwelcoming, yet unavoidable addition to the already-hard-to-maintain-grocery-list. Here, we have compared the anti-microbial efficacy of Patanjali Hand Sanitizer (PHS), developed and marketed by Patanjali Ayurved Ltd. (an India-based food and herbal medicine company) with one of the topmost hand sanitizers currently used under clinical set-ups. PHS has anti-microbial efficacy comparable to that of the standard hand sanitizer. Besides, disc diffusion and time-dependent thumb print assays showed that PHS has longer retentivity on the applied surfaces, suggesting lesser consumption of the sanitizer and concomitant relaxation on the monthly grocery budget. Observed anti-bacterial potency of PHS is attributed to the disruption of bacterial cell membrane, as employed by alcohol-based hand sanitizers. A rough estimation revealed that PHS is ~ 4.3 times cost effective than the standard hand sanitizer used as the positive control in this study. Taken together, PHS is a suitable alternative for existing hand sanitizers available in the market that can relax the demand-supply strain and soften significantly the burden of monthly expenditure on hand sanitizers.",

Green, low-cost, and efficient detection methods can help control such pollution. In this study, a protein biosensor, mApple-D6A3, was built from rice-derived Cd 2+ -binding protein D6A3 fused with the red fluorescent protein mApple at the N-terminus to detect the contents of heavy metals. Fluorescence intensity of mApple fused with D6A3 indicated the biosensor’s sensitivity to metal ions and its intensity was more stable under alkaline conditions. mApple-D6A3 was most sensitive to Cu 2+ , then Ni 2+ , then Cd 2+ . Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments demonstrated that mApple-D6A3 successfully bound to each of these three metal ions, and its ability to bind the ions was, from strongest to weakest, Cu 2+ &gt; Cd 2+ &gt; Ni 2+ . There were strong linear relationships between the fluorescence intensity of mApple-D6A3 and concentrations of Cd 2+ (0–100 μM), Cu 2+ (0–60 μM) and Ni 2+ (0–120 μM), and their respective R 2 values were 0.994, 0.973 and 0.973. When mApple-D6A3 was applied to detect concentrations of heavy metal ions in water (0–0.1 mM) or culture medium (0–1 mM), its accuracy for detection attained more than 80%. This study demonstrates the potential of this biosensor as a tool for detection of heavy metal ions.",

    "abstract": "Degradation of complex plant biomass demands a fine-regulated portfolio of glycoside hydrolases. The LE (LguI/Eco81I)-cloning approach was used to produce two enzyme chimeras CB and BC composed of an endoglucanase Cel5A (C) from the extreme thermophilic bacterium Fervidobacterium gondwanense and an archaeal β-glucosidase Bgl1 (B) derived from a hydrothermal spring metagenome. Recombinant chimeras and parental enzymes were produced in Escherichia coli and purified using a two-step affinity chromatography approach. Enzymatic properties revealed that both chimeras closely resemble the parental enzymes and physical mixtures, but Cel5A displayed lower temperature tolerance at 100°C when fused to Bgl1 independent of the conformational order. Moreover, the determination of enzymatic performances resulted in the detection of additive effects in case of BC fusion chimera. Kinetic measurements in combination with HPLC-mediated product analyses and site-directed mutation constructs indicated that Cel5A was strongly impaired when fused at the N-terminus, while activity was reduced to a slighter extend as C-terminal fusion partner. In contrast to these results, catalytic activity of Bgl1 at the N-terminus was improved 1.2-fold, effectively counteracting the slightly reduced activity of Cel5A by converting cellobiose into glucose. In addition, cellobiose exhibited inhibitory effects on Cel5A, resulting in a higher yield of cellobiose and glucose by application of an enzyme mixture (53.1%) compared to cellobiose produced from endoglucanase alone (10.9%). However, the overall release of cellobiose and glucose was even increased by catalytic action of BC (59.2%). These results indicate possible advantages of easily produced bifunctional fusion enzymes for the improved conversion of complex polysaccharide plant materials.",

    "abstract": "Prebiotics may be efficient for prevention of intestinal infections in humans and animals by increasing the levels of beneficial bacteria and thereby improving gut health. Using purified prebiotics may however not be cost-effective in the livestock production industry. Instead, prebiotic fibres may be released directly in the gastro-intestinal tract by feeding enzymes with a suitable substrate and allowing the prebiotics to be produced in situ. Using low doses, 0.03 % enzyme-to-substrate ratio, of the enzymes pectin lyase and polygalacturonase in combination with potato pulp, a low-value industrial by-product, we show that high molecular weight galacto-rhamnogalacturonan can be solubilized in the stomach of weaning piglets. The release of this fiber is in the order of 22–38 % of the theoretical amount, achieved within 20 min. The catalysis takes place mainly in the stomach of the animal and is then followed by distribution through the small intestines. To our knowledge, this is the first paper describing targeted production of prebiotics in an animal model.",

However, this protein shows 46% identity with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288c NADPH-dependent methylglyoxal reductase, which exhibits broad substrate specificity for aldehydes. In the present study, the YGL157w gene product (KmGRE2) was purified to homogeneity from overexpressing Escherichia coli cells and found to be a monomer. The enzyme was strictly specific for NADPH and was active with a wide variety of substrates, including aliphatic (branched-chain and linear) and aromatic aldehydes. The optimal pH for methylglyoxal reduction was 5.5. With methylglyoxal as a substrate, the optimal temperature for enzyme activity at pH 5.5 was 45°C. The enzyme retained more than 70% of its activity after incubation for 30 min at temperatures below 35°C or at pHs between 5.5 and 9.0. In addition, the KmGRE2-overexpressing E. coli showed improved growth when cultivated in cedar hydrolysate, as compared to cells not expressing the enzyme. Taken together, these results indicate that KmGRE2 is potentially useful as an inhibit decomposer in E. coli cells.",

We here described the practicality of sequence-independent amplification combined with DNA microarray analysis for simultaneous detection and genotyping of human NoVs in fecal specimens. We showed that single primer isothermal linear amplification (Ribo-SPIA) of genogroup I (GI) and genogroup II (GII) NoVs could be run through the same amplification protocol without the need to design and use any virus-specific primers. Related virus could be subtyped by the unique pattern of hybridization with the amplified product to the microarray. By testing 22 clinical fecal specimens obtained from acute gastroenteritis cases as blinded samples, 2 were GI positive and 18 were GII positive as well as 2 negative for NoVs. A NoV GII positive specimen was also identified as having co-occurrence of hepatitis A virus. The study showed that there was 100 % concordance for positive NoV detection at genogroup level between the results of Ribo-SPIA/microarray and the phylogenetic analysis of viral sequences of the capsid gene. In addition, 85 % genotype agreement was observed for the new assay compared to the results of phylogenetic analysis.",

Surface functionalizations were characterized at each step by reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS). The two functionalized gold samples both led to a loss of culturability of the yeast Candida albicans, higher than 65%, indicating that the activity of the freshly-designed surfaces was probably due to still covalently immobilized carvacrol. On the contrary, when a phenyl group replaced the terpenic moiety, the yeast culturability increased by about 30%, highlighting the specific activity of carvacrol grafted on the surfaces. Confocal microscopy analyses showed that the mode of action of the functionalized surfaces with the ester or the ether of carvacrol was, in both cases, fungicidal and not anti-adhesive.

Surface biofilms have been attributed to be associated with a ubiquitous protein domain present in all branches of bacteria, known as the GGD(/E)EF domain. While the diguanlyate cyclase activities of these proteins are universally established, the role of these proteins as diguanlyate-specific phosphodiesterases in conjunction with a EAL domain has also been reported. The VC0395_0300 protein from V. cholerae which shows biofilm forming abilities also acts as a phosphodiesterase. Interestingly, this GGD(/E)EF protein contains a EAL site in the reverse orientation. We attempted to mutate the GGEEF signature along the sequence by site-directed mutagenesis. The resultant mutants (Sebox5-7) did not show much difference in phosphodiesterase activity in comparison with the wild type protein (Sebox3), indicating the independence of the phosphodiesterase activity of the protein from the GGD(/E)EF domain. However, the ability of the mutants to form surface biofilm was significantly lesser in the case of mutations in the three central positions of the signature domain.",

Xylanolytic enzymes have a great number of possible applications in many biotechnological processes and therefore, these enzymes are continuously attracting the attention of scientists. Due to this fact, different β-Xylosidases have been isolated, purified and characterized from several bacteria and fungi. Microorganisms in this respect have gained much momentum for production of these significant biocatalysts with remarkable features. It is difficult to propagate microorganisms for efficient and cost-competitive production of β-Xylosidase from hemicelluloses due to expensive conditions of fermentation. The screening of new organisms with an enhanced production of β-Xylosidases has been made possible with the help of recombinant DNA technology. β-Xylosidase genes haven been cloned and expressed on large scale in both homologous and heterologous hosts with the advent of genetic engineering. Therefore, we have reviewed the literature regarding cloning of β-Xylosidase genes into various hosts for their heterologous production along with sequence similarities among different β-Xylosidases. The study provides insight into the current status of cloning, expression and sequence analysis of β-Xylosidases for industrial applications.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that nitric oxide donors capable of manipulating nitric oxide-mediated signaling in bacteria could induce dispersal of biofilms. Encased in extracellular polymeric substances, human and plant pathogens within biofilms are significantly more resistant to sanitizers. This is particularly a problem in refrigerated environments where food is processed. In an exercise aimed to study the potential of nitric oxide donors as biofilm dispersal in refrigerated conditions, we compared the ability of different nitric oxide donors (SNAP, NO-aspirin and Noc-5) to dislodge biofilms formed by foodborne, human and plant pathogens treated at 4 °C. The donors SNAP and Noc-5 were efficient in dispersing biofilms formed by Salmonella enterica, pathogenic Escherichia coli and Listeria innocua. The biomasses were decreased up to 30 % when compared with the untreated controls. When the plant pathogens Pectobacterium sp. and Xanthomonas sp. were tested the dispersion was mainly limited to Pectobacterium carotovorum biofilms, decreasing up to 15 % after exposure to molsidomine. Finally, the association of selected nitric oxide donors with sanitizers (DiQuat, H2O2, peracetic acid and PhenoTek II) was effective in dispersing biofilms. The best dispersal was achieved by pre-treating P. carotovorum with molsidomine and then peracetic acid. The synergistic effect was estimated up to ~35 % in dispersal when compared with peracetic acid alone. The association of nitric oxide donors with sanitizers could provide a foundation for an improved sanitization procedure for cleaning refrigerate environments.",

    "abstract": "The inactivation mechanism of photocatalytic disinfectants on bacteria is well known. In contrast, the potential inactivation of fungal spores by visible-light induced photocatalysis has been recognized, but the inactivation mechanism is poorly understood. We hypothesize that photocatalytically generated reactive oxygen species (ROSs) are directly involved in this mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we identified the roles of ROSs in the inactivation of Fusarium solani spores. As the photocatalysts, we doped TiO2 with 3 typical dopants, forming Ag/TiO2, N/TiO2 and Er3+:YAlO3/TiO2. The Ag/TiO2 photocatalysis was dominated by H2O2, with the longest lifetime among the investigated ROSs. Ag/TiO2 photocatalysis yielded almost 100 % inactivation efficiency and preserved the cell-wall shape of the spores, thus minimizing the biomolecule leakage. Er3+:YAlO3/TiO2 was dominated by h+ ROSs, yielding an inactivation efficiency of 91 %; however, the severe leakage released large numbers of molecular bio-products. Severe damage to the cell walls by the h+ species was confirmed in micrograph observations. Subsequent to cell wall breakage, the Er3+:YAlO3/TiO2 nanoparticles entered the spore cells and directly oxidized the intracellular material. The N/TiO2 photocatalysis, with •O2 − dominated ROSs, delivered intermediate performance. In conclusion, photocatalysts that generate H2O2-dominated ROSs are most preferred for spore inactivation.",

Cell free extracts yielded gold nanoparticles of hydrodynamic diameter (50–200 nm). In this study, the total protein concentration influences the nanofabrication and not only the reductase enzymes as originally thought. Powder X-ray diffraction studies confirm the crystalline nature of the gold nanoparticles. Fourier Transform Infra Red spectroscopy and thermal gravimetric analysis suggests that the biosynthesized gold nanoparticles are capped by peptides/proteins. Dispersion experiments indicate a stable dispersion of gold nanoparticles in pH 12 solutions which is also confirmed by electron microscopic analysis and validated using a surface plasmon resonance assay. The effectiveness of the dispersed nanoparticles for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol using sodium borohydride as a reductant further confirms the formation of functional gold nanoparticles. It is also reported that gold nanoparticles with mean particle diameter of 27 nm are biosynthesized inside the whole cell by transmission electron microscopy analysis. With optimized reaction conditions, maximum gold bioaccumulation with the 24 h culture age of the yeast with cellular uptake of ~1010 gold atoms at the single cell level is achieved but it is not easy to extract the gold nanoparticles from the whole resting cells.",

Daptomycin is a novel cyclic-lipopeptide antibiotic produced by Streptomyces roseosporus that has progressed as a significant anti-MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) antibiotic. But, the economic practicality of this highly valued secondary metabolite is deterred by its poor production and tedious processing methodology. The present study aims at strategic improvement of Daptomycin production through morphological variations of S. roseosporus cells. Free cells, pelletized cells and immobilized cells on ultra porous refractory brick and silk sachets were investigated for the production of Daptomycin in a lab-scale 2.0 l air-lift bioreactor. The effect(s) of nitrogen source, inoculum size and oxygen stress were analyzed for pellet formation of S. roseosporus. Interestingly, free cells produced 750 mg/l of Daptomycin in a single batch. But, the three phase broth viscosity increased due to vigorous growth of free cells which hampered the oxygen transfer rate. The cell degeneration over the time deterred pellet reusability. 1430 mg/l Daptomycin was produced using pellets for 2 batches. On the contrary, mechanical stability, buoyancy and reusability of refractory bricks and silk sachets were beneficial. Daptomycin production was recorded for 6-8 batches. Immobilized cells on refractory bricks and silk sachets led to 4895 mg/l and 3623 mg/l Daptomycin production respectively. Cell immobilization improved the three phase broth rheology and hence, the hydrodynamics within the reactor. Therefore, whole-cell immobilization could contribute to the ameliorated production of this life-saving drug.",

NASA has also approved an adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP)-based detection methodology as a means to prescreen surfaces for the presence of microbial contamination, prior to the spore assay. During Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) spacecraft assembly, test, and launch operations, 4853 surface samples were collected to verify compliance with the bioburden requirement at launch. A subset of these samples was measured for microbial cleanliness using both the NSA (n = 272) and ATP assay (n = 249). NSA results revealed that ~8% (22/272) of the samples showed the presence of at least one spore, whereas ATP assay measurements indicated that ~15% (35/249) of samples exceeded the \"threshold cleanliness limit\" of 2.3 × 10−11 mmol ATP per 25 cm2 used by MSL. Of the 22 NSA samples with a spore, 18% (4/22) were considered above the level of acceptance by both techniques. Based on post launch data analysis presented here, it was determined that this threshold cleanliness limit of 2.3 × 10−11 mmol ATP per 25 cm2 could be adopted as a benchmark for assessing spacecraft surface cleanliness. This study clearly demonstrates the value of using alternative methods to rapidly assess spacecraft cleanliness, and provides useful information regarding the process.",

Characterization was carried out via SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, followed by reversed-phase HPLC, size-exclusion HPLC and MALDI-TOF-MS. The classical in vitro bioassay, based on the induction of alkaline phosphatase activity in C2C12 cells, confirmed that hBMP-2 biological activity is mostly related to the dimeric form, being ~ 4-fold higher for the CHO-derived glycosylated form when compared with the E. coli counterpart. The E. coli -derived met-hBMP-2 has shown, by MALDI-TOF-MS, a large presence of the bioactive dimer. A more complex molecular mass (MM) distribution was found for the CHO-derived product, whose exact MM has never been reported because of its variable glycosylation. A method based on RP-HPLC was set up, allowing a quantitative and qualitative hBMP-2 determination even directly on ongoing culture media. Considering that hBMP-2 is highly unstable, presenting moreover an extremely high aggregate value, we believe that these data pave the way to a necessary characterization of this important factor when synthesized by DNA recombinant techniques in different types of hosts.",

Nanopillar topography is deterrent to only those bacteria that are attached, or in close contact with the nanopillars. The present study investigated the variation in the viability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains PAO1 (virulent) and ATCC 9027 (avirulent) on the wing surface of dragonfly ( Pantala flavescens ). Viability study indicated that only 0.2% ATCC 9027 survived when incubated with wing for 48 h in Phosphate buffered saline, while under the same conditions 43.47% PAO1 survived. Enumeration of Pseudomonas attached to wing surface suggested that, the number of PAO1 attached on the wing surface was three times lesser than ATCC 9027. Propensity of attachment of P. aeruginosa strains PAO1 and ATCC 9027 on the wing surface investigated using scanning probe microscope indicated that P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027 showed adhesion to 88% of regions and, PAO1 showed adhesion to only 48% regions tested on wing surface. PAO1 survived the bactericidal effect of wing surface by evading attachment. Three clinical isolates tested which showed viability similar to PAO1 strain, also showed lower propensity to attach to wing surface. Transcriptional level analyses using RT-PCR suggested that flagellar genes (fliE and fleS) were downregulated and genes responsible for reversible to irreversible attachment (gcbA and rsmZ) were upregulated in ATCC 9027 than PAO1 on wing surface, indicating relatively higher attachment of ATCC 9027 on wing surface. The study suggests that virulent strains of P. aeruginosa may evade attachment on wing surface. The results gain significance as bioinspired surfaces are being created towards developing antibacterial medical implants and other antibacterial surface applications.",

In this study, 12.008 μg/mL DHMF was produced from 9.045 μg/mL 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) with a yield of 1.33 g/g using the crude enzymes from fungus Ganoderma sessile . To elucidate the toxic potential for both compounds, cytotoxicity tests and acute toxicity were evaluated respectively. 5-HMF induced weak cytotoxicity in HCT-8, A549 and SGC-7901 cells and DHMF exerted no cytotoxicity on HCT-8 while induced inhibition proliferation of A549 and SGC-7901 cells. The acute toxicity study showed no mortality happened in any group even at the single dose of 2000 mg/kg body weight. These results suggest it is feasible to convert 5-HMF to DHMF via crude enzymes from fungus G. sessile under mild condition, and that DHMF displays a potential effect of antitumor in vitro with little acute toxicity.",

In this study, the main components of the BCF were examined to investigate the active component/s responsible for driving the changes in the intestinal cells. The adherence of various bifidobacteria to HT-29 cells was increased when the intestinal cells were pre-incubated with immunoglobulin G (IgG). Modulation of the intestinal cells by IgG was concentration dependent with 16 mg/mL IgG resulting in a 43-fold increase in the adhesion of Bifidobacterium longum NCIMB 8809 to HT-29 cells. Periodate treatment of colostral IgG prior to performing the colonization studies resulted in a reduction in the adhesion of the strain to the intestinal cells demonstrating that the glycans of IgG may be important in modulating the intestinal cells for enhanced commensal adhesion. IgG isolated from mature milk also resulted in significant increases in adhesion of the Bifidobacterium strains tested albeit at reduced levels (3.9-fold). The impact of IgG on the HT-29 cells was also visualised via scanning electron microscopy. This study builds a strong case for the inclusion of IgG ingredients sourced from cow's milk in functional foods aimed at increasing numbers of health promoting bacteria in the human gut.",

The cultured neuronal cells in a customized pressurized chamber were analyzed for the onset of glutathione, myeloperoxidase (MPO), cathepsin, expression of inflammatory enzymes such as cyclooxygenase (COX-1), lipoxygenase (5- LOX), sPLA2 caveolin-1, glaucoma markers and other inflammatory cytokines in the presence and absence of betalain. The results have shown that a significant increase in the expression of oxidative stress with increased activity of cathepsin B and D. On the other hand, the activity of inflammatory enzymes such as COX-1, 5- LOX, sPLA2 were significantly increased in pressure exposed cells. In addition, glaucoma simulated cells demonstrated a significant increase in the VEGF, TGF-β, BDGF, and neuroserpin compared to control. Moreover, cells predisposed to hydrostatic pressure demonstrated an increase in (p &lt; 0.01) inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, CXCR4, IL-17, IL-1β, and TNF-α levels. However, cells pre-treated with betalain improved the glutathione levels with attenuated MPO activity. Simultaneously, the levels of inflammatory cytokines and other glaucoma marker genes found restored in drug pre-treated cells. Thus, the results of the present study demonstrate that the use of betalain on ocular cells can prevent the progression of the disease that can be a suggestive therapeutic for controlling glaucoma like conditions.",

Humans can incorporate exogenous Neu5Gc into their tissues from eating red meat. Neu5Gc cannot be biosynthesized by humans due to an evolutionary mutation and has been implicated in causing inflammation causing human diseases, such as cancer. The study Neu5Gc is important in evolutionary biology and the development of potential cancer biomarkers. Unfortunately, there are several limitations to detecting Neu5Gc. The elimination of Neu5Gc involves a degradative pathway leading to the incorporation of N -glycolyl groups into glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as Gc-CN. Gc-CN has been found in humans and in animals including mice, lamb and chimpanzees. Here, we present the biosynthesis of Gc-CN in bacteria by feeding chemically synthesized N -glycolylglucosamine to Escherichia coli . A metabolically engineered strain of E. coli K4, fed with glucose supplemented with GlcNGc, converted it to N -glycolylgalactosamine (GalNGc) that could then be utilized as a substrate in the chondroitin biosynthetic pathway. The final product, Gc-CN was converted to disaccharides using chondroitin lyase ABC and analyzed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry with multiple reaction monitoring detection. This analysis showed the incorporation of GalNGc into the backbone of the chondroitin oligosaccharide.",

AR113 ( Lactobacillus plantarum ) and AR340 ( Lactobacillus paracasei ) with significantly antimicrobial β-hemolytic streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus activity were isolated from Chinese pickle through agar well diffusion assay. Through the analyses of probiotic properties in antibiofilm, lysozyme and hydrogen peroxide tolerance, bacterial surface properties, adherence ability, tooth degradation and anti-inflammatory activity, the AR113 and AR340 showed anti-adhesion activity of 45.2–71.1% and 20.3–56.8% against β-hemolytic streptococci and 15.4–52.6% and 30.7–65.9% against Staphylococcus aureus , respectively, at different concentration.

In recent years producers and consumers reported a drop of nut quality due to the presence of rot diseases caused by Gnomoniopsis smithogilvyi. Early detection of this pathogen is fundamental to the economic viability of the chestnut industry. In the present study, we developed three molecular methods based on real-time portable LAMP, visual LAMP and qPCR assays for G. smithogilvyi . The molecular assays were specific for G. smithogilvyi and did not amplify the other 11 Gnomoniopsis species and 11 other fungal species commonly associated with chestnuts. The detection limit of both the qPCR and real-time portable LAMP (P-LAMP) assays was 0.128 pg/µL, while the visual LAMP (V-LAMP) assay enabled the detection up to 0.64 pg/µL. By using these newly developed molecular tools, the pathogen was detected in symptomatic and asymptomatic nuts, but not in leaves. The reliability of these molecular methods, including the P-LAMP assay, was particularly useful in detecting G. smithogilvyi of harvested nuts in field, even in the absence of rot symptoms.",

Cells that had been starved for 2 days were free of PHB granules but resynthesized them within 30 min of growth in fresh medium with succinate. In most cases, the granules were distributed randomly, although in some cases they appeared in a more organized pattern. The rates of growth and PHB accumulation were analyzed within the frame of a Genome-Scale Metabolic Model (GSMM) containing 781 metabolic genes, 1403 reactions and 1503 metabolites. The model was used to obtain quantitative predictions of biomass yields and PHB synthesis during aerobic growth on succinate as sole carbon and energy sources. The results revealed an initial fast stage of PHB accumulation, during which all of the acetyl-CoA originating from succinate was diverted to PHB production. The next stage was characterized by a tenfold lower PHB production rate and the simultaneous onset of exponential growth, during which acetyl-CoA was predominantly drained into the TCA cycle. Previous research has shown that PHB accumulation correlates with cytosolic acetyl-CoA concentration. It has also been shown that PHB accumulation is not transcriptionally regulated. Our results are consistent with the mentioned findings and suggest that, in absence of cell growth, most of the cellular acetyl-CoA is channeled to PHB synthesis, while during exponential growth, it is drained to the TCA cycle, causing a reduction of the cytosolic acetyl-CoA pool and a concomitant decrease of the synthesis of acetoacetyl-CoA (the precursor of PHB synthesis).",

Strain robustness can be defined as the persistence of genotypic and/or phenotypic traits in a system. In this work, robustness of an engineered strain is defined as plasmid expression stability, cultivability, membrane integrity and macroscopic cell behavior and was assessed in response to implementations of sugar feeding strategies (pulses and continuous) and two plasmid stabilization systems (kanamycin resistance and Post-Segregational Killing hok/sok ). Fed-batch bioreactor cultures, relevant mode to reach high cell densities and higher cell generation number, were implemented to investigate the robustness of C. necator engineered strains. Host cells bore a recombinant plasmid encoding for a plasmid expression level monitoring system, based on eGFP fluorescence quantified by flow cytometry. We first showed that well-controlled continuous feeding in comparison to a pulse-based feeding allowed a better carbon use for protein synthesis (avoiding organic acid excretion), a lower heterogeneity of the plasmid expression and a lower cell permeabilization. Moreover, the plasmid stabilization system Post-Segregational Killing hok/sok , an autonomous system independent on external addition of compounds, showed the best ability to maintain plasmid expression level stability insuring a greater population homogeneity in the culture. Therefore, in the case of engineered C. necator , the PSK system hok/sok appears to be a relevant and an efficient alternative to antibiotic resistance system for selection pressure, especially, in the case of bioprocess development for economic and environmental reasons.",

The results indicated that this traditional Chinese medicine formula (LM) and the extract of the traditional Chinese medicine formula (LMT) downregulated pH of succus gastricus and raised pH of the ileum, and LMT obviously decreased the feed conversion ratio. Further study showed LMT and LM also significantly increased the thick and long of gastrointestinal villi. And then, 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing revealed that groups LMT and LM have higher relative abundance of the genus Lactobacillus in the colon, succus gastricus, and jejunum, which are beneficial bacteria sold as dietary supplements to aid digestion or to augment health. Meanwhile, the relative abundance levels of Prevotellaceae , Alloprevotella , and Prevotella in the colon and Clostridium in succus gastricus and jejunum were lower.

However, some drawbacks exist that require individual solutions also when P450 whole-cell catalysts are used. Herein, we compared wet resting cells and lyophilized cells of recombinant E. coli regarding P450-catalyzed oxidation and found out that lyophilized cells are well-appropriate as P450-biocatalysts. E. coli harboring CYP105D from Streptomyces platensis DSM 40041 was used as model enzyme and testosterone as model substrate. Conversion was first enhanced by optimized handling of resting cells. Co-expression of the alcohol dehydrogenase from Rhodococcus erythropolis for cofactor regeneration did not affect P450 activity of wet resting cells (46% conversion) but was crucial to obtain sufficient P450 activity with lyophilized cells reaching a conversion of 72% under the same conditions. The use of recombinant lyophilized E. coli cells for P450 mediated oxidations is a promising starting point towards broader application of these enzymes.",

    "abstract": "Agave (Agave tequilana Weber var. azul) fermentations are traditionally carried out employing batch systems in the process of tequila manufacturing; nevertheless, continuous cultures could be an attractive technological alternative to increase productivity and efficiency of sugar to ethanol conversion. However, agave juice (used as a culture medium) has nutritional deficiencies that limit the implementation of yeast continuous fermentations, resulting in high residual sugars and low fermentative rates. In this work, fermentations of agave juice using Saccharomyces cerevisiae were put into operation to prove the necessity of supplementing yeast extract, in order to alleviate nutritional deficiencies of agave juice. Furthermore, continuous fermentations were performed at two different aeration flow rates, and feeding sterilized and non-sterilized media. The obtained fermented musts were subsequently distilled to obtain tequila and the preference level was compared against two commercial tequilas, according to a sensorial analysis. The supplementation of agave juice with air and yeast extract augmented the fermentative capacity of S. cerevisiae S1 and the ethanol productivities, compared to those continuous fermentations non supplemented. In fact, aeration improved ethanol production from 37 to 40 g L(-1), reducing sugars consumption from 73 to 88 g L(-1) and ethanol productivity from 3.0 to 3.2 g (Lh)(-1), for non-aerated and aerated (at 0.02 vvm) cultures, respectively. Supplementation of yeast extract allowed an increase in specific growth rate and dilution rates (0.12 h(-1), compared to 0.08 h(-1) of non-supplemented cultures), ethanol production (47 g L(-1)), reducing sugars consumption (93 g L(-1)) and ethanol productivity [5.6 g (Lh)(-1)] were reached. Additionally, the effect of feeding sterilized or non-sterilized medium to the continuous cultures was compared, finding no significant differences between both types of cultures. The overall effect of adding yeast extract and air to the continuous fermentations resulted in 88 % increase in ethanol productivity. For all cultures, pH was not controlled, reaching low pH values (from 2.6 to 3). This feature suggested a reduced probability of contamination for prolonged continuous cultures and explained why no significant differences were found between continuous cultures fed with sterilized or non-sterilized media. Concentrations of volatile compounds quantified in the distillates (tequila) were in the allowed ranges established by the Mexican regulation of tequila (NOM-006-SCFI-2012, Norma Oficial Mexicana: Bebidas alcohólicas-Tequila-specificaciones, 2012). The preference level of the distillates was similar to that of two well-known commercial tequilas. The results suggested the possibility of implementing this innovative technology on an industrial scale, attaining high productivities and using non-sterilized agave juice.",

This system allows nearly instantaneous determination of total VOC production by utilizing a platinum catalyst to completely and quantitatively oxidize headspace VOCs to CO2 in coordination with a CO2 detector. Measurement of respiratory CO2 by bypassing the catalyst allowed the total VOC content to be determined from the difference in the two signals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of a platinum catalyst and CO2 detector being used to quantify the total VOCs produced by a complex bioreactor system. Continuous recording of these CO2 data provided a record of respiration and total VOC production throughout the experiments. Proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) was used to identify and quantify major VOCs. The sum of the individual compounds measured by PTR-MS can be compared to the total VOCs quantified by the platinum catalyst to identify potential differences in detection, identification and calibration. PTR-MS measurements accounted on average for 94 % of the total VOC carbon detected by the platinum catalyst and CO2 detector. In a model system, a VOC producing endophytic fungus Nodulisporium isolate TI-13 was grown in a solid state reactor utilizing the agricultural byproduct beet pulp as a substrate. Temporal changes in production of major volatile compounds (ethanol, methanol, acetaldehyde, terpenes, and terpenoids) were quantified by PTR-MS and compared to the total VOC measurements taken with the platinum catalyst and CO2 detector. This analytical system provided fast, consistent data for evaluating VOC production in the nonhomogeneous solid state reactor system.",

In order to develop viable control methods for fed-batch fermentation of Rhamnolipid production, multiple substrate feeding strategies were employed and their efficiencies were compared with different substrates concentration of glucose, nitrogen and phosphorous. The product formation depends upon the substrate feeding strategy and so, the fed-batch fermentation was carried out by using P. aeruginosa providing substrates at manifold rates.

Four plain emulgel formulas were prepared by mixing stearic acid/yellow soft paraffin-based O/W emulsion formulae based on Carbopol 940, Na alginate, Na carboxymethylcellulose or Hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose E4. Sodium alginate-based emulgel was selected for preparation of four medicated emulgel formulations combining LRJ and GE at four different concentrations. The selected medicated emulgels were used for the in vivo studies. The emulgel formulated with Na alginate and HPMC (MF3) exhibited optimum smooth homogeneous consistency, neutral pH, acceptable viscosity, spreadability, extrudability values and best storage stability properties. In vivo results revealed that, the wounds infected with MRSA isolate in rates were wet (oozing) and showed pus formation when compared to injured uninfected wounds. MF3 formula containing 4% LRJ and 50% GE showed the maximum wound healing properties, both in the apparent physical wound healing measurements and in the histopathological examination. In conclusion, the medicated emulgel formulation (MF3) prepared with Na alginate was found optimum for topical application. MF3 formula containing 4% LRJ and 50% GE has shown the highest in vivo wound healing capacities. Further clinical studies should be conducted to prove both its safety and efficacy and the potential use in human.",

    "abstract": "The sustainable production of sunflower (Helianthus annuus) is crucial and one way to accomplish this feat is to have an understanding of the beneficial bacteria of sunflower rhizosphere. Similarly, the respiratory response of these bacteria needs to be studied to understand their roles in the ecosystem. This study was therefore conceptualized to gain insights into the effects of soil properties and carbon substrate utilization on bacterial community diversity of sunflower rhizosphere grown in Ditsobottla and Kraaipan, North West Province, South Africa. Extracted DNA from sunflower rhizosphere and bulk soils was subjected to 16S amplicon sequencing. Significant differences were observed in the alpha and beta diversities of the soil bacterial communities (p < 0.05). At the order level, among all the bacterial taxa captured in the farms, Bacillales were the most dominant. The abundance of Lactobacillales, Bacillales, Rhizobiales, Enterobacteriales, Burkholderiales, Flavobacteriales, Sphingomonadales, Myxococcales, and Nitrosomonadales obtained from Ditsobottla rhizosphere soil (R1) was positively influenced by organic matter (OM), while the abundance of Planctomycetales, Cytophagales, Gemmatimonadales, Nitrospirales and Caulobacteriales from Kraaipan rhizosphere soil (R2) was positively influenced by total N and pH. Bacterial communities of all the soil samples utilized the different carbon substrates (three amino acids, six carbohydrates, and three carboxylic acids) as an energy source. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were only observed in tryptophan and methionine amended soils. Unclassified bacteria were also captured in this study, such bacteria can further be harnessed for sustainable production of sunflower and other agricultural crops.",

    "abstract": "Dietary fat is an important part of human diet and has a close relationship with human health. However, it is still unclear how gut microbiota in adolescent responds to dietary fats at a normal dose. In this study, fat-free group (BC) was used as blank control group, we explored blood index and gut microbiota structure in growing rat(aged 1 months) after feeding a normal dose of 16.9% stewed lard(SL), refined lard(RL), fish oil(FO) and soybean oil(SO) for 6 weeks, respectively. The results showed that compared with RL group, SL group showed reduced fasting blood sugar and blood lipid levels and improved nutrient absorption capacity of the intestine. The blood indexes of glucose (Glu), total cholesterol (TC) and total triglyceride (TG) in FO treatment group were relatively low. The abundance of Bacteroidetes in the BC group decreased, and the abundance of Firmicutes increased. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio of the FO group was relatively low, and the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio of the SL group and the SO group was lower than that of the RL group. The abundance of Bacteroidaceae in the SL group was increased. Research results showed that fat-free diets will increase the risk of obesity to a certain extent; compared with refined lard, stewed lard, soybean oil and fish oil can reduce the risk of obesity to a certain extent. The present study could find that the addition and types of dietary fat will affect the abundance and diversity of rat intestinal flora, and provide some information for nutritional evaluation about these dietary lipids.",

The occurrence of hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKp) infections is gradually increasing worldwide, and disinfectant resistance is also being reported. Carbapenem- and disinfectant-resistant hvKp infection has made clinical treatment and nosocomial infection control among children increasingly challenging. In this study, whole-genome sequencing was conducted among 34 Carba NP-positive carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) strains, and the distribution of antibiotic resistance genes, virulence genes and disinfectant resistance genes was determined. Eleven distinct STs were identified, and most of them were ST11 (58.8%). Among the carbapenem resistance genes, KPC-2 was predominant (61.8%), followed by NDM-1 (26.5%) and IPM-4 (11.8%), and no other carbapenemase genes were found. Twelve virulence genes were investigated. All 34 CRKP strains carried the following virulence genes: rcsA/B, entA, fimA/H and mrkA/D. The gene iucB was present in only 3 (8.9%) CRKP strains. The positive detection rates of the iroN and ybtA genes were 94.1% and 64.7%, respectively. None of the strains was found to carry the rmpA and iroB genes. Two disinfectant resistance genes were investigated in this study. Twenty-one (61.8%) strains carried both the qacE and cepA disinfectant resistance genes, 13 (38.2%) CRKP strains carried only the cepA gene, and no strains with only the qacE gene was detected. The correlations among virulence, drug resistance and disinfectant tolerance showed that the virulence and disinfectant resistance genes were distinct among several types of carbapenemase-producing CRKP strains.",

In this paper, the antifeedant and larvicidal potentials of 69 fungal isolates were screened against the Egyptian cotton leafworm Spodoptera littoralis . A total of 17 isolates showed the insecticidal potentials with three promising isolates. These strains were Aspergillus sydowii , Lasiodiplodia theobromae , and Aspergillus flavus isolated from Ricinus communis (bark), Terminalia arjuna (Bark), and Psidium guajava (twigs), respectively. The effect of gamma irradiation on the antifeedant and larvicidal activities of the three strains was investigated. Exposure of the fungal spores to 1000 Gy of gamma rays significantly intensified both the antifeedant and larvicidal potentials. To identify compounds responsible for these activities, extracts of the three strains were fractionated by thin layer chromatography. The nature of the separated compounds namely, Penitrem A, 1, 3, 5, 8- tetramethyl- 4, 6-diethyl- 7- [2- (methoxycarbonyl)ethyl] porphyrin (from A. sydowii ), Penitrem A, 2, 7, 12, 17-Tetramethyl-3, 5:8, 10:13, 15:18, 20-tetrakis (2,2-dimethylpropano) porphyrin (from A. flavus ), N,N-Diethyl-3-nitrobenzamide, and Diisooctyl-phthalate (from L. theobromae ) were studied by GC-MS analysis. These findings recommend endophytic fungi as promising sources of novel natural compounds to mitigate harmful insects.",

In this study, 31 fungus–methanogen co-cultures were first obtained from the rumen of yaks grazing in Qinghai Province, China, using the Hungate roll-tube technique. The fungi were identified according to morphological characteristics and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences. The methanogens associated with each fungus were identified by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. They were five co-culture types: Neocallimastix frontalis + Methanobrevibacter ruminantium, Neocallimastix frontalis + Methanobrevibacter gottschalkii, Orpinomyces joyonii + Methanobrevibacter ruminantium, Caecomyces communis + Methanobrevibacter ruminantium, and Caecomyces communis + Methanobrevibacter millerae . Among the 31 co-cultures, during the 5-day incubation, the N. frontalis + M. gottschalkii co-culture YakQH5 degraded 59.0%–68.1% of the dry matter (DM) and 49.5%–59.7% of the neutral detergent fiber (NDF) of wheat straw, corn stalk, rice straw, oat straw and sorghum straw to produce CH 4 (3.0–4.6 mmol/g DM) and acetate (7.3–8.6 mmol/g DM) as end-products. Ferulic acid (FA) released at 4.8 mg/g DM on corn stalk and p -coumaric acid (PCA) released at 11.7 mg/g DM on sorghum straw showed the highest values, with the following peak values of enzyme activities: xylanase at 12,910 mU/mL on wheat straw, ferulic acid esterase (FAE) at 10.5 mU/mL on corn stalk, and p -coumaric acid esterase (CAE) at 20.5 mU/mL on sorghum straw. The N. frontalis + M. gottschalkii co-culture YakQH5 from Qinghai yaks represents a new efficient combination for lignocellulose biodegradation, performing better than previously reported fungus–methanogen co-cultures from the digestive tract of ruminants.",

    "abstract": "Carbon catabolite repression (CCR) enables preferential utilization of easily metabolizable carbon sources, implying the presence of mechanisms to ensure discriminatory gene repression depending on the ambient carbon sources. However, the mechanisms for such hierarchical repression are not precisely understood. In this report, we examined how deletion of pkaA and ganB, which encode cAMP signaling factors, and creA, which encodes a well-characterized repressor of CCR, affects CCR of hemicellulase genes in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans. β-Xylanase production increased not only in ΔcreA but also in ΔpkaA and ΔganB, with the highest level observed in their double deletants, irrespective of the presence or absence of D-glucose. Expression of the β-xylanase genes in the presence of D-glucose was de-repressed in all the deletion mutants, with significantly higher tolerance against D-glucose repression in ΔpkaA and ΔganB than in ΔcreA. In the presence of galactomannan and D-glucose, partial de-repression of β-mannanase production was detected in ΔcreA, but not in ΔpkaA and ΔganB. The double deletion of creA/pkaA and creA/ganB led to earlier production. Release from D-glucose repression of the β-mannanase genes was partial in the single deletants, while nearly full de-repression was observed in ΔcreAΔpkaA and ΔcreAΔganB. The contribution of PkaA and GanB to CCR by D-xylose of the β-mannanase genes was very minor compared to that of CreA. Consequently, the present study revealed that cAMP signaling plays a major role in CCR of hemicellulase gene expression in a manner that is clearly independent from CreA.",

In this study, we selected BacPelA, the pectin lyase with the highest expression activity from Bacillus clausii, modified and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Through fragment replacement, the catalytic activity of the enzyme was significantly improved. The optimum pH and temperature of the modified pectin lyase (PGLA-rep4) were 11.0 and 70 °C, respectively. It also exhibited a superior ability to cleave methylated pectin. The enzyme activity of PGLA-rep4, measured at 235 nm with 0.2% apple pectin as the substrate, was 554.0 U/mL, and the specific enzyme activity after purification using a nickel column was 822.9 U/mg. After approximately 20 ns of molecular dynamics simulation, the structure of the pectin lyase PGLA-rep4 tended to be stable. The root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) values at the key catalytically active site, LYS168, were higher than those of the wildtype PGLA. In addition, PGLA-rep4 was relatively stable in the presence of metal ions. PGLA-rep4 has good enzymatic properties and activities and maintains a high pH and temperature. This study provides a successful strategy for enhancing the catalytic activity of PGLA-rep4, making it the ultimate candidate for degumming and various uses in the pulp, paper, and textile industries.",

In this study, our aim was to improve the biocatalytic production of aurachin D from a quinolone precursor molecule with recombinant Escherichia coli cells expressing the biosynthesis enzyme AuaA. In order to achieve a high-level production of this membrane-bound farnesyltransferase in E. coli, the expression of the auaA gene was translationally coupled to an upstream cistron in accordance with a bicistronic design (BCD) strategy. Screening of various BCD elements led to the identification of optimized auaA expression cassettes, which increased the aurachin D titer in E. coli up to 29-fold in comparison to T7-mediated expression. This titer could be further raised by codon optimization of auaA and by introducing the mevalonate pathway into the production strain. The latter measure was intended to improve the availability of farnesyl pyrophosphate, which is needed as a cosubstrate for the AuaA-catalyzed reaction. In sum, the described efforts resulted in a strain producing aurachin D with a titer that is 424 times higher than that obtained with the original, non-optimized expression host.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Monkeypox (MPX) is a common zoonotic disease caused by a double-strand DNA MPX virus (MPXV). MPX was considered a sporadic rare disease causing a mild disease with a low capacity to spread among humans. The clinical picture of human MPX highly resembles smallpox, though early lymphadenopathy in human MPX is the distinguishing sign not present in smallpox. The incubation period is 1–3 weeks, and fever, headache, joint pain, myalgia, and nausea for about 3 days. Skin lesions that appear 1–3 days following fever and lymphadenopathy usually appear simultaneously on the face and periphery. By cross-reactivity and protection, the smallpox vaccine produced 85% protection against infection with Orthopoxviruses, including MPX. Antiviral drugs like tecovirimate and brincidofovir could be effective agents against the development of MPX. MPX epidemics are less reported and described as other life-threatening epidemics, leading to an unclear picture of this disease’s pathogenesis, epidemiology, and management. With the recent wide range of MPX outbreaks, immense research is mandatory to revise the importance of MPX pathogenesis and risk for epidemic development worldwide. Therefore, this critical study aimed to review MPX's pathogenesis, epidemiology, and management with possible repurposed drugs.",

    "abstract": "Fusarium crown and foot rot, caused by F. solani f. sp. cucurbitae, are major fungal diseases affecting zucchini and other cucurbits. Despite the efficacy of synthetic fungicides, their health and environmental hazards have highlighted the urgent need for safer alternatives, such as phytochemical-based biocides. Owing to the upregulation of the plant secondary metabolism under stressful conditions, bioprospecting in harsh environments could reveal ore plants for bioactive metabolites. In this study, thirteen wild plants were collected from their natural habitat in a semiarid environment (Yanbu, Saudi Arabia) and extracted to obtain phenolics rich extracts. Total polyphenols, flavonoids, antioxidant capacities and the antifungal activities of the extracts against a pathogenic isolate of F. solani were assessed. Fusarium solani was isolated from infected zucchini and characterized by scanning electron microscopy. Hierarchical clustering analysis of the phytochemical screening and in vitro bioactivity revealed that Rosmarinus officinalis, Pulicaria crispa, Achillea falcata and Haloxylon salicornicum were the richest in polyphenols and the most powerful against F. solani. Further, the extracts of these four plants significantly decreased the disease incidence in zucchini, where P. crispa was the premier. Interestingly, results of transmission electron microscopy revealed that extract of P. crispa, as a representative of the powerful group, induced ultrastructural disorders in fungal cells. Therefore, this study suggests the use of R. officinalis, P. crispa, A. falcata and H. salicornicum grown in semi-arid environments as ore plants to develop phytochemical-based biocides against Fusarium crown and foot rot.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The growing awareness about the adverse health effects of artificial synthetic preservatives has led to a rapid increase in the demand for safe food preservation techniques and bio preservatives. Thus, in this study, the biopreservatives efficacy of enterocin-producing Enterococcus faecium Smr18 and its enterocin, ESmr18 was evaluated against Salmonella enterica contamination in chicken samples. E. faecium Smr18 is susceptible to the antibiotics penicillin-G, ampicillin, vancomycin, and erythromycin, thereby indicating that it is a nonpathogenic strain. Further, the enterocin ESmr18 was purified and characterised as a 3.8 kDa peptide. It possessed broad spectrum antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens including S. enterica serotypes Typhi and Typhimurium. Purified ESmr18 disrupted the cell membrane permeability of the target cell thereby causing rapid efflux of potassium ions from L. monocytogenes and S. enterica. Chicken samples inoculated with S. enterica and packaged in alginate films containing immobilised viable E. faecium resulted in 3 log 10 colony forming units (CFU) reduction in the counts of S. enterica after 34 days of storage at 7–8 °C. The crude preparation of ESmr18 also significantly (p &lt; 0.05) reduced the CFU counts of salmonella- inoculated chicken meat model. Purified ESmr18 at the concentration upto 4.98 µg/ml had no cytolytic effect against human red blood cells. Crude preparation of ESmr18 when orally administered in fish did not cause any significant (p &lt; 0.05) change in the biochemical parameters of sera samples. Nonsignificant changes in the parameters of comet and micronucleus assays were observed between the treated and untreated groups of fishes that further indicated the safety profile of the enterocin ESmr18.",

    "abstract": "Ralstonia eutropha H16 is a chemolithoautotrophic bacterium with O2-tolerant hydrogenase (Hyds) enzymes. Hyds are expressed in the presence of gas mixtures (H2, O2, CO2) or under energy limitation and stress conditions. O2-tolerant Hyds are promising candidates as anode biocatalysts in enzymatic fuel cells (EFCs). Supplementation of 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract to the fructose-nitrogen (FN) growth medium enhanced H2-oxidizing Hyd activity ~ sixfold. Our study aimed to identify key metabolites (L-amino acids (L-AAs) and vitamins) in yeast extract that are necessary for the increased synthesis and activity of Hyds. A decrease in pH and a reduction in ORP (from + 240 ± 5 mV to - 180 mV ± 10 mV values) after 24 h of growth in the presence of AAs were observed. Compared to the FN-medium control, supplementation of 7.0 μmol/ml of the L-AA mixture stimulated the growth of bacteria ~ 1.9 to 2.9 fold, after 72 h. The whole cells' H2-oxidizing Hyd activity was not observed in control samples, whereas the addition of L-AAs, mainly glycine resulted in a maximum of ~ 22 ± 0.5 and 15 ± 0.3 U, g CDW-1 activity after 24 h and 72 h, respectively. Our results suggest a correlation between ORP, pH, and function of Hyds in R. eutropha H16 in the presence of key L-AAs. L-AAs used in small amounts can be proposed as signaling molecules or key components of Hyd maturation. These results are important for the optimization of O2-tolerant Hyds production as anode biocatalysts.",

    "abstract": "Roseocin, the two-peptide lantibiotic from Streptomyces roseosporus, carries extensive intramolecular (methyl)lanthionine bridging in the peptides and exhibits synergistic antibacterial activity against clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogens. Both peptides have a conserved leader but a diverse core region. The biosynthesis of roseocin involves post-translational modification of the two precursor peptides by a single promiscuous lanthipeptide synthetase, RosM, to install an indispensable disulfide bond in the Rosα core along with four and six thioether rings in Rosα and Rosβ cores, respectively. RosM homologs in the phylum actinobacteria were identified here to reveal twelve other members of the roseocin family which diverged into three types of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Further, the evolutionary rate among the BGC variants and analysis of variability within the core peptide versus leader peptide revealed a phylum-dependent lanthipeptide evolution. Analysis of horizontal gene transfer revealed its role in the generation of core peptide diversity. The naturally occurring diverse congeners of roseocin peptides identified from the mined novel BGCs were carefully aligned to identify the conserved sites and the substitutions in the core peptide region. These selected sites in the Rosα peptide were mutated for permitted substitutions, expressed heterologously in E. coli, and post-translationally modified by RosM in vivo. Despite a limited number of generated variants, two variants, RosαL8F and RosαL8W exhibited significantly improved inhibitory activity in a species-dependent manner compared to the wild-type roseocin. Our study proves that a natural repository of evolved variants of roseocin is present in nature and the key variations can be used to generate improved variants.",

Apart from TB, the members of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), which includes around 170 species, may also cause different diseases in humans. Therefore this study aimed to investigate the distribution of NTM strains isolated from extrapulmonary (EP) samples by Real-Time PCR and PCR-sequencing methods in Southwest Iran. Three hundred and twenty-five suspected EP samples were collected from patients referred to the referral hospitals in Ahvaz, Iran. The isolates were initially screened by acid fast staining and identified by phenotypic culture and biochemical tests. The Real-Time PCR and rpoB- based PCR methods were performed followed by sequence analysis of rpoB gene. From 124 samples, 77 (62%) were positive for NTM by culture and rpoB sequence analysis. M. fortuitum was the most commonly isolated NTM in present study. In Real-Time PCR, only 69 (55.64%) isolates showed more homology with standard NTM isolates. In general, the growing trend of EPNTM infections in Iran needs specific programs and resources to get a better diagnosis. PCR sequencing is a reliable method, it can be used for definitive identification of positive cultures for identification of NTM species.",

    "abstract": "Deoxynivalenol (DON) is one of the most prevalent mycotoxin contaminants, which posing a serious health threat to animals and humans. Previous studies have found that individually supplemented probiotic or glycyrrhinic acid (GA) could degrade DON and alleviate DON-induced cytotoxicity. The present study investigated the effect of combining GA with Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) using orthogonal design on alleviating IPEC-J2 cell damage induced by DON. The results showed that the optimal counts of S. cerevisiae and E. faecalis significantly promoted cell viability. The optimal combination for increasing cell viability was 400 µg/mL GA, 1 × 106 CFU/mL S. cerevisiae and 1 × 106 CFU/mL E. faecalis to make GAP, which not only significantly alleviated the DON toxicity but also achieved the highest degradation rate of DON (34.7%). Moreover, DON exposure significantly increased IL-8, Caspase3 and NF-κB contents, and upregulated the mRNA expressions of Bax, Caspase 3, NF-κB and the protein expressions of Bax, TNF-α and COX-2. However, GAP addition significantly reduced aforementioned genes and proteins. Furthermore, GAP addition significantly increased the mRNA expressions of Claudin-1, Occludin, GLUT2 and ASCT2, and the protein expressions of ZO-1, Claudin-1 and PePT1. It was inferred that the combination of GA, S. cerevisiae, and E. faecalis had the synergistic effect on enhancing cell viability and DON degradation, which could protect cells from DON-induced damage by reducing DON cytotoxicity, alleviating cell apoptosis and inflammation via inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway, improving intestinal barrier function, and regulating nutrient absorption and transport. These findings suggest that GAP may have potential as a dietary supplement for livestock or humans exposed to DON-contaminated food or feed.",

    "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori OipA (Outer Inflammatory Protein A) is an outer membrane protein that takes role in the adherence and colonization to the stomach. oipA gene expression is regulated by the slipped-strand mispairing mechanism through a hypermutable CT dinucleotide repeat motif in the 5΄ region. Alterations in the CT number repeats cause frame-shift mutations to result in phase variation of oipA expression. While a functional \"On\" status has been recognized as a risk factor for peptic ulcer diseases and gastric cancer in many studies, some controversial findings still exist. To this end, this study compiled the sequence data of oipA from 10 different studies between 2000-2019 and 50 oipA DNA sequences from our own research that examined the relationship between the phase On/Off status of oipA and gastric diseases based on CT repeat number. Overall, we have reached 536 oipA DNA sequences from patients. This large collection of oipA sequences first clarified the absolute conservation of the peptide-pentamer of FWLHA for phase ''On'' status, suggesting this pentamer as a superior marker for the determination of oipA status than counting the number of CT repeats. Combining the sequence and patient data, we have re-analyzed the association between the ''On'' status of oipA and gastric diseases. Our results showed a strong association between oipA ''On'' status and gastric cancer supporting previous findings. We also investigated the AlphaFold2 computed structure of OipA that adopts a beta-barrel fold closely resembling to the autotransporter family of H. pylori. Altogether, this study confirms a strong association between oipA ''On'' statuses and severe gastrointestinal diseases like cancer and provides useful insights into the FWLHA pentamer as an indicator of \"On\" status of oipA putative autotransporter function rather than CT repeats number.",

To obtain insights of transcriptomic response in macrofungi against heat stress , we performed RNA-seq analysis using Pleurotus tuoliensis mycelium cells that were treated under 32 °C and 36 °C for consecutive 96 h. By comparing the growth rate data, we found mycelium cells could maintain normal growth rate almost the same as control under 32 °C, yet halted the growths under 36 °C. In total, 2724 differential expressed genes were identified from the three pair-wise comparisons, which were classified to four clusters based on their expression patterns. We also performed gene set enrichment analysis using both GO and KEGG databases, and revealed 48, 113 and 105 enriched GO terms, and 1, 5, and 6 enriched KEGG pathways for three pair-wise comparisons accordingly. In addition, we identified 9 overlapping GO terms and 1 overlapping KEGG pathway shared by the three comparisons. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in cell communication, amino acid metabolic process, intracellular signal transduction and small molecule biosynthesis were identified in two heat stress treatments despite of the stress intensity. However, the expression of two heat shock protein genes ( HSP10 and HSP60 ) were induced by increasing temperature. Our findings also suggested the DEGs associated with cell cycle regulation had various expression patterns under two heat stress conditions possibly due to different functions. Furthermore, 11 DEGs related to ergosterol biosynthesis were identified with similar expression trends, indicating the ergosterol levels and cell membrane composition may have a tight connection to the acquisition of thermotolerance, which warrant further investigations for deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms in fungal stress responses.",

This investigation aimed to assess the combined therapeutic efficacy of Fluconazole and Amphotericin B for cryptococcal pneumonia and to explore the roles of miR-15b and TGF-β1 in modulating treatment response. Twenty-eight patients diagnosed with cryptococcal pneumonia were randomly allocated to receive either Amphotericin B monotherapy (control group) or a combination of Amphotericin B and Fluconazole (observation group) over a 14-day period. Key respiratory function indices—forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and FEV1/FVC ratios—were measured pre- and post-treatment, alongside levels of procalcitonin (PCT), soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1), miR-15b, and TGF-β1. Results demonstrated marked improvements in pulmonary function within the observation group, with significantly higher FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC values than those in the control group (P < 0.05). Additionally, the observation group exhibited greater reductions in PCT and sTREM-1, coupled with notable elevations in miR-15b and TGF-β1 levels. The combination therapy achieved a total response rate of 92.86%, significantly surpassing the control's 57.14% efficacy (P < 0.05). These findings indicate that Fluconazole combined with Amphotericin B not only enhances clinical efficacy by mitigating inflammation but also supports lung function recovery with a favourable safety profile, highlighting its utility in managing cryptococcal pneumonia effectively.",

    "abstract": "Resistant and virulent strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) are rapidly disseminated among both hospitalized patients and communities, therefore, the identification of the genes responsible for virulence and resistance, along with the clonal relatedness of these strains, could be beneficial in the management of the dissemination of these strains among patients. The aim of the present study was to assess antibiotic susceptibility, virulence and resistance genes, as well as the genetic relatedness of K. pneumoniae strains isolated from patients admitted to four hospitals in Mazandaran, Iran. A total of 95 K. pneumoniae were gathered from hospitalized patients. All isolates were confirmed using biochemical and conventional microbiological methods, followed by the assessment of susceptibility patterns through disk diffusion and the detection of resistance and virulence genes using conventional PCR. The genetic diversity of clinical isolates was determined using the Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus PCR (ERIC-PCR) technique. The resistance frequencies varied, with the highest being for ampicillin/sulbactam (95.8%) and the lowest for fosfomycin (3.2%). Only one strain displayed a non-MDR profile against all antibiotics tested. Virulence-associated genes were detected, such as mrkD (90.5%), fimH (80%), entB (92.6%), iutA (25.3%), and ybtS (68.4%). Genes associated with efflux pumps and outer membrane porins included acrAB (98.9%), tolC (95.8%), mdtK (83.2%), ompK35 (95.8%), and ompK36 (92.6%). Based on ERIC-PCR patterns with a 90% similarity, the isolates were categorized into 17 distinct clusters. While the majority of isolates had a same profile and were grouped in the predominant pattern, 11 isolates were identified as singletons. Our study indicates that the prevalence of MDR K. pneumoniae carrying virulence genes and exhibiting close relatedness underscores the urgent need for effective strategies to control and prevent infections caused by K. pneumoniae.",

This study aims to identify various NTM strains from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, assess their drug resistance profiles, and investigate the risk factors associated with NTM disease. Gene chip technology was used to identify NTM strains. The broth microdilution method assessed the drug sensitivity of isolated NTM pathogenic bacteria, determining their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Logistic regression analysis identified potential risk factors for NTM disease. Results showed the slow-growing NTM strains isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid to be predominantly Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium intracellulare, accounting for 32.05% and 29.49% of the isolates, respectively. The rapidly growing NTM strains were mainly Mycobacterium chelonae and Mycobacterium abscessus, each constituting 25.64% of the isolates. Mycobacterium avium was found to be sensitive to clarithromycin, while linezolid demonstrated high antibacterial efficacy against Mycobacterium intracellulare. In drug susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium chelonae and Mycobacterium abscessus, amikacin exhibited the highest sensitivity, followed by clarithromycin. For patients with NTM-positive cultures, the risk factors for NTM lung disease included age (45-60 years, > 60 years), a smoking history exceeding 10 years, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, immunocompromised status, and the presence of thin-walled pulmonary cavities. Collectively, this study elucidates the distribution of NTM strains, their drug susceptibility profiles, and key risk factors for NTM lung disease, highlighting the need for proactive screening, early intervention, and targeted preventive strategies to improve diagnosis and optimize treatment outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The rise of deaths by resistant bacteria is a global threat to public health systems. Klebsiella pneumoniae is a virulent pathogen that causes serious nosocomial infections. The major obstacle to bacterial treatment is antibiotic resistance, which necessitates the introducing of alternative therapies. Phage therapy has been regarded as a promising avenue to fight multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. In the current study, a novel phage vB_KpnP_KP17 was isolated from sewage, and its lytic potential was investigated against K. pneumoniae. The isolated phage vB_KpnP_kP17 was lytic to 17.5% of tested K. pneumoniae isolates. One step growth curve indicated a virulent phage with a short latent period (20 min) and large burst size (331 PFU/cell). Additionally, vB_KpnP_kP17 maintained its activity against planktonic cells over a wide range of pH, temperature and UV irradiation intervals. The potential of vB_KpnP_KP17 as antibiofilm agent was revealed by the biofilm inhibition assay. The isolated phage vB_KpnP_KP17 at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 inhibited more than 50% of attached biofilms of tested K. pneumoniae isolates. The genome of vB_KpnP_kP17 was characterized and found to be a linear dsDNA of 39,936 bp in length and GC content of 52.85%. Additionally, the absence of toxicity, virulence and antibiotic resistance genes further confirms the safety of vB_KpnP_KP17 for clinical applications. These characteristics make vB_KpnP_KP17 of a potential therapeutic value to manage MDR K. pneumoniae infections. Additionally, the formulation of vB_KpnP_KP17 in a cocktail with other lytic phages or with antibiotics could be applied to further limit biofilm-producing K. pneumoniae infections.",

    "abstract": "Marbled eels are migratory between freshwater, brackish, and saltwater environments. Eel mucus contains biological components that are essential in protecting against environmental pathogens. The biological activity of mucus depends on endogenous and exogenous factors. This study aimed to determine the influence of solvents in extracting bioactive compounds from marbled eel mucus for aquaculture and human healthcare applications. The results show that different solvents affect the composition and biological activity of the extract from marbled eel mucus. The extracts have 19–23 other peaks of compounds, with retention times ranging from 0.8 to 60.0 min on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The selective extraction rate of components (% area) has significant differences between extracts with different solvents. The eel mucus extracted with acetone solvent exhibited the highest biological activity in all tests: IC50 = 36.603 mg/mL and SC% = 98.424% at 100 mg/mL for antioxidant activity; Antibacterial activity was demonstrated against S. aureus (IC50 = 65.00 ± 3.01 µg/mL) and B. subtilis (IC50 = 112.00 ± 7.89 µg/mL); The ability to inhibit human skin cancer cells (IC50 = 465.96 ± 8.54 µg/mL) and normal cells (IC50 = 453.36 ± 17.88 µg/mL). Extracts extracted with n-Hexane solvent showed higher safety for cells than extracts from other solvents (IC50 = 632.43 ± 18.80 µg/mL, higher than the value IC50 = 545.25 ± 26.36 µg/mL for skin cancer cells). These results provide important data for selecting and applying products derived from extracts of marbled eel mucus in the future, sparking excitement and optimism about this research's potential impact on aquaculture and human health care.",

    "abstract": "Triterpenoids exhibit considerable potential and are extensively utilized in both food and pharmaceutical industries. However, Athelia termitophila (TMB) naturally harbors only trace amounts of these compounds. Consequently, this study sought to optimize the composition of the culture medium and its cultivation parameters to augment both triterpenoids biosynthesis and TMB biomass. To this end, a series of systematic experiments were carried out. At the outset, a One Factor at a Time (OFAT) approach was employed to identify key culture components and conditions. Based on the OFAT findings, six factors were selected for further investigation using the Plackett-Burman design (PBD) to assess their influence on triterpenoids production and biomass yield. The PBD outcomes pinpointed three critical factors-cultural duration, yeast extract powder, and KH2PO4-each of which was subjected to further optimization through the Box-Behnken design (BBD). The BBD analysis determined the optimal culture medium and conditions: 30 g/L corn starch, 13.44 g/L yeast extract powder, 4.74 g/L KH2PO4, a liquid-to-volume ratio of 130/250 mL, 6% inoculum volumes, and a cultivation period of 7.8 days. Upon optimization, both triterpenoids yield (1.9-fold increase) and mycelial biomass (1.66-fold increase) were significantly enhanced compared to the unoptimized medium. This study not only provides a robust methodology for enhancing triterpenoids content and mycelial biomass in TMB, but also contributes novel insights into the biosynthesis of triterpenoids.",

    "abstract": "Lipases are extraordinarily critical co-factor-independent enzymes with profound economic consequences. They are utilized extensively in production of fine chemicals, food, textile, pulp and paper, laundry, and biodiesel sectors. In the current study, the lipolytic activity of 141 fungal isolates-representing 21 genera and 38 species-that were isolated from samples of desert soil gathered from the Governorates of Sohag, Qena, and Aswan were examined. Of the 74 isolates showed positive lipase activity, 40 were high lipase producers. In terms of lipase production, Aspergillus terreus AUMC 15762 was the most effective strain. To enhance the synthesis of lipase from Aspergillus terreus AUMC 15762, Plackett-Burman design (PBD) was employed. For the maximal amount of lipase synthesis (103.3 U/mL), ammonium sulphate was required after three days at 25 °C, pH 4.0, and 3.0 g/L. Through the use of Trilite MA 12 anion exchanger and Sephadex G-100 column chromatography, lipase was purified 17.79 times and achieved 64.714 kDa molecular weight on SDS-PAGE. The highest possible specific activity of 3867.85 ± 214.28 U/mg was attained at pH 8.0 and 40 °C. The addition of KCl and ZnSO4 raised the lipase specific activity by 115.42%. Km of 19.0 mg/mL and Vmax of 1000 μmol/min were determined for the pure lipase. The effects of 20 U/mL pure lipase on corn and olive oily spots were examined in this work at pH 8.0 and 40 °C. The pure lipase completely removed oil contamination from fiber surfaces, as evidenced by the oily spots' separation from the white cotton textiles after 60 min. This work offers a lipase produced from Aspergillus terreus species that showed promise for industrial laundry applications.",

A remarkable antimicrobial therapeutic biomaterial is needed to fight dental caries and recurrent necrotic lesions. This study used Mentha longifolia extract to synthesize Copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) with distinctive properties at room temperature (22-25 °C). These CuNPs were supplemented with cephalosporin antibiotics that act as a capping agent to explore their synergistic antibacterial potency. These nanoparticles were subjected to FTIR, XRD, UV-Vis spectrophotometry, and SEM for characterisation. These CuNPs capped with antibiotics were added to glass ionomer (GIC) cement. These GIC samples were divided into pure GIC and modified GIC samples. Antibiotic-supplemented CuNPs, conjugated with GIC, showed good effect against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as compared to conventional GIC, tested through a modified direct contact test. Among them, GIC enriched with cefotaxime-supplemented CuNPs exhibited excellent antibacterial effects, followed by Cefepime and Ceftriaxone-supplemented CuNPs, respectively. Pure GIC has the most negligible antibacterial effect. Further, the interaction of these modified GICs with the selected bacterial strains was studied using the extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (XDLVO) approach. The results show that the modified GIC effectively inhibited biofilm formation on dental implants.",

Herein, we reported the synthesis of five new 2,4-disubstituted-6-iodoquinazoline derivatives coded compounds 3a–e. The respective compounds were examined for their antiproliferative, antimicrobial, and carbonic anhydrase XII (CAXII) inhibitory activity against four cancerous cell lines. Compound 3c was proven to be the most effective as an anticancer. It stopped the growth of the four used tumor cell lines at concentrations ranging from 4.0 to 8.0 µM as compared to the reference doxorubicin (2.3–3.25 µM). Compound 3b, was able to stop the proliferation of the tumor cell lines with IC 50 between 6.0 and 9.0 µM. The five compounds exhibited both broad-spectrum and antifungal action; however, their antibacterial activities against Gram-positive bacteria were superior to those of Gram-negative. Compound 3c showed the strongest antibacterial and antifungal activities, followed by compound 3b. In conclusion, the 4-substituted-anilino derivatives equipped with sulfonamide at position 4 of the quinazoline nucleus are suitable antitumor lead compounds. Moreover, the 4-methoxyphenyl substituent at position-2 has a better impact on activity than unsubstituted or even other substituents. The lab results are aligned with molecular docking analysis of the respective compounds against the potential targets, including CAXII, human thymidylate synthase (hTS), and human thymidine kinase (hTK), for the anticancer activities and DHFR of E. coli and S. aureus for the antibacterial properties. Compounds 3c and 3b are highly recommended for preclinical and clinical evaluation as anticancer and/or antibacterial agents for potential use in humans.",

Additionally, Prx-LCA2 increased HYP content in the skin, indicating improved collagen integrity. Histological analysis of mouse skin further confirmed the therapeutic efficacy of Prx-LCA2. The enterotoxin-derived carrier system exhibited excellent biosafety profile with no observed cytotoxicity or skin irritation.

    "abstract": "Plateau environment represents a common terrestrial characterized by multistress conditions including hypobaric hypoxia, low temperature, and intense radiation, yet sustain over 100 million permanent or transient inhabitants. While this extreme environment exerts profound impacts on cerebral architecture and gut microbiota homeostasis, precipitating cognitive deficits and microbiome-derived intestinal pathologies, the mechanistic interplay between plateau environment adaptation and microbial dynamics remains contentious. Here, we employ a microbiota-gut-brain axis framework to investigate whether probiotic intervention can ameliorate hippocampal impairments induced by simulated plateau environment exposure (3500-4000 m) in mice. Through simulated plateau environment exposure experiments, we revealed that extreme high-altitude conditions induced hippocampal memory dysfunction in mice, exacerbated oxidative stress damage in hippocampal tissues, and altered synaptic plasticity-related biomarkers including CREB transcription factor, BDNF protein levels, and electrophysiological power spectra. Administration of HL79 alleviated these burdens, including memory dysfunction and tissue damage, though complete reversal was not achieved. Combined hippocampal transcriptomic analyses suggested that HL79's beneficial effects primarily involved modulation of lipid-related gene expression in the hippocampus, consistent with prior reports of plateau environmental impacts on gene expression. Serum metabolomic results further reinforced this inference that differential metabolites regulated by HL79 are mainly enriched in bile secretion, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, and PPAR signaling pathways, though the precise regulatory mechanisms require further elucidation. This research provides a novel microbiota-gut-brain axis-based regulatory strategy for adaptation to extreme plateau environments and offers new evidence for understanding the relationship between gut microbiota and plateau environment adaptation at high elevations.",

Due to the relevance of this process in WWTPs, different approaches were used in this work to monitor COMAMMOX bacteria, as well as other microorganisms involved in the biological removal of nitrogen occurring in the bioreactor of a full-scale WWTP. This facility operates with low dissolved oxygen concentrations and prolonged sludge retention times. Fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed the presence of COMAMMOX bacteria showing their distribution within the activated sludge flocs. Primers targeting the amoA gene, which encodes the A subunit of the ammonia monooxygenase enzyme, were employed as genetic markers in PCR techniques to simultaneously detect and amplify both COMAMMOX clades A and B, as well as specifically clade A, clade B, or various COMAMMOX Nitrospira species (Ca. N. nitrosa , Ca . N. inopinata , and Ca . N. nitrificans ). Using digital PCR, a set of these primers enabled the estimation of the proportion of amoA COMAMMOX genes versus other nitrifiers (AOB, AOA and NOB). The data obtained not only confirmed the presence of COMAMMOX bacteria, but also their abundance, comparable to that of NOB and AOB. The 16S rRNA gene-based meta-taxonomy analysis gave complementary data about the microbial diversity and community composition within the samples. The results also highlight the biases of each technology used as monitoring tools, which must be accurate for the effective management of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and for exploiting the potential of COMAMMOX bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In Egypt, the genus Fagonia is found in all the deserts of Egypt and the Sinai Peninsula. It is widely used to treat many diseases as a home remedy without sufficient scientific studies, especially Fagonia arabica L. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to evaluate the comprehensive phytochemical profile and biological evaluation of F. Arabica using HPLC method, antimicrobial activity, antioxidants, and cytotoxicity assays. The results showed that the phytochemical components detected in the aerial flowering parts of F. arabica were tannins, steroids, terpenoids, diterpenes, glycosides, saponins, flavonoids, phenols, alkaloids, fixed oils, carbohydrates, proteins, and amino acids. HPLC highlighted the presence of fifteen phenolic compounds present in F. arabica aqueous extract, and the highest of them were chlorogenic acid, gallic acid, and catechin. The antibacterial study of F. arabica extract showed significant inhibitory actions against Staphylococcus epidermidis , Staphylococcus aureus , Enterococcus faecalis , Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Acinetobacter baumannii with zone diameters of 20.0, 22.0, 23.0, 21.0, 17.0, and 18.0 mm, respectively. The extract of aerial flowering parts of F. arabica showed high value (IC 50 = 46.25 µg mL − 1 ) in its free radical scavenging activity. The F. arabica extract showed low cytotoxicity against the Vero and A549 cell lines with IC 50 values of 317.09 µg mL − 1 and 178.08 µg/mL, respectively. Therefore, the F. arabica extract is used as antibacterial and anticancer agents due to their high content of phytochemicals and antioxidants and can be applied in innovative pharmaceutical and medical fields.",

While extensive research has explored the effects of diseases and pathological conditions on gut microbiome composition, the influence of demographic factors remains underexplored, limiting our understanding of microbiome variations in disease states. This study addresses this gap by investigating the impact of demographic variables, including age, sex, and geography, on gut microbiome diversity in healthy individuals. Using the American Gut Project's extensive dataset and the QIIME2 bioinformatics pipeline, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of microbial profiles across diverse demographic groups. Our results revealed significant age-related shifts in microbial richness and composition, and geographic location strongly influenced phylogenetic diversity. In contrast, sex exhibited limited impact on microbial diversity within healthy BMI ranges. These findings highlight the critical role of demographic factors in shaping gut microbiome diversity, providing a foundational framework to better contextualize disease-related microbiome variations and advance personalized healthcare approaches.",

    "abstract": "Psoriasis is a persistent immune-mediated inflammatory disorder that adversely affects the skin. Interleukin-22 (IL-22) is integral to the development and pathophysiology of psoriasis, and targeting IL-22 may serve as a promising therapeutic approach for treating the condition. IL-22 binding protein (IL-22BP) exhibits a binding affinity for IL-22 that far surpasses that of IL-22RA1 and functions as a natural antagonist of IL-22. Traditional IL-22BP production methods predominantly rely on eukaryotic animal cell expression systems, which generally require complex processes, resulting in low yield and high production costs. This study reports the expression of long-acting IL-22BP with a high yield and purity over 90% in Escherichia coli by fusion with the albumin-binding structural domain ABD. The biological functions of rhIL-22BP-ABD were assessed utilizing cell lines and a murine model. Our findings indicated that rhIL-22BP-ABD successfully suppressed IL-22-induced proliferation of HaCaT cells in vitro and alleviated imiquimod-induced psoriasis inflammation in mice. Furthermore, rhIL-22BP-ABD can effectively inhibit the signaling of its downstream signaling pathway STAT3 and the associated inflammatory factors by binding to IL-22, which is beneficial to the recovery of psoriasis. These findings provide a basis for forthcoming extensive studies on the rhIL-22BP-ABD protein for industrial manufacturing and pharmaceutical development.",

    "abstract": "Evidence from observational studies and clinical trials has reported that gut microbiota (GM) was associated with chronic lung diseases (CLDs). However, the causal relationships between GM and CLDs have yet to be fully ascertained. The Mendelian randomization (MR) based causal analysis was performed using the genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from the MiBioGen and FinnGen consortium. GM served as exposure, and CLDs were taken for outcomes. Inverse variance weighted, MR-Egger, and weighted median methods were utilized to examine the causal association between GM and CLDs. The sensitivity analyses were then conducted to validate the robustness of the results. Further, the reverse MR analysis was performed to evaluate the possibility of reverse causation. Finally, the in-silico in-situ microbiota resequencing (ISSMR) of high-throughput sequencing data was utilized as a supplement to dissect the role of microbiota spatial distribution disturbance on the onset of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study revealed that GM had causal associations with CLDs. Conversely, reverse MR analysis suggested that the presence of COPD and IPF may causally influence the abundance of specific GM. And ISSMR further provided clues to the interaction of intra-tissue as well as gut microbe disturbance in IPF and COPD from synergistic or independent perspectives. In short, the MR analysis revealed a causal relationship between GM and CLDs from a host genetic perspective, and ISSMR extended the host-microbe regulatory modality from a microbe genetic perspective, thus together providing novel insights into the gut microbiota-mediated development mechanism of CLDs.",

The active ingredient of milk thistle is silymarin, a key component used to treat numerous physical and biological ailments. This study aimed to compare the nutritional composition, total phenolic, flavonoid, and tannin contents, and the antimicrobial activities of S. marianum stems, leaves, and flowers extracted using five different solvents. Phytochemical assays were used to evaluate the total phenolic, flavonoid, and tannin contents in petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, acetone, methanol, and water extracts from different plant parts. The proximate composition showed that the leaves had a higher percentage of moisture (11.53%). In contrast, the flowers showed increased lipid content, carbohydrate, and protein concentration (5.17, 69.86, and 10.03%, respectively), and stems showed elevated ash content (28.67%) compared to leaves and flowers. In S. marianum , the highest yield was obtained from the flowers, while the leaves and stems produced progressively lower amounts, respectively. Among the solvents tested, extraction with water made the largest yield, followed in decreasing order by methanol, acetone, ethyl acetate, and petroleum ether. The findings of the study revealed that alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids, glycosides, steroids, quinones, phenols, anthraquinones, cardiac glycosides, and terpenoids were found by phytochemical analysis of S. marianum in different parts. At the same time, saponins and anthocyanins were completely absent in all parts. On the other hand, coumarins are present in leaves and flowers and are completely lacking in stems. The highest levels of phenol content, tannins, and flavonoids were found in the methanol extract of the flowers (183.12 ± 11.02 mg gallic acid equivalent/g (mg GAE/g), 187.43 ± 15.91 mg quercetin equivalents/g (mg QE/g), and 94.40 ± 16.04 mg TAE/g, respectively). In contrast, the water extract of stems had the lowest amount (5.45 ± 1.32 mg GAE/g, 9.60 ± 1.5 mg QE/g, and 3.27 ± 1.53 mg TAE/g, respectively). Antimicrobial tests revealed the extract's ability to inhibit several Gram-positive bacteria ( S. aureus ATCC 6538 and B.subtilis ATCC 6633), Gram-negative bacteria ( P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027, S. typhimurium ATCC 14028, E. coli ATCC 11229), and eukaryotic strains such as unicellular fungi ( C.albicans ATCC 10231). These results confirm the potential of milk thistle extract as a naturally occurring antimicrobial agent. Graphical abstract",

Owing to its diverse clinical manifestations and the limited sensitivity of current diagnostic methods, NS is difficult to diagnose. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of NS and identifying reliable biomarkers are essential for improving diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. This study employed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to explore the causal relationships among protein ratio quantitative trait loci (rQTLs), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metabolites, and syphilis risk at various stages. The results revealed that several rQTLs, including CD46/TNFRSF14 and TBC1D23/TBC1D5, were closely associated with syphilis risk, whereas others, such as BANK1/HEXIM1 and GOPC/HEXIM1, exhibited protective effects. Mediation analysis further identified key CSF metabolites, such as N-acetyltaurine and bilirubin, as important mediators linking rQTLs and syphilis progression. Through integrated analysis of cis-proteins from rQTLs and transcriptomic data from CD4 + T-cells of NS patients, METAP2 was identified as a key biomarker in NS, with the potential mechanisms elucidated. Importantly, T. pallidum may inhibit CD4 + T-cell proliferation by modulating METAP2, thereby accelerating disease progression. These findings offer new insights into the pathogenesis of NS and highlight METAP2 as a potential biomarker, laying a foundation for improving diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Burkholderia is a significant pathogen that causes disease burden across the globe. In particular, Burkholderia cenocepacia and Burkholderia multivorans are the predominant isolates that infect people with cystic fibrosis (CF) and cause hospital-acquired infections. Understanding antimicrobial resistance and virulent factors among these species is of great significance for addressing this growing resistance burden. Initially, we retrieved 75 complete genome sequences of B. cenocepacia and B. multivorans from NCBI database and analysed them for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and virulent factors. This yielded 368 antimicrobial resistance genes and 202 virulent factors after removing the duplicates. Further, a comprehensive interaction network was constructed using STRING, which was visualized and analysed using Cytoscape. Through cytoHubba and MCODE analysis, eight key hub genes FliF, FliG, FliM, FliS, FlgB, FlgC, FlgD and FlgK were identified. Additionally, a non-homology analysis was conducted to ensure that the key nodes do not exhibit similarity with the human genome and gut microbiota. Functional enrichment analysis revealed their significant role in the flagellar assembly pathway, particularly in bacterial motility, colonization and biofilm formation. Notably, seven hub genes were enriched in bacterial-type flagellum-dependent cell motility pathway and cellular localization. It is worth noting that 17,967 phytochemicals were exploited to identify the potent hit compounds against each of the identified hub genes. Interestingly, the hit molecules were found to form several key interactions with the targets, indicating their potential as promising therapeutic agents for combating AMR. Overall, the identified hub genes and their potent inhibitors present compelling targets for novel antimicrobial therapies in CF, underscoring the need for future experimental validation.",

Following the confirmation of the prebiotic activity of lentinan, this study aimed to use microencapsulation technology to prepare synbiotics composed of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) and lentinan. The optimal preparation process for the synbiotic microcapsules was determined through single-factor, orthogonal, and response surface experiments. Subsequent experiments on storage stability, gastric acid tolerance, and intestinal release characteristics confirmed that the microencapsulated L. plantarum-lentinan synbiotic exhibited increased resistance to adverse environments. The microencapsulated synbiotic was ultimately incorporated into antibiotic-free feed at a dosage of 1 × 109 CFU/kg for broilers. The results indicated that this synbiotic could increase the average daily weight gain and feed conversion ratio of 28-day-old broiler chickens, increase the immune organ index, improve the morphology of the intestinal villi, and effectively increase the activity of digestive enzymes in the small intestine. Moreover, changes in the cecal microbial community composition of broilers were observed, with an increase in the number of Lactobacillus and a decrease in the number of Escherichia coli. In summary, this synbiotic can effectively enhance the growth performance of broilers, regulate the intestinal microbiota, improve immune function, and reduce the risk of intestinal and respiratory diseases in broilers.",

From 198 protein targets previously identified through multi-omics analysis, 10 essential, druggable, broad-spectrum targets were selected. Three promising non-antibiotic ligands (rupatadine, orlistat, and citric acid) were evaluated through minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), molecular docking, cytotoxicity testing, and a murine model of MRSA skin infection. Rupatadine, orlistat, and citric acid showed MICs of 0.031 mg/mL, 1.5 mg/mL, and 2.5 mg/mL, respectively. Rupatadine demonstrated the most potent anti-MRSA activity, with molecular docking revealing favorable binding energy (− 3.45 kcal/mol) to Aminoacyl transferase (FemA). Serial passage experiments over eight passages showed no resistance development against rupatadine in one MRSA strain and only twofold increase in another, compared to 8–13 fold increases observed with conventional antibiotics. Checkerboard assays revealed synergistic effects between rupatadine and β-lactam antibiotics (cefazolin and cefotaxime, FICI = 0.3). FemA is essential in cell wall biosynthesis and represents an essential target for anti-MRSA agents. Functional enrichment and pathway network analyses revealed significant disruption of biological processes governing peptidoglycan biosynthesis and cell wall biogenesis, which indicates the possibility of rupatadine compromising S. aureus cell wall integrity through interference with peptidoglycan assembly pathways, supporting its potential as a repurposed anti-MRSA agent. Rupatadine showed favorable tolerance on human skin fibroblast cells (IC 50 : 1150 µg/mL), and significantly reduced bacterial count in a murine model.",

The antibacterial and antioxidant properties of agarwood essential oils (EOs) have been well documented. High-altitude (> 2500 m) regions attract tens of millions of visitors worldwide each year; however, the hypoxic environment poses a threat to the health of the body's organ systems, including the digestive system. Additionally, hypoxia has been reported to alter the gut microbiota and metabolites. Our previous study demonstrated that hypoxia exposure triggered ferroptosis in the gastric and small intestinal mucosa. This study aimed to explore the therapeutic effects and potential mechanisms of EOs in hypoxia-induced gastric and small intestinal mucosal injury. EO effects were evaluated based on clinical manifestations, histopathological assessments, and lipid peroxidation as determined by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) levels. We also assessed microbiota changes through 16 S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and analyzed metabolites using untargeted liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry in the gastric and small intestinal contents of mice. EO treatment significantly alleviated hypoxia-triggered mucosal damage in the stomach and small intestine. Notably, EOs reduced hypoxia-induced lipid peroxidation and partially recovered the microbiota and metabolite disruptions induced by hypoxia. Specifically, Candidatus_Saccharimonas and Akkermansia may contribute to mucosal repair via regulating xanthoxic acid and aspartylglycosamine, and guanosine, respectively. EOs may provide a promising approach for treating hypoxia-induced gastric and small intestinal damage by repressing lipid peroxidation and regulating the microbiota and metabolites.",

Controlling these parameters will therefore make it possible to optimize the production of alcohol and the growth of the yeast during fermentation. The aim of this work is to show that the extraction of polyphenols, the main inhibitors of sorghum enzyme activity, prior to malting increases enzyme activity in the malt, thereby producing high levels of reducing sugars. This is reflected in the high alcohol content at the end of the fermentation process. Three parameters were considered in this work, namely: The polyphenol content in the grain (Discolored and non-discolored sorghum), temperature (12 and 25 °C) and fermentation time (in hours). The choice of fermentation temperature was made depending on the specific characteristics of the yeast used and taking into account the range used by artisan breweries producing sorghum beer in DR Congo. These breweries ferment their beers at room temperature. The results obtained give a better alcohol content of 7.53% for the E1T1 sample (Discolored sorghum, fermentation at 12 °C). The comparison of the results confirms that the extraction of the phenolic compounds before malting as well as the fermentation temperature had a significant effect on the production of alcohol and the growth of the yeast. The results of this work open the door to many other studies to provide to the industrial and artisanal brewers with scientific data that will allow them to better integrate red sorghum malt as raw material into brewing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Isolation of Pythium and Globisporangium (Chromista, Oomycota) from their natural sources is very difficult due to the heavy contamination with other microbes, which hinders obtaining them in pure form. This study aims to develop a new, cheap and safe selective medium to isolate Pythium and Globisporangium species from their natural sources, despite the previous presence of more than 3 types of selective media including: VP 3 (Vancomycin + PCNB + Penicillin + Pimaricin), NARM (Nystatin + Ampicillin + Rifampicin + Miconazole), and NARF (Nystatin + Ampicillin + Rifampicin + Fluazinam) used to isolate Oomycota. The elevated expense of antibiotics, along with alerts regarding potential contamination, toxicity, and tumor proliferation, renders them undesirable. Safe and inexpensive antibiotics from pharmaceutical sources were used with fixed formulations and concentrations. A selective medium was developed, called FANS (Fluconazole + Ampicillin + Nystatin + Sulbactam) with the following concentrations (1200 mg + 500 mg + 100,000 IU + 250 mg) respectively/L Corn Meal Agar promotes only the growth and formation of reproductive structures of Pythium and Globisporangium . On the other hand, these antibiotics completely inhibited the growth of other contaminated fungi and bacteria. Mycelial growth, zoospore formation, and oospore production for ( Pythium aphanidermatum , Pythium oligandrum , and Globisporangium ultimum var. ultimum ) were highest in FANS, followed by NARM, then NARF, while VP 3 gave the lowest results compared to the control sample. It can be concluded that the use of FANS selective medium made the process of Pythium isolation easier, safer, and less expensive for worldwide researchers especially in developing and low-income countries.",

These oligomers are characterized by high water solubility and bioavailability. COSs have demonstrated several biological activities in the medical field, including antitumor, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory. This study aimed to assess and purify bio-produced COSs obtained from a culture containing a locally isolated Bacillus cereus strain from an Egyptian soil sample and investigate their biological activities, such as immunostimulatory and anti-inflammatory activities. The COSs were bio-produced by fermentation of a native B. cereus strain in media containing colloidal chitosan hydrolyzed by the action of chitosanase enzyme. COSs were then purified on a column packed with a Sephadex LH-20 column. The purified form of COSs were quantified and detected according to their molecular weights and degree of polymerization by UPLC-Mass spectroscopy. The purified COSs were detected as polymers of GlcN at different degrees of polymerization (DP1-DP6) and different molecular weight ranges (m z −1 ). The purified COSs were administered orally to groups of mice to evaluate their immunostimulatory effects on cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression by measuring cytokine levels in their thymus glands and spleens. Cytokine analysis revealed that COSs enhanced the release of IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ in both the thymus and spleen ( p &lt; 0.05). The activity of COSs as an anti-inflammatory was assessed by inducing edema in the paws using carrageenan. COSs’ dose of 500 mg kg −1 exhibited a potential anti-inflammatory effect when compared to dexamethasone ( p &lt; 0.05). This study concluded that the bio-produced COSs have considerable potential and are promising as a drug with immunostimulant activities. These observed activities resulted from the ability of COSs to stimulate the production of different cytokine markers in safe doses. Also, these COSs showed significant anti-inflammatory activity when administered orally.",

    "abstract": "Here, we investigated the antioxidant, antidiabetic, dermatoprotective, and antibacterial capacities of Centaurium erythraea essential oil (CEEO) and its major compounds namely menthol, carvacrol, and tricosane. The main findings revealed that CEEO, menthol, and tricosane impeded the proliferation of Gram-positive bacteria more efficiently than that of Gram-negative bacteria. The most active molecules in the FRAP assay were carvacrol (59.96 ± 2.60 µg/mL) and menthol (57.93 ± 15.63 µg/mL), while the DPPH and ABTS tests demonstrated a potent activity of CEEO. For the antidiabetic tests, CEEO displayed significantly lower IC50 values, 168.62 μg/mL for α-amylase and 87.18 μg/mL for α-glucosidase. These values indicated a marked inhibition compared to menthol, carvacrol, and tricosane as they exhibited a moderate inhibition of α-amylase (IC50 = 471.50 μg/mL, IC50 = 566.20 μg/mL, and IC50 = 385.26 μg/mL, respectively) and α-glucosidase (183.25 μg/mL, 201.18 μg/mL, 192.30 μg/mL, respectively). With an IC50 of 41.863 ± 0.031 μg/mL, CEEO also showed excellent efficacy against tyrosinase. For the inhibition of elastase, similar IC50 values for CEEO (113.02 ± 3.37 μg/mL) and menthol (112.06 ± 3.70 μg/mL) were reported while those of carvacrol and tricosane were 124.68 ± 4.31 and 145.26 ± 4.62 μg/mL, respectively. To sum up, CEEO, carvacrol, menthol, and tricosane exert various biological activities that need to be deeply investigated and optimized to select the best compound and/or combination. Main compounds of Centaurium erythraea L., essential oils, menthol, carvacrol, and tricosane, showed important antimicrobial and anti-enzymatic effects. Menthol is responsible for the dermatoprotective activity of CEEO. Tricosane and carvacrol revealed the most prominent antibacterial and antidiabetic effects.",

This study investigated the protective role of pentoxifylline (PTX), a methylxanthine derivative with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, against AMK-induced organ damage in male BALB/c mice. Thirty mice were divided into six groups: control, AMK (100 mg/kg/day), PTX monotherapy (50 or 100 mg/kg/day), and AMK combined with PTX (50 or 100 mg/kg/day). After 28 days, biochemical, oxidative stress, inflammatory, and histopathological analyses were conducted. AMK administration significantly elevated renal (BUN and creatinine) and hepatic (ALT, AST and ALP) markers, increased oxidative stress (MDA), and upregulated inflammatory cytokines (IL-17), alongside histopathological damage in kidney and liver tissues. Co-treatment with PTX, particularly at 100 mg/kg, normalized these parameters, restored antioxidant defenses, reduced inflammation, and preserved tissue architecture. PTX demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy, with the higher dose offering complete protection against AMK-induced toxicity. These findings highlighted PTX’s potential as an adjunctive therapy to mitigate AMK-associated nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity, suggesting its clinical utility in optimizing aminoglycoside safety without compromising efficacy.",

Structures of the isolated compounds were determined using LC/MS analyses. To assess and compare their potential nephroprotective effects, the parent compounds and their biotransformation metabolites were subjected to molecular docking studies targeting AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) for the first time. During microbial biotransformation, a series of reactions, primarily hydroxylation and reduction, were observed, resulting in the identification of five distinct metabolites. LC/MS analysis of the fermentation medium revealed that Bacillus subtilis 168 converted 6-gingerol into 6-gingerdiol (M1) and hydroxylated 6-gingerol (M2), while 6-shogaol was transformed into 6-paradol (M3) and hydroxylated 6-shogaol (M4). Additionally, 6-paradol underwent further reduction to form (M5). Docking results showed that all compounds demonstrated binding affinity to AMPK, indicating potential nephroprotective activity. Notably, M1 exhibited the highest binding affinity, suggesting its strong therapeutic promise as a nephroprotective agent of natural origin. M5 ranked second in binding affinity, followed by M4. These results highlight the effectiveness of microbial transformation in generating bioactive derivatives with potentially enhanced biological activity compared to their natural precursors.",

To identify the dominant enzyme contributing to this activity, the crude enzyme extract was separated into different fractions by ammonium sulfate precipitation, MonoQ anion-exchange chromatography, and Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration chromatography. Afraction with high activity towards hexanol at pH 4.0 was obtained, exhibiting 38-fold improved purity and a specific activity of 3802.7 U/mg. After electrophoretic analysis, the fraction showed a molecular weight of 223 kDa by Native-PAGE and 51.4 kDa by SDS-PAGE. The purified fraction was identified as a glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) by peptide mass fingerprinting data. This fraction showed high activity towards glutamate, α-ketoglutarate, hexanol, and isoamyl alcohol with a Km value of 41.74, 4.01, 20.37, and 19.37 mM, respectively, but with no activity towards methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, and isobutanol. As a comparison, the GDH from yeast had no activity towards hexanol and other alcohols. Kinetic analysis revealed that glutamate and hexanol served as competitive inhibitors to each other for the purified GDH. The GDH showed the highest activity towards hexanol at pH 4.0 and 30 °C, and was the most stable at pH 2.2–7.0 and ≤40 °C. The presence of ADP, Fe2+, K+, and Zn2+ increased the enzymatic activity towards hexanol and EDTA, Pb2+, Mn2+, ATP, and DTT decreased the activity. These novel characteristics expand the reported properties of GDH and suggest the newly characterized GDH has unique potential for practical application.",

Experiment 1: diets were formulated with 60% of concentrate level, and two sugarcane genotypes (high or low NDFD) either freshly cut or as silage. Experiment 2: diets were formulated with two levels of concentrate (60 or 80%), and two sugarcane genotypes (high or low NDFD) offered as freshly cut. Each experimental period lasted for 14 d, with the last 4 d used for ruminal fluid collection. Three cellulolytic bacteria (Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens), two amylolytic (Streptococcus bovis, Ruminobacter amylophilus), and a lactate fermenting microorganism (Megasphaera elsdenii) were quantified by qPCR. Experiment 1: diets with fresh sugarcane increased the population of S. bovis, and M. elsdenii. Sugarcane with high NDFD increased F. succinogenes population only when sugarcane was offered as freshly cut. Experiment 2: increasing concentrate in the diet decreased S. bovis population, and increased R. amylophilus. Sugarcane with high NDFD increased the population of cellulolytic bacteria only at the 60% concentrate diet. Providing sugarcane with high NDFD favored the growth of fibrolytic bacteria, and this effect were dependent on the conservation method and on diet concentrate level. In addition, sucrose appears to have great effect on the composition of ruminal microflora, especially S. bovis.",

In this study, the diversity and abundance of AOA and AOB communities were investigated in ten Yangtze lakes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), clone library and quantitative PCR techniques. The results showed that the abundances of both AOA and AOB in bare sediments were considerably but not significantly higher than those in vegetated sediments. Interestingly, AOB communities were more sensitive to changes in local environmental factors and vegetation characteristics than were AOA communities. Amongst climate and land use variables, mean annual precipitation, percentage of agriculture and percentage of vegetation were the key determinants of AOB abundance and diversity. Additionally, total organic carbon and chlorophyll-a concentrations in lake water were significantly related to AOB abundance and diversity. The results of the ordination analysis indicated that 81.2 and 84.3% of the cumulative variance for the species composition of AOA and AOB communities could be explained by the climate, land use and local factors. The climate and local environments played important roles in shaping AOA communities, whereas catchment agriculture and water chlorophyll-a concentration were key influencing factors of AOB communities.

    "abstract": "Improved understanding of pathogen survival in the stream environment is needed to enhance existing predictive models of stream pathogen populations. Further, the increasing use of thermal springs for bathing necessitates additional studies focused on not only typical streams but also thermal spring conditions, where water temperature is relatively higher than typical streams. This study was conducted to assess the survival of E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella Typhimurium in stream water under free floating and particle-attached conditions at a range of temperature. A series of microcosm studies were conducted to determine pathogen decay rates. In bench-scale experiments, water circulation and sediment resuspension mimicked natural stream and thermal spring conditions, with continuous air flow providing aeration, constant mixing and turbulent conditions, and improved water circulation. Data on E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella survival were subsequently used to determine first-order decay equations for calculating the rate constant and decimal reduction time for the modeled experimental conditions. Results showed that at 40 °C, the survival of particle attached E. coli O157:H7 was longer than that of particle attached Salmonella. Under free floating condition, Salmonella survived longer than E. coli O157:H7. At 50 °C, survival of particle attached E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella was longer than that of free floating E. coli and Salmonella. At 60 °C, survival of particle attached Salmonella was longer than that of free floating Salmonella. Similarly at 60 °C, the survival of E. coli O157:H7 under particle attached condition was longer than that of the free floating condition. The findings of this study suggest that the survival of E. coli O157:H7 differs than the survival of Salmonella in stream water and thermal spring conditions, and the assumption used in previous studies to estimate survival of bacteria in stream environment could result in over/underestimation if the impact of particle attachment on pathogen survival is not accounted for.",

    "abstract": "Sortases are enzymes mostly found in Gram-positive bacteria which cleave proteins site-specifically. This feature makes them a promising tool in molecular biology and biotechnology. In this study, using bacterial surface display of recombinant proteins and ability of sortase A in site-specifically cleavage of the amino acid sequences, a novel method for one-step purification of recombinant proteins was developed. Using computational program tools, a chimeric protein containing a metallothionein (mt) and chitin binding domain (ChBD) was attached to the C-terminal domain of the truncated outer membrane protein A (Lpp′-ompA) using sortase recognition site (amino acid residues: LPQTG) as a separator. The structure of the chimeric protein was simulated using molecular dynamics to determine if the LPQTG motif is accessible to the sortase active site. The designed chimeric protein was expressed and purified. The purified chimeric protein was also displayed on the surface of E. coli cells. Both purified chimeric protein and the E. coli cells displaying Lpp′-ompA-mt-ChBD carrier protein were then treated with sortase to evaluate the efficiency of sortase-mediated cleavage of purified chimeric protein as well as surface displayed-chimeric protein. It is shown that mt-ChBD protein was successfully cleaved and dissociated from Lpp′-ompA carrier and released into the medium after treatment with sortase in both recombinant protein and surface displayed-chimeric protein. The experimental results confirmed the molecular dynamics analysis results. The presented method could be regarded as a novel strategy for one step expression and purification of recombinant proteins.",

    "abstract": "L-Carnitine is an essential compound that shuttles long chain fatty acids into mitochondria. The objective of this study was to produce L-carnitine enriched oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus) using common buckwheat fermented by Rhizopus oligosporus. Mushroom grown on common buckwheat medium contained 9.9-23.9% higher L-carnitine (186.3 mg/kg) than those grown on basal medium without any buckwheat addition. Those grown on fermented common buckwheat medium contained the highest L-carnitine content (201.2 mg/kg). Size index and lightness of mushroom pileus (L*) were also the highest (100.7 and 50.6, respectively) for those grown in medium added with fermented common buckwheat (20%, w/w). Antioxidant activities of both mushroom extracts (1.5 mg/mL) showed the same level as 38.7% for mushroom grown in media added with common buckwheat or fermented common buckwheat. At the treatment concentration of 300 μg/mL, viabilities of murine macrophage cell line Raw 264.7 cells treated with ethanol extract of oyster mushroom grown on buckwheat medium ranged from 58.9 to 67.8%. The oyster mushroom grown on buckwheat and fermented buckwheat medium can be used as one of the substitutes for meat based diets.",

The cephamycin C biosynthetic gene cluster and pathway have been basically elucidated and the CcaR positive regulator was found to control the cephamycin genes expression. However, additional mechanisms of regulation cannot be excluded. The BB341_RS13780/13785 gene pair in S. clavuligerus F613-1 (annotated as SCLAV_2960/2959 in S. clavuligerus ATCC27064) encodes a bacterial two-component system (TCS) and were designated as CepRS (for cephamycin regulator/sensor). CepRS significantly affects cephamycin C production but only slightly affects CA production. To further understand the regulation of cephamycin C biosynthesis, the cepRS genes were deleted from S. clavuligerus F613-1. The deletion mutant resulted in decreased cephamycin C production but had no phenotypic effects. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that CepRS regulates the expression of most genes involved in cephamycin C biosynthesis, with electrophoretic mobility shift assays showing that CepR interacts with the cefD-cmcI intergenic region. These results demonstrate that the CepR response regulator serves as a transcriptional activator of cephamycin C biosynthesis, which may provide an approach for metabolic engineering methods for CA production by S. clavuligerus F613-1 in future.",

    "abstract": "The potential of fermentation broth of Ganoderma lucidum (FBG) in improving the quality of Chinese steamed bread (CSB) was firstly evaluated. The sensory quality scores of CSB treated by FBG are significantly higher than that of CSB in the control, and texture profile analysis also indicates the increase of CSB hardness and chewiness caused by FBG. Observation on micro-structure of CSB shows that formation of larger pores and expansion of starch granules are the important reasons for the improvement of CSB specific volume (volS), and granule expansion is due to that gluten network distributed in CSB is destroyed as a result of cross-linkage of flour proteins catalyzed by laccase, which makes starch granules releasing from the network easily contact with steam or other enzymes during the proofing and steaming of dough. Moreover, FBG contains amylases which not only convert amylopectin to amylose, but also degrade starch to glucose, maltose and polysaccharides, correspondingly resulting in changes of amylose/amylopectin (Ae/An) ratio of flour and CSB volS, and the latter is because more CO2 produced by the yeast during CSB making leads to the larger pore area in crumb. Both hardness and chewiness are determined by the comprehensive effect of protein cross-linkage, Ae/An ratio and volS change, and this viewpoint gives a logical explanation for the effects of 0.025–0.10 ml/g of FBG on hardness and chewiness of CSB.",

    "abstract": "Flue gases from a power plant based on waste combustion were tested as a carbon dioxide (CO2) source for growing Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. To achieve recognition as an environmentally friendly hydrogen production method, waste gases should be used to grow this hydrogen-producing microalgae. The algae were grown in undiluted flue gas containing 11.4±0.2% CO2 by volume, in diluted flue gas containing 6.7±0.1% or 2.5±0.0% CO2, and in pure liquid CO2 at a concentration of 2.7±0.2%. The NOx concentration was 45±16 mg m-3, the SO2 concentration was 36±19 mg m-3, the HCl concentration 4.1±1.0 mg m-3 and the O2 concentration 7.9±0.2% in the undiluted flue gas. Undiluted flue gas reduced the dry weight production by around 20-25% when grown at a photon flux density (PFD) of 300 μmol m-2 s-1 artificial light and at 24 or 33°C, compared with the other treatments. A less negative effect was found at the highest flue gas concentration when the algae were grown at 75 μmol m-2 s-1 PFD. Growing the algae outdoors at a day length of 12.5 h and a temperature of around 24°C, the dry weight production was higher (about 15%) in the 2.6% CO2 flue gas treatment compared with all other treatments. Reducing the light level by 30% through shading did not affect the dry weight production. Calculated on aerial basis the productivity reached approximately 70 g m-2 day-1 in the 300 μmol m-2 s-1 PFD treatment (corresponding to 25 mol m-2 day-1) and approximately 17 g m-2 day-1 in the 75μmol m-2 s-1 PFD treatment (corresponding to 6.5 mol m-2 day-1). The outdoor production reached around 14 g m-2 day-1. It was concluded that the negative effect of the undiluted flue gas was attributable to the high CO2 concentration and not to the other pollutants.",

These VFAs are subject to elongation to larger, more energy-dense products through reverse β-oxidation, and the resulting products are useful as precursors for liquid fuels production. This study examined the effect of several redox mediators (neutral red, methyl viologen, safranin O, tannic acid) as alternative electron carriers for mixed ruminal bacteria during the fermentation of biomass (ground switchgrass not subjected to other pretreatments) and their potential to enhance elongation of end-products to medium-chain VFAs with no additional run-time. Neutral red (1 mM) in particular facilitated chain elongation, increasing average VFA chain length from 2.42 to 2.97 carbon atoms per molecule, while simultaneously inhibiting methane accumulation by over half yet maintaining total C in end products. The ability of redox dyes to act as alternative electron carriers suggests that ruminal fermentation is inherently manipulable toward retaining a higher fraction of substrate energy in the form of VFA.",

The working electrode potential was electrochemically regulated at -0.8 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Stable methane production of 9.37 L-CH4 · L-1 · day-1 and dichromate chemical oxygen demand (CODcr) removal of 62.5% were observed, even at a high organic loading rate (OLR) of 89.3 g-CODcr · L-1 · day-1. Given energy as methane (372.6 kJ · L-1 · day-1) was much higher than input electric energy to the working electrode (0.6 kJ · L-1 · day-1) at this OLR. Methanogens were highly retained in CFT by direct attachment to the cathodic working electrodes (52.3%; ratio of methanogens to prokaryotes), compared with the suspended fraction (31.2%), probably contributing to the acceleration of organic material degradation and removal of organic acids.

    "abstract": "Determination of metabolically active cell count is an important step in designing, operating and controlling fermentation processes. It's particularly relevant in processes involving mixed cultures, where multiple species contribute to the total growth. The motivation for the current study is to develop a methodology to estimate metabolically active cell counts for the individual species in a mixed culture with approximate equal numbers. Further, the methodology should indicate the presence of a contaminant in short time periods since in the agar plate methods used frequently it takes about 24 h. We present a methodology based on the rate of Methylene blue (MB) reduction to evaluate total count of metabolically active cells. The standard curve relating the slope of MB reduction and CFU of the individual species could be used to measure the metabolic activity of each species in the mixed culture. The slope of MB reduction could also be used to obtain the growth rate of individual species in a mixed culture and that of the total cell count. These measurements were achieved in less than 6 minutes during the growth of the cells. Evaluating the metabolic activity of individual species in a mixed culture is tedious, difficult and time consuming. The Methylene Blue dye Reduction Test (MBRT) presented here is capable of quickly estimating colony forming units (CFU) of individual species in a mixed culture if the ratio of the numbers of cells is known. The method was used to dynamically detect the occurrence of a contaminating microorganism during fermentation. The protocol developed here can be adapted to applications in processes involving mixed cultures.",

The present study explores the potential for isolating novel Rieske non-heme iron oxygenases from thermophilic sources. Browsing the entire bacterial genome database led to the identification of 45 homologs from thermophilic bacteria distributed mainly among Chloroflexi, Deinococcus–Thermus and Firmicutes. Thermostability, measured according to the aliphatic index, showed higher values for certain homologs compared with their mesophilic relatives. Prediction of substrate preferences indicated that a wide array of aromatic hydrocarbons could be transformed by most of the identified oxygenase homologs.

The synthesis pathway comprises two enzymes, β-ketothiolase and acetoacetyl-CoA reductase which convert cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA to (R)-3-hydroxybutyric acid [(R)-3-HB] which is released into the culture medium. In the present study we used the non-conventional yeast, Arxula adeninivorans, for the synthesis enantiopure (R)-3-HB. To establish optimal production, we investigated three different endogenous yeast thiolases (Akat1p, Akat2p, Akat4p) and three bacterial thiolases (atoBp, thlp, phaAp) in combination with an enantiospecific reductase (phaBp) from Cupriavidus necator H16 and endogenous yeast reductases (Atpk2p, Afox2p). We found that Arxula is able to release (R)-3-HB used an existing secretion system negating the need to engineer membrane transport. Overexpression of thl and phaB genes in organisms cultured in a shaking flask resulted in 4.84 g L−1 (R)-3-HB, at a rate of 0.023 g L−1 h−1 over 214 h. Fed-batch culturing with glucose as a carbon source did not improve the yield, but a similar level was reached with a shorter incubation period [3.78 g L−1 of (R)-3-HB at 89 h] and the rate of production was doubled to 0.043 g L−1 h−1 which is higher than any levels in yeast reported to date. The secreted (R)-3-HB was 99.9% pure. This is the first evidence of enantiopure (R)-3-HB synthesis using yeast as a production host and glucose as a carbon source.",

    "abstract": "Fungal species associated with ericaceous plant roots produce a number of enzymes and other bio-active metabolites in order to enhance survival of their host plants in natural environments. This study focussed on endoglucanase production from root associated ericoid mycorrhizal and dark septate endophytic fungal isolates. Out of the five fungal isolates screened, Leohumicola sp. (ChemRU330/PPRI 13195) had the highest relative enzyme activity and was tested along with isolates belonging to Hyloscyphaceae (EdRU083/PPRI 17284) and Leotiomycetes (EdRU002/PPRI 17261) for endoglucanase production under different pH and nutritional conditions that included: carbon sources, nitrogen sources and metal ions, at an optimum temperature of 28 °C. An optimal of pH 5.0 produced enzyme activity of 3.99, 2.18 and 4.31 (U/mg protein) for isolates EdRU083, EdRU002 and Leohumicola sp. respectively. Increased enzyme activities and improved mycelial biomass production were obtained in the presence of supplements such as potassium, sodium, glucose, maltose, cellobiose, tryptone and peptone. While NaFe-EDTA and Co2+ inhibited enzyme activity. The potential role of these fungi as a source of novel enzymes is an ongoing objective of this study.",

The ccdB killer gene has a cleavage site (CCC/GGG) for the SmaI restriction enzyme which is used for vector linearisation and cloning blunt-ended products. pELMO transformation efficiency was evaluated with different sized inserts and its cloning efficiency was compared to that of the pGEM-T Easy commercial vector. The highest pELMO transformation efficiency was observed for ~500 bp DNA fragments; pELMO vector had higher cloning efficiency for all insert sizes tested. In-house and commercial vector cloned insert reads after sequencing were similar thus highlighting that sequencing primers were designed and localised appropriately. pELMO is thus proposed as a practical alternative for in-house cloning of PCR products in molecular biology laboratories.",

    "abstract": "As yeast is commonly used for RNA production, it is industrially important to breed strains with high RNA contents. The upstream activating factor (UAF) plays an important role in transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a major constituent of intracellular RNA species. Here, we targeted the essential rRNA transcription regulator Rrn5 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a component of the UAF complex, and disrupted the genomic RRN5 gene using a helper plasmid carrying an RRN5 gene. Then we isolated nine suppressor mutants (Sup mutants) of RRN5 gene disruption, causing deficiency in rRNA transcription. The Sup mutants had RNA contents of approximately 40% of the wild type level and expansion of rDNA repeats to ca. 400-700 copies. Reintroduction of a functional RRN5 gene into Sup mutants caused a reduction in the number of rDNA repeats to close to the wild type level but did not change RNA content. However, we found that reintroduction of RRN5 into the Sup16 mutant (in which the FOB1 gene encoding the rDNA replication fork barrier site binding protein was disrupted) resulted in a significant increase (17%) in RNA content compared with wild type, although the rDNA repeat copy number was almost identical to the wild type strain. In this case, upregulated transcription of non-transcribed spacers (NTS) occurred, especially in the NTS2 region; this was likely mediated by RNA polymerase II and accounted for the increased RNA content. Thus, we propose a novel breeding strategy for developing high RNA content yeast by harnessing the essential rRNA transcription regulator.",

Our objective was to identify NZ2114 derivatives with improved activity through substitution of His16 and His18 with residues Arginine and Lysine. Eight mutants were designed and expressed in Pichia pastoris X-33 via pPICZαA. Five of them exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against S. aureus at low minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 0.057–0.454 μM. Among them, H1, H2, and H3 showed ideal pharmacodynamic effects on methicillin-resistant S. aureus ATCC43300. The total protein level of H1, H2, and H3 reached 1.70, 1.77 and 1.54 g/l at 120 h of induction in the 5-l fermenter, respectively. They killed over 99.9% of pathogens within 1.5 h at 2× and 4× MIC. The post antibiotic effect of H1, H2 and H3 to S. aureus ATCC43300 was 2.94, 1.75 and 1.55 h at 2× MIC, which was similar with their original peptide NZ2114 (1.43 h) and vancomycin (1.72 h). The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) indicated indifferent effects between H1, H2, H3 and vancomycin, ampicillin, rifampicin. Additionally, they had low hemolysis and high stability in different environments (temperature, pH, proteases, and saline ions). All results indicate that H1, H2, and H3 can be produced in large-scale and have potential as therapeutic drugs against MRSA.",

To facilitate the isolation of mycobacteria from soil, Middlebrook 7H10 agar was optimized as an enhanced selective medium by increasing the concentration of malachite green. A series of modified Middlebrook 7H10 agar media with malachite green concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 2500 mg/L was evaluated using 20 soil samples decontaminated with 3% sodium dodecyl sulfate plus 2% NaOH for 30 min. Among these modified Middlebrook 7H10 media, the medium with malachite green at a concentration of 250 mg/L, i.e., at the same concentration as in Löwenstein-Jensen medium, was the most effective in terms of the number of plates with mycobacterial growth. This medium was further evaluated with 116 soil samples. The results showed that 87.1% (101/116) of the samples produced mycobacterial growth, and 15 samples (12.9%) produced no mycobacterial growth. Of the plates inoculated with the soil samples, each in duplicate, 5.2% (12/232) showed late contamination. In total, 19 mycobacterial species were isolated, including seven (36.8%) rapidly growing mycobacteria and 12 (63.2%) slowly growing mycobacteria. Our results demonstrate that the modified Middlebrook 7H10 agar with 250 mg/L malachite green is useful for the primary isolation of nontuberculous mycobacteria from soil.",

In this work the hydantoinase and carbamoylase from Arthrobacter crystallopoietes DSM 20117 were investigated with respect to their applicability in a cell-free hydantoinase process. Both enzymes were heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli BL21DE3. Cultivation and induction of the hydantoinase under oxygen deficiency resulted in markedly higher specific activities and a further increase in expression was achieved by codon-optimization. Further expression conditions of the hydantoinase were tested using the microbioreactor system BioLector®, which showed a positive effect upon the addition of 3% ethanol to the cultivation medium. Additionally, the hydantoinase and carbamoylase were successfully purified by immobilized metal ion affinity using Ni Sepharose beads as well as by functionalized magnetic beads, while the latter method was clearly more effective with respect to recovery and purification factor. Immobilization of both enzymes via functionalized magnetic beads directly from the crude cell extract was successful and resulted in specific activities that turned out to be much higher than those of the purified free enzymes.",

Addition of the IYDs at 3 g/L significantly enhanced the survival of the probiotic bacteria by 2.75-4.05 log cycles after 10-h exposure in a pH 3.0 buffer. Acid stress assay with IYD components obtained after centrifugation and filtration revealed that water-soluble compounds were responsible for improving the acid tolerance of L. rhamnosus HN001 for all three preparations. Differences in protective effect amongst the IYDs on L. rhamnosus HN001 were observed when permeates and retentates of the water-soluble extracts, obtained through ultrafiltration with a 2 kDa membrane, were assayed against the lactic acid bacterium. Chemical analysis of the water-soluble components suggests that low molecular weight polysaccharides, specific free amino acids and/or antioxidants in the 2 kDa permeates could have contributed to the enhanced survival of L. rhamnosus HN001 during acid stress. The contrast amongst the 2 kDa retentates' viability enhancing property may have been attributed to the differences in size and structure of the higher molecular weight carbohydrates and proteins, as the survival of the probiotic did not relate to the concentration of these compounds. These results suggests that oenological IYDs could potentially be applied to probiotic foods for enhancing the acid tolerance of the beneficial microorganisms, and consequently prolonging the shelf life of these products.",

    "abstract": "Disentangling the interactions between cyanobacteria and associated bacterial community is important for understanding the mechanisms that mediate the formation of cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater ecosystems. Despite the fact that a metagenomic approach enables researchers to profile the structure of microbial communities associated with cyanobacteria, reconstructing genome sequences for all members remains inefficient, due to the inherent enormous microbial diversity. Here, we have established a stable coculture system under high salinity, originally from a mixture of an axenic cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 and a non-axenic bloom-forming cyanobacterium Microcystis colony. Metagenomic analysis showed that the coculture consists of S. sp. PCC 7002 and two heterotrophic bacteria, designated as Pseudomonas stutzeri TAIHU and Mesorhizobium sp. TAIHU, respectively. And near-complete genome sequences of both bacteria were reconstructed from the metagenomic dataset with an average completeness of 99.8%. Genome-wide pathway analysis revealed that M. sp. TAIHU carried all the genes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of cobalamin, which is required by S. sp. PCC 7002 for growth. To cope with the high salinity in the coculture, experimental evidence demonstrated that S. sp. PCC 7002 would synthesize the compatible solutes including sucrose and glucosylglycerol, which are supposed to be exploited by both heterotrophic bacteria as potential carbon and/or nitrogen sources. Furthermore, the genes encoding for the biosynthesis of the ectoine, another common osmolyte are found exclusively in P. stutzeri TAIHU, while the genes responsible for the catabolism of ectoine and its derives are present only in M. sp. TAIHU. These genomic evidence indicates beneficial interaction between three members in the coculture. Establishment of the coculture system with relative simplicity provides a useful model system for investigating the interspecies interactions, and genome sequences of both bacteria associated with Microcystis bloom described here will facilitate the researcher to elucidate the role of these heterotrophic bacteria in the formation and maintenance of cyanobacterial bloom in freshwater ecosystem.",

An open circuit voltage of 1.596 V and a maximum power density of 29.42 mWm−2 were obtained by serially connecting three SMFCs. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed that the internal resistance which comprised ohmic resistance and anodic and cathodic charge transfer resistance was approximately 400 Ω for each of the three individual SMFCs. We used the serially connected SMFCs to power an electronic timer through a 1 F capacitor. The SMFCs had powered the timer for 80 h until the potential of the SMFCs dropped below 0.936 V. Then, RNA was extracted from anode samples and 16S rRNA was sequenced following reverse transcription. The results showed that the relative abundance of active exoelectrogenic bacteria-associated genera on the anode was 13.03%, 27.78%, and 16.17% for the three SMFCs with Geobacter and Anaeromyxobacter being the dominant genera.

It does not reduce the palatability of forage grass for animals, but it hinders the isolation of cellulose fibers and the efficient enzymatic depolymerization of cellulose and hemicellulose into fermentable sugars in biorefining processes by limiting the access by hydrolytic enzymes to their polysaccharide substrates.

Epidemiological analysis revealed that serotype FAdV-8 is one of the major pathogenic FAdVs currently prevalent in domestic flocks. Although the fiber protein of FAdV plays vital roles in viral infection and pathogenesis, the B cell epitope in the fiber protein is less known. In this study, two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific to fiber protein of FAdV-8, designated as 4D9 and 5F10, were prepared. Although the mAb 4D9 and 5F10 could not neutralize FAdV-8 infection, 4D9 and 5F10 showed good activities of indirect immunofluorescence, western blot and immunoprecipitation. Epitope analysis revealed that mAb 5F10 recognized 187–219aa in the fiber whereas mAb 4D9 recognized 113–149aa in the fiber. Sequence analysis showed that the epitope recognized by mAb 5F10 was conserve across serotypes FAdV-7, 8a and 8b whereas that for mAb 4D9 was only conserve in FAdV-8b. The generation of mAbs specific to fiber of FAdV-8 and the identification of the novel B cell epitopes here lay the foundation for further studying the antigenicity of the fiber and developing specific diagnosis for FAdV-8.",

However, its application is currently restricted because of the low expression and instability of foreign gene in D. salina cells. During genetic operation, transformation is a crucial step for genes expression in D. salina system. Although several transformation methods are existing currently, many inherent deficiencies and limitations still can be found in actual practice. Thus, we attempted to set up a rapid transformation method using the change of salt concentrations for D. salina. Based on osmotic pressure difference, exogenous genes can be spontaneously transferred into D. salina cells. After that, transformed D. salina cells were subjected to histochemical and molecular analysis. The results showed that the reporter gene, beta-glucuronidase genes were successfully expressed in the positive transformants, and detected in all of transformed cells by PCR analysis. Moreover, different transformation parameters, containing the salt gradient, time, dye dosage and Triton X-100 concentration, were optimized to obtain an optimal transformation result. Taken together, we preliminarily established a rapid transformation method with the features of fast, simple, economic, and high-efficient.

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction of a foreign gene coding for a pathogen resistant protein into the target plant and constitutive expression of Resistance (R) proteins may confer high level of resistance. However, genetic engineering could lead to reprogramming of molecular mechanisms that manage physiological behavior, which in turn could lead to undesired results. Therefore, using a pathogen-inducible synthetic promoter approach, response to pathogens could be more specific. Ascochyta rabiei is a destructive fungal pathogen in chickpea production. In this study, we analyzed the expression pattern of three synthetic promoters in response to pathogen and two defense hormones. We have tested three synthetic pathogen-inducible promoters designated as (1) synthetic promoter-D box-D box (SP-DD), (2) synthetic promoter-F element-F element (SP-FF) and (3) synthetic promoter-F element-F element-D box-D box (SP-FFDD) via Agrobacterium transient expression assay. The cis -acting element designated as ‘D’ is a 31 base pair sequence from the promoter of parsley pathogenesis-related gene 2 ( PR2 gene) and the cis -acting element designated as ‘F’ is a 39 base pairs sequence from the promoter of Arabidopsis AtCMPG1 gene. We used mycelial extracts from two pathotypes of A. rabiei as elicitor to define the responsiveness of the promoters against pathogen. Plant phytohormones including salicylic acid and methyl jasmonate were also used to study the promoter sensitivity in plant signaling pathways. Our results showed that the SP-FF promoter was highly inducible to A. rabiei and methyl jasmonate as well, while the SP-DD promoter was more sensitive to salicylic acid. The SP-FFDD promoter was equally responsive to both pathotypes of A. rabiei which is probably due to the complex nature of box D cis -acting element.",

Simple large-scale detection methods for M. leprae infection are crucial for early detection of leprosy and disease control. The present study investigates the production and seroreactivity of a recombinant polypeptide composed of various M. leprae protein epitopes. The structural and physicochemical parameters of this construction were assessed using in silico tools. Parameters like subcellular localization, presence of signal peptide, primary, secondary, and tertiary structures, and 3D model were ascertained using several bioinformatics tools. The resultant purified recombinant polypeptide, designated rMLP15, is composed of 15 peptides from six selected M. leprae proteins (ML1358, ML2055, ML0885, ML1811, ML1812, and ML1214) that induce T cell reactivity in leprosy patients from different hyperendemic regions. Using rMLP15 as the antigen, sera from 24 positive patients and 14 healthy controls were evaluated for reactivity via ELISA. ELISA-rMLP15 was able to diagnose 79.17% of leprosy patients with a specificity of 92.86%. rMLP15 was also able to detect the multibacillary and paucibacillary patients in the same proportions, a desirable addition in the leprosy diagnosis. These results summarily indicate the utility of the recombinant protein rMLP15 in the diagnosis of leprosy and the future development of a viable screening test.",

Rats were assigned to the following groups: sham, control, 1000 U/kg erythropoietin, 1 mL/kg sesame oil, 1000 U/kg erythropoietin + 1 mL/kg sesame oil, and positive control. We measured the levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced glutathione (GSH), antioxidant enzymes, and proinflammatory markers and performed renal histopathological evaluation. The combined erythropoietin and sesame oil treatment significantly reduced BUN, ALT, creatinine, lipid peroxidation, ROS, and proinflammatory markers and GSH and antioxidant enzyme levels. Histopathological examination showed that the combined erythropoietin and sesame oil treatment significantly reduced necrosis. Therefore, combined treatment of sesame oil and erythropoietin may represent an effective therapeutic approach against ischemic kidney injury after kidney transplantation.",

Catalpol belongs to the iridoid glycoside family and is highly abundant in Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch. The study included five groups such as group I (normal control), group II (treatment control), group III (low-dose treatment), group IV (medium-dose treatment) and group V (high-dose treatment). We investigated the therapeutic effects of catalpol on cardiac arrhythmia in human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, lipid peroxidation, antioxidant activity, and caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities and protein levels were measured in normal control, treatment control, and treated (1, 10, and 100 µM) iPSC groups. Compared with the treatment control group, catalpol supplementation (1, 10, and 100 µM) increased iPSC cell viability by 7.5, 27.3, and 65.8%, respectively; reduced the LDH levels by 10.4, 31.3, and 75.2%, respectively; and reduced the lipid peroxidation levels by 7.7, 33.0, and 62.6%, respectively. The antioxidant levels were significantly higher in the treatment control group than in the normal control group. Catalpol (100 µM) reduced the caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities by more than 30% and increased expression of the corresponding proteins by more than 50%. These findings suggest that the naturally occurring iridoid glycoside catalpol is effective against aconitine-induced cardiac arrhythmia in iPSCs.",

For such applications, it is essential to explore good biocatalytic systems for high activity and recyclability. The feasibility of membrane enclosed enzymatic catalysis (MEEC) for enzyme recycling with laccase was evaluated. The dialysis membrane enclosed laccase catalysis (DMELC) was tested for the conversion of the non-phenolic model substrate 2,2'-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS). Trametes versicolor laccase was found to be completely retained by the dialysis membrane during the process. The ABTS total conversion after DMELC reached the same values as the batch reaction of the enzyme in solution. The efficiency of DMELC conversion of ABTS under different process conditions including shaking speed, temperature, ABTS concentration and pH was investigated. The repetitive dialysis minimally affected the activity and the protein content of the enclosed laccase. DMELC retained 70.3 ± 0.8% of its initial conversion after 5 cycles. The usefulness of MEEC extends to other enzymes with the benefit of superior activity of an enzyme in solution and the recyclability which is normally only obtained with immobilized enzymes.",

The regulation of molecular mechanics of human glioma by lncRNA-LINC00525 through microRNA sponging in glioma is elusive. The lncRNA-LINC00525 showed significant (P &lt; 0.05) upregulation in glioma cancer cells. The upregulation of lncRNA-LINC00525 was upto 6.6-fold in glioma cells relative to the normal cells. Knockdown of lncRNA-LINC00525 significantly declined the proliferation of the glioma cancer cells. Additionally, the colony formation was inhibited by around 60% in glioma cells. The wound healing and transwell assays revealed significant (P &lt; 0.05) inhibition of migration and invasion potential under lncRNA-LINC00525 knockdown. The western blotting study of biomarkers of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) revealed that lncRNA-LINC00525 gene silencing reduced the expression of mesenchymal molecular markers but increased the protein levels of epithelial markers. miR-338-3p was predicted to be interacting with lncRNA-LINC00525 in glioma and was shown to mediated the regulatory role of lncRNA-LINC00525.

The enzymes of the two strains G25 and G38 that degrade BAs were amine oxidases (AOs) located on their respective cell membranes. The conditions that promoted the AO activity of Virgibacillus spp. were NaCl concentrations 5–10%, temperature 37 °C, pH 7.0 and ethanol concentrations 0–2%. Safety assessments (antibiotic susceptibility, biofilm activity and hemolytic activity) indicated that Virgibacillus spp. do not present a risk to human health, and this isolate can be confidently recommended as safe starter cultures for the food industry. Then, the two strains were cultured separately as starters and applied to the Gssp to analyze their influence on the flavor and quality of the product. As far as the bad flavors in Gssp such as sulfur-organic and sulf-chlor were concerned, the response values in the starter groups by G25 and G38 were significantly reduced by 39% and 65%, respectively. For the ability of strains to degrade BAs in Gssp, G25 degraded 11.1% of histamine, 11.3% of tyramine, 15.5% of putrescine and 4.1% of cadaverine; G38 significantly degraded 10.1% of histamine, 21.8% of tyramine, 18.1% of putrescine and 5.0% of cadaverine. These results indicated that the selected species could be used as starter cultures for the control of BA accumulation and degradation in Gssp.",

Cadmium (Cd) is one of the most toxic heavy metals and poses health risks to both humans and the ecosystem. Herein, we explore the impacts of Cd on a soil–plant system composed of oilseed rapes ( Brassica napus and Brassica juncea ) and bacteria. The results showed that Cd accumulation within tissues of two species of oilseed rapes enhanced with increasing concentrations of Cd in soils, and Cd treatment decreased their chlorophyll content and suppressed rapeseeds growth. Meanwhile, Cd stress induced the changes of antioxidative enzymes activities of both B. napus and B. juncea . Response to Cd of bacterial community was similar in soil-two species of oilseed rapes system. The impact of Cd on the bacterial communities of soils was greater than bacterial communities of plants (phyllosphere and endophyte). The α-diversity of bacterial community in soils declined significantly under higher Cd concentration (30 mg/kg). In addition, soil bacterial communities composition and structure were altered in the presence of higher Cd concentration. Meanwhile, the bacterial communities of bulk soils were significantly correlated with Cd, while the variation of rhizosphere soils bacterial communities were markedly correlated with Cd and other environmental factors of both soils and plants. These results suggested that Cd could affect both the growth of plants and the indigenous bacterial community in soil–plant system, which might further change ecosystem functions in soils.",

In our previous study, 4-HIL was synthesized from self-produced L-isoleucine (Ile) in Corynebacterium glutamicum by expressing an Ile dioxygenase gene. Although the 4-HIL production of recombinant strain SZ06 increased significantly, a by-product, L-lysine (Lys) was accumulated because of the share of the first several enzymes in Ile and Lys biosynthetic pathways. In this study, programming adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) was designed and conducted in SZ06 to promote 4-HIL biosynthesis. At first, a programming evolutionary system pMK was constructed, which contains a Lys biosensor LysG-P lysE and an evolutionary actuator composed of a mutagenesis gene and a fluorescent protein gene. The evolutionary strain SZ06/pMK was then let to be evolved programmatically and spontaneously by sensing Lys concentration. After successive rounds of evolution, nine mutant strains K1 − K9 with significantly increased 4-HIL production and growth performance were obtained. The maximum 4-HIL titer was 152.19 ± 14.60 mM, 28.4% higher than that in SZ06. This titer was higher than those of all the metabolic engineered C. glutamicum strains ever constructed. The whole genome sequencing of the nine evolved strains revealed approximately 30 genetic mutations in each strain. Only one mutation was directly related to the Lys biosynthetic pathway. Therefore, programming ALE driven by Lys biosensor can be used as an effective strategy to increase 4-HIL production in C. glutamicum .",

In present studies, we built 20 Cry2Ab alanine mutants site-directed in the helices α4–α5 of Domain I and demonstrated that mutants N151A, T152A, F157A, L183A, L185A and I188A could reduce the assembly of the 250 kDa oligomers, suggesting that these mutation residues might be essential for Cry2Ab oligomerization. As expected, all of these variants showed lower insecticidal activity against P. xylostella . Furthermore, we found that the pore-forming activities of these mutants also decreased when compared to wild-type Cry2Ab. Taken together, our data identified key residues for Cry2Ab oligomerization and emphasized that oligomerization was closely related to the insecticidal activity and pore-forming activity of Cry2Ab.",

The genome of a representative member of this group of fungi has recently been sequenced. However, because of their poor genetic tractability, including transformation, truffles have so far eluded in-depth functional genomic investigations. Here we report that A. tumefaciens can infect Tuber borchii mycelia, thereby conveying its transfer DNA with the production of stably integrated transformants. We constructed two new binary plasmids (pABr1 and pABr3) and tested them as improved transformation vectors using the green fluorescent protein as reporter gene and hygromycin phosphotransferase as selection marker. Transformants were stable for at least 12 months of in vitro culture propagation and, as revealed by TAIL- PCR analysis, integration sites appear to be heterogeneous, with a preference for repeat element-containing genome sites.",

We have used nano-sized acicular material to establish a novel method for bacterial transformation. Here, we generated penetrons that carried antisense DNA adsorbed on nano-sized acicular material (α-sepiolite) by providing sliding friction onto the surface of agar gel; we then investigated whether penetron formation was applicable to gene silencing techniques. Antisense DNA was artificially synthesized as 15 or 90mer DNA oligonucleotides based on the sequences around the translation start codon of target mRNAs. Mixtures of bacterial cells with antisense DNA adsorbed on α-sepiolite were stimulated by sliding friction on the surface of agar gel for 60 s. Upon formation of Escherichia coli penetrons, β-lactamase and β-galactosidase expression was evaluated by counting the numbers of colonies formed on LB agar containing ampicillin and by measuring β-galactosidase activity respectively. The numbers of ampicillin resistant colonies and the β-galactosidase activity derived from penetrons bearing antisense DNA (90mer) was repressed to 15% and 25%, respectively, of that of control penetrons which lacked antisense DNA. Biphenyl metabolite, ring cleavage yellow compound produced by Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes penetron treated with antisense oligonucleotide DNA targeted to bphD increased higher than that lacking antisense DNA. This result indicated that expression of bphD in P. pseudoalcaligenes penetrons was repressed by antisense DNA that targeted bphD mRNA. Sporulation rates of Bacillus subtilis penetrons treated with antisense DNA (15mer) targeted to spo0A decreased to 24.4% relative to penetrons lacking antisense DNA. This novel method of gene silencing has substantial promise for elucidation of gene function in bacterial species that have been refractory to experimental introduction of exogenous DNA.",

In this study we analysed the antioxidant capacity of pure chemical compounds (quercetin, ascorbic acid, caffeic acid, oleic acid, and glutathione) added to molasses during biomass propagation, and we determine several oxidative damage/response parameters (lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, protective metabolites and enzymatic activities) to assess their molecular effects. Supplementation with ascorbic, caffeic or oleic acids diminished the oxidative damage associated to ADY production. Based on these results, we tested supplementation of molasses with argan oil, a natural food-grade ingredient rich in these three antioxidants, and we showed that it improved both biomass yield and fermentative performance of ADY. Therefore, we propose the use of natural, food-grade antioxidant ingredients, such as argan oil, in industrial processes involving high cellular oxidative stress, such as the biotechnological production of the dry starter.",

The violet pigment PP-V is the one of the main pigments biosynthesized by this fungus. This pigment contains an amino group in a pyran ring as its core structure. We focused on this pigment and examined the relationship between intracellular ammonium concentration and pigment production using glutamine as a nitrogen source. The intracellular ammonium level decreased about 1.5-fold in conditions favoring PP-V production. Moreover, P. purpurogenum was transferred to medium in which it commonly produces the related pigment PP-O after cultivating it in the presence or absence of glutamine to investigate whether this fungus biosynthesizes PP-V using surplus ammonium in cells. Only mycelia cultured in medium containing 10 mM glutamine produced the violet pigment, and simultaneously intracellular ammonium levels decreased under this condition. From comparisons of the amount of PP-V that was secreted with quantity of surplus intracellular ammonium, it is suggested that P. purpurogenum maintains ammonium homeostasis by excreting waste ammonium as PP-V.",

    "abstract": "Market demands for monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are steadily increasing worldwide. As a result, production processes using Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) are in the focus of ongoing intensification studies for maximizing cell-specific and volumetric productivities. This includes the optimization of animal-derived component free (ADCF) cultivation media as part of good cell culture practice. Dipeptides are known to improve CHO culture performance. However, little or even conflicting assumptions exist about their putative import and functionality inside the cells. A set of well-known performance boosters and new dipeptide prospects was evaluated. The present study revealed that dipeptides are indeed imported in the cells, where they are decomposed to the amino acids building blocks. Subsequently, they are metabolized or, unexpectedly, secreted to the medium. Monoclonal antibody production boosting additives like L-alanine-L-glutamine (AQ) or glycyl-L-glutamine (GQ) can be assigned to fast or slow dipeptide uptake, respectively, thus pinpointing to the need to study dipeptide kinetics and to adjust their feeding individually for optimizing mAb production.",

Antibiotic susceptibility test was used to detect CIP resistant (CIPR) isolates and MICCIP was determined by broth microdilution method. The presence of qnrS gene was identified by PCR and Southern blot hybridization (SBH) confirmed their location. Checkerboard titration demonstrated the effect of NMP on CIP action. PCR followed by sequencing and in silico analysis revealed the contribution of mutations in acrR, marR and gyrA to CIPR development. Out of 152 isolates, 101 were detected as CIPR. Randomly selected 53 isolates (MICCIP 4-512 µg/mL) were identified as Escherichia spp. (26), Enterobacter spp. (7), Klebsiella spp. (5) and Salmonella spp. (15) and of them 31 isolates carried qnrS. qnrS harboring 18 highly CIPR isolates (MICCIP: 256-512 µg/mL) were selected for further study. SBH confirmed 7 isolates harbored qnrS gene in plasmids. The acrA, acrB and tolC were present in all 18 isolates and NMP had an additive (12-isolates) or synergistic (6-isolates) effect on CIP action. Most isolates contained double amino acid (aa) substitutions (S83L and D87N) in QRDR of GyrA resulting in an altered conformation of putative CIP binding pocket. However, some isolates contained single (S83L or S83Y) or no aa substitution but showed high CIPR implicating that the concerted action of three mechanisms is responsible for high CIPR with the most significant role of efflux pump.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Classical fungal mutant strains obtained by mutagenesis have helped to elucidate fundamental metabolic pathways in the past. In the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa , the gluc-1 strain was isolated long ago and characterized by its low level of β-glucosidase activity, which is essential for the degradation of cellulose, the most abundant biopolymer on Earth and the main polymeric component of the plant cell wall. Based on genomic resequencing, we hypothesized that the causative mutation resides in the β-glucosidase gene gh3-3 ( bgl6, NCU08755 ). In this work, growth patterns, enzymatic activities and sugar utilization rates were analyzed in several mutant and overexpression strains related to gluc-1 and gh3-3 . In addition, different mutants affected in the degradation and transport of cellobiose were analyzed. While overexpression of gh3-3 led to the recovery of β-glucosidase activity in the gluc-1 mutant, as well as normal utilization of cellobiose, the full gene deletion strain Δ gh3-3 was found to behave differently than gluc-1 with lower secreted β-glucosidase activity, indicating a dominant role of the amino acid substitution in the point mutated gh3-3 gene of gluc-1 . Our results furthermore confirm that GH3-3 is the major extracellular β-glucosidase in N. crassa and demonstrate that the two cellodextrin transporters CDT-1 and CDT-2 are essential for growth on cellobiose when the three main N. crassa β-glucosidases are absent. Overall, these findings provide valuable insight into the mechanisms of cellulose utilization in filamentous fungi, being an essential step in the efficient production of biorefinable sugars from agricultural and forestry plant biomass.",

We designed and constructed the naked plasmid DNA vaccine pcDNA-CCOL2A1, which effectively prevented and treated a rheumatoid arthritis model by inducing immunotolerance. We aimed to ensure a reliable, controllable dosage of this oral DNA vaccine preparation and establish its stability. We transformed pcDNA-CCOL2A1 via electroporation into attenuated Salmonella typhimurium SL7207. A resistant plate assay confirmed the successful construction of the transformed strain of the SL7207/pcDNA-CCOL2A1 oral DNA vaccine. We verified its identification and stability in vitro and in vivo. Significant differences were observed in the characteristics of the transformed and blank SL7207 strains. No electrophoretic restriction patterns or direct sequencing signals were observed in the original extract of the transformed strain. However, target gene bands and sequence signals were successfully detected after PCR amplification. CCOL2A1 expression was detected in the ilea of BALB/c mice that were orally administered SL7207/pcDNA-CCOL2A1. The pcDNA-CCOL2A1 plasmid of the transformed strain was retained under the resistant condition, and the transformed strain remained stable at 4 °C for 100 days. The concentration of the strain harboring the pcDNA-CCOL2A1 plasmid was stable at 109 CFU/mL after 6-8 h of incubation. The results demonstrated that the transformed strain SL7207/pcDNA-CCOL2A1 can be expressed in vivo, has good stability, and may be used to prepare the oral DNA vaccine pcDNA-CCOL2A1 with a stable, controllable dosage and the capacity to provide oral immunization.

    "abstract": "Abstract Nanobodies are highly specific binding domains derived from naturally occurring single chain camelid antibodies. Live biotherapeutic products (LBPs) are biological products containing preparations of live organisms, such as Lactobacillus , that are intended for use as drugs, i.e. to address a specific disease or condition. Demonstrating potency of multi-strain LBPs can be challenging. The approach investigated here is to use strain-specific nanobody reagents in LBP potency assays. Llamas were immunized with radiation-killed Lactobacillus jensenii or L. crispatus whole cell preparations. A nanobody phage-display library was constructed and panned against bacterial preparations to identify nanobodies specific for each species. Nanobody-encoding DNA sequences were subcloned and the nanobodies were expressed, purified, and characterized. Colony immunoblots and flow cytometry showed that binding by Lj75 and Lj94 nanobodies were limited to a subset of L. jensenii strains while binding by Lc38 and Lc58 nanobodies were limited to L. crispatus strains. Mass spectrometry was used to demonstrate that Lj75 specifically bound a peptidase of L. jensenii , and that Lc58 bound an S-layer protein of L. crispatus . The utility of fluorescent nanobodies in evaluating multi-strain LBP potency assays was assessed by evaluating a L. crispatus and L. jensenii mixture by fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and colony immunoblots. Our results showed that the fluorescent nanobody labelling enabled differentiation and quantitation of the strains in mixture by these methods. Development of these nanobody reagents represents a potential advance in LBP testing, informing the advancement of future LBP potency assays and, thereby, facilitation of clinical investigation of LBPs.",

The isolates differentiated into Gram positive and negative with rods and spherical shapes. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed 8 closely related bacterial genera that consisted of Bacillus (33.3%), Staphylococcus (22.2%), Alcaligens (11.1%) , Pantoea (11.1%), Xanthomonas, and Sphingomonas (7.4%) each. Others included Acinetobacter, and Pseudomonas at 3.7% each. Bacterial endophytes of genus bacillus were isolated from all the three plants. These results indicate the presence of high diversity of endophytic bacteria associated with the different parts of L. diversifolia, S. sesban and C. salothyrsus growing in western Kenya.",

Oral and nasal samples were collected by dry sponge swabs in 10 ml of sterile phosphate-buffered saline. The MRSA and Candida spp. was confirmed using the PCR method and mecA and Als3p genes, respectively. The SYBR Green-based quantitative real-time PCR was used to evaluate the relative expression levels of mecA and Als3p genes in MRSA and Candida spp., respectively. The frequency of S. aureus in oral-only and nasal-only swab samples were 14.1% ( n = 24/170). 58.3% ( n = 14/24) and 29.2% ( n = 7/24) of S. aureus isolated from oral and nasal samples were MRSA, respectively.

The overall average of gene expression levels among all Candida spp. and MRSA isolates indicated that the mecA and Als3p genes expression increased six and two times in co-colonization conditions compared to single colonization conditions, respectively. Our findings revealed the importance of polymicrobial infection in clinical settings and stated that it is possible that Candida spp. facilitates the infection of S. aureus and can lead to systemic infection in co-colonized patients.",

In this study, the immobilization of this enzyme on hydroxyapatite has been carried out and assessed with the aim of enhancing the characteristics and efficiency of chABCI. Hydroxyapatite particles (HAPs) are a potential candidate for drug-delivery carriers because of their excellent biocompatibility, shape controllability, and high adsorption. The use of the nanometer scale allows efficient access to the enzyme's substrate. It demonstrates important biological application capabilities in this way. Field emission gun-scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), in vitro release study, and cytotoxicity test were used to characterize the drug nanosystem's properties. According to the findings, electrostatic bindings was formed between charged groups of the enzyme and hydroxyapatite nanoparticles. The results also demonstrated that immobilized chABCI on hydroxyapatite has beneficial properties, such as more manageable drug release, minimal toxicity and side effects, and a high potential to enhance the efficacy of drug delivery and decrease the need for repeated injections.",

This study evaluated five natural flavonoid glycosides including Fisetin, Kaempferol, Morin, Myricetin, and Quercetin as photosensitizers against HPV-18 E6 and E7 oncoproteins using computational methods. After obtaining the amino acid sequences of HPV-18 E6 and E7, various tools were used to predict and verify their properties. The PubChem database was then examined to identify potential natural flavonoid glycosides, followed by predictions of their drug-likeness and ADMET properties. Subsequently, molecular docking was conducted to enhance the screening accuracy and to gain insights into the interactions between the natural compounds and the active sites of HPV-18 E6 and E7 oncoproteins. The protein structures of E6 and E7 were predicted and validated to be reliable. The results of molecular docking demonstrated that Kaempferol exhibited the highest binding affinity to both E6 and E7. All compounds satisfied Lipinski's rules of drug-likeness, except Myricetin. They showed high absorption, distribution volume and similar ADMET profiles with no toxicity. In summary, natural flavonoid glycosides, especially Kaempferol, show potential as photosensitizers for antimicrobial photodynamic therapy against HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer through inhibition of E6 and E7 oncoproteins.

The enzyme kinetic parameters were determined for each enzyme variant.

The specific activities were calculated as 7.5, 6.8, 4.9, and 2.8 µg HA µg enzyme −1 min −1 for SeHAS, HAS 123 , HAS 23 , and HAS Intra , respectively. The results revealed SeHAS produced a polydisperse HMW-HA (268 kDa), while HAS 123 and HAS 23 produced a polydisperse LMW-HA (&lt; 30 kDa). Interestingly, HAS Intra produced a low-disperse LMW-HA. Kinetics studies revealed the truncated variants displayed increased K m values for two substrates when compared to the wild-type enzyme. Biological assessments indicated all LMW-HAs showed a dose-dependent proliferation activity on endothelial cells (ECs), whereas HMW-HAs exhibited an inhibitory effect. Also, LMW-HAs had the highest cell migration effect at 10 µg/mL, while at 200 µg/mL, both LMW- and HMW-HAs postponed the healing recovery rate. The study elucidated that the transmembrane domains (TMDs) of SeHAS affect the enzyme kinetics, HA-titer, HA-size, and HA-dispersity. These findings open new insight into the rational engineering of SeHAS to produce size-defined HA. Graphical abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Adequate bowel cleansing is crucial for endoscopic diagnosis and treatment, and the recovery of gut microbiota after intestinal cleansing is also important. A hypertonic syrup predominantly comprising l -arabinose and d -xylose (20% xylo-oligosaccharides) can be extracted from the hemicellulose of corn husks and cobs. l -Arabinose and xylo-oligosaccharides have been reported to relieve constipation and improve the gut microbial environment. This study evaluated the bowel cleansing effect of the aforementioned syrup and its influence on the organism and intestinal microbiota after cleansing in comparison with polyethylene glycol-4000 (PEG-4000) in mice. Bowel cleansing was performed using syrup or PEG-4000 in C57BL/6J mice, and the effect of intestinal preparation and its influence on serum electrolytes and gut microbiota after bowel cleansing were evaluated. The volume of intestinal residual feces in the syrup group was significantly lower than that in the PEG-4000 group. Additionally, syrup disturbed serum electrolytes more mildly than PEG-4000. Alpha diversity in the gut microbiota was significantly higher in the syrup group than in the PEG-4000 group on the first day after bowel cleansing. However, no difference in beta diversity was observed between the two groups. Syrup increased the abundance of Bifidobacteria and Christensenella and decreased the abundance of Akkermansia in comparison with PEG-4000 on the first day after bowel cleansing. Thus, this syrup has potential clinical use as a bowel cleansing agent given the above effects, its benefits and safety, and better taste and acceptability.",

However, for the majority of enzyme classes, current screening methods have limited throughput, or need expensive substrates in combination with sophisticated setups. Here, we present a straightforward, high throughput selection system that couples sucrose synthase activity to growth.

    "abstract": "Abstract Urinary tract infections (UTI) by antibiotic resistant and virulent K. pneumoniae are a growing concern. Understanding the genome and validating the genomic profile along with pangenome analysis will facilitate surveillance of high-risk clones of K. pneumoniae to underpin management strategies toward early detection. The present study aims to correlate resistome with phenotypic antimicrobial resistance and virulome with pathogenicity in Klebsiella spp. The present study aimed to perform complete genome sequences of Klebsiella spp. and to analyse the correlation of resistome with phenotypic antimicrobial resistance and virulome with pathogenicity. To understand the resistome, pangenome and virulome in the Klebsiella spp, the ResFinder, CARD, IS Finder, PlasmidFinder, PHASTER, Roary, VFDB were used. The phenotypic susceptibility profiling identified the uropathogenic kp3 to exhibit multi drug resistance. The resistome and in vitro antimicrobial profiling showed concordance with all the tested antibiotics against the study strains. Hypermucoviscosity was not observed for any of the test isolates; this phenotypic character matches perfectly with the absence of rmpA and magA genes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the presence of ste, stf, stc and sti major fimbrial operons of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium in K. pneumoniae genome. The study identifies the discordance of virulome and virulence in Klebsiella spp. The complete genome analysis and phenotypic correlation identify uropathogenic K. pneumoniae kp3 as a carbapenem-resistant and virulent pathogen. The Pangenome of K. pneumoniae was open suggesting high genetic diversity. Diverse K serotypes were observed. Sequence typing reveals the prevalence of K. pneumoniae high-risk clones in UTI catheterised patients. The study also highlights the concordance of resistome and in vitro susceptibility tests. Importantly, the study identifies the necessity of virulome and phenotypic virulence markers for timely diagnosis and immediate treatment for the management of high-risk K. pneumoniae clones.",

The study particularly examined autolysis, indirectly associated with antibacterial resistance, when using Coptis rhizome for bacterial infections. In our methodology, Coptis rhizome was processed with ethanol and distilled water to produce four different extracts: CRET30, CRET50, CRET70, and CRDW. The antibacterial activity of these extracts were tested through Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) assays, disk diffusion tests, and time-kill assays, targeting both standard (ATCC 49619) and resistant (ATCC 70067) strains. The study also evaluated the extracts’ biofilm inhibition properties and monitored the expression of the lyt gene, integral to autolysis. The results prominently showed that the CRET70 extract demonstrated remarkable antibacterial strength. It achieved an MIC of 0.125 µg/mL against both tested S. pneumoniae strains. The disk diffusion assay recorded inhibition zones of 22.17 mm for ATCC 49619 and 17.20 mm for ATCC 70067. Impressively, CRET70 resulted in a 2-log decrease in bacterial numbers for both strains, showcasing its potent bactericidal capacity. The extract was also effective in inhibiting 77.40% of biofilm formation. Additionally, the significant overexpression of the lytA gene in the presence of CRET70 pointed to a potential mechanism of action for its antibacterial effects. The outcomes provided new perspectives on the use of Coptis rhizome in combating S. pneumoniae , especially significant in an era of escalating antibiotic resistance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recombinant protein production in Komagataella phaffi (K. phaffi) , a widely utilized host organism, can be optimized by enhancing the metabolic flux in the central carbon metabolism pathways. The methanol utilization pathway (MUT) during methanol-based growth plays a crucial role in providing precursors and energy for cell growth and development. This study investigated the impact of boosting the methanol dissimilation pathway, a branch of MUT that plays a vital role in detoxifying formaldehyde and providing energy in the form of NADH, in K. phaffi . This was achieved by integrating two orthologous genes from Hansenula polymorpha into the K. phaffi genome: formaldehyde dehydrogenase ( Hp FLD) and formate dehydrogenase ( Hp FMDH). The Hp FLD and Hp FMDH genes were isolated from the Hansenula polymorpha genome and inserted under the regulation of the pAOX1 promoter in the genome of recombinant K. phaffi that already contained a single copy of model protein genes (eGFP or EGII). The expression levels of these model proteins were assessed through protein activity assays and gene expression analysis. The findings revealed that while both orthologous genes positively influenced model protein production, Hp FMDH exhibited a more pronounced upregulation in expression compared to Hp FLD. Co-expression of both orthologous genes demonstrated synergistic effects, resulting in approximately a twofold increase in the levels of the model proteins detected. This study provides valuable insights into enhancing the production capacity of recombinant proteins in K. phaffi . Graphical abstract",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is a promising approach to combat antibiotic resistance in endodontic infections. It eliminates residual bacteria from the root canal space and reduces the need for antibiotics. To enhance its effectiveness, an in silico and in vitro study was performed to investigate the potential of targeted aPDT using natural photosensitizers, Kojic acid and Parietin. This approach aims to inhibit the biofilm formation of Enterococcus faecalis, a frequent cause of endodontic infections, by targeting the Ace and Esp proteins. After determining the physicochemical characteristics of Ace and Esp proteins and model quality assessment, the molecular dynamic simulation was performed to recognize the structural variations. The stability and physical movement of the protein-ligand complexes were evaluated. In silico molecular docking was conducted, followed by ADME/Tox profiling, pharmacokinetics characteristics, and assessment of drug-likeness properties of the natural photosensitizers. The study also investigated the changes in the expression of genes (esp and ace) involved in E. faecalis biofilm formation. The results showed that both Kojic acid and Parietin complied with Lipinski's rule of five and exhibited drug-like properties. In silico analysis indicated stable complexes between Ace and Esp proteins and the natural photosensitizers. The molecular docking studies demonstrated good binding affinity. Additionally, the expression of the ace and esp genes was significantly downregulated in aPDT using Kojic acid and Parietin with blue light compared to the control group. This investigation concluded that Kojic acid and Parietin with drug-likeness could efficiently interact with Ace and Esp proteins with a strong binding affinity. Hence, natural photosensitizers-mediated aPDT can be considered a promising adjunctive treatment against endodontic infections.",

The isoelectric point of 5.0 was determined by isoelectric focusing. The novel PSA_Lip showed only 23.8–25.1%, 25.5%, 26.6% and 28.4% identity to the previously characterized GDSL-like enzymes phospholipase, plant lipase, acetylcholinesterase and acetylxylan esterase, from the carbohydrate esterase family 16, respectively. Therefore, the enzyme was purified from the culture supernatant and the catalytic properties and the substrate specificity of the enzyme were investigated using different assays to reveal its potential function. While no phospholipase, acetylcholinesterase and acetylxylan esterase activities were detected, studies on the hydrolysis of ferulic acid methyl ester (~ 8.3%) and feruloylated carbohydrate 5- O -transferuloyl-arabino-furanose (~ 0.8%) showed low conversions of these substrates. By investigating the hydrolytic activity towards p- nitrophenyl-(pNP)-esters with various chain-lengths, the highest activity was determined for medium chain-length pNP-octanoate at 65 °C and a pH value of 8, while almost no activity was detected for pNP-hexanoate. The enzyme is highly stable when stored at pH 10 and 4 °C for at least 7 days. Moreover, using consensus sequence analysis and homology modeling, we could demonstrate that the PSA_Lip does not contain the usual SGNH residues in the actives site, which are usually present in GDS(L)-like enzymes.",

    "abstract": "The continuous growth of biofilm infections and their resilience to conventional cleaning methods and antimicrobial agents pose a worldwide challenge across diverse sectors. This persistent medical, industrial, and environmental issue contributes to treatment challenges and chronic diseases. Lactic acid bacteria have garnered global attention for their substantial antimicrobial effects against pathogens and established beneficial roles. Notably, their biofilms are also predicted to show a promising control strategy against pathogenic biofilm formation. The prevalence of biofilm-related problems underscores the need for extensive research and innovative solutions to tackle this global challenge. This novel study investigates the effect of different extracts (external, internal, and mixed extracts) obtained from Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG biofilm on pathogenic-formed biofilms. Subsequently, external extracts presented an important eradication effectiveness. Furthermore, a 6-fold concentration of these extracts led to eradication percentages of 57%, 67%, and 76% for Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms, respectively, and around 99.9% bactericidal effect of biofilm cells was observed for the three strains. The results of this research could mark a significant breakthrough in the field of anti-biofilm and antimicrobial strategies. Further studies and molecular research will be necessary to detect the molecules secreted by the biofilm, and their mechanisms of action engaged in new anti-biofilm strategies.",

Sustainable production of high-quality commonly used medicinal plants remains a limitation for commercialisation. Thus, this study investigated the potential for plant substitution by examining bacterial endophytes capable of producing similar host plant secondary metabolites. The metabolite profiles and endophytic bacterial communities of endangered Aloe lettyae were compared with those of Aloe longibracteata using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. Only 15 metabolites were significantly different between A. lettyae and A. longibracteata based on metabolite concentrations. However, both plants' functionality and potential application remain comparable. Phytohormones, including indole-3-acetate and 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetate, were more concentrated in A. lettyae than A. longibracteata. Metabolites such as tyrosine, allantoin, and myo-inositol, with human health benefits, were annotated in both species. Aloe lettyae harboured a phylogenetically diverse bacteria community compared to A. longibracteata, with a higher richness of bacterial species, indicating a likelihood of diverse metabolic capabilities among the bacteria. Dominant endophytes, including Bacillus, Comamonas, and Pseudomonas, possess enzymes contributing to various metabolic pathways. The enzymes have the potential to impact the synthesis, or breakdown of plant metabolites, consequently influencing the overall metabolic composition of the host plant. Therefore, this study supports the interchangeability of A. lettyae and A. longibracteata due to their ability to produce similar metabolites, and although the Aloe species exhibit phylogenetically diverse endophytic communities, the feasibility of utilizing their endophytes as producers of secondary metabolites remains viable.",

Current anti-leishmanial treatments are often ineffective over extended periods and are associated with toxic side effects, highlighting the urgent need for new, effective, and safe alternative treatments for this infectious disease. The objective of this study was to evaluate the anti-leishmanial effects of a hydroalcoholic extract of Hypericum scabrum (H. scabrum), comparing its efficacy to that of the control drug glucantime against the standard strain of Leishmania major. The H. scabrum plants were collected from the western regions of Iran. A hydroalcoholic extract was prepared from the flower and stem of the plant using a maceration method. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis was conducted to identify the chemical compounds present in the extract. Promastigotes of L. major were cultured, and the anti-leishmanial activity of the extracts was assessed at concentrations ranging from 12.5 to 800 µg/ml using the MTT [3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide] assay. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for the H. scabrum plant extract at 24, 48, and 72 h were 245.47, 141.25 and 85.11 μg/ml, respectively. The IC50 values for glucantime (the control drug) at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h were 30.19, 21.37, and 12.58 μg/ml, respectively. While the H. scabrum extract exhibited a lower effect compared to the control drug, it still demonstrated a significant inhibitory effect on the promastigote form of L. major. Given that the plant extract of H. scabrum has demonstrated promising anti-leishmanial effects against L. major promastigotes, further studies are warranted to evaluate the efficacy of these extracts in animal models of leishmaniasis.",

Three nucleic acid detection assays (Ustar, Coyote Flash10, Coyote Flash 20) that are widely used in China are currently being evaluated for their effectiveness in detecting MP DNA in nasopharyngeal specimens. Reference standard materials for MP and a total of 35 NPS collected from Peking Union Medical College Hospital were tested using the Ustar, Coyote Flash10 and Coyote Flash 20 assays to assess analytical sensitivity, analytical specificity, diagnostic performance and workflow. The assays showed differing limits of detection (LOD) based on the absolute quantification of reference standards, with LODs of 500 copies/mL for the Ustar assays and 200 copies/mL for both Coyote Flash10 and Coyote Flash 20 assays. Additionally, all three assays displayed excellently analytical specificity in detecting MP DNA.The clinical correlation analysis demonstrated that the Ustar assay exhibited a sensitivity of 90.00%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 100%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 62.50%. In contrast, both the Coyote Flash10 and Coyote Flash 20 assays displayed perfect diagnostic accuracy with 100% sensitivities, specificities, PPVs, and NPVs. Despite variations in detection principles, sample volume, and pre-preparation among the three assays, they all had a turnaround time of less than 30 min with low-throughput processing. Overall, all three rapid nucleic acid detection assays displayed excellent clinical performance in detecting MP DNA, offering a solid foundation for the quick clinical diagnosis of MP infection.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from livestock is a crucial step towards mitigating the impact of climate change and improving environmental sustainability in agriculture. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Yucca schidigera extract, chitosan, and chitosan nanoparticles as feed additives on in vitro GHG emissions and fermentation profiles in ruminal fluid from bulls. Total gas, CH 4 , CO, and H 2 S emissions (up to 48 h), rumen fermentation profiles, and CH 4 conversion efficiency were measured using standard protocols. The experiments involved supplementing 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mL/g dry matter (DM) of additives in different forages (alfalfa hay, corn silage, and oats hay). The chemical composition of forage showed suitable levels of DM, ash, crude protein, acid detergent fiber, neutral detergent fiber, lignin, and metabolizable energy. The addition of these supplements increased asymptotic gas production across all forages while simultaneously reducing CH 4 , CO, and H 2 S emissions, though the extent of reduction varied depending on forage type. Moreover, the treatments improved fermentation profiles, including pH and dry matter digestibility, and significantly influenced CH 4 conversion efficiency (CH 4 :ME, CH 4 :OM, and CH 4 :SCFA; P &lt; 0.05). These results underscore the potential of Y. schidigera extract, chitosan, and chitosan nanoparticles as effective strategies for mitigating GHG emissions from ruminants given these promising in vitro findings. Further in vivo studies are recommended to validate their efficacy under real-world conditions, which could pave the way for practical applications in the field.",

In the present study, statistical experimental design methodology was used to investigate the effect of fermentation conditions (dissolved oxygen, IPTG, and temperature) on rPDT production by Escherichia coli. rPDT is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of three different protein domains including the N-terminal 179 amino acid fragment of the S1 subunit of pertussis toxin, the full-length genetically detoxified diphtheria toxin (CRM197), and the 50 kDa tetanus toxin fragment C. A 15 Box–Behnken design augmented with center points revealed that IPTG and DO at the center point and low temperature will result in high yield. The optimal condition for rPDT production were found to be 100 µM IPTG, DO 30% and temperature 20 °C.",

Hence, the purpose of this paper is to explore the optimal C and N sources for large-scale culture of Paenibacillus polymyxa, and to screen trace elements that can promote their proliferation and improve the activity. First, the concentration of Paenibacillus polymyxa Pp-7250, the number of spores were used as evaluation index. It was found that the four trace elements Cu2+, Fe2+, Mn2+, and Zn2+ could promote the proliferation of Paenibacillus polymyxa at their optimal concentrations. Next, when using wheat starch as carbon source and soybean meal as nitrogen source, it was most suitable for large-scale culture. Finally, field experiments were carried out, and it was discovered that the combination of four trace elements plus the wheat soybean meal group could significantly improve the disease prevention, growth promotion ability of Pp-7250 and its colonization in ginseng. Moreover, the ability of Pp-7250 to transform ginseng roots and leaf saponins were also significantly improved. The group also affected the rhizosphere bacterial community of ginseng and the number showed a significant promotion or inhibition.",

However, native cyanobacteria do not produce these hydrocarbons at sufficient rates or yields to warrant commercial deployment.

The two putative genes (alr5283 and alr5284) required for long-chain hydrocarbon production in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 were knocked out through a double crossover approach. The knockout mutant abolished the production of heptadecane (C17H36). The mutant is able to be complemented by a plasmid bearing the two genes along with their native promoters only. The complemented mutant restored photosynthetic production of heptadecane. This combined genetic and metabolite (alkanes) profiling approach may be broadly applicable to characterization of knockout mutants, using N2-fixing cyanobacteria as a cellular factory driven by solar energy to produce a wide range of commodity chemicals and drop-in-fuels from atmospheric gases (CO2 and N2 gas) and mineralized water.",

Although it has been reported that ABF-2 exerts in vitro microbicidal activity against a range of bacteria and fungi, the structure of ABF-2 has not yet been solved. To enable structural studies of ABF-2 by NMR spectroscopy, a large amount of isotopically labeled ABF-2 is essential. However, the direct expression of ABF-2 in Escherichia coli is difficult to achieve due to its instability. Therefore, we applied a coexpression method to the production of ABF-2 in order to enhance the inclusion body formation of ABF-2. The inclusion body formation of ABF-2 was vastly enhanced by coexpression of aggregation-prone proteins (partner proteins). By using this method, we succeeded in obtaining milligram quantities of active, correctly folded ABF-2. In addition, 15 N-labeled ABF-2 and a well-dispersed heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum were also obtained successfully. Moreover, the effect of the charge of the partner protein on the inclusion body formation of ABF-2 in this method was investigated by using four structurally homologous proteins. We concluded that a partner protein of opposite charge enhanced the formation of an inclusion body of the target peptide efficiently.",

In this work, we present a novel enzyme, the Type I Baeyer–Villiger monooxygenase from Leptospira biflexa. This protein is phylogenetically distant from other well-characterized BVMOs.

As a result, we observed that this biocatalyst readily oxidized linear- and branched- medium-chain ketones, alkyl levulinates and linear ketones with aromatic substituents with excellent regioselectivity. In addition, this enzyme catalyzed the oxidation of 2-substituted cycloketone derivatives but showed an unusual selection against substituents in positions 3 or 4 of the ring.",

The material consisted of the M. haemolytica reference strain ATCC® BAA410, reference serotypes A1, A2, A5, A6, A7, A9, and A11, and wild-type isolates of serotype A1. Bacteriophage morphology was examined with a transmission electron microscope. The proteins were separated in SDS-PAGE and two-dimensional electrophoresis and characterized by MALDI-TOF. Among the phages obtained, seven were specific for strains A1, A2, A5, A6, A7 and 25, and PHL-1 was specific for the BAA410 strain. The protein profiles for the phages were very similar to one another, but differed from the reference phage in that they lacked protein fractions with molecular weights of 22.9, 56.3 and 73.1 kDa. 2D electrophoresis revealed significant differences in the size of proteins and their localization in the pH gradient. The most similar profiles were observed in phages specific for strains BAA-410 and A6. In all profiles two main spots were observed in the molecular weight range from 44 to 70 kDa at pH < 4. The results indicate that 2D electrophoresis is a very useful tool for characterization of phage protein profiles. An important objective was to determine the molecular differences between morphologically similar phages belonging to one family and to find similarities to phages specific for other pathogens.

Circular dichroism measurements suggested that the two S-layer proteins had a high β-sheet content and a low α-helix structure content. In an adhesion experiment, SA displayed higher adhesive capability towards Caco-2 cells than did SB. The results suggest that these two S-layer proteins could have biotechnological applications.",

Despite the high fat content, mayonnaise is an attractive substrate for food spoilage microorganisms. The aim of this study was to develop a method for yeast identification in mayonnaise and to test commercially available mayonnaises for the presence of these contaminating microorganisms. Based on the sequencing of intergenic regions ITS1 and ITS2, we identified a yeast microorganism that causes mayonnaise spoilage. We found that DNA sequences were more than 99% identical to the GenBank DNA sequences from Pichia kudriavzevii. We developed a specific to P. kudriavzevii TaqMan probe and primers. The reaction conditions were optimized regarding to the components concentration and temperature cycle. The minimum amount of P. kudriavzevii DNA that could be detected by developed method was 50 fg. The minimal number of P. kudriavzevii cells that could be detected by developed method without pre-enrichment was 50. We tested verified method with DNAs from microorganisms of different taxonomic groups that were obtained from three collections of microorganisms. Finally, we analyzed 20 different brands of mayonnaise from 14 producers and 10 different brands of mayonnaise sauce from seven producers. We determined the Cq parameter that characterizes transition of the fluorescence curve to the logarithmic phase and, therefore, correlates with the extent of sample contamination with P. kudriavzevii yeast. P. kudriavzevii was detected in six analyzed samples of mayonnaise and one sample of mayonnaise sauce.",

First, we have produced the essential reagent of mAb against AIV H3 strains with the development of an mAb-Mouse immunization with a purified H3-subtype AIV strain and cell fusion to generate hybridoma cells. These cells were screened with hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests, and optimal cells were subcloned. We chose a hybridoma cell line that steadily secreted a specific H3-subtype AIV mAb, designated 9F12, that belongs to the IgG1 subclass and has a K-type light chain. 9F12 was shown to bind specifically to the H3-subtype AIV antigen by both immunofluorescence assay and Western blot analysis. Finally, a 9F12-based sandwich ELISA was successfully developed and used to specifically test for this antigen. The sandwich ELISA conditions were optimized, and the specificity and sensitivity were validated. The results for clinical sample detection were consistent with viral isolation. Consequently, the 9F12-based sandwich ELISA is a specific, sensitive, robust, rapid and versatile diagnostic tool for H3-subtype AIV and provides a promising strategy for effective influenza virus prevention and control.",

QQ enzyme AiiO-AIO6 from Ochrobactrum sp. M231 has several excellent properties and shows biotherapeutic potential against important bacterial pathogens of aquatic species. AiiO-AIO6 can be secretory expressed in Bacillus subtilis via a non-classical secretion pathway. To improve AiiO-AIO6 production, four intracellular protease-deletion mutants of B. subtilis 1A751 were constructed by individually knocking out the intracellular protease-encoding genes ( tepA, ymfH, yrrN and ywpE ). The AiiO-AIO6 expression plasmid pWB-AIO6BS was transformed into the B. subtilis 1A751 and its four intracellular protease-deletion derivatives. Results showed that all recombinant intracellular protease-deletion derivatives (BSΔ tepA , BSΔ ymfH , BSΔ yrrN and BSΔ ywpE ) had a positive impact on AiiO-AIO6 production. The highest amount of AiiO-AIO6 extracellular production of BSΔ ywpE in shake flask reached 1416.47 U/mL/OD 600 , which was about 121% higher than that of the wild-type strain. Furthermore, LC–MS/MS analysis of the degrading products of 3-oxo-C8-HSL by purification of AiiO-AIO6 indicated that AiiO-AIO6 was an AHL-lactonase which hydrolyzes the lactone ring of AHLs. Phylogenetic analysis showed that AiiO-AIO6 was classified as a member of the α/β hydrolase family with a conserved “nucleophile-acid-histidine” catalytic triad. In summary, this study showed that intracellular proteases were responsible for the reduced yields of heterologous proteins and provided an efficient strategy to enhance the extracellular production of AHL lactonase AiiO-AIO6.",

This microalga immobilized in alginate beads was previously shown to be useful for the reduction of several chemical and microbial contaminants present in the highly polluted water from the Matanza–Riachuelo watershed. However, these beads had a relatively short shelf life in the natural environment. To overcome this limitation, a 3D-printed PLA device was designed. PLA is a biocompatible and biodegradable material suitable for biotechnological applications. We used Erlenmeyers and stirred-tank bioreactors fed batch with Murashige Skoog (MS) culture medium or water from the Cildáñez stream (one of the water bodies of the aforementioned watershed) to estimate the growth kinetics parameters and the bioremediation capacity of immobilized-microalgal cells as an unconfined system (UcS) or a confined system (CfS) inside PLA devices on Cildáñez water. Although alga’s growth parameters were maximum in the UcS fed with MS medium as substrate, successful bioremediation of the target water was possible using the CfS: all inorganic nitrogen forms and total phosphorus were reduced at least by 90% after 5 days of bioprocess in an agitated bioreactor, whereas aerobic mesophilic bacteria decreased by about 85%. The number of coliforms also decreased. Standardized cytotoxicity tests using Allium cepa seeds carried out to prove the effectiveness of the bioremediation process, confirmed the high degree of decontamination achieved by the use of immobilized microalga confined in a 3D-printable PLA-device.",

The purpose of this study was to explore the intestinal flora of the sable by metagenomic library-based techniques. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument. The effective sequencing data of each sample was above 6000 M, and the ratio of clean reads to raw reads was over 98%. The total ORF length was approximately 603,031, equivalent to 347.36 Mbp. We investigated gene functions with the KEGG database and identified 7140 KEGG ortholog (KO) groups comprising 129,788 genes across all of the samples. We selected a subset of genes with the highest abundances to construct cluster heat maps. From the results of the KEGG metabolic pathway annotations, we acquired information on gene functions, as represented by the categories of metabolism, environmental information processing, genetic information processing, cellular processes and organismal systems. We then investigated gene function with the CAZy database and identified functional carbohydrate hydrolases corresponding to genes in the intestinal microorganisms of sable. This finding is consistent with the fact that the sable is adapted to cold environments and requires a large amount of energy to maintain its metabolic activity. We also investigated gene functions with the eggNOG database; the main functions of genes included gene duplication, recombination and repair, transport and metabolism of amino acids, and transport and metabolism of carbohydrates. In this study, we attempted to identify the complex structure of the microbial population of sable based on metagenomic sequencing methods, which use whole metagenomic data, and to map the obtained sequences to known genes or pathways in existing databases, such as CAZy, KEGG, and eggNOG. We then explored the genetic composition and functional diversity of the microbial community based on the mapped functional categories.",

The effect of different micronutrients such as mineral salts and vitamin on P. indica H32 growth was determined as well. A mixture design based on Design-Expert 10.0 Software was performed to optimize the culture medium concentration. Finally, in the designed medium, an attribute of the biological mechanism of action of the P. indica H32 against nematodes, was evaluated: the hydrogen sulfide production. It was found that tested carbon/nitrogen ratios were not a significant influence on P. indica H32 growth. Growth of P. indica H32 was favored with use of sucrose, yeast extract and phosphate buffer without the addition of any tested micronutrients. An optimal concentration of 10 g/L sucrose and 5 g/L yeast extract were obtained at a cost of 0.10 $/L. In this concentration, the specific growth rate (µ) and maximal optical density (Xmax) were equal to 0.439 h − 1 and 8.00 respectively. It was evidenced that under the culture conditions used, P. indica H32 produced hydrogen sulfide. The designed medium led to a 1.08 $/L reduction of costs in comparison to LB medium.

The results demonstrated the combination of strains HN006 ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) and HN010 ( Wickerhamomyces anomalus ) provided satisfactory wine fermentation with an interesting flavor profile, as strain HN010 was highly aromatic and had elevated sensory scores with comparatively low ethanol yield, while strain HN006 had a poor flavor profile but produced the largest amount of ethanol. Subsequently, we co-cultured strains HN006 and HN010 to optimize the fermentation system. The results revealed the following optimum parameters: a mixed inoculum of 6% (v/v) at an HN006/HN010 ratio of 1:2 (v/v), a raw material ratio of 5:3:2 (chestnut: malt: glutinous rice), and yeast extract concentration of 6 g/L. Additionally, this fermentation system was successfully scaled-up to a 1000 L pilot-scale system. The results of this study showed that strains HN006 and HN010 could be used as alternatives for whiskey fermentation, as well as provided a generalized experimental scheme to assess other microorganisms.",

    "abstract": "The short-faced moles (Scaptochirus moschata) are unique Chinese mammal that live in burrows for life. They have complex ecological adaptation mechanisms to adapt to perennial underground life. Intestinal microbes play an important role in the ecological adaptation of wild animals. The gut microbiota diversity and its function in short-faced moles' ecological adaptation is a scientific issue worth exploring. In this study, the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform was used to sequence the V3-V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA genes of 22 short-faced moles' intestinal samples to study the composition and functional structure of their intestinal microbiota. The results showed that in the short-faced moles' intestine, there are four main phyla, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidete. At the family level, Peptostreptococcaceae and Enterobacteriaceae have the highest abundance. At the genus level, Romboutsia is the genus with the highest microbial abundance. According to the KEGG database, the main functions of short-faced mole gut microbes are metabolism, genetic information processing, environmental information processing, and cellular processes. The function of short-faced mole intestinal microbiota is suitable for its long-term burrowing life. No gender difference is found in the composition and function of the short-faced mole intestinal microbiota. There are significant differences in the composition and functional structure of the short-faced mole gut microbiota between samples collected from different habitats. We conferred that this is related to the different environment factors in which they live, especially to the edaphic factors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Given its biocompatibility, rheological, and physiological properties, hyaluronic acid (HA) has become a biomaterial of increasing interest with multiple applications in medicine and cosmetics. In recent decades, microbial fermentations have become an important source for the industrial production of HA. However, due to its final applications, microbial HA must undergo critical and long purification processes to ensure clinical and cosmetic grade purity. Aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS) have proven to be an efficient technique for the primary recovery of high-value biomolecules. Nevertheless, their implementation in HA downstream processing has been practically unexplored. In this work, polyethylene glycol (PEG)–citrate ATPS were used for the first time for the primary recovery of HA produced with an engineered strain of Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus . The effects of PEG molecular weight (MW), tie-line length (TLL), volume ratio (V R ), and sample load on HA recovery and purity were studied with a clarified fermentation broth as feed material. HA was recovered in the salt-rich bottom phase, and its recovery increased when a PEG MW of 8000 g mol −1 was used. Lower V R values (0.38) favoured HA recovery, whereas purity was enhanced by a high V R (3.50). Meanwhile, sample load had a negative impact on both recovery and purity. The ATPS with the best performance was PEG 8000 g mol −1 , TLL 43% (w/w), and V R 3.50, showing 79.4% HA recovery and 74.5% purity. This study demonstrated for the first time the potential of PEG–citrate ATPS as an effective primary recovery strategy for the downstream process of microbial HA.",

Here we report the biochemical characterization and biotechnological assessment of two heterologously expressed members of GH5-23-McGlc from Mucor circinelloides and PcGlc from Penicillium chrysogenum. Both enzymes exhibited the highest hydrolytic activities with quercetin-3-β-O-glucopyranoside, whereas lower specificity constants were determined with the rutinosides narcissin, rutin and hesperidin. High stabilities against thermal, ethanol and dimethyl sulfoxide-induced inactivation, a very limited secondary hydrolysis of the formed transglycosylation products, and no detectable product inhibition were additional features appropriate for biotechnological applications. The enzymes were compared in their efficiencies to hydrolyze rutin and to synthesize 2-phenylethyl rutinoside under homogeneous and heterogeneous reaction conditions using high rutin concentrations of 100 and 300 mM. Highest transglycosylation efficiencies were achieved with fully dissolved rutin in reaction mixtures containing 25% dimethyl sulfoxide. Molecular docking and multiple sequence alignments suggest that the hydrophobic environment of aromatic residues within the + 1 subsite of GH5-23 glycosidases is very important for the binding of flavonoid glucosides and rutinosides.",

    "abstract": "Wild-type cultivations are of invaluable relevance for industrial biotechnology when it comes to the agricultural or food sector. Here, genetic engineering is hardly applicable due to legal barriers and consumer's demand for GMO-free products. An important pillar for wild-type cultivations displays the genus Bacillus. One of the challenges for Bacillus cultivations is the global ComX-dependent quorum sensing system. Here, molecular process control can serve as a tool to optimize the production process without genetic engineering. To realize this approach, quantitative knowledge of the mechanism is essential, which, however, is often available only to a limited extent. The presented work provides a case study based on the production of cyclic lipopeptide surfactin, whose expression is in dependence of ComX, using natural producer B. subtilis DSM 10 T. First, a surfactin reference process with 40 g/L of glucose was performed as batch fermentation in a pilot scale bioreactor system to gain novel insights into kinetic behavior of ComX in relation to surfactin production. Interestingly, the specific surfactin productivity did not increase linearly with ComX activity. The data were then used to derive a mathematic model for the time course of ComX in dependence of existing biomass, biomass growth as well as a putative ComX-specific protease. The newly adapted model was validated and transferred to other batch fermentations, employing 20 and 60 g/L glucose. The applied approach can serve as a model system for molecular process control strategies, which can thus be extended to other quorum sensing dependent wild-type cultivations.",

In this study, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific to Hexon protein of FAdV-4, designated as 3G8, was generated. Subsequently, the linear peptide recognized by 3G8 was mapped and identified as 213AYGAYVK219 using a series of overlapping peptides generated from Hexon protein. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that the epitope recognized by 3G8 was highly conserved across all the FAdVs. The epitope was immunogenic and could be recognized by FAdV-4 positive chicken serum samples.

Streptococcus mutans is an established cariogenic bacteria dwelling within biofilms, and C123 segment of P1 protein is known to form amyloid fibrils in S. mutans biofilms, among which C3 segment could serve as a promising anti-amyloid target due to its critical role in C123-P1 interactions. Recently, small molecules have been found to successfully inhibit biofilms by targeting amyloid fibrils. Thus, our study aimed to screen small molecules targeting C3 segment with the capacity to influence amyloid fibrils and S. mutans biofilms. In silico screening was utilized to discover promising small molecules, which were evaluated for their effects on bacterial cells and amyloid fibrils. We selected 99 small molecules and enrolled 55 small molecules named D1–D55 for crystal violet staining. Notably, D25 selectively inhibit S. mutans biofilms but had no significant influence on biofilms formed by Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus sanguinis , and D25 showed no bactericidal effects and low cytotoxicity. In addition, amyloid fibrils in free-floating bacteria, biofilms and purified C123 were quantified with ThT assays, and the differences were not statistically significant in the presence or absence of D25. Morphological changes of amyloid fibrils were visualized with TEM images, where amorphous aggregates were obvious coupled with long and atypical amyloid fibrils. Moreover, amyloid-related genes were upregulated in response to D25. In conclusion, D25 is a promising antimicrobial agent with the capacity to influence amyloid fibrils and inhibit S. mutans biofilms.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic green algae have become an increasingly popular platform for recombinant proteins production. In particular, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, has garnered increased attention for having the necessary biochemical machinery to produce vaccines, human antibodies and next generation cancer targeting immunotoxins. While it has been shown that chloroplasts contain chaperones, peptidyl prolylisomerases and protein disulfide isomerases that facilitate these complex proteins folding and assembly, little has been done to determine which processes serve as rate-limiting steps for protein accumulation. In other expression systems, as Escherichia coli, Chinese hamster ovary cells, and insect cells, recombinant protein accumulation can be hampered by cell's inability to fold the target polypeptide into the native state, resulting in aggregation and degradation. To determine if chloroplasts' ability to oxidize proteins that require disulfide bonds into a stable conformation is a rate-limiting step of protein accumulation, three recombinant strains, each expressing a different recombinant protein, were analyzed. These recombinant proteins included fluorescent GFP, a reporter containing no disulfide bonds; Gaussia princeps luciferase, a luminescent reporter containing disulfide bonds; and an immunotoxin, an antibody-fusion protein containing disulfide bonds. Each strain was analyzed for its ability to accumulate proteins when supplemented with selenocystamine, a small molecule capable of catalyzing the formation of disulfide bonds. Selenocystamine supplementation led to an increase in luciferase and immunotoxin but not GFP accumulation. These results demonstrated that selenocystamine can increase the accumulation of proteins containing disulfide bonds and suggests that a rate-limiting step in chloroplast protein accumulation is the disulfide bonds formation in recombinant proteins native structure.",

In this study we used A. nidulans WG505 as an expression host to heterologously express Gaeumannomyces graminis lipoxygenase. The presence of the recombinant LOX induced phenotypic changes in A. nidulans transformants. Also, a proteomic analysis of an A. nidulans LOX producing strain indicated that the heterologous protein was degraded before its glycosylation in the secretory pathway. We observed that the presence of LOX induced the specific production of aminopeptidase Y that possibly degrades the G. graminis lipoxygenase intercellularly. Also the presence of the protein thioredoxin reductase suggests that the G. graminis lipoxygenase is actively repressed in A. nidulans.",

The objective of this study was to produce biologically active, four chicken FST-type proteins in an Escherichia coli expression system. Gibson assembly cloning method was used to insert the DNA fragments of four FST-type proteins, designated as FST288, NDFSD1/2, NDFSD1, and NDFSD1/1, into pMALc5x vector downstream of the maltose-binding protein (MBP) gene, and the plasmids containing the inserts were eventually transformed into Shuffle E. coli strain for protein expression. We observed a soluble expression of the four MBP-fused FST-type proteins, and the proteins could be easily purified by the combination of amylose and heparin resin affinity chromatography. MBP-fused FST-type proteins demonstrated their affinity to anti-FST antibody. In an in vitro reporter gene assay to examine their potencies and selectivities to different ligands (MSTN, GDF11, and activin A), the four FST-type proteins (MBP-FST288, MBP-NDFSD1/2, MBP-NDFSD1, and MBP-NDFSD1/1) showed different potency and selectivity against the three ligands from each other. Ligand selectivity of each FST-type proteins was similar to its counterpart FST-type protein of eukaryotic origin. In conclusion, we could produce four FST-type proteins having different ligand selectivity in E. coli, and the results imply that economic production of a large amount of FST-type proteins with different ligand selectivity is possible to examine their potential use in meat-producing animals.",

The molecular size of the purified enzyme is approximately 18 kDa and the in silico study cited here indicated the presence of a zinc-binding domain predicted to be a member of the subfamily A of a metallopeptidase. Its activity, however, was reduced by the presence of Zn2+. When Escherichia coli PG was used as a substrate and subjected to digestion for 5 min with 3 μg/ml of enzyme, the peptidase M15A showed 2 times higher in lysis efficiency when compared to the commercial lysozyme. The enzyme works in a broad alkaligenic pH range of 7.5–9.0 and temperatures from 25 to 42 °C. The enzyme was able to lyse 18 Gram-negative bacteria in which the outer membrane was permeabilized by chloroform treatment. Interestingly, it also lysed Enterococcus sp., but not other Gram-positive bacteria. In general, endolysin cannot lyse Gram-negative bacteria from outside, however, the cationic amphipathic C-terminal in some endolysins showed permeability to Gram-negative outer membranes. Genetically engineered ST79 peptidase M15A that showed a broad spectrum against Gram-negative bacterial PG or, in combination with an antibiotic the same way as combined drug methodology, could facilitate an effective treatment of severe or antibiotic resistant cases.",

    "abstract": "Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a life-threatening infection in immunocompromised patients, rapid and sensitive detection of Aspergillus from clinical samples has been a major challenge in the early diagnosis of IA. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA-ELISA) was developed to fulfil the need for the efficient diagnosis of these infections. The primers targeting 18S rRNA were selected for the amplification of Aspergillus RNA by the isothermal digoxigenin (DIG)-labeling NASBA process. The DIG-labeled RNA amplicons were hybridized with a specific biotinylated DNA probe immobilized on streptavidin-coated microtiter plate. The hybrids were colorimetrically detected by the addition of an anti-DIG antibodies linked to ALP and substrate (disodium 4-nitrophenyl phosphate). The detection limit of the Aspergillus NABSA-ELISA system was 1 CFU and the RNA in non-target bacteria or fungus was not amplified. The performance of this NASBA-ELISA compared to RT-PCR and galactomannan (GM) was evaluated by testing blood samples from 86 patients at high risk for IA. The sensitivity of NASBA-ELISA, RT-PCR and GM-ELISA was 80.56 % (95 % CI 63.98–91.81), 72.22 % (95 % CI 54.81–85.80), 58.33 % (95 % CI 40.76–74.49), respectively, and the specificity was 80.00 % (95 % CI 66.28–89.97), 84.00 % (95 % CI 70.89–92.83), 82.00 % (95 % CI 68.56–91.42). The efficiency of the three methods in various combinations was also evaluated. Combination of NASBA-ELISA and GM-ELISA testing achieved perfect specificity (100 %; 95 % CI 92.89–100) and perfect positive predictive value (100 %; 95 % CI 83.16–100).

In conclusion, the NASBA-ELISA assay consists of an alternative process for large-scale samples detection with semi-quantitative results and provides good clinical performance without resorting to expensive equipment. This assay makes it possible for the NASBA based RNA diagnosis to become a routine work in laboratories in less developed countries with fewer resources.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAO1 has been commonly used in the laboratory, with frequent genome variations reported. Quorum sensing (QS), a cell-cell communication system, plays important role in controlling a variety of virulence factors. However, the evolution and adaptability of QS in those laboratory strains are still poorly understood. Here we used the QS reporter and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to systematically investigate the QS phenotypes and corresponding genetic basis in collected laboratory PAO1 strains. We found that the PAO1-z strain has an inactive LasR protein, while bearing an active Rhl QS system and exhibiting QS-controlled protease-positive activity. Our study revealed that an 18-bp insertion in mexT gene gave rise to the active QS system in the PAO1-z strain. This MexT inactivation restored the QS activity caused by the inactive LasR, showing elevated production of pyocyanin, cyanide and elastase. Our results implied the evolutionary trajectory for the PAO1-z strain, with the evulutionary order from the first Las QS inactivation to the final Rhl QS activation. Our findings point out that QS homeostasis occurs in the laboratory P. aeruginosa strain, offering a potential platform for the QS study in clinical isolates.",

    "abstract": "Dengue is an arboviral disease, which threatens almost half the global population, and has emerged as the most significant of current global public health challenges. In this study, we prepared dengue virus-like particles (DENV-LPs) consisting of Capsid-premembrane-envelope (CprME) and premembrane-envelope (prME) polypeptides from serotype 1 and 4, which were expressed in the silkworms using Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) bacmid. 1CprME, 1prME, 4CprME, and 4prME expressed proteins in hemolymph, and the molecular weight of the purified proteins was 55 kDa, respectively. The purified polypeptides formed spherical Dengue virus-like particles (DENV-LPs) with ~ 30-55 nm in diameter. The immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) images revealed antigens to the surface of a lipid bilayer of DENV-LPs. The heparin-binding assay shows a positive relationship between absorbance and E protein domain III (EDIII) quantity, which is supported by the isothermal titration calorimetry assay. This indicates a moderate binding affinity between heparin and DENV-LP. The high correlation between patient sera and DENV-LP reactivities revealed that these DENV-LPs shared similar epitopes with the natural dengue virus. IgG elicitation studies in mice have demonstrated that DENV-LPs/CPrMEs elicit a stronger immune response than DENV-LP/prMEs, which lends credence to this claim.",

The fresh BSG is currently used as low-cost cattle feed due to its microbiological instability and high perishability. While recent research looked at the effects of storage time and temperature on the characteristics of wet brewers grains (WBG) as ruminant feeds. Three storage temperatures (15, 20, and 25 °C) and periods (2, 4 and 6 days) were arranged in a 3 × 3 factorial design. Surface spoilage was not apparent at 15 °C throughout the storage periods. Deterioration was not also observed at 20 °C until the fourth day of storage where slight mold growth was apparent. Extensive mold growth was detected late in the sixth day at 20 °C and continued manifestations up until the last day of storage at 25 °C. Changes in major nutrients, DM losses, and yeast and mold colony count were significantly affected by the interaction of storage temperatures and durations (P < 0.05). Except for samples stored at 15 °C, nutrients contents decreased concomitantly (exceptions are ADF, lignin, and loss in DM) with prolonged storage times (p < 0.05) and increasing temperatures (p < 0.05). Contrast analysis indicated that it would be safe to store under aerobic storage conditions and feed the WBG for dairy cattle.",

Results showed that the sequence identity of 3WZ1 and 1URX reaches 48.8%. 1URX has a higher thermal sensitivity and less thermostability than 3WZ1 as more thermostable regions and hydrogen bonds exist in 3WZ1 compared with 1URX. The structures of 1URX and 3WZ1 become unstable with increasing temperatures up to 500 K. The strategies to increase the thermostability of 1URX and 3WZ1 are discussed. This study could provide insights into the design and modification of β-agarases at a high temperature.",

It is still a challenge to obtain metabolic engineering strains with high ABE yield. Screening strains with remarkable characteristics from nature and improving ABE yield by mutation are viable approaches. Clostridium beijerinckii XH 0906, a newly isolated strain, produces butanol and isopropanol (BI) as the main end-products (9.1 g/L BI) during fermentation with glucose as the sole carbon source. The screening process for this strain was performed under aerobic conditions rather than anaerobic environment. Thus, it is a robust stain capable of oxygen-tolerant BI fermentation. Furthermore, C. beijerinckii XH 0906 fermented xylose and glucose simultaneously to produce BI. A mutant strain obtained by ultraviolet (UV) mutagenesis, C. beijerinckii XH 29, had improved BI production capacity and could produce 17.0 g/L BI and 18.4 g/L BI using glucose or corn stover hydrolysate, respectively as the carbon source. Interestingly, C. beijerinckii XH 29 also produced up to 19.3 g/L isopropanol through fermentation of a glucose-acetone mix. These results indicate that C. beijerinckii XH 29 is an excellent BI producer with great potential for industrial applications.",

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of Broussonetia papyrifera silage (BPS) gradually replacing the whole crop maize silage (WCMS) on total tract digestibility, rumen fermentation parameters, serum biochemical indicators, and rumen microbes of Holstein heifers. The diet treatment consisted of four proportions of BPS (0%, 25%, 50% and 75%) as substitute for WCMS (designated as T0, T25, T50 and T75, respectively). Twenty heifers (body weight = 245 ± 24 kg) were randomly divided into four groups of five heifers, and randomly received one diet. The feeding adaption period was 7 days, and the experiment period was 30 days. Our findings suggested that the digestibility of neutral detergent fiber and crude protein increased linearly with the increased in BPS (P < 0.05). The concentrations of total protein and albumin increased quadratically with the increased in BPS (P < 0.05). The 16s high-throughput sequencing showed that feeding BPS did not change the diversity and structure of the rumen microbes of heifers. However, the relative abundances of Tenericutes and SR1-Absconditabacteria increased linearly with the increased in BPS (P < 0.05). The Weighted Correlation Network Analysis results suggested that ALT concentration was positively correlated with the abundance of Prevotella-1 (r = 0.73; P = 0.007). In general, Holstein heifers fed with BPS did not change the diversity and uniformity of rumen microbes, and enhanced the body protein metabolism.",

To explore other alternatives, researchers focused on cell agriculture and cell-based meat, especially large-scale cell culture. As a prerequisite for production, large-scale culture technology has become an important bottleneck restricting cell-based meat industrialization. In this study, the single-factor variable method was adopted to examine the influence of Cytodex1 microcarrier pretreatment, spinner flask reaction vessel, cell culture medium, serum and cell incubation, and other influencing factors on large-scale cell cultures to identify the optimization parameters suitable for 3D culture environment. Collagen and 3D culture were also prospectively explored to promote myogenesis and cultivate tissue-like muscle fibers that contract spontaneously. This research lays a theoretical foundation and an exploratory practice for large-scale cell cultures and provides a study reference for the microenvironment of myoblast culture in vitro, a feasible direction for the cell therapy of muscular dystrophy, and prerequisites for the industrialized manufacturing of cell-based meat. Graphical summary: Research on large-scale myoblast culture using spinner flasks and microcarriers. For cell culture, the microcarriers were pretreated with UV and collagen. Cell seeding condition, spinner flask speed, resting time, and spinner flask culture microenvironment were then optimized. Finally, two culture systems were prepared: a culture system based on large-scale cell expansion and a culture system for myogenesis promotion and differentiation.",

These bioreactors are expected to be run for extended periods of time and may experience variations in the influent quality, such as increasing sulfate loading rate and decrease in pH, while being expected to function optimally. In this study we followed the sulfate removal rate and variation in microbial communities over a period of up to 333 days in three different up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) bioreactors being submitted to increasing sulfate loading rate or decreasing pH. Sodium lactate was used as the sole carbon source and electron donor. All three bioreactors contained highly diverse microbial communities containing archaea, fungi and bacteria. Sulfurospirillum and Desulfovibrio were the most prominent bacterial genera detected in the bioreactors receiving the highest sulfate loading rates, and the greatest relative abundance of methanogenic archaea and the fungal genus Cadophora coincided with the highest sulfate reduction rates. In contrast, Sulfuricurvum was dominant in the bioreactor receiving influent with alternating pH, but its relative abundance receded in response to low pH of the influent. All bioreactors showed excellent sulfate removal even under extreme conditions in addition to unique responses in the microbial communities under changing operational conditions. This shows that a high diversity in the microbial consortia in the bioreactors could make the sulfate removal process less sensitive to changing operational conditions, such as variations in influent sulfate loading rate and pH.",

Fifty-five patients with H. pylori-associated gastritis, 47 patients with H. pylori-associated PUD, and 48 uninfected patients were in this research. Antrum biopsy was used to detect H. pylori, virulence factors and histopathological assessments. Expression of TNF-α in the infected group was significantly higher than the uninfected group. Also, cagA/oipA-positive infected patients induce significantly more TNF-α expression than do cagA/oipA-negative infected patients. Expression of TNF-α was significantly increased in the PUD group than the gastritis group. Notably, TNF-α expression had a significant positive correlation with the frequency of Th1/Th17/Th22 lymphocytes in the PUD group. These findings indicate the importance of increasing TNF-α with Th1, Th17, Th22 responses increase as an important risk factor for PUD in context of H. pylori infection.",

Snailase and lyticase were screened and combined in this work to enhance the lysis of Candida cells. The lysis solution composition and metal bath were optimized to boost amplification efficiency and biosafety. A duplex real-time PCR was established to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the preparation method. Using the supernatant from the rapid preparation method as templates, the duplex PCR sensitivities for five common Candida species were determined to be as low as 10 0 CFUs. When compared to conventional preparation methods, the samples prepared by our method showed higher PCR detection sensitivity. PCR identification and ITS sequencing were 100% consistent, which was better than biochemical identification. This study demonstrates a rapid method for Candida DNA preparation that has the potential to be used in clinical laboratories. Meanwhile, the practical application of the method for clinical samples needs to be proven in future investigations.",

Only GH16B (597 amino acids, 63.8 kDa), with N-terminal 22-amino acid signal sequence, was secreted into the culture supernatant and demonstrated a robust endolytic agarose hydrolyzing activity for producing neoagarotetraose (NA4) and neoagarohexaose (NA6) as end products. The optimal temperature and pH for the enzyme activity were 50 °C and 7.0, respectively. The enzyme was stable up to 50 °C and over a pH range of 5.0-8.0. The kinetic parameters, including Km, Vmax, kcat, and kcat/Km, of GH16B β-agarases for agarose were 14.40 mg/mL, 542.0 U/mg, 576.3 s-1, and 4.80 × 106 s-1 M-1, respectively. The addition of 1 mM MnCl2 and 15 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine enhanced the enzymatic activity. When agarose or neoagaro-oligosaccharides were used as substrates, the end products of enzymatic catalysis were NA4 and NA6, whereas agaropentaose was produced along with NA4 and NA6 when agaro-oligosaccharides were used as substrates. Treatment of 9%[w/v] melted agarose with the enzyme (1.6 µg/mL) under continuous magnetic stirring at 50 °C for 14 h resulted in efficient agarose liquefaction into NA4 and NA6. Purification of NA4 and NA6 from the enzymatic hydrolysate (9%[w/v] agarose, 20 mL) via Sephadex G-15 column chromatography yielded ~ 650 mg NA4/~ 900 mg NA6 (i.e., ~ 85.3% of the theoretical maximum yield). These findings suggest that the recombinant thermostable GH16B β-agarase is useful for agarose liquefaction to produce NA4 and NA6.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A novel red-pigmented bacterium was isolated from a water sample collected at Osun River, Ede. Morphological and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that the bacterium is a strain of Brevundimonas olei , while its red pigment was identified using UV-visible, FTIR and GCMS as a derivative of propylprodigiosin. The maximum absorbance of 534 nm, the FTIR’s 1344 cm − 1 peak of prodigiosin’s methoxyl C-O interaction, and the molecular ions from GCMS confirmed the pigment’s identity. The pigments production was temperature-sensitive (25 °C), lost at &gt; 28 °C, and in the presence of urea and humus. In addition, the pigment turned pink in the presence of hydrocarbons, while its red colour was retained with KCN and Fe 2 SO 4, and enhanced by methylparaben. Furthermore, the pigment is stable in high temperature, salt, and acidic conditions, but changed to yellow in alkaline solution. The pigment, identified as propylprodigiosin (m/z 297), demonstrated broad-spectrum antibacterial activities against clinically important strains of Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC25923), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC9077), Bacillus cereus (ATCC10876), Salmonella typhi (ATCC13311), and Escherichia coli (DSM10974). The ethanol extract has the highest zones of inhibition of 29 ± 3.0, 26 ± 1.2, 22 ± 3.0, 22 ± 1.5, and 20 ± 2.0 mm, respectively. Furthermore, the acetone pigments interacted with cellulose and glucose such that increasing glucose concentrations showed linearity at 425 nm. Finally, the fastness of the pigments to fabrics was excellent, with percentage fadedness of 0 and − 43% light and washing tests, respectively, in the presence of Fe 2 SO 4 as the mordant. The antibacterial nature of prodigiosin solutions and their good textile fastness to fabrics could be essential in manufacturing antiseptic materials such as bandages, hospital clothing and agricultural applications such as tubers preservation.

    "abstract": "Abstract A large number of nicotine-containing wastes produced during the tobacco manufacturing process are seriously harmful to the environment and human health. The degradation and transformation of nicotine-containing environmental contaminants to harmless substances has become an urgent requirement. Lasioderma serricorne can grow and reproduce in nicotine-rich sources, and their intestinal microbiota show promising potential to degrade and utilize nicotine. The purpose of this study is to screen and identify nicotine-degrading bacteria from the intestines of L. serricorne and explore their degradation characteristics. A dominant strain, YC7, with significant nicotine degradation capabilities was isolated from the intestines of L. serricorne. The strain was identified as Bacillus using a polyphasic approach. The test results showed it can produce multiple enzymes that include β-glucosidase, cellulase, proteases, and amylases. The nicotine-degrading bacteria were functionally annotated using databases. Nicotine dehydrogenase (NDH) was found by combining an activity tracking test and protein mass spectrometry analysis. The YC-7 NDH in the pathway was molecularly docked and functionally verified via the gene knockdown method. The binding ability of nicotine to nicotine-degrading enzymes was investigated using molecular docking. A high-efficiency nicotine-degrading bacteria, YC-7, was isolated and screened from tobacco, and the gene functions related to degradation were verified. This investigation provides a new hypothesis for screening nicotine-degrading bacteria and increases our knowledge of potential nicotine-degrading microbial sources.",

Finding bacteria that produce metabolites with antifungal properties may turn out to be invaluable in the fight against this devastating disease. The entomopathogenic bacteria, Xenorhabdus szentirmaii and X. budapestensis produce secondary metabolites that are effective against a wide range of fungal plant pathogens. To assess whether they may also be effective against Bd, we extracted cell-free culture media (CFCM) from liquid cultures of X. szentirmaii and X. budapestensis and tested their ability to inhibit Bd growth in vitro. As a second step, using juvenile common toads (Bufo bufo) experimentally infected with Bd we also tested the in vivo antifungal efficacy of X. szentirmaii CFCM diluted to 2 and 10% (v/v), while also assessing possible malign side effects on amphibians. Results of the in vitro experiment documented highly effective growth inhibition by CFCMs of both Xenorhabdus species. The in vivo experiment showed that treatment with CFCM of X. szentirmaii applied at a dilution of 10% resulted in infection intensities reduced by ca. 73% compared to controls and to juvenile toads treated with CFCM applied at a dilution of 2%. At the same time, we detected no negative side effects of treatment with CFCM on toad survival and development. Our results clearly support the idea that metabolites of X. szentirmaii, and perhaps of several other Xenorhabdus species as well, may prove highly useful for the treatment of Bd infected amphibians.",

    "abstract": "Previous work demonstrated inactivation of influenza virus by GHz frequency electromagnetic fields. Despite theoretical and experimental results, the underlying mechanism driving this inactivation remains unknown. One hypothesis is that the electromagnetic field is causing damage to the virion membrane (and therefore changing spike protein orientation) rendering the virus unable to attach and infect host cells. Towards examining this hypothesis, our group employed nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEFs) as a surrogate to radiofrequency (RF) exposure to enable exploration of dose response thresholds of electric field-induced viral membrane damage. In summary, Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) was exposed, in suspension, to mono and bipolar 600-ns pulsed electric fields (nsPEFs) at two amplitudes (12.5 and 25 kV/cm) and pulse numbers [0 (sham), 1, 5, 10, 100, and 1000] at a 1 Hz (Hz) repetition rate. The temperature rise immediately after exposure(s) was measured using thermocouples to differentiate effects of the electric field (E-field) and heating (i.e., the thermal gradient). Inactivation of BCoV was evaluated by infecting HRT-18G host cells and assessing differences in virus infectivity days after exposure. Our results show that 600 nsPEFs, both bipolar and monopolar, can reduce the infectivity of coronaviruses at various amplitudes, pulse numbers, and pulse polarity. Interestingly, we observed that bipolar exposures appeared to be more efficient at lower exposure intensities than monopolar pulses. Future work should focus on experiments to identify the mechanism underlying nsPEF-induced viral inactivation.",

(Zygophyllaceae) is a plant endemic to Argentina and Chile, and its extract has been studied over the last years due to the presence of antimicrobial agents that can be used to control the growth of some pathogens in agriculture. However, the extract is highly hydrophobic, which strongly affects its fungicidal activity in aqueous media. In this sense, the solid dispersion technique was used to produce L. nitida extract nanodispersions with polyethylene glycol (PLE) and with polyethylene glycol and zinc acetate (PZLE). In order to further evaluate the activity of the extract in PLE and PZLE, blank nanodispersions containing only polyethylene glycol (PEG) and zinc acetate (PZ) without the addition of the extract were also produced. The fungicidal activity of the water-soluble nanoparticles was evaluated at different concentrations (0.037-0.110 g.mL-1). In general, the nanoparticles were successfully produced on a nanometric size and presented a significant inhibitory activity on the growth of the pathogens Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium verticillioides in aqueous media. Compared to PLE, PZLE presented increased fungistatic activity, possibly due to their increased solubility in water. Even though their application in agriculture should be further investigated, the nanodispersions present great potential to be applied as a green biotechnological tool.",

Currently, polymyxins are mainly used for the treatment of Gram-negative bacterial-related infection, while exhibiting limited antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). However, the combination of antibiotics with antibiotic adjuvants is a feasible strategy for the hard-treated infection and toxicity reducing. We will investigate the antibacterial activity of simeprevir (SIM), which treated for genotype 1 and 4 chronic hepatitis C, combined with polymyxins against MRSA through high-throughput screening technology. In our study, the synergistic antibacterial effect of SIM and polymyxins against S. aureus in vitro was found by checkerboard assay and time-growth curve. The cytotoxicity of SIM combined with polymyxin B sulfate [PB(S)] or polymyxin E (PE) in vitro was evaluated using CCK-8, human RBC hemolysis and scratch assays. In addition, we investigated the eradication of biofilm formation of S. aureus by biofilm inhibition assay and the killing of persister cells. Moreover, we evaluated the therapeutic effect and in vivo toxicity of the combination against MRSA in murine subcutaneous abscess model. Furthermore, it was preliminarily found that SIM significantly enhanced the destruction of MRSA membrane by SYTOX Green and DISC3(5) probes. In summary, these results reveal that the therapy of SIM combined with polymyxins (especially PE) is promising for the treatment of MRSA infection.",

    "abstract": "Cryptosporidiosis is an intestinal infection that is triggered by the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium spp. Cryptosporidium oocysts can spread from one host to another either through direct contact with infected hosts' faeces or through indirect means (consumption of contaminated water or food). Significant numbers of oocysts are produced as a result of the rapid growth of the parasite within the infected hosts. For proper care of cryptosporidiosis, a laboratory diagnosis is necessary. Therefore, this study aimed to produce anti-Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum) oocyst immunoglobulin (Ig)G polyclonal antibodies (pAbs). The produced pAbs were used in the detection of C. parvum oocysts antigens in stool and serum samples of infected calves. Moreover, pAbs were tested in protection of balb-c male mice from cryptosporidiosis infection. C. parvum oocysts were used in the preparation of antigens to be used in the immunization of New Zealand white rabbits. pAb was purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation method, caprylic acid purification method and diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) anion exchange chromatographic method. Sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (using prepared pAb) scored higher sensitivity (85% and 95% for serum and stool samples) than that (80%) of microscopic examination of stool samples. Moreover, pAb significantly reduced the oocysts shedding, decreased inflammatory cytokines and enhanced the loss in the body weight of protected animals. The prepared pAb succeeded in the diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis in calves with high sensitivity either in the serum or stool samples. Our results indicated the usefulness of using the prepared pAb in protection against cryptosporidiosis.",

    "abstract": "Different agricultural crop wastes (ACW) such as mesocarps (peel) are annually produced after consuming their edible parts in the world without any scientific information about their nutritional potential. Therefore, a study was conducted to determine the ruminal-microbial fermentation pattern and nutritional potential of some crop mesocarps (peel) including different species of melons (Watermelon, Galia melon, Rockmelon, Til sabz, and Til atashi) as well as cucumber and eggplant using common and standard laboratory methods. The amount of crude protein (CP) varied from 7.19 to 19.1% of dry matter (DM) for Til sabz and cucumber mesocarps, respectively. The highest (34.1% of DM) and lowest (15.4%) content of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) were related to eggplant and Til sabz peels, respectively (p < 0.05). The content of non-fiber carbohydrates (NFC) varied from 38.7% for eggplant peel to 66.6% for Til sabz. All mesocarps had a low DM percentage (4.88% of DM for cucumber to 8.45 for eggplant). Rockmelon peel had the highest amount of calcium (5.25 g/kg DM) and magnesium (5.75 g/kg DM) compared with the other mesocarps (p < 0.05). The highest amounts of potassium (33.4 g/kg of DM), sodium (7.15 g/kg of DM), and zinc (21 mg/kg of DM) were observed in the peels of watermelon, Til atashi, and cucumber, respectively (p < 0.05). The potential of ruminal-microbial gas production also differed from 55.6 ml/200 mg of DM for eggplant to 63.1 ml for Til sabz peel. Except for cucumber (8.75 MJ/kg of DM) and eggplant (8.71 MJ), other mesocarps (different melon species) had almost similar metabolizable energy (ME, 9.06-9.50 MJ/kg of DM). Among the studied mesocarps, the lowest ruminal-microbial DM and organic matter (OM) digestibility was also observed in eggplant and cucumber (p < 0.05). Gallia melon had the highest acid-base buffering capacity (267 mEq×10- 3, p < 0.05). According to our findings, the mesocarps of melons showed a higher nutritional value than the cucumber and eggplant. In general, Til sabz exhibited a notable favorite and superior nutritional characteristic compared with the other mesocarps.",

    "abstract": "Organohalide-respiring Desulfitobacterium strains are believed to play an important role in the bioremediation and natural attenuation of chlorinated aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. However, several studies have reported that chloroform significantly inhibits microbial reductive dechlorination of chloroethene. In this study, we examined the effect of chloroform on several Desulfitobacterium strains, including ortho-chlorophenol-dechlorinating Desulfitobacterium dehalogenans JW/IU-1 and Desulfitobacterium hafniense DCB-2, and also the chloroethene-dechlorinating strain D. hafniense TCE1. In medium containing 3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenylacetate as an electron acceptor, chloroform inhibited the growth of strains JW/IU-1 and DCB-2. Although chloroform did not directly inhibit dechlorination of 3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenylacetate by resting cells, cells cultivated with chloroform showed decreased dechlorination activity. Moreover, transcription of the gene encoding the reductive dehalogenase CprA decreased significantly in cells cultivated with chloroform. These results indicate that chloroform inhibits the growth and dechlorination activity of strains JW/IU-1 and DCB-2 via inhibition of cprA transcription. In contrast, cultivation of strain TCE1 in the presence of chloroform gave rise to a PceA reductive dehalogenase gene-deletion variant of strain TCE1; a similar phenomenon was observed in our previous study of chloroethene-dechlorinating D. hafniense strain Y51. Our results suggest that chloroform extensively inhibits the dechlorination activity of Desulfitobacterium strains, and that the inhibitory mechanism appears to differ between ortho-chlorophenol dechlorinators and chloroethene dechlorinators.",

Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that transcription of most LiP and MnP isozyme genes was statistically significantly upregulated in the presence of the cAMP and IBMX compared to the untreated condition. However, 100 μM calmodulin (CaM) inhibitor N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide (W-7), which had insignificant effects on fungal growth and intracellular cAMP concentration, not only offset the increased activity and transcription induced by the drugs, but also decreased them to below basal levels. Like the isozyme genes, transcription of the CaM gene (cam) was also upregulated by cAMP and IBMX. These results suggest that cAMP signaling functions to increase the transcription of LiP and MnP through the induction of cam transcription.",

Individual full-length CYP cDNAs were cloned and sequenced, and the relative nucleotide sequence similarity of pb -1 (1788 bp), pb -2 (1881 bp) and pb -3 (1791 bp) was more than 58%. Alignment of the deduced amino acid (aa) sequences of pb -1- pb -3 showed that these three CYPs belong to the same family with &gt; 40% aa sequence similarity, and pb -1 and pb -3 are in the same subfamily, with &gt; 55% aa sequence similarity. Furthermore, pb -1- pb -3 appeared to be a subfamily of CYP63A (CYP63A1-CYP63A4), found in Phanerochaete chrysosporium . The phylogenetic tree constructed by 500 bootstrap replications using the neighbor-joining method showed that the evolutionary distance between pb -1 and pb -3 was shorter than that between pb -2 and pb -1 (or pb -3). Exon-intron analysis of pb -1 and pb -3 showed that both genes have nearly the same number, size and order of exons and the types of introns, also indicating both genes appear to be evolutionarily close. It is interesting that the transcription level of pb -3 was evidently increased above the pb -1 transcription level by exposure to 12 coplanar PCB congeners and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo- p -dioxin, though the two genes were evolutionarily close.",

Complete genome analysis using single molecule real-time technology revealed that the genome consists of a 5,120,146 bp circular chromosome and a 252,328 bp megaplasmid. A series of genetic determinants associated with the carbon utilization signature of the strain were subsequently identified in the chromosome. Of note, the coexistence of genes encoding several iron–sulfur cluster independent isoenzymes in the genome indicated the importance of these enzymes in the events of iron deficiency. Synteny and comparative analysis have also unraveled the unique features of d-lactate dehydrogenase of strain S5.2 in the study. Collective information of this work has provided insights on the metabolic role of this strain in vineyard soil rhizosphere.",

    "abstract": "Candida dubliniensis shares a wide range of phenotypic characteristics with Candida albicans including a common trait called germ tube positivity. Hence, laboratory differentiation of these two species is cumbersome. Duplex PCR analyses for C. albicans and C. dubliniensis was performed directly on DNA extracted from a total of 122 germ tube positive isolates derived from 100 concentrated oral rinse samples from a random cohort of diabetics attending a clinic in Sri Lanka. These results were confirmed by DNA sequencing of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA of the yeasts. Performance efficacy of duplex PCR was then compared with phenotypic identification using a standard battery of phenotypic tests. Of the 122 germ tube positive isolates three were identified by duplex PCR as C. dubliniensis and the remainder as C. albicans. On the contrary, when the standard phenotypic tests, sugar assimilation and chlamydospore formation, were used to differentiate the two species 13 germ tube positive isolates were erroneously identified as C. dubliniensis. Duplex PCR was found to be rapid, sensitive and more specific than phenotypic identification methods in discriminating C. dubliniensis from C. albicans. This is also the first report on the oral carriage of C. dubliniensis in a Sri Lankan population.",

In the present study, we identified the cDNA of a phormicin gene (BdPho) in the oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), a ruinous agricultural pest causing great economic losses to fruits and vegetables. The cDNA of BdPho contains a 282 bp open reading frame encoding 93 amino acid residues, and the predicted molecular weight and isoelectric point of BdPho peptide were 9.83 kDa and 7.54, respectively. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses showed that the transcription level of BdPho was the highest in adult during different developmental stages and was the highest in abdomen among adult tagmata. Moreover, BdPho was highly expressed in fat body among different tissues, both in female and male adult. The mRNA level of BdPho was significantly up-regulated to 7.46- and 14.53-fold at 3 and 6 h after the insects were challenged with peptidoglycans from Escherichia coli (PGN-EB), respectively, suggesting its antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative microorganisms. Furthermore, the expression level of BdPho was significantly up-regulated to 3.83-fold after mating, suggesting that female adults might enhance their immunity by up-regulating the expression level of BdPho during mating. These results firstly describe the basic properties of the phormicin gene from B. dorsalis, and lay the foundation for investigating functional properties of AMPs and exploring the molecular mechanisms in the immune system.",

Skatole, produced from microbial degradation of l-tryptophan, is the main contributor to boar taint, an off-odor and off-flavor taint, released upon heating meat from some entire male pigs. An appropriate method for quantifying O. scatoligenes would help investigating the relationship between O. scatoligenes abundance and skatole concentration in the pig gut. Thus, the present study aimed at developing a TaqMan-MGB probe-based, species-specific qPCR assay for rapid quantification of O. scatoligenes. The use of a MGB probe allowed discriminating O. scatoligenes from other closely related species. Moreover, the assay allowed quantifying down to three target gene copies per PCR reaction using genomic DNA-constructed standards, or 1.5 × 103 cells/g digesta, using O. scatoligenes-spiked digesta samples as reference standards. The developed assay was applied to assess the impact of dietary chicory roots on O. scatoligenes in the hindgut of pigs. Olsenella scatoligenes made up &lt; 0.01% of the microbial population in the pig hindgut. Interestingly, the highest number of O. scatoligenes was found in young entire male pigs fed high levels of chicory roots. This indicates that the known effect of chicory roots for reducing skatole production is not by inhibiting the growth of this skatole-producing bacterium in the pig hindgut. Accordingly, the abundance of O. scatoligenes in the hindgut does not seem to be an appropriate indicator of boar taint. The present study is the first to describe a TaqMan-MGB probe qPCR assay for detection and quantification of O. scatoligenes in pigs.",

Our recent studies highlighted that apart from ubiquitous roles of Hsf1 at higher temperatures, it also has myriad non-heat shock responsive roles essential under iron deprivation and drug defense. Here, we further explored its implications in the normal cellular functioning, by profiling its genome-wide occupancy using chromatin immuno-precipitation coupled to high-density tiling arrays under basal and iron deprived conditions. Hsf1 recruitment profiles revealed that it binds to promoters of 660 genes of varied functions, under both the conditions, however, elicited variability in intensity of binding. For instance, Hsf1 binding was observed on several genes of oxidative and osmotic stress response, cell wall integrity, iron homeostasis, mitochondrial, hyphal and multidrug transporters. Additionally, the present study divulged a novel motif under basal conditions comprising, -GTGn3GTGn3GTG- where, Hsf1 displays strong occupancy at significant number of sites on several promoters distinct from the heat induced motif. Hence, by binding to and regulating major chaperones, stress responsive genes and drug resistance regulators, Hsf1 is imperative in regulating various cellular machineries. The current study provides a framework for understanding novel aspects of how Hsf1 coordinates diverse cellular functions.",

The present study aimed to use in silico analysis as a tool to identify epitopes from Lys-gingipain (Kgp) and neuraminidase virulence factors of the Pg ATCC 33277 strain. Protein sequences were obtained from the NCBI Protein Database and they were scanned for amino acid patterns indicative of MHC II binding using the MHC-II Binding Predictions tool from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). Peptides from different regions of the proteins were chemically synthesized and tested by the indirect ELISA method to verify IgG immunoreactivity in serum of subjects with CP and without periodontitis (WP). T cell epitope prediction resulted in 16 peptide sequences from Kgp and 18 peptide sequences from neuraminidase. All tested Kgp peptides exhibited IgG immunoreactivity whereas tested neuraminidase peptides presented low IgG immunoreactivity. Thus, the IgG reactivity to Kgp protein could be reaffirmed and the low IgG reactivity to Pg neuraminidase could be suggested. The novel peptide epitopes from Pg were useful to evaluate its immunoreactivity based on the IgG-mediated host response. In silico analysis was useful for preselecting epitopes for immune response studies in CP.",

Based on a nearly 20% increase of total fatty acid in IM13005, which was majorly contributed by saturated or monounsaturated FAs in form of neutral lipids, within 5 h under the heat shock, the fatty acids and lipids synthesis variation were postulated as the physiological reason for the high temperature tolerance.",

Flagellin (FliC) is the main subunit protein forming the bacterial filament, which is present in large amounts on the surface of all flagellated Salmonella. After bioinformatics analysis, the most highly conserved region (locates position from 1 to 102 amino acid residue of FliC, we named it as FliC′) was selected, and corresponding recombinant FliC′ (rFliC′) protein was tailored as an immunogen to generate monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against Salmonella flagellin. BALB/c mice were immunized with the purified recombinant protein rFliC′, which were prepared by prokaryotic expression system pET22b (+) expressing FliC′. After fusion of spleen cells from the immunized mice and SP2/0 cells, three hybridoma cells (1D6, 2G6 and 3E2) producing MAbs against targeted flagellate Salmonella FliC′ were generated and screened. The ability of MAb 3E2 to recognize and bind to Salmonella flagella was demonstrated by immunogold electron microscopy (IEM) method. Western blot (WB) analysis demonstrated that MAb 3E2 could specifically recognize flagellated Salmonella strains. Moreover, MAb 3E2 has a direct agglutination activity against Salmonella strains with visible agglutination reaction. To further verify this agglutination activity, a total of 52 flagellated Salmonella strains (23 serovars), 8 non-flagellate Salmonella strains (2 serovars) and 16 other non-Salmonella bacteria strains were used to evaluate the specificity of the MAb by direct Slide Agglutination Test (SAT). Results showed that MAb 3E2 reacted with all Salmonella strains possessing flagellum and had no cross-reaction with non-flagellate Salmonella strains or other non-Salmonella bacteria strains. Sequentially, the ability to detect the presence of Salmonella in raw samples of the MAb 3E2-based SAT method was evaluated. The conventional culture-based detection method was performed as the standard reference method for detection of Salmonella. Altogether, 369 samples collected from laying hens were tested, and the results indicated that the MAb 3E2-based SAT method could specifically detect Salmonella. Furthermore, the SAT results were obtained more quickly, as compared with the standard method. As a whole, the MAbs against the tailored conserved region of Salmonella flagellin were prepared in this study, and MAb 3E2-based SAT is a promising candidate for the flagellated Salmonella spp. rapid detection.",

    "abstract": "Present investigation determines the protective effect of Cinnamtannin A2 against chronic renal failure (CRF). 5/6 nephrectomized rat model was used to induced CRF by removing the kidneys and rats were treated with Cinnamtannin A2 10 mg/kg, i.p. for the period 30 days. Nephroprotective effect Cinnamtannin A2 was assessed by estimating the biochemical parameters of renal function test and cytokines in the serum of nephractomized rats. Oxidative stress parameters were estimated in the kidney tissue and western blot assay and qRT-PCR assay was performed to determine the expression of protein in renal tissue of nephractomized rats. Moreover histopathology study was done to observe the tubular injury. Data of the report reveals that treatment with Cinnamtannin A2 ameliorates the altered level of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), Kidney Injury Molecule-1 (KIM-1) and cytokines in the serum and microalbuminurea in the urine of 5/6 nephrectomized rat. Oxidative stress level was reduced in Cinnamtannin A2 treated group than CRF group. Moreover treatment with Cinnamtannin A2 attenuates the altered expression of proteins involved in Nrf2-Keap1 pathway in the kidney tissue of 5/6 nephrectomized rat. Result of histopathology reveals that tubular injury score was reduced in the kidney tissue of Cinnamtannin A2 treated group than CRF group. In conclusion, data of the report suggest that treatment with Cinnamtannin A2 ameliorates the level of KIM1 and NAGL in 5/6 nephractomized rats by regulating Nrf2- Keap1 pathway.",

Although the robustness of the cell wall of C. reinhardtii makes it difficult to extract its intracellular products, such property is beneficial when using the cell as an ingredient to fabricate \"cell-plastic\" in this study. The cell layer, which is a component of the cell-plastic, was prepared with an intercellular filler to connect each cell because C. reinhardtii is a single-cell strain. The cell layers were then repeatedly piled to increase the strength of the cell-plastic. To avoid slippage between the cell layers, they were covered with a small amount of a two-dimensional polymer to maintain the flat surface structure of the cell-plastic. Based on the evaluation, the cell-plastic has the potential to be a novel, sustainable plastic using ubiquitous green algal cells in nature.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae ( A. pleuropneumoniae/APP ) is the pathogen that causes porcine contagious pleuropneumonia. Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is divided into 18 serovars, and the cross protection efficacy of epitopes is debatable, which has resulted in the slow development of a vaccine. Consequently, epitope-based vaccines conferring Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae cross protection have rarely been reported. In this study, B cell epitopes in the head domain of trimeric autotransporter adhesin were predicted, and 6 epitopes were selected. Then, the predicted epitopes (Ba1, Bb5, C1, PH1 and PH2) were connected by linkers to construct a recombinant tandem antigen ( rta ) gene. The RTA protein encoded by the recombinant rta gene was expressed, and finally the ICR mice were immunized with the RTA protein with or without inactivated Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (serovars 1 and 5b) and challenged with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae to evaluate the protective effect of the epitope-based vaccine and combined vaccine. The mice in the RTA-immunized group and RTA plus inactivated Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae vaccine group had a significant improvement in clinical symptoms and a higher level of antibody in the serum than those in the control group. The RTA immune group had a 40% survival rate after Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae infection, whereas the combination of RTA and inactivated Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae produced very strong cross immune protection in mice, at least 50% (RTA IB1 + C5) and at most 100% (RTA IB5 + C1), whereas no cross immunoprotection was found in the solo Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae immune group. Overall, the combination of the RTA protein and inactivated bacteria significantly enhanced the cross protection effects. This implies that RTA protein in combination with a suitable inactivated Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae strain could be a candidate vaccine for porcine contagious pleuropneumonia.",

Recently a novel HRM-based method for Klebsiella pneumoniae typing has been proposed: it consists of an HRM protocol designed on the capsular wzi gene and an HRM-based algorithm of strains clustering. In this study, we evaluated the repeatability and reproducibility of this method by performing the HRM typing of a set of K. pneumoniae strains, on three different instruments and by two different operators. The results showed that operators do not affect melting temperatures while different instruments can. Despite this, we found that strain clustering analysis, performed using MeltingPlot separately on the data from the three instruments, remains almost perfectly consistent. The HRM method under study resulted highly repeatable and thus reliable for large studies, even when several operators are involved. Furthermore, the HRM clusters obtained from the three different instruments were highly conserved, suggesting that this method could be applied in multicenter studies, even if different instruments are used.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Waste plastic and methane emissions are two anthropogenic by-products exacerbating environmental pollution. Methane-oxidizing bacteria (methanotrophs) hold the key to solving these problems simultaneously by utilising otherwise wasted methane gas as carbon source and accumulating the carbon as poly-3-hydroxybutyrate, a biodegradable plastic polymer. Here we present the isolation and characterisation of two novel Methylocystis strains with the ability to produce up to 55.7 ± 1.9% poly-3-hydroxybutyrate of cell dry weight when grown on methane from different waste sources such as landfill and anaerobic digester gas. Methylocystis rosea BRCS1 isolated from a recreational lake and Methylocystis parvus BRCS2 isolated from a bog were whole genome sequenced using PacBio and Illumina genome sequencing technologies. In addition to potassium nitrate, these strains were also shown to grow on ammonium chloride, glutamine and ornithine as nitrogen source. Growth of Methylocystis parvus BRCS2 on Nitrate Mineral Salt (NMS) media with 0.1% methanol vapor as carbon source was demonstrated. The genetic tractability by conjugation was also determined with conjugation efficiencies up to 2.8 × 10 –2 and 1.8 × 10 –2 for Methylocystis rosea BRCS1 and Methylocystis parvus BRCS2 respectively using a plasmid with ColE1 origin of replication. Finally, we show that Methylocystis species can produce considerable amounts of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate on waste methane sources without impaired growth, a proof of concept which opens doors to their use in integrated bio-facilities like landfills and anaerobic digesters.",

Strain Tn246 contained a mini-Tn5 Km insertion in a prodigiosin biosynthetic gene and was deficient in production of prodigiosin. All other compounds detected in N4-5 extract were detected in the Tn246 extract. This is the first report demonstrating that prodigiosin can control a plant disease.

In this work, we presented three independent experiments in order to evaluate the influence of some of those input factors on a lipase production separately by using the Aspergillus niger MYA 135 and the two-stage fermentation technique. Regarding the culture modality, the biomass was pre-grown in a first reactor. Then, the washed mycelium was transferred to a second reactor to continue the study. Firstly, linear effects of fungal morphology and several physiological parameters on a lipase production were explored using the Plackett–Burman design. The dispersed fungal morphology was confirmed as a proper quality characteristic for producing an extracellular lipase activity. Concerning the impact of the carbon source on the biomass pre-growth, the sucrose (E = 9.923, p &lt; 0.001) and the l -arabinose (E = 4.198, p = 0.009) presented positive and significant effects on the enzyme production. On the contrary, the supplementation of 0.05 g/L CaCl 2 displayed a highly negative and significant effect on this process (E = − 7.390, p &lt; 0.001). Secondly, the relationship between the enzyme production and the input variables N:C ratio, FeCl 3 and olive oil was explored applying the central composite design. Among the model terms, the N:C ratio of the production medium had the most negative and significant influence on the enzyme synthesis. Thus, it was concluded that a low N:C ratio was preferable to increase its production. In addition, the bifunctional role of FeCl 3 on this fungus was presented. Thirdly, a prove of concept assay was also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cyanophycin (multi- l -arginyl-poly- l -aspartic acid; also known as cyanophycin grana peptide [CGP]) is a biopolymer that could be used in various fields, for example, as a potential precursor for the synthesis of polyaspartic acid or for the production of CGP-derived dipeptides. To extend the applications of this polymer, it is therefore of interest to synthesize CGP with different compositions. A recent re-evaluation of the CGP synthesis in C. glutamicum has shown that C. glutamicum is a potentially interesting microorganism for CGP synthesis with a high content of alternative amino acids. This study shows that the amount of alternative amino acids can be increased by using mutants of C. glutamicum with altered amino acid biosynthesis. With the DM1729 mutant, the lysine content in the polymer could be increased up to 33.5 mol%. Furthermore, an ornithine content of up to 12.6 mol% was achieved with ORN2(P gdh 4 ). How much water-soluble or insoluble CGP is synthesized is strongly related to the used cyanophycin synthetase. CphA Dh synthesizes soluble CGP exclusively. However, soluble CGP could also be isolated from cells expressing CphA 6308 Δ1 or CphA 6308 Δ1_C595S in addition to insoluble CGP in all examined strains. The point mutation in CphA 6308 Δ1_C595S partially resulted in a higher lysine content. In addition, the CGP content could be increased to 36% of the cell dry weight under optimizing growth conditions in C. glutamicum ATCC13032. All known alternative major amino acids for CGP synthesis (lysine, ornithine, citrulline, and glutamic acid) could be incorporated into CGP in C. glutamicum .",

These core enzyme genes shared approximately 70% identity with that of the putative MCO from Micromonospora sp. MP36. According to the principle of S-GAM, the N- and C-terminal regions of the deduced products of the mature gene come from the known parent gene, which should be homologous and compatible with the target gene. We constructed two different MCO hybrid genes using Bacillus subtilis BOX and Micromonospora sp. MP36 MCO, to give Bs-mg-mco and Mic-mg-mco , respectively. The constructed chimeric MCO genes were fused with the maltose-binding protein (MBP) gene at the N-terminus for expression in Escherichia coli cells. We found that MBP-Mic-mg-MCO/Mic-mg-MCO possessed the characteristic properties of laccase, although MBP-Bs-mg-MCO had no activity. This novel laccase (Mic-mg-MCO) demonstrated unique substrate specificity, sufficient activity at neutral pH, and high thermal stability, which are suitable properties for its use as a laccase biocatalyst.",

Although most plants roots have the potential to express natural biosynthesis pathways required to produce specialized metabolites such as anthocyanins, the anthocyanin synthesis is specifically silenced in roots. To explore the molecular mechanism of absence and production ability of anthocyanin in the roots, investigated the effect of a bHLH gene AmDelila , and an R2R3-MYB gene AmRosea1 , which are the master regulators of anthocyanin biosynthesis in Antirrhinum majus flowers, by expressing these genes in transformed hairy roots of A. majus . Co-ectopic expression of both AmDelila and AmRosea1 significantly upregulated the expression of the key target structural genes in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway. Furthermore, this resulted in strongly enhanced anthocyanin accumulation in transformed hairy roots. Ectopic expression of AmDelila alone did not gives rise to any significant anthocyanin accumulation, however, ectopic expression of AmRosea1 alone clearly upregulated expression of the main structural genes as well as greatly promoted anthocyanin accumulation in transformed hairy roots, where the contents reached 0.773–2.064 mg/g fresh weight. These results suggest that AmRosea1 plays a key role in the regulatory network in controlling the initiation of anthocyanin biosynthesis in roots, and the combination of AmRosea1 and hairy root culture is a powerful tool to study and production of anthocyanins in the roots of A. majus .",

    "abstract": "Abstract Members of the Enterobacter genus are gram-negative bacteria, which are used as plant growth-promoting bacteria, and increasingly recovered from economic plants as emerging pathogens. A new Enterobacter mori strain, designated CX01, was isolated as an emerging bacterial pathogen of a recent outbreak of kiwifruit canker-like disease in China. The main symptoms associated with this syndrome are bleeding cankers on the trunk and branch, and brown leaf spots. The genome sequence of E . mori CX01 was determined as a single chromosome of 4,966,908 bp with 4640 predicted open reading frames (ORFs). To better understand the features of the genus and its potential pathogenic mechanisms, five available Enterobacter genomes were compared and a pan-genome of 4870 COGs with 3158 core COGs were revealed. An important feature of the E . mori CX01 genome is that it lacks a type III secretion system often found in pathogenic bacteria, instead it is equipped with type I, II, and VI secretory systems. Besides, the genes encoding putative virulence effectors, two-component systems, nutrient acquisition systems, proteins involved in phytohormone synthesis, which may contribute to the virulence and adaption to the host plant niches are included. The genome sequence of E . mori CX01 has high similarity with that of E. mori LMG 25,706, though the rearrangements occur throughout two genomes. Further pathogenicity assay showed that both strains can either invade kiwifruit or mulberry, indicating they may have similar host range. Comparison with a closely related isolate enabled us to understand its pathogenesis and ecology.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial biofilms formation is one of the major reasons for treatment failure in chronic wound infections. Therefore, diagnostic biomarkers remain the best option for prevention and treatment of chronic wound infections by biofilms. Herein, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 was used to mimic biofilm development in porcine skin explants wells as ex vivo wound model. The microscopic imaging showed that PAO1 in porcine skin explants wells formed micro-colonies at 24 h, developed mushroom-like structure at 48 h, and at 72 h mushroom-like structure disappeared, remaining a thin bacterial lawn. RNA-seq data analysis revealed that the expression levels of genes involved in the type II hxc secretion system were significantly higher in biofilms than in planktonic cells, especially the expression of lapA encoding alkaline phosphatase. However, the expression levels of genes associated with denitrification pathway were markedly decreased in biofilms, especially the transcription of nirS encoding nitrite reductase to produce nitric oxide (NO). Therefore, their expressions and products were further detected using RT-qPCR and biochemical assays, respectively. The results found that the expression of lapA and alkaline phosphatase activity were induced, but the expression of nirS and intracellular NO were reduced at the whole biofilms cycle. The study indicates that LapA and NO would play an important role for P. aeruginosa biofilm formation in chronic wound infections. LapA would serve as potential target to monitor chronic wound infections by P. aeruginosa biofilms. Inducing NO would be used to treat chronic wound infections due to P. aeruginosa biofilms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This work explores the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of Pseudomonas (P.) aeruginosa exotoxin A using the guanyl hydrazone derivative, nitrobenzylidine aminoguanidine (NBAG) and the impact of gamma radiation on its efficacy. Unlike the conventional detection methods, NBAG was used as the acceptor of ADP ribose moiety instead of wheat germ extract elongation factor 2. Exotoxin A was extracted from P. aeruginosa clinical isolates and screened for toxA gene using standard PCR. NBAG was synthesized using aminoguanidine bicarbonate and 4-nitrobenzaldehyde and its identity has been confirmed by UV, FTIR, Mass and 13 C-NMR spectroscopy. The ADP-ribosyl transferase activity of exotoxin A on NBAG in the presence of Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) was recorded using UV spectroscopy and HPLC. In vitro ADP-ribosyl transferase activity of exotoxin A protein extract was also explored by monitoring its cytotoxicity on Hep-2 cells using sulforhodamine B cytotoxicity assay. Bacterial broths were irradiated at 5, 10, 15, 24 Gy and exotoxin A protein extract activity were assessed post exposure. Exotoxin A extract exerted an ADP-ribosyltransferase ability which was depicted by the appearance of a new ʎmax after the addition of exotoxin A to NBAG/NAD + mixture, fragmentation of NAD + and development of new peaks in HPLC chromatograms. Intracellular enzyme activity was confirmed by the prominent cytotoxic effects of exotoxin A extract on cultured cells. In conclusion, the activity of Exotoxin A can be monitored via its ADP-ribosyltransferase activity and low doses of gamma radiation reduced its activity. Therefore, coupling radiotherapy with exotoxin A in cancer therapy should be carefully monitored.",

    "abstract": "Enriched cultures of microorganisms are an essential step in the production of inoculum of these organisms for biotechnology and bioengineering. The potential application of methanotrophic microorganisms for removal of methane produced from landfills and coal mines as well as biodegradation of toxic compounds has been widely studied. Therefore, searching for new sources of methanotrophs can contribute to increasing the possibilities of biotechnology and bioengineering. Enrichment cultures of endophytic methanotrophs from Sphagnum sp. were initiated in NMS medium, a most widely used medium for cultivation of methanotrophic bacteria from various environments proposed in 1970 by Whittenbury. Incubation was carried out at 10, 20, 30, and 37°C with vigorous shaking on a shaker (180 rpm). The source of carbon and energy for endophytes were methane at the concentration range between 1-20%. It appeared that the consortium of endophytic bacteria grew only at the temperature of 20 and 30°C. During the culture of endophytes, the measurements of gas concentration showed a steady loss of methane and oxygen, as well as accumulation of carbon dioxide as a CH4 oxidation product. The use of FISH has made characterization of endophytic consortia possible. It turned out that the population of endophytes consists of type I and II methanotrophs as well as associated non-methanotrophic bacteria. Furthermore, we determined the potential of the examined bacteria for methane oxidation, which ranged up to 4,7 μMCH4 per ml of the population of endophytes per day.",

    "abstract": "Rapid and specific detection of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing (ESBL) bacteria is crucial both for timely antibiotic therapy when treating infected patients as well as for appropriate infection control measures aimed at curbing the spread of ESBL-producing isolates. Whereas a variety of phenotypic methods are currently available for ESBL detection, they remain time consuming and sometimes difficult to interpret while being also affected by a lack of sensitivity and specificity. Considering the longer turnaround time (TAT) of susceptibility testing and culture results, DNA-based ESBL identification would be a valuable surrogate for phenotypic-based methods. Putative ESBL-positive Enterobacteriaceae isolates (n = 330) from clinical specimen were prospectively collected in Bulgaria, Romania and Democratic Republic of Congo and tested in this study. All isolates were assessed for ESBL-production by the E-test method and those giving undetermined ESBL status were re-tested using the combination disk test. A genotypic assay successively combining qPCR detection of blaCTX-M, blaTEM and blaSHV genes with a multiplex pyrosequencing of blaTEM and blaSHV genes was developed in order to detect the most common ESBL-associated TEM and SHV single nucleotides polymorphisms, irrespective of their plasmid and/or chromosomal location. This assay was applied on all Enterobacteriaceae isolates (n = 330). Phenotypic and genotypic results matched in 324/330 (98.2%). Accordingly, real-time PCR combined with multiplex pyrosequencing appears to be a reliable and easy-to-perform assay with high-throughput identification and fast TAT (~5 h).",

    "abstract": "The influence of internal mass transfer on productivity as well as the performance of packed bed bioreactor was determined by varying a number of parameters; chitosan coating, flow rate, glucose concentration and particle size. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells were immobilized in chitosan and non-chitosan coated alginate beads to demonstrate the effect on particle side mass transfer on substrate consumption time, lag phase and ethanol production. The results indicate that chitosan coating, beads size, glucose concentration and flow rate have a significant effect on lag phase duration. The duration of lag phase for different size of beads (0.8, 2 and 4 mm) decreases by increasing flow rate and by decreasing the size of beads. Moreover, longer lag phase were found at higher glucose medium concentration and also with chitosan coated beads. It was observed that by increasing flow rates; lag phase and glucose consumption time decreased. The reason is due to the reduction of external (fluid side) mass transfer as a result of increase in flow rate as glucose is easily transported to the surface of the beads. Varying the size of beads is an additional factor: as it reduces the internal (particle side) mass transfer by reducing the size of beads. The reason behind this is the distance for reactants to reach active site of catalyst (cells) and the thickness of fluid created layer around alginate beads is reduced. The optimum combination of parameters consisting of smaller beads size (0.8 mm), higher flow rate of 90 ml/min and glucose concentration of 10 g/l were found to be the maximum condition for ethanol production.",

In this study, the Plackett-Burman Design and the Central Composite Design, which offer efficient and feasible approaches, were complemented to screen significant parameters and identify the optimal values for maximum AMVL production. The results suggested that sucrose, NaNO3, yeast extract and K2HPO4 were the key factors affecting AMVL production in a complex medium, whereas the major components required for a defined medium were NaNO3, K2HPO4, KH2PO4 and trace elements. These factors were subsequently optimized using the response surface methodology. Under optimal conditions, a maximum AMVL production of 250 mg/L in the complex medium and 200 mg/L in the defined medium was achieved, which represents an increase of approximately 3-4-fold compared to the commonly used malt extract medium.",

However, different insect species are poorly controlled by the available Bt toxins or have evolved resistance to these toxins. Evolution of Bt toxicity could provide novel toxins to control insect pests. To this aim, efficient display systems to select toxins with increased binding to insect membranes or midgut proteins involved in toxicity are likely to be helpful. Here we describe two display systems, phage display and ribosome display, that allow the efficient display of two non-structurally related Bt toxins, Cry1Ac and Cyt1Aa. Improved display of Cry1Ac and Cyt1Aa on M13 phages was achieved by changing the commonly used peptide leader sequence of the coat pIII-fusion protein, that relies on the Sec translocation pathway, for a peptide leader sequence that relies on the signal recognition particle pathway (SRP) and by using a modified M13 helper phage (Phaberge) that has an amber mutation in its pIII genomic sequence and preferentially assembles using the pIII-fusion protein. Also, both Cry1Ac and Cyt1Aa were efficiently displayed on ribosomes, which could allow the construction of large libraries of variants. Furthermore, Cry1Ac or Cyt1Aa displayed on M13 phages or ribosomes were specifically selected from a mixture of both toxins depending on which antigen was immobilized for binding selection. These improved systems may allow the selection of Cry toxin variants with improved insecticidal activities that could counter insect resistances.",

Outbreaks of avian influenza virus (AIV) are a liability to the poultry industry and increase the risk for transmission to humans. There are limitations to using the AIV vaccine in poultry, creating barriers to controlling outbreaks and a need for alternative effective control measures. Application of RNA interference (RNAi) techniques hold potential; however, the delivery of RNAi-mediating agents is a well-known obstacle to harnessing its clinical application. We introduce a novel antiviral approach using bacterial vectors that target avian mucosal epithelial cells and deliver (small interfering RNA) siRNAs against two AIV genes, nucleoprotein (NP) and polymerase acidic protein (PA). Using a red fluorescent reporter, we first demonstrated vector delivery and intracellular expression in avian epithelial cells. Subsequently, we demonstrated significant reductions in AIV shedding when applying these anti-AIV vectors prophylactically. These antiviral vectors provided up to a 10,000-fold reduction in viral titers shed, demonstrating in vitro proof-of-concept for using these novel anti-AIV vectors to inhibit AIV shedding. Our results indicate this siRNA vector technology could represent a scalable and clinically applicable antiviral technology for avian and human influenza and a prototype for RNAi-based vectors against other viruses.",

    "abstract": "Commercial biogas production takes place by complex microbial communities enclosed in controlled “technical ecosystems”. Once established, the communities tend to be resilient towards disturbances, although the relative abundance of their members may vary. The start-up phase, during which the community establishes itself, is therefore decisive for the later performance of the reactor. In this study, we followed the first 240 days of a standard agricultural energy crop digester consisting of a 400 m3 plug flow fermenter and a 1000 m3 agitated post digester, operated at 40–45 °C. The feed consisted of corn and later grass silage augmented by ground wheat. Changes in both the eubacterial and methanogenic archaeal communities were followed by automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA). In addition the copy number of the methyl-coenzyme reductase A (mcrA)-genes found in all known methanogens were followed by quantitative PCR, while selected samples from two phases—one early, one late—of the community structure development were subjected to high throughput sequencing. Biogas volume and composition (CH4, CO2, H2, H2S, O2), pH, ammonia-N, and volatile fatty acids (VFA), were measured as part of the routine process control. VFA/TIC values were calculated on this basis. Whereas the total gas production of the plant established itself at about 2500 m3 biogas per day within the first months, the composition of the microbial communities showed distinct spatial and temporal differences over the investigated time period. Absolute values for DNA isolation procedures are difficult to certify, hence comparative results on community structures obtained using standardized ARISA with identical primers are of value. Moreover, ARISA patterns can be statistically analyzed to identify distinct subgroups and transitions between them as well as serial correlations. Thereby the microbial community and its structural development can be correlated with statistical relevance to changes in operational (feed) and process parameters (pH-value, biogas composition). In particular when augmented by deep sequencing data of judiciously chosen samples, this allows a hitherto unknown level of insight into the performance of technical biogas plants.",

    "abstract": "A solubility diagram was employed to understand growth promotion of Arthrospira (Spirulina) platensis by steelmaking slag (SMS). The growth promotion effect of 112 % of freshwater microalga A. platensis was obtained using 5 g/L SMS. However, metabolites, such as pigments, and protein content of A. platensis were not significantly affected. Several metals dissolved in Spirulina-Ogawa-Terui medium were detected by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry just after the addition of SMS. The solubility diagram provides information on the chemical speciation of metal elements based on pH and concentration. It is a useful tool to understand the effect of metals on microalgal growth. The metal elements used to control microalgal growth are essential minerals but also act as a source of oxidative stress. Regarding the affecting mechanism of SMS, iron may be the primary element regulating microalgal growth via pathway involving reactive oxygen species, as revealed by superoxide dismutase assay.",

So it is necessary to artificially construct engineered strain to improve the degradation efficiency and meet the requirements of pollutant degradation. In this study, four genes ( fpdA2 , fpdB , fpdC , and fpdD ) for 4-FP degradation from Arthrobacter sp. strain IF1 were optimized and synthesized and then reconstructed into Escherichia coli by a multi-monocistronic vector to obtain recombinant BL- fpd that could degrade 4-FP efficiently. Under optimized induction conditions (inducing the strain by 2 g/L L-arabinose and 1 mM IPTG at 37 ℃), BL- fpd could completely degrade 2 mM 4-FP, 4-chlorophenol, 4-bromophenol, and 4-nitrophenol into β-ketoadipate, which could be further metabolized by the bacteria. FpdA2 showed the highest activity towards 4-bromophenol. The strain could completely degrade 1 mM 4-FP in industrial wastewater within 3 h. This study provided a promising strain for the degradation of 4-FP and some other 4-substituted phenols. The construction technologies of multi-monocistronic expression vector may also be used to construct other organic pollutants degrading bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2), a key regulator of osteogenesis, induces the differentiation of mesenchymal cells into cartilage or bone tissues. Early orthopedic and dental studies often used mammalian cell-derived rhBMP-2, especially Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. However, CHO cell-derived rhBMP-2 (C-rhBMP-2) presents disadvantages such as high cost and low production yield. To overcome these problems, Escherichia coli-derived BMP-2 (E-rhBMP-2) was developed; however, the E-rhBMP-2-induced signaling pathways and gene expression profiles during osteogenesis remain unclear. Here, we investigated the E-rhBMP-2-induced osteogenic differentiation pattern in C2C12 cells and elucidated the difference in biological characteristics between E-rhBMP-2 and C-rhBMP-2 via surface plasmon resonance, western blotting, qRT-PCR, RNA-seq, and alkaline phosphatase assays. The binding affinities of E-rhBMP-2 and C-rhBMP-2 towards BMP receptors were similar, both being confirmed at the nanomolecular level. However, the phosphorylation of Smad1/5/9 at 3 h after treatment with E-rhBMP-2 was significantly lower than that on treatment with C-rhBMP-2. The expression profiles of osteogenic marker genes were similar in both the E-rhBMP-2 and C-rhBMP-2 groups, but the gene expression level in the E-rhBMP-2 group was lower than that in the C-rhBMP-2 group at each time point. Taken together, our results suggest that the osteogenic signaling pathways induced by E-rhBMP-2 and C-rhBMP-2 both follow the general Smad-signaling pathway, but the difference in intracellular phosphorylation intensity results in distinguishable transcription profiles on osteogenic marker genes and biological activities of each rhBMP-2. These findings provide an extensive understanding of the biological properties of E-rhBMP-2 and the signaling pathways during osteogenic differentiation.",

Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG is of the most known beneficial species with an ability to protect the intestine as opposed to Staphylococcus epidermidis 444 which causes serious health risks due to its high antimicrobial resistance. This study investigates first the survival and coexistence ability of L. rhamnosus GG, and S. epidermidis 444 at different pH levels. Subsequently, lysozyme's antimicrobial and antibiofilm effect on these two strains was elucidated before adding different concentrations of oxytetracycline hydrochloride antibiotic. Results showed that 50% inhibition of L. rhamnosus GG, S. epidermidis 444, and a co-culture of these planktonic strains were obtained respectively at a lysozyme concentration of 30, 18, and 26 mg/mL after the addition of ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA). At a pH of 7.5, mixing lysozyme (at IC50) and EDTA with oxytetracycline hydrochloride (700 μg/mL) showed an additional bactericidal effect as compared to its known bacteriostatic effect. Similarly, the addition of lysozyme to the antibiotic further increased the biofilm eradication of S. epidermidis 444 and L. rhamnosus GG where a maximal eradication of 70% was reached. Therefore, the potential development of new drugs based on adding a lysozyme-EDTA mixture to different types of antibiotics may be highly promising.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Leishmaniasis is a tropical disease that leads to various clinical phenotypes. This study aimed to investigate protein expression changes in metacyclic and amastigote-like stages of L. tropica isolated from Iranian cutaneous leishmaniasis patients. Isolated samples were cultured and species type identified using PCR–RFLP technique. The promastigotes were grown in RPMI1640 media and differentiated to metacyclic and amastigote-like forms, followed by the extracted proteins of both successive stages carried out for proteomics and bioinformatics analysis. Using SWATH-MS quantitative proteomics technique, a total 176 and 155 distinct proteins were identified in metacyclic and axenic amastigote stages, respectively. Of these, 65 proteins were altered significantly (p-value &lt; 0.05 and fold change ≥ 2) between studied stages. Several gene ontology (GO) categories were enriched for biological process during conversion of metacyclic promastigotes into amastigote-like, which “metabolic process” (GO: 0044281, P-Value: 6.52e-5), and “translation” (GO: 0006412, p-value: 5.01e–14) were disclosed as the top category in up and down-regulated proteins, respectively. Also, the KEGG pathway analysis indicated “metabolic pathways” and “ribosome” term as the most important pathways in up and down-regulated proteins, respectively. According to protein interaction network analysis, enolase (ENOL) has been detected as main hub proteins during differentiation, followed by Putative NADH-dependent fumarate reductase (LmjF.35.1180) and 40S ribosomal protein S2 (LmjF.32.0450). Overall, protein changes possibly play important roles in L. tropica biology. Anabolic pathways were down-regulated, whereas catabolic pathways were up-regulated during L. tropica differentiation. These protein expression changes could provide parasite survival in host macrophages, and could use as novel potential drug and vaccine targets for leishmaniasis. Graphical Abstract",

Hence, there is a continuing demand for new, efficient biotechnological approaches for I-FOS production. In this work, crude inulosucrase InuGB-V3 from Lactobacillus gasseri DSM 20604 was used to synthesize I-FOS from sucrose. Supplementation with 1 mM CaCl2, a pH of 3.5-5.5, and an incubation temperature of 40 °C were found to be optimal production parameters at which crude inulosucrase showed high conversion rates, low sucrose hydrolysis, and excellent stability over 4 days. The optimal process conditions were employed in cell-free bioconversion reactions. By elevating the substrate concentration from 570 to 800 g L-1, the I-FOS concentration and the synthesis of products with a low degree of polymerization (DP) could be increased, while sucrose hydrolysis was decreased. Bioconversion of 800 g L-1 sucrose for 20 h resulted in an I-FOS-rich syrup with an I-FOS concentration of 401 ± 7 g L-1 and an I-FOS purity of 53 ± 1% [w/w]. I-FOS with a DP of 3-11 were synthesized, with 1,1-kestotetraose (DP4) being the predominant transfructosylation product. The high-calorie sugars glucose, sucrose, and fructose were removed from the generated I-FOS-rich syrup using activated charcoal. Thus, 81 ± 5% of the initially applied I-FOS were recovered with a purity of 89 ± 1%.",

Both strains showed hydantoinase and dihydropyrimidinase activity by hydrolyzing all substrates to the corresponding N-carbamoyl-α- or N-carbamoyl-β-amino acids. However, carbamoylase activity and thus a further degradation of these products to α- and β-amino acids was not detected. Additionally, the genes coding for a dihydropyrimidinase and a carbamoylase of Aminobacter sp. DSM24754 were elucidated. For Aminobacter sp. DSM24755 a dihydropyrimidinase gene flanked by two genes coding for putative ABC transporter proteins was detected. The deduced amino acid sequences of both dihydropyrimidinases are highly similar to the well-studied dihydropyrimidinase of Sinorhizobium meliloti CECT4114. The latter enzyme is reported to accept substituted hydantoins and dihydropyrimidines as substrates.

Here we applied a nitrogen gas plasma apparatus to the inactivation of Stx. Samples of Stx1 and Stx2 were treated with a nitrogen gas plasma generated by a plasma device using a short high-voltage pulse applied by a static induction thyristor power supply at 1.5 kpps (kilo pulse per second). The recovered Stx samples were then analyzed for immunological and biological activities. Immunochromatography demonstrated that Stx1 and Stx2 were degraded by the gas plasma. Quantification by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that both toxins were efficiently degraded to less than 1/10th of their original concentration within 5 min of treatment. Western blotting further showed the gas plasma treatment degraded the A subunit, which mediates the toxicity of Stx. Moreover, an assay using HEp-2 cells as an index of cytotoxicity showed that gas plasma treatment reduced the toxic activity of Stx. Therefore, nitrogen gas plasma might be an efficient method for the inactivation of Stx.",

The optimized production of bacterial biomass in aerobic conditions was predicted and the interactive effects between crude glycerol, urea and magnesium sulfate were investigated. As a result, a model for predicting the concentration of bacterial biocatalyst biomass was developed with crude glycerol as a sole carbon source. In addition, it was observed that the interactive effect between crude glycerol and urea was statistically significant. Response surface methodology was also employed to develop the model for predicting the concentration of succinic acid produced. Validity of the model was confirmed during verification experiments wherein actual results differed from predicted values by 0.77%. The applied statistical methods proved the feasibility for anaerobic succinic acid production on crude glycerol without expensive yeast extract addition.

In this work, we compared the inhibitory effect of S. pneumoniae and its relatives on the growth of Moraxella catarrhalis strains using the culture-based antagonistic test. We observed that the inhibitory effect of S. mitis strains is kept when a hydrogen peroxide produced by cells is inactivated by catalase, and even when the live cells are killed in chloroform vapors, in contrast to the pneumococcus whose inhibiting ability disappeared when the cells die. It was suggested that this effect may be due to the production of bacterial antimicrobial peptides by S. mitis, so we examined the genomes of our strains for the presence of bacteriocin-like peptides encoding genes. We observed that a set of bacteriocin-like genes in the genome of S. mitis is greatly poorer in comparison with S. pneumoniae one; moreover, in one S. mitis strain we found no bacteriocin-like genes. It could mean that there are probably some additional opportunities of S. mitis to inhibit the growth of competing neighbors which are still have to be discovered.",

PtXyl43 secretion is a two-step process, and the second step is accompanied by cell periplasmic leakage, indicating that PtXyl43 secretion is the result of semi-specific secretion. Homology modeling of PtXyl43 suggested that PtXyl43 had a canonical GH43 family β-xylosidase structure containing five blades. Seventeen blade deletions or circular mutants were designed to identify the conformational motif(s) involved in secretion. These mutants were expressed as recombinant, codon-optimized proteins in E. coli. Notably, only mutants containing blades 2–4 were effectively secreted. Blades 2–4 are necessary for secretion, but it appears that blade 1 or 5 must be present to maintain the structure of blades 2–4. Simultaneous deletion of blades 1 and 5 dramatically reduces excretion. The covalent and sequential linking of blades of 2, 3 and 4 are important for the excretion of mutants, as separate blades of 2 and 3 or 3 and 4 abolishes excretion. Fusion with PtXyl43 promotes the excretion of GFP from the periplasm to the extracellular milieu, which suggested that PtXyl43 had the potential to carry proteins. This study provides new insights into secretory mechanism of secretable signal peptide-lacking proteins in E. coli. To our knowledge, this is the first to definitively identify the conformational determinants for secretion of a signal peptide-lacking GH43 family β-xylosidase. This finding also has application potential for the secretion of recombinant proteins.",

    "abstract": "The fermentation process is widely used in the industry for bioethanol production. Even though it is widely used, microbial contamination is unpredictable and difficult to control. The problem of reduced productivity is directly linked to competition for nutrients during contamination. Yeasts representing the Candida species are frequently isolated contaminants. Elucidating the behavior of a contaminant during the fermentation cycle is essential for combatting the contamination. Consequently, the aim of the current study was to better understand the functional and transcriptional behavior of a contaminating yeast Candida tropicalis. We used a global RNA sequencing approach (RNA-seq/MiSeq) to analyze gene expression. Genes with significantly repressed or induced expression, and related to the fermentations process, such as sugar transport, pyruvate decarboxylase, amino acid metabolism, membrane, tolerance to high concentrations of ethanol and temperatures, nutrient suppression), and transcription-linked processes, were identified. The expression pattern suggested that the functional and transcriptional behavior of the contaminating yeast during fermentation for bioethanol production is similar to that of the standard yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In addition, the analysis confirmed that C. tropicalis is an important contaminant of the alcoholic fermentation process, generating bioethanol and viability through its tolerance to all the adversities of a fermentation process essential for the production of bioethanol. According on the gene expression profile, many of these mechanisms are similar to those of S. cerevisiae strains currently used for bioethanol production. These mechanisms can inform studies on antimicrobials, to combat yeast contamination during industrial bioethanol production.",

In this work, the capacity of engineered retrovirus like particles devoided of host protein CD81 to display HCV envelope antigens was compared to non-engineered particles. A persistent inability of CD81 negative VLPs to incorporate HCV E2 protein as a result from the inefficient transport of HCV E2 to the plasma membrane, was observed.

The gene encoded a polypeptide composed of 272 amino acids and had a maximum similarity of 52.4% to a known DAHPS at the amino acid level. Multiple sequence alignment, homologous modeling, and molecular docking showed that Aro1A had the typical (β/α)8 barrel-shaped catalytic structural domain of DAHPS. The motifs and amino acid residues involved in the combination of substrates and metal ligand were highly conservative with the known DAHPS. The putative DAHPS gene was subcloned into a pET-30a(+) vector and was overexpressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) cells. The recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity. The maximum activity for the recombinant Aro1A protein occurred at pH 8.0 and 40 °C. Ba2+ and Ca2+ stimulated the activity of Aro1A protein. The enzyme showed high affinity and catalytic efficiency (K PEP = 19.58 μM, V PEP = 29.02 μM min−1, and k cat PEP /K PEP = 0.88 s−1 μM−1) under optimal reaction conditions.

    "abstract": "The inability of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce ethanol from xylose has hampered the biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass. However, prior studies reveal that functional expression of xylose isomerase (XI) from Burkholderia cenocepacia (XylABc) in S. cerevisiae has remarkably improved xylose consumption and ethanol productivity. Yet, little is known about kinetic and structural properties of this enzyme. Hereby, a purified recombinant XylA was assayed in vitro, showing optimal enzyme activity at 37 °C and pH 7.2. The Km of XylA for D-xylose was at least threefold lower than the Km results for any XI published to date (e.g. XylA from Piromyces sp.). In addition, oligomerization behavior as a tetramer was observed for XylA in solution. Functional and structural comparative analyses amongst three microbial XIs were further performed as theoretical models, showing that xylose orientation at the active site was highly conserved among the XIs. Mg2+ ions anchor the sugar and guide its pyranoside oxygen towards a histidine residue present at the active site, allowing an acid-base reaction, linearizing xylose. Electrostatic surface analyses showed that small variations in the net charge distribution and dipole moment could directly affect the way the substrate interacts with the protein, thus altering its kinetic properties. Accordingly, in silico modeling suggested the tetramer may be the major functional form. These analyses and the resulting model promote a better understanding of this protein family and pave the way to further protein engineering and application of XylA in the ethanol industry.",

Strain GB-4(0) of this species was previously isolated from rice husks and produces biodegradable plastic-degrading enzyme (Pseudozyma antarctica esterase; PaE). In this study, we generated a MEL biosynthesis-deficient strain (∆PaEMT1) by deleting the gene PaEMT1, which is essential to MEL biosynthesis in strain GB-4(0). The resulting ∆PaEMT1 strain showed deficient PaE activity, and the corresponding signal was hardly detected in its culture supernatant through western blotting analysis using rabbit anti-PaE serum. On the other hand, the relative expression of the gene PaCLE1, encoding PaE, was identical between GB-4(0) and ∆PaEMT1 based on quantitative real-time PCR. When strain ∆PaEMT1 was grown in culture media supplemented with various surfactants, i.e., Tween20, BRIJ35 and TritonX-100, and MELs, PaE activity and secretion recovered. We also attempted to detect intracellular PaE using cell-free extract, but observed no signal in the soluble or insoluble fractions of ∆PaEMT1. This result suggested that the PaCLE1 gene was not translated to PaE, or that expressed PaE was degraded immediately in ∆PaEMT1. Based on these results, MEL biosynthesis is an important contributor to PaE production.",

In this study the VP1 protein of the FMDV SAT2/ZIM/7/83 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells in Luria broth and EnPresso® B media in shake flasks. Production was further developed and the VP1 protein was produced at 2.15 g L-1 in fed-batch fermentations at 2 L scale. The protein formed insoluble inclusion bodies that were isolated, denatured and refolded. When tested in ELISA, the protein was found to be highly reactive with serum from a SAT2 vaccinated guinea pig, and not reactive to SAT1 and SAT3 antisera. These results open avenues to evaluate recombinantly expressed VP1 proteins for differentiation of the three Southern African Territories serotypes of FMDV that co-occur in Southern and East Africa.

In a library of approx. 1.4 × 10 6 clones created by random mutagenesis we identified the variant Lb ADH K71E . Kinetic analysis of the purified enzyme revealed that Lb ADH K71E had a ~ 16% lowered K M value and a 17% higher V max for 2,5-hexanedione compared to the wild-type Lb ADH. Higher activities were also observed for the alternative substrates acetophenone, acetylpyridine, 2-hexanone, 4-hydroxy-2-butanone, and methyl acetoacetate. K71 is solvent-exposed on the surface of Lb ADH and not located within or close to the active site. Therefore, K71 is not an obvious target for rational protein engineering. The study demonstrates that high-throughput screening using the NADPH biosensor pSenSox represents a powerful method to find unexpected beneficial mutations in NADPH-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases that can be favorable in industrial biotransformations.",

A promising candidate strain for the production of microbial oil is the oleaginous yeast Schwanniomyces occidentalis CBS 2864. To compete with fossil resources, cultivation and processing of S. occidentalis requires improvement. Currently, different cell wall disruption techniques based on mechanical, chemical, physiological, and biological methods are being investigated using a variety of oil producing yeasts and microalgae. Most of these techniques are not suitable for upscaling because they are technically or energetically unfavorable. Therefore, new techniques have to be developed to overcome this challenge. Here, we demonstrate an effective mild enzymatic approach for cell disruption to facilitate lipid extraction from the oleaginous yeast S. occidentalis . Most oil was released by applying 187 mg L −1 tailor-made enzymes from Trichoderma harzianum CBS 146429 against the yeast cell wall of S. occidentalis at pH 5.0 and 40 °C with 4 h of incubation time after applying 1 M NaOH as a pretreatment step.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The damages observed in Tunisian citrus orchards have prompted studies on the Pseudomonas spp . responsible for blast and black pit. Prospective orchards between 2015 and 2017 showed that the diseases rapidly spread geographically and to new cultivars. A screening of Pseudomonas spp. isolated from symptomatic trees revealed their wide diversity according to phylogenetic analysis of their housekeeping rpoD and cts genes. The majority of strains were affiliated to Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae (Phylogroup PG02b), previously described in Tunisia. However, they exhibited various BOX-PCR fingerprints and were not clonal. This work demonstrated, for the first time in Tunisia, the involvement of Pseudomonas cerasi (PG02a) and Pseudomonas congelans (PG02c). The latter did not show significant pathogenicity on citrus, but was pathogenic on cantaloupe and active for ice nucleation that could play a role in the disease. A comparative phylogenetic study of citrus pathogens from Iran, Montenegro and Tunisia revealed that P. syringae (PG02b) strains are closely related but again not clonal. Interestingly P. cerasi (PG02a) was isolated in two countries and seems to outspread. However, its role in the diseases is not fully understood and it should be monitored in future studies. The diversity of pathogenic Pseudomonas spp. and the extension of the diseases highlight that they have become complex and synergistic. It opens questions about which factors favor diseases and how to fight against them efficiently and with sustainable means.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In Brazil, there is a growing demand for specialised pharmaceuticals, and the high cost of their importation results in increasing costs, reaching US$ 1.34 billion in 2012 and US$ 1.61 billion in 2013. Worldwide expenses related to drugs could reach US$ 1.3 trillion in 2018, especially due to new treatments for hepatitis C and cancer. Specialised or high-cost pharmaceutical drugs used for the treatment of viral hepatitis, multiple sclerosis, HIV and diabetes are distributed free of charge by the Brazilian government. The glucagon peptide was included in this group of high-cost biopharmaceuticals in 2008. Although its main application is the treatment of hypoglycaemia in diabetic patients, it can also be used with patients in an alcoholic coma, for those patients with biliary tract pain, and as a bronchodilator. Therefore, in order to reduce biopharmaceutical production costs, the Brazilian government passed laws focusing on the development and increase of a National Pharmaceutical Industrial Centre, including the demand for the national production of glucagon. For that reason and given the importance and high cost of recombinant glucagon, the purpose of this study was to develop methods to improve production, purification and performance of the biological activity of recombinant glucagon. Glucagon was recombined into a plasmid vector containing a Glutathione S-transferase tag, and the peptide was expressed in a heterologous Escherichia coli system. After purification procedures and molecular analyses, the biological activity of this recombinant glucagon was examined using in vivo assays and showed a highly significant (p &lt; 0.00001) and prolonged effect on glucose levels when compared with the standard glucagon. The experimental procedure described here facilitates the high level production of recombinant glucagon with an extended biological activity.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical models have been used from growth kinetic simulation to gen regulatory networks prediction for B. thuringiensis culture. However, this culture is a time dependent dynamic process where cells physiology suffers several changes depending on the changes in the cell environment. Therefore, through its culture, B. thuringiensis presents three phases related with the predominance of three major metabolic pathways: vegetative growth (Embded-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway), transition (γ-aminobutiric cycle) and sporulation (tricarboxylic acid cycle). There is not available a mathematical model that relates the different stages of cultivation with the metabolic pathway active on each one of them. Therefore, in the present study, and based on published data, a biodynamic model was generated to describe the dynamic of the three different phases based on their major metabolic pathways. The biodynamic model is used to study the interrelation between the different culture phases and their relationship with the Cry protein production. The model consists of three interconnected modules where each module represents one culture phase and its principal metabolic pathway. For model validation four new fermentations were done showing that the model constructed describes reasonably well the dynamic of the three phases. The main results of this model imply that poly-β-hydroxybutyrate is crucial for endospore and Cry protein production. According to the yields of dipicolinic acid and Cry from poly-β-hydroxybutyrate, calculated with the model, the endospore and Cry protein production are not just simultaneous and parallel processes they are also competitive processes.",

Trametes pubescens, T. multicolor, T. meyenii and T. versicolor decoloured amaranth azo-dye best on low-nitrogen agar-solidified media whereas Bjerkandera adusta and Phlebia radiata were most effective in low nitrogen medium supplemented with manganese. Trametes cotonea did not decolour effectively under any condition. The decolouring Trametes species were also effective in liquid culture whereas B. adusta and P. radiata were not. Trametes meyenii, T. pubescens and T. multicolor were equal to or better than commonly employed T. versicolor at decolouring amaranth. This is the first study to show the dye decolouration potential of T. meyenii , T. pubescens , and T. multicolor . Supplementing with Mn(II) increased assayable manganese peroxidase activity, but not long-term decolouration, indicating that laccase is the main decolourizing enzyme in these Trametes species. This appears to be because of inadequate Mn 3+ chelation required by manganese peroxidase because adding relatively low amounts of malonate enhanced decolouration rates. The ability of Trametes meyenii to simultaneously decolour dye over prolonged periods of time while growing in relatively nutrient-rich medium appears to be unique amongst white-rot fungi, indicating its potential in wastewater bioremediation.",

VHb expression was also correlated with an increase of as much as about 30% in conversion of ammonia to nitrite by growing cells.

To give an added value to these oils, they were transesterified into biodiesel in a solvent-free system using immobilized enzyme lipozyme from Mucor miehei. The Doehlert experimental design was used to evaluate the methyl ester (ME) yields as influenced by enzyme concentration—EC, temperature—T, added water content—AWC, and reaction time—RT. Biodiesel yields were quantified by 1H NMR spectroscopy and subsequently modeled by a second order polynomial equation with interactions. Lipozyme enzymes were more tolerant to high temperatures in neem and shea oils reaction media compared to that of mango oil. The optimum reaction conditions EC, T, AWC, and RT assuring near complete conversion were as follows: mango oil 7.25 %, 36.6 °C, 10.9 %, 36.4 h; neem oil EC = 7.19 %, T = 45.7 °C, AWC = 8.43 %, RT = 25.08 h; and shea oil EC = 4.43 %, T = 45.65 °C, AWC = 6.21 % and RT = 25.08 h. Validation experiments of these optimum conditions gave ME yields of 98.1 ± 1.0, 98.5 ± 1.6 and 99.3 ± 0.4 % for mango, neem and shea oils, respectively, which all met ASTM biodiesel standards.",

Furthermore, the presence of polysaccharides that can be easily degraded might increase the assimilation rate of lignocellulose by promoting growth.

Successfully, we generated 194 transgenic chickens identified by Southern blot with a positive transgenic rate of 24%. The average concentration of rhLZ was 29.90 ± 6.50 μg/mL in the egg white. Lysozyme in egg white of transgenic chickens had a significantly higher antibacterial activity than those of non-transgenic chickens by lysoplate assay (P < 0.05). The feces of transgenic and non-transgenic chickens were collected and five types of bacteria (Lactobacillus, Salmonella, Bifidobacterium, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) were isolated and cultured to detect the impact of rhLZ on gut microbiota. Among the five bacteria, the number of Bifidobacterium in the intestine of those transgenic was significantly increased (P < 0.05). Moreover, the growth traits of the transgenic and non-transgenic chickens were analyzed. It was found that the 6-week shank length, 6-week weight and 18-week weight of transgenic chickens were significantly increased than that of non-transgenic chickens. The results demonstrated that rhLZ-transgenic chicken could promote the growth of Bifidobacterium in the intestine and improve the postnatal growth of chicken.",

Because of the wide application of macrolides in clinical treatment, macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae strains have become increasingly common worldwide. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying drug resistance in M. pneumoniae are poorly understood. In the present work, we analyzed the whole proteomes of macrolide-sensitive and macrolide-resistant strains of M. pneumoniae using a tandem mass tag-labeling quantitative proteomic technique, Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD022220. In total, 165 differentially expressed proteins were identified, of which 80 were upregulated and 85 were downregulated in the drug-resistant strain compared with the sensitive strain. Functional analysis revealed that these proteins were predominantly involved in protein and peptide biosynthesis processes, the ribosome, and transmembrane transporter activity, which implicates them in the mechanism(s) of resistance of M. pneumoniae to macrolides. Our results provide new insights into drug resistance in M. pneumoniae and identify potential targets for further studies on resistance mechanisms in this bacterium.",

Primary structure analysis of the protein sequence revealed that it contained a conserved active site motif (SxSxG) and a structural motif (CS-D-HC). Then the esterase gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia c oli BL21(DE3). SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified esterase showed that it was expressed in a highly soluble form and its molecular mass was estimated to be 55 kDa. Characterization of the esterase revealed that it exhibited high activity toward p -nitrophenyl esters with short acyl chains and especially p -nitrophenyl acetate, suggesting that it was a typical carboxylesterase rather than a lipase. With p -nitrophenyl acetate as substrate, the enzyme showed its optimal activity at pH 7.0 and 30 °C, and it was stable at a broad pH range from 4.5 to 10.0 and temperature not higher than 50 °C. Furthermore, the enzyme showed different substrate specificity from known esterase, it was not only hydrolyzing against p -nitrophenyl esters, but also hydrolyzing all hydroxybenzoic esters and hydroxycinnamic ester assayed. As it was an enzyme active on a broad range of phenolic esters, simultaneously possessing feruloyl esterase, chlorogenate esterase and tannase activities, it could serve as a valuable candidate for applications in biotechnology.",

Then, we calculated the numbers of bacterial colonies and collected the bacterial culture mixtures from each kind of medium. Using the Illumina HiSeq platform, we analyzed the composition and diversity of the culture-enriched gut bacterial community. Our data suggested that medium supplemented with blood could increase the diversity of the bacterial community. In addition, beef powder and peptone could significantly change the culture-enriched bacterial community. A moderate density (100–150 colony-forming units per plate) was optimal for obtaining the highest diversity on the agar. Similarly, membrane transport was significantly enriched in the moderate-density group, which indicated a more active metabolism in this density range.

Sows received a commercial diet throughout gestation and lactation (CTR; n = 64), a commercial diet throughout gestation and a diet containing PAs in lactation (CTR-PA; n = 63) or a commercial diet containing PAs in gestation and lactation (PA; n = 90). Sows were weighed and backfat recorded after mating and at entry and exit from the farrowing house and piglets were weighed on days 1 and 21 of life. Faecal samples collected from sows at farrowing house entry and piglets at 21 and 35 d were subjected to 16 S rRNA gene amplicon analysis. The addition of PAs to sow diets resulted in more piglets born ( P = 0.03), however, it did not improve the number of liveborn piglets ( P = 0.14). There were no differences in sow weight, P2 backfat depth or lactation feed intake observed. PAs had no effect on piglet weight or survival to weaning but did alter the faecal microbiota of sows, and this change was observed in piglets at 21 and 35 d.

The selectivity and specificity of the biosensors were determined based on the interaction between heavy metals and regulatory proteins; thereby, the modulating target selectivity of biosensors could be achieved by changing target sensing properties of regulatory proteins. The results of this study demonstrated that Pb(II)-sensing biosensors could be generated from an arsenic-responsive genetic system, which was originally used for arsenic-sensing biosensors. The amino acids around to As(III)-binding sites of ArsR were mutated and cysteine residues were relocated to modulate the metal selectivity. In addition, genes encoding metal ion-translocating P-type ATPases, such as copA and zntA, were deleted to enhance the specificity by increasing the intercellular levels of divalent metal ions. Based on the results, channel protein deleted E. coli cells harboring a pair of recombinant genes, engineered ArsR and arsAp::egfp, showed enhanced responses upon Pb exposure and could be used to quantify the amount of Pb(II) in artificially contaminated water and plants grown in media containing Pb(II). Although we focused on generating Pb(II)-specific biosensors in this study, the proposed strategy has a great potential for the generation of diverse heavy metal-sensing biosensors and risk assessment of heavy metals in environmental samples as well as in plants.",

    "abstract": "The phenomenon of membrane vesicle (MV) production is known to be common to all bacterial cells. Although MVs are expected to be employed in a variety of applications, improving MV productivity is essential for applications. Since the deletion of the degP gene, a periplasmic dual-function protease and chaperone, in Escherichia coli has successfully improved MV production capacity, we tried to enhance MV productivity in the thermophilic M. ruber H328 by deleting the degP gene. One gene (mrH_0331) was selected for degP gene from the H328 genome and we constructed the mutant strain ∆degP by deleting the degP gene of the H328 strain that was replaced with the htk gene showing thermophilic kanamaycin resistance by homologous recombination. The mutant strain ∆degP exhibited smooth growth but a lower level of turbidity at 60 °C although there was no difference in growth at 55 °C between the wild strain and the mutant strain. Finally, we have confirmed that incubation at 60 °C increases MV in the mutant strain ∆degP strain about fivefold by using two fluorescent dyes, DiI and FM4-64, which is followed by TEM analysis. The deletion of the degP gene presumably causes an increase in denatured proteins at 60 °C, leading to enhanced MV production. Meanwhile, the S-layer protein included in the outer membrane of the H328 strain increased in the MV fraction prepared from the mutant cells incubated at 60 °C. This indicates that this method is effective for MV production and that degP deletion enhances it in strain H328.",

    "abstract": "S-adenosyl-L-methionine is an important bioactive molecule participating in a number of biochemical reactions including the transmethylation and transsulphuration reactions of proteins and the biosynthesis of aliphatic polyamines. Strategies of metabolic engineering were used to alter the metabolic flux for enhancing the production of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) in Pichia pastoris GS115. These strategies include the over-expression of Sam2 by knock-in technique and the disruption of Cbs by knock-out technique. Three strains, ZJGSU1 with knock- in of Sam2, ZJGSU2 with knock-out of Cbs and ZJGSU3 with both knock-in of Sam2 and knock -out of Cbs, were constructed for the effective production of SAM. Yields of SAM in strains ZJGSU1 and ZJGSU2 were 32- and 5-fold higher than in the original strain P. pastoris GS115, respectively. The strain ZJGSU3 had a dramatic increase in the SAM yield, and it was 46-fold higher compared to the original strain. These results indicate that there is a strong synergistic effect on the production of SAM by combining knock-in with knock-out techniques. The yield of SAM in ZJGSU3 strain was 4.37 g/L in a 3 L fermentor. This study provides deep insight into the effective industrial production of SAM in future.",

Approximately 122-fold purification was achieved with a yield of 10.5%. The enzyme preparation was homogeneous as judged by sodium dodecyl polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The molecular mass of the purified enzyme was estimated to be 49 kDa by SDS-PAGE and gel filtration, suggesting that it is a monomer. Enzyme activity was optimal at pH 8.0 and was stable in the range of pH 7.0–10. The optimum temperature for activity was 40°C and the enzyme was stable up to 40°C. The isoelectric point was pH 5.8. Substrate specificity was very high for formaldehyde. Besides formaldehyde, the only aldehyde or alcohol tested that served as a substrate was pyruvaldehyde. Enzyme activity was enhanced by several divalent cations such as Mn 2+ (179%), Ba 2+ (132%), and Ca 2+ (112%) but was completely inhibited by Ni 2+ , Fe 3+ , Hg 2+ , p-chloromercuribenzoate (PCMB) and cuprizone. Inactivation of the enzyme by sulfhydryl reagents (Hg 2+ and PCMB) indicated that the sulfhydryl group of the enzyme is essential for catalytic activity.",

Equal proportion of 0.1% formic acid and methanol (v/v) were used to convert extracts of Cordyceps sinensis and Ganoderma lucidum into their respective ions under positive MS polarity condition. No chromatographic separation was performed. The principal m/z values of Cordyceps sinensis and Ganoderma lucidum were identified as: 104.2, 116.2, 120.2, 175.2, 236.3, 248.3, 266.3, 366.6 and 498.6; 439.7, 469.7, 511.7, 551.6, 623.6, 637.7 and 653.6, respectively.

Five repeat analyses provided a total of 180 spectra for herbal extracts of Cordyceps sinensis and Ganoderma lucidum. Root-mean-square-deviation (RMSE) were highly satisfactory at <4% for both training and validation models. Correlation coefficient (r2) values of between 0.9994 and 0.9997 were reported.

Recovery assessment was performed over two days using six sets of matrix blank (n = 6) spiked at three concentration levels of approximately 83, 166 and 333 mg kg-1. Extraction using acetonitrile provided good overall recovery range of 92-118%. A quantitation limit of 0.2 mg L-1 was reported for both Cordyceps sinensis and Ganoderma lucidum. Intra-day and inter-day RMSE values of 7% or better were achieved. Application of the scaffold in a high-throughput routine environment would imply a significant reduction in effort and time, since the option of having a model driven analytical solution is now available.",

    "abstract": "Like any other enteric pathogen, Salmonella also encounters acidic stress in the stomach as well as within the host macrophage milieu. However, the pathogen is reported to combat this stress through acid tolerance response (ATR), expressing a number of genes and eventually the proteins. Recently, an acid induced outer membrane phenotype encoded by fliC gene in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi has been identified. In the present study, fliC gene was cloned to study its biological implications. The recombinant FliC (rFliC) protein was observed to stimulate the production of antibodies. These antibodies could also recognize the FliC protein (antigen) in the clinical samples i.e. blood samples from typhoid patents as well as healthy blood samples spiked with serovar Typhi. Moreover, the rFliC also reacted with the sera from patients suffering with typhoid fever indicating its in-vivo immunogenicity. Ex-vivo study revealed that rFliC has the potential to stimulate the macrophages to generate higher levels of inflammatory mediators such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitrite. The inflammatory potential of FliC was also confirmed in-vivo, by the paw oedema test as well as by flicking response of the inflamed paw indicating hyperalgesia occurring during inflammatory response. The findings of the present study indicate that acid induced FliC might be one of the factors enhancing the virulence of serovar Typhi under the host acidic conditions and may prove to be helpful in designing the prophylactic measures.",

    "abstract": "A major problem for manufacturers of cracked spores Ganoderma lucidum, a traditional functional food/Chinese medicine (TCM), is to ensure that raw materials are consistent as received from the producer. To address this, a feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) method assisted by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and principal component analysis (PCA) was developed for the spectroscopic discrimination of cracked spores of Ganoderma lucidum from uncracked spores. 120 samples comprising cracked spores, uncracked spores and concentrate of Ganoderma lucidum were analyzed. Differences in the absorption spectra located at ν1 (1143 - 1037 cm-1), ν2 (1660 - 1560 cm-1), ν3 (1745 - 1716 cm-1) and ν4 (2845 - 2798 cm-1) were identified by applying fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy and used as variables for discriminant analysis. The utilization of spectra frequencies offered maximum chemical information provided by the absorption spectra. Uncracked spores gave rise to characteristic spectrum that permitted discrimination from its cracked physical state. Parallel application of variables derived from unsupervised LDA/PCA provided useful (feed-forward) information to achieve 100% classification integrity objective in ANN. 100% model validation was obtained by utilizing 30 independent samples. ν1 was used to construct the matrix-matched calibration curve (n = 10) based on 4 levels of concentration (20%, 40%, 60% and 80% uncracked spores in cracked spores). A coefficient of correlation (r) of 0.97 was obtained. Relative standard deviation (RSD) of 11% was achieved using 100% uncracked spores (n = 30). These results demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing a combination of spectroscopy and prospective statistical tools to perform non destructive food quality assessment in a high throughput environment.",

The present study investigated the feasibility of using waste iron shavings as electron donor for nitrogen removal by biological denitrification. Two anoxic sequencing batch reactors (AnSBR) were continuously operated for more than 100 days. The results showed that the TN removal efficiency increased from 12% in the control reactor (AnSBR-C) to 20% in the reactor with waste iron shavings (AnSBR-Fe). The TN removal was mainly achieved by the reduction of nitrate by heterotrophic denitrification and autotrophic denitrification for AnSBR-Fe. The residual COD (38.4 mg/L) in the effluent of AnSBR-Fe was higher than that (22 mg/L) in the effluent of AnSBR-C, which could be due to that the bacteria preferred to use iron instead of the recalcitrant organics that present in the wastewater. Furthermore, 3DEEM, UHPLC-QTOF and GC-MS analysis were used to characterize the organics in the wastewater, and the results showed that the addition of waste iron shavings affected the degradation of organics during the biological denitrification process.",

    "abstract": "Key microalgal species are currently being exploited as biomanufacturing platforms using mass cultivation systems. The opportunities to enhance productivity levels or produce non-native compounds are increasing as genetic manipulation and metabolic engineering tools are rapidly advancing. Regardless of the end product, there are both environmental and industrial risks associated to open pond cultivation of mutant microalgal strains. A mutant escape could be detrimental to local biodiversity and increase the risk of algal blooms. Similarly, if the cultivation pond is invaded by a wild-type (WT) microalgae or the mutant reverts to WT phenotypes, productivity could be impacted. To investigate these potential risks, a response surface methodology was applied to determine the competitive outcome of two Chlamydomonas reinhardtii strains, a WT (CC-124) and a high-lipid accumulating mutant (CC-4333), grown in mixotrophic conditions, with differing levels of nitrogen and initial WT to mutant ratios. Results of the growth experiments show that mutant cells have double the exponential growth rate of the WT in monoculture. However, due to a slower transition from lag phase to exponential phase, mutant cells are outcompeted by the WT in every co-culture treatment. This suggests that, under the conditions tested, outdoor cultivation of the C. reinhardtii cell wall-deficient mutant strains does not carry a significant environmental risk to its WT in an escape scenario. Furthermore, lipid results show the mutant strain accumulates over 200% more TAGs per cell, at 50 mg L−1 NH4Cl, compared to the WT, therefore, the fragility of the mutant strain could impact on overall industrial productivity.",

Firstly, the heat-flow power-time curves of E. coli growth affected by different S. miltiorrhizae samples were recorded. Then, some crucial quantitative thermo-kinetic parameters including growth rate constant, heat-flow power and heat output, etc. were obtained from theses curves and were further investigated by some powerful chemometric techniques including similarity analysis, multivariate analysis of variance, hierarchical clustering analysis and principle component analysis. By analyzing the principle parameters, growth rate constant of the second exponential phase (k 2) and the heat-flow output powers of the second highest peak (P 2), together with the derived parameter inhibitory ratio (I, %), it could be quickly concluded that the tested S. miltiorrhizae samples from different sources in China exhibited strong antibacterial effects on E. coli and the samples from Beijing city exhibited the strongest anti-E. coli effects, which might be used as novel and underlying antibacterial candidates for the resistance of E. coli to the existing drugs in practice.

This study shows that a cold-shock can be applied to induce lysis of the yeast cells. A strain of P. pastoris was constructed in which the endogenous eng gene encoding a putative endo-β-1,3-glucanase was overexpressed using the cold-shock induced promoter of the cctα gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the transgenic P. pastoris, the expression of eng increased 3.6-fold after chilling the cells from 30 to 4 °C (cold-shock stage) followed by incubation for 6 h (eng expression stage). The culture was heated to 30 °C for 6 h (ENG synthesis stage) and kept at 37 °C for 24 h (lysis stage). After this procedure the cell morphology changed, spheroplasts were obtained and cellular lysis was observed. Thus, a clone of P. pastoris was obtained, which undergoes autolysis after a cold-shock.",

Lysobacter enzymogenes, is a non-pathogenic species known for its capacity as a biocontrol agent of plant pathogens. It is also noted for the production of antimicrobial secondary metabolites, heat stable antifungal factor (HSAF) and WAP-8294A2, that have potential for agricultural and pharmaceutical applications. The species also displays type IV pili-dependent twitching motility and the production of multiple extracellular lytic enzymes as additional biocontrol-related traits. Here, we show that L. enzymogenes strain OH11 possesses three genes widely separated in the OH11 genome that code for unique Ax21-like proteins (Lsp). By comparing the wildtype OH11 with mutant strains having a single lsp gene or a combination of lsp genes deleted, we found that each Lsp protein individually is involved in positive regulation of HSAF and WAP-8294A2 biosynthesis, but the proteins collectively do not exert additive effects in this regulation. None of the Lsp proteins were found to influence twitching motility or the production of three extracellular lytic enzymes. This study is the first to provide evidence linking Ax21-family proteins to antibiotic biosynthesis and, hence, adds new insights into the diversity of regulatory functions of Ax21 family proteins in bacteria.",

In this work, a Stirred-Catalytic-Basket-BioReactor using various immobilizing foams as support material and compared to free cells were used, focusing mainly on; (i) effect of mass-transfer on cells physiology and (ii) ethanol productivity. The performance of the reactor was further evaluated by ethanol volumetric productivity, yield and time for process completion and it was found that the variation of ethanol production and diffusion of the substrate in fermentation process are co-related with the stirrer speed and initial glucose concentration. It was also observed that the time difference for glucose consumption between free and immobilized cells (alginate and sponges) tends to increase by increasing the glucose concentration in the medium. We found that at higher stirrer speed (500 rpm) when using higher glucose concentration (200 g/l), ethanol volumetric productivity increased significantly in the sponge (85 g/l) as compared to alginate beads (79 g/l) and free cells (60 g/l). From the data obtained, it can be concluded that sponges are the best support material for attaining higher ethanol productivity. A stirred catalytic basket bioreactor with yeast cells immobilized in polyethylene sponge gives higher ethanol production at a higher glucose consumption rate, and this productivity is due to higher mixing efficiency and reduced external as well as internal mass transfer limitations. The potentials of the reactor rank it as a remarkable ethanol/fine-chemical production approach that needs further investigations.",

    "abstract": "Influenza viruses have periodically caused pandemic due to frequent mutation of viral proteins. Influenza viruses have two major membrane glycoproteins: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Hemagglutinin plays a crucial role in viral entry, while NA is involved in the process of a viral escape. In terms of developing antiviral drugs, HA is a more important target than NA in the prevention of pandemic, since HA is likely to change the host specificity of a virus by acquiring mutations, thereby to increase the risk of pandemic. To characterize mutated HA functions, current approaches require immobilization of purified HA on plastic wells and carriers. These troublesome methods make it difficult to respond to emerging mutations. In order to address this problem, a yeast cell surface engineering approach was investigated. Using this technology, human HAs derived from various H1N1 subtypes were successfully and rapidly displayed on the yeast cell surface. The yeast-displayed HAs exhibited similar abilities to native influenza virus HAs. Using this system, human HAs with 190E and 225G mutations were shown to exhibit altered recognition specificities from human to avian erythrocytes. This system furthermore allowed direct measurement of HA binding abilities without protein purification and immobilization. Coupled with the ease of genetic manipulation, this system allows the simple and comprehensive construction of mutant protein libraries on yeast cell surface, thereby contributing to influenza virus pandemic prevention.",

The maximum chitinase production reached after 24 h at 2.5% colloidal chitin concentration in presence of starch as an inducer. Chitinase was extracted efficiently at 65% cold acetone concentration and then purified by using DEAE-Cellulose column chromatography. Purified chitinase having molecular weight 22 kDa with single polypeptide chain was optimally active at pH 5.0 and temperature 30 °C. The purified chitinase revealed kinetic properties like Km 1.66 mg/ml and Vmax 769 mM/min. Crude chitinase extract efficiently formed protoplasts from A. niger, A. oryzae, T. viride and F. moniliforme. The formed protoplasts of A. niger and T. viride showed 70 and 66% regeneration frequency respectively. Further, intergeneric fusants were developed successfully and identified at molecular level using RNA profiling. Thus, this study could be useful for strain improvement of various fungi for biotechnological applications.",

    "abstract": "Scarce high-quality protein feed resources has limited the development of animal husbandry. In this study, we used a dual-flow continuous culture system to evaluate effects of difference dietary protein sources including soybean meal (SBM), cottonseed meal (CSM), and rapeseed meal (RSM), on nutrient disappearance, rumen fermentation, and microbiota of XiongDong black goats. Dietary proteins of either CSM, RSM or SBM had no effect on nutrient disappearance (P > 0.05). CSM or RSM significantly reduced (P < 0.01) the pH and enhanced (P < 0.01) the ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) concentration in fermentation liquid compared to SBM. The short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) contents were greater (P = 0.05) and acetate was lower (P < 0.01) in SBM than those in RSM and CSM, whereas propionate was greater (P < 0.01) in RSM than that in SBM, consequently reducing the acetate to propionate ratio (A/P) in RSM. Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria were detected as the dominant phyla, and the relative abundances of Spirochaetae (P < 0.01) and Chlorobi (P < 0.05) declined in the CSM and RSM groups as compared to those in the SBM group. At the genus level, Prevotella_1 was the dominant genus; as compared to SBM, its relative abundance was greater (P < 0.01) in CSM and RSM. The abundances of Prevotellaceae_Ga6A1 and Christensenellaceae_R7 were lower (P < 0.05) in CSM, whereas Eubacterium_oxidoreducens_group, and Treponema_2 were lower (P < 0.01) in both CSM and RSM, and other genera were not different (P > 0.10). Although the bacterial community changed with different dietary protein sources, the disappearances of nutrients were not affected, suggesting that CSM and RSM could be used by rumen bacteria, as in case with SBM, and are suitable protein sources for ruminant diets.",

In the current study, various critical process parameters for optimum production of AlkB have been optimized through feed forward neural network (FFNN) and genetic algorithm (GA) models using Penicillium chrysogenum SNP5 (MTCC13144). AlkB specific activity under preliminary un-optimized conditions i.e., 1% hexadecane, 7.4 pH, 11 days incubation time, 28 °C incubation temperature and 1 ml of inoculum size was 100 U/mg. ‘One variable at a time’ (OVAT) strategy was used to identify optimum physicochemical parameters and then its output data was fed to develop a model of FFNN with ‘6-12-1’ topology. Outputs of FFNN were further optimized through GA to minimize errors and intensify search level. This has provided superior predictive performances with 0.053 U/mg overall mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), 6.801 U/mg root mean square errors (RMSE), and 0.987 overall correlation coefficient (R). The AlkB specific activity improved by 3.5-fold, i.e., from 100 U/mg under preliminary un-optimized conditions to 351.32 U/mg under optimum physicochemical conditions obtained through FFNN-GA hybrid method, i.e., hexadecane (carbon source): 1.56% v/v, FeSO 4 : 0.63 mM, incubation temperature: 27.40 °C, pH: 7.38, incubation time: 12.35 days and inoculums size: 1.33 ml.

Researching and developing a herpes zoster vaccine will help to decrease the incidence of herpes zoster. To increase the bioreactor productivity, a serum-free HEK293 cell perfusion process with adenovirus vector herpes zoster (rAd-HZ) vaccine production was developed efficiently using the design of experiment (DoE) method. First, serum-free media for HEK293 cells were screened in both batch and semi-perfusion culture modes. Then, three optimal media were employed in a medium mixture design to improve cell culture performance, and the 1:1 mixture of HEK293 medium and MCD293 medium (named HM293 medium) was identified as the optimal formulation. On the basis of the HM293 medium, the relationship of critical process parameters (CPPs), including the time of infection (TOI), multiplicity of infection (MOI), pH, and critical quality attributes (CQAs) (adenovirus titer (Titer), cell-specific virus yield (CSVY), adenovirus fold expansion (Fold)) of rAd-HZ production was investigated using the DoE approach. Furthermore, the robust setpoint and design space of these CPPs were explored. Finally, the rAd-HZ production process with parameters at a robust setpoint (TOI = 7.2 × 10 6 cells/mL, MOI = 3.7, and pH = 7.17) was successfully scaled-up to a 3-L bioreactor with an alternating tangential flow system, yielding an adenovirus titer of 3.0 × 10 10 IFU/mL, a CSVY of 4167 IFU/cells, a Fold of 1117 at 2 days post infection (dpi). The DoE approach accelerated the development of a HEK293 serum-free medium and of a robust adenovirus production process.",

The purpose of this study was to establish a novel EBV detection method by combining the recombinase aided amplification (RAA) assay with an initial enrichment step that utilizes magnetic beads coated with a recombinant human mannan-binding lectin (rhMBL, M1 protein). An M1 protein-protein A magnetic bead complex (M1 beads) was prepared and used to achieve separation and enrichment of EBV from blood. After nucleic acid extraction, DNA was amplified by RAA. Using 388 whole blood samples and 1 serum sample, we explored the specificity, sensitivity and applicability of the newly developed detection method and compared it with commercial quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) following M1 bead enrichment, traditional qPCR and traditional RAA. After enrichment, the positivity rate of EBV was increased from 15.94% to 17.74% by RAA (P < 0.05) and from 7.20% to 15.17% by qPCR (P < 0.05). The viral loads after enrichment were increased by 1.13 to 23.19-fold (P < 0.05). Our data demonstrates that an RAA assay incorporating M1 bead enrichment is a promising tool for detecting low EBV viral loads in blood samples that will facilitate an early response to EBV infection.",

However, the application of mouse MAb is limited in other animals due to immune rejection. Here, the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of 10H4 were cloned and ligated with constant canine antibody regions to produce a canine-derived chimeric MAb 11D9, in a CHO-S cell expression system. The cell supernatant of the CHO cell line 11D9 exhibited a HI titer of 1:2560 against all the variants of CPV-2 (new CPV-2a, new CPV-2b, and CPV-2c), and had the same average neutralization titer as the new CPV-2a (1:11,046.5) and new CPV-2b (1:11,046.5) variants, which was slightly higher than that of CPV-2c variants (1:10,615.7). In animal experiment, the treatment of chimeric MAb 11D9 had a high therapeutic effect in beagles infected with the new CPV-2a. Overall, the canine-derived chimeric MAb 11D9 produced by CHO-S cells showed a high HI and neutralization titer against CPV-2 and the therapeutic effects against the new CPV-2a in beagles, providing potential for the prevention or treatment of CPV-2 infections in dogs.",

An ascomycete Gibberella zeae VKM F-2600 is capable of producing UDCA by 7β-hydroxylation of lithocholic acid (LCA). The present study is aimed at the improvement of the fungus productivity. The original procedures for the protoplast obtaining followed by UV mutagenesis and screening of ketoconazole-resistant mutant clones have been applied. The highest yield of G. zeae protoplasts was obtained when using the mycelium in the active growth phase, ammonium chloride as an osmotic stabilizer and treatment of the fungal cells by the lytic enzymes cocktail from Trichoderma hurzanium . The conditions for effective protoplast regeneration and the UV-mutagenesis were found to provide 6–12% survival rate of the protoplasts with superior number of possible mutations. Three of 27 ketoconazole-resistant mutant clones obtained have been selected due to their increased biocatalytic activity towards LCA. The mutant G. zeae M23 produced 26% more UDCA even at relatively high LCA concentration (4 g/L) as compared with parent fungal strain, and the conversion reached 88% (w/w). The yield of UDCA reached in this study prefers those ever reported. The results contribute to the knowledge on ascomycete mutagenesis, and are of importance for biotechnological production of value added cholic acids. Graphical Abstract",

So, we investigated the nutritional-fermentation quality of PL before and after ensiling with or without yogurt containing mainly lactic acid-producing bacteria (Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophiles) and molasses (at two levels of 2 and 4% of dry matter) in the polyethylene microsilos for 60 days. A range of dry matter (29.1-39.1%), crude protein (3.85-4.83%), ash (5.33-8.60%), and non-fiber carbohydrates (53.2%-58.6%) contents were observed among the treatments. A significant increase in calcium, potassium, magnesium, manganese, iron, and zinc was observed in PL after ensiling compared to before ensiling (p < 0.05). The PL ensiled with 4% yogurt exhibited the highest ammonia nitrogen, lactic and acetic acids, but the lowest butyric acid among the ensiled PL (p < 0.05). The ensiling of PL without additive (control) significantly decreased potential gas production, dry matter digestibility, organic matter digestibility, total volatile fatty acids, metabolizable energy, net energy for lactation, base-buffering capacity, titratable alkalinity, and acid-base buffering capacity compared to before ensiling (p < 0.05). According to the present results, the nutritional value of PL before ensiling was higher than after ensiling. The addition of yogurt and molasses to PL at the ensiling process especially at 4% of dry matter, improved the fermentation and nutritional characteristics. In general, the addition of yogurt or molasses as two cheap and available additives is recommended to improve the digestive-fermentation parameters of PL in silo and ruminal environments.",

Considering the antimicrobial properties of copper, here, the bacterial load and the presence of Acinetobacter spp. were monitored on high handling surfaces covered by 99.9% copper films on intensive and non-intensive care unit bedrooms in a tertiary care hospital. Firstly, copper-coated films were able to inhibit the adhesion and biofilm formation of A. baumannii strains in in vitro assays. On the other hand, Acinetobacter spp. were isolated from both copper-coated and uncoated surfaces in the hospital, although the majority was detected on surfaces without copper. All carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii isolates identified harbored the blaoxa-23 gene, while the A. nosocomialis isolates were susceptible to most antimicrobials tested. All isolates were susceptible to polymyxin B. Regarding the total aerobic bacteria, surfaces with copper-coated films presented lower total loads than those detected for controls. Copper coating films may be a workable strategy to mitigate HAIs, given their potential in reducing bacterial loads in nosocomial environments, including threatening pathogens like A. baumannii.",

    "abstract": "The milk-clotting enzyme (MCE) is a crucial ingredient in cheese manufacture. Due to the limits of traditional MCE, finding viable substitute is a pressing issue. This study aims to isolate and identify a wild strain with high milk-clotting activity (MCA) and low proteolytic activity (PA) and optimize the fermentation conditions for MCE production. A strain of Bacillus velezensis DB219 with high MCA/PA value (9.2) was isolated from dairy soil (Wuchang, Heilongjiang, China) and identified through 16S rRNA from 40 strains. The optimal wheat bran, carbon, nitrogen, inoculum size, volume and initial pH were 60 g/L, soluble starch 12.5 g/L, corn steep liquor 3 g/L, 5%, 40 mL and 6.15, respectively for improving DB219 MCE production through single factor experiment. The wheat bran concentration, corn steep liquor concentration and volume were the most critical factor and their changed range was determined through Plackett-Burman design and the steepest ascent/descent experiments. The response surface analysis experiment of three factors and three levels was conducted by Box-Behnken design. The theoretical optimal fermentation conditions for DB219 MCE were as follows: wheat bran concentration 60.14 g/L, soluble starch 12.5 g/L, corn steep liquor 3 g/L, inoculum size 5%, volume 40.08 mL and initial pH 6.15. DB219 MCE achieved the maximal MCA (3164.84 SU/mL) that was 101.9% of the predicted value (3104.49 SU/mL) and 4.3-fold higher than the control.",

    "abstract": "Giardia duodenalis (G. duodenalis) is an infectious protozoan that has a global distribution especially in the hot climate. Around 200 million people are infected worldwide annually by Giardia, but infection is not always accompanied by symptoms, especially in endemic countries. Using traditional microscopy techniques in diagnosis, both in stool and water samples were less sensitive when compared to immunological methods; and the need for new diagnostic methods was necessary. Also, protection from infection is required in endemic areas. Therefore, the study aimed to produce anti- G. duodenalis IgG polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) by immunizing rabbit by G. duodenalis cyst recombinant protein. The produced antibodies were evaluated in the detection of G. duodenalis antigens in patients' stool and water samples from endemic areas across River Nile; where pAbs were used as a coating and a peroxidase conjugate antibody in sandwich ELISA. Moreover, pAbs were tested for the protection of mice from giardiasis. Sandwich ELISA using pAb has succeeded in the detection of G. duodenalis coproantigens in stool samples by a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 92.72%. Moreover, G. duodenalis cyst was detected in only seven water samples by ordinary microscopy; while sandwich ELISA revealed nineteen positive results. IgG pAb (1/200 µg/ml) protected mice from giardiasis; which was evident from the reduction in cysts and trophozoites numbers. We recommended the use of sandwich ELISA to monitor water quality, investigate environmental contamination and diagnosis in patients' stools. The pAbs can be prepared in large amount and used in field diagnosis and protection. This will help in the early diagnosis of G. duodenalis in water, which in turn can control outbreaks in rural areas.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Protoplast fusion is one of the most reliable methods of introducing desirable traits into industrially-promising fungal strains. It harnesses the entire genomic repertoire of fusing microorganisms by routing the natural barrier and genetic incompatibility between them. In the present study, the axenic culture of a thermo-halotolerant strain of Aspergillus candidus (Asp-C) produced an anti-leukemic l -asparaginase ( l -ASNase) while a xylan-degrading strain of Aspergillus sydowii (Asp-S) produced the acrylamide-reduction type. Protoplast fusion of the wild strains generated Fusant-06 with improved anti-leukemic and acrylamide reduction potentials. Submerged fed-batch fermentation was preferred to batch and continuous modes on the basis of impressive techno-economics. Fusant-06 l -ASNase was purified by PEG/Na + citrate aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) to 146.21-fold and global sensitivity analysis report revealed polymer molecular weight and citrate concentration as major determinants of yield and purification factor, respectively. The enzyme was characterized by molecular weight, amino acid profile, activity and stability to chemical agents. Michaelis–Menten kinetics, evaluated under optimum conditions gave K m , V ma x , K cat , and K cat /K m as 6.67 × 10 –5 M, 1666.67 µmolmin −1 mg −1 protein, 3.88 × 10 4 min −1 and 5.81 × 10 8 M −1 .min −1 respectively. In-vitro cytotoxicity of HL-60 cell lines by Fusant-06 l -ASNase improved significantly from their respective wild strains. Stability of Fusant-06 l -ASNase over a wide range of pH, temperature and NaCl concentration, coupled with its micromolar K m value, confers commercial and therapeutic value on the product. Free-radical scavenging and acrylamide reduction activities were intermediate and the conferred thermo-halo-stability could be exploited for sustainable clinical and food industry applications.",

Although the plain Burkholderia is pervasive from taxonomic and genetic perspectives, a common characteristic is that they may use the quorum-sensing (QS) system. In our previous study, we generated the complete genome sequence of Burkholderia contaminans SK875 isolated from the respiratory tract. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report functional genomic features of B. contaminans SK875 for understanding the pathogenic characteristics. In addition, comparative genomic analysis for five B. contaminans genomes was performed to provide comprehensive information on the disease potential of B. contaminans species. Analysis of average nucleotide identity (ANI) showed that the genome has high similarity (> 96%) with other B. contaminans strains. Five B. contaminans genomes yielded a pangenome of 8832 coding genes, a core genome of 5452 genes, the accessory genome of 2128 genes, and a unique genome of 1252 genes. The 186 genes were specific to B. contaminans SK875, including toxin higB-2, oxygen-dependent choline dehydrogenase, and hypothetical proteins. Genotypic analysis of the antimicrobial resistance of B. contaminans SK875 verified resistance to tetracycline, fluoroquinolone, and aminoglycoside. Compared with the virulence factor database, we identified 79 promising virulence genes such as adhesion system, invasions, antiphagocytic, and secretion systems. Moreover, 45 genes of 57 QS-related genes that were identified in B. contaminans SK875 indicated high sequence homology with other B. contaminans strains. Our results will help to gain insight into virulence, antibiotic resistance, and quorum sensing for B. contaminans species.",

In the current study, recombinant LukS-PV protein-loaded silver nanoparticles were prepared and their cytotoxicity effect was analyzed on human breast cancer cells and human normal embryonic kidneys cells by MTT assay. Apoptosis was investigated by staining with Annexin V/propidium iodide. The recombinant LukS-PV protein-loaded silver nanoparticles showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity and induced apoptosis in the MCF7 cells and had a lesser effect on HEK293 cells. After 24 h exposure to the recombinant LukS-PV protein-loaded silver nanoparticles (IC50), Annexin V-FITC/PI FCM revealed that 33.2% of MCF7 cells were apoptotic. In conclusion, recombinant LukS-PV protein-loaded silver nanoparticles probably cannot be a better alternative for the targeted healing approaches to cancer therapies. Hence, it is suggested that silver nanoparticles could be utilized as a delivery system for releasing toxins into cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Duck adenovirus 3 (DAdV-3), a newly emerged duck adenovirus, has resulted in significant economic losses to the duck industry across China since 2014. However, little is known about the B cell epitopes in major antigen of DAdV-3 and the serological approach for detection of DAdV-3 is not available. In this study, four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific to Fiber-2 protein of DAdV-3 were first generated and designated as 2G10, 3D9, 5E6, and 6B12. Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) showed that all of the mAbs reacted with the Fiber-2. Moreover, mAbs 2G10, 5E6, and 6B12 demonstrated good activity with Fiber-2 in Western blot. Notably, the Fiber-2 could be immunoprecipitated efficiently by mAb 3D9. Epitope mapping revealed that mAbs 2G10, 3D9, 5E6, and 6B12 recognized 397-429aa, 463-481aa, 67-99aa, and 1-66aa of Fiber-2, respectively. Besides, a novel sandwich ELISA for efficient detection of DAdV-3 was developed based on mAb 3D9 and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated mAb 3D9. The sandwich ELISA only reacted with DAdV-3 but not with other duck-associated viruses. The limit of detection of the ELISA was 6.25 × 10 3 TCID 50 /mL. Overall, the mAbs generated laid the foundation for elucidating the critical role of Fiber-2 in mediating infection and pathogenesis, and the sandwich ELISA approach established here provided efficient and rapid serological diagnostic tool for DAdV-3.",

Statistical analysis indicated there is no significant difference in HA titer between RBSHA2 and RBSHA3 strains (p-value > 0.05), however, these strains produced HA approximately 4-fold higher than that of RBSHA strain. Agarose gel electrophoresis showed the same molecular weight (< 30 kDa) of produced HA by strains. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) revealed all HA polymers had a relatively low polydispersity index (PDI < 0.5).

In order to explore the differences of microbial community structure of threshed and redried tobacco leaves from different origins at home and abroad, 14 groups of tobacco leaves from 8 different countries were tested by high-throughput DNA sequencing and microbiology analysis. Then, through amplicon sequence variants (ASV) cluster analysis, Venn diagram and species labeling and other microbial diversity analysis, the dominant bacteria and fungi on the surface of threshed and redried tobacco leaves were obtained. The results showed that there were significant differences in the composition of tobacco bacteria and fungi after threshing and redrying from different geographical areas. The relative abundance of Microbacterium and Sphingomonas in domestic tobacco leaves was significantly higher than that of foreign tobacco leaves. The relative abundance of Pseudomonas in foreign tobacco bacterial colonies was significantly higher than that of domestic tobacco leaves. In terms of fungi, the relative abundance of Aspergillus and Alternaria in domestic tobacco leaves was significantly higher than that of foreign tobacco leaves. Septoria, Sampaiozyma, Cladosporium and Phoma account for significantly higher proportions of foreign tobacco leaves. These microorganisms may be indispensable in aging process to form different flavors of tobacco leaves.

However, the current breeding methods for this strain primarily rely on natural screening and traditional mutagenesis. The limited availability of efficient genetic engineering tools, particularly recombination techniques, has hindered further advancements in its applications. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation to identify and characterize a recombinase, RecT, derived from a Bacillus phage. Remarkably, the recombinase exhibited a 10 5 -fold enhancement in the recombination efficiency of the strain. To facilitate genome editing, we developed a system based on the conditional expression of RecT using a rhamnose-inducible promoter (P rha ). The efficacy of this system was evaluated by deleting the amyL gene, which encodes an α-amylase. Our findings revealed that the induction time and concentration of rhamnose, along with the generation time of the strain, significantly influenced the editing efficiency. Optimal conditions for genome editing were determined as follows: the wild-type strain was initially transformed with the genome editing plasmid, followed by cultivation and induction with 1.5% rhamnose for 8 h. Subsequently, the strain was further cultured for an additional 24 h, equivalent to approximately three generations. Consequently, the recombination efficiency reached an impressive 16.67%. This study represents a significant advancement in enhancing the recombination efficiency of B. licheniformis through the utilization of a RecT-based recombination system. Moreover, it provides a highly effective genome editing tool for genetic engineering applications in this strain.",

CrRNAs with and without phosphorylated modification and different crRNA preparation methods are used to assess the effect on the detection system. After optimization, we detected as low as one copy of Salmonella DNA and drug resistance mutation parC S80I with the Salmonella DNA standard. For 94 clinical samples, this method also showed high sensitivity (100%, 95% CI: 84.98-100%) and specificity (98.48%, 95% CI: 90.73-99.92%) with less time (3 h) than plate culture (16 h) and conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing (over 16 h). Besides, one parC S80I mutant strain was detected, which is consistent with the result of DNA sequencing.

    "abstract": "In nature, terpene nucleosides are relatively rare, with 1-tuberculosinyladenosine (1-TbAd) being an exclusive feature of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). The convergence of nucleosides and terpene pathways in the Mtb complex appears to have emerged late in its evolutionary history. 1-TbAd (PDB ID: 3WQK) is a prominent chemical marker for Mtb and may contribute to its virulence-related properties when exported extracellularly. We gathered a comprehensive set of 270 phytochemicals from diverse Ayurvedic texts and treatment traditions. Subsequently, we conducted structure-based molecular docking analyses to identify compounds exhibiting the strongest binding affinity for 1-TbAd, highlighting their potential as drug candidates. These selected compounds were further subjected to an in-vitro growth inhibition assay against the reference strain Mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv. Among the candidates, Asiaticoside A (ASA) emerged as a promising candidate from the pool of 270 compounds. To assess the impact of ASA on 1-TbAd expression, we employed a PCR-based mRNA expression assay, revealing ASA's ability to downregulate 1-TbAd expression in extensively drug-resistant MTb strains. Remarkably, the conventional drug rifampin showed no such effectiveness in our experiments. We further conducted molecular dynamic simulations to explore the interaction between ASA and 1-TbAd in a cellular-like environment, confirming the stability of their interaction. Also, we predicted ASA's stability toward causing inducing the random mutations in the target gene. With this, we propose a novel target and its modulator to treat extensively drug-resistant MTB.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Facilitated purification of proteins, at a low cost and a short time, is one of the key steps in the industrial production of recombinant proteins. In the current study, polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA-NPs) are considered in the synthesis of magnetic beads for purifying recombinant proteins due to advantages such as biocompatibility/ biodegradability, easy synthesis, as well as the ability to directly chelate metal ions. They were synthesized in Tris buffer (pH: 8:5), then chelated with Fe 3+ (20 mg) and Ni 2+ ions at concentrations of 2, 3, 5, and 7 mg/ml. Prepared nanoparticles were characterized through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), dynamic light scattering (DLS), Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP), and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The size distribution of the particles was reported in the narrow range of 120–140 nm and 200 to 220 nm by the SEM image and DLS analysis, respectively. The chelation of ions on the surface of the nanoparticle was confirmed by the ICP technique with a magnetization of 35.42 emu/g. The highest adsorption rate of Ni 2+ ions to polydopamine was obtained at a ratio of 1.4. The SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis confirmed the purification of eGFP and Hsp40 by PDA/Fe 3+ /Ni 2+ at 26 and 40 kDa compared to the commercial nickel column. Moreover, the concentration of purified eGFP by PDA/Fe 3+ /Ni 2+ was reported 138.83 µg/ml by the fluorescent signals, which is almost equal to or more than the protein purified by commercial Ni-NTA column (108.28 µg/ ml). The stability of PDA/Fe 3+ /Ni 2+ has also been evaluated by ICP-OES for 10 days, and the result suggested that PDA magnetic beads were stable. Therefore, it can be concluded that PDA/Fe 3+ /Ni 2+ have the ability to purify recombinant proteins in one less step and shorter time.",

After a 24 h culture under the optimal conditions, the viable count reached 4.76 × 109 cfu/mL, with the degradation rates of ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) increased to 93.5%, 100%, 68.3%, 32.6%, and 85%, respectively. After optimizing the feeding strategy, the concentration of viable bacteria reached 5.80 × 109 cfu/mL. In the application effect verification experiment, the degradation rates of NH4+-N, TN, TP, and COD in the experimental group reached 96.69%, 75.18%, 73.82%, and 90.83%, respectively, showing a significant improvement compared to the results of the control group. The main components in the control group were Dokdonella, Brevundimonas, Alishewanella, Rhodobacter, Pseudoxanthomonas, and Thauera, whereas those in the experimental group were Dokdonella, Proteocatella, Rhodobacter, Dechlomonas, and Nitrospira. Proteocatella, Dechlomonas, and Nitrosra, which were unique to the experimental group, are common bacteria used for nitrogen and phosphorus removal. This explains the difference in the sewage treatment capacity between the two groups.

To obtain ω-TA variants with a higher activity and more favorable properties for industrial use, we modified critical amino acid residues either in the catalytic center or in a previously proposed signature motif critical for aromatic β-amino acid ω-TAs. Seventeen different variants of this enzyme were generated and their activity was examined with four β-amino acids and one γ-amino acid, and compared with the wildtype's activity. Among all variants, seven showed up to ninefold higher activity with at least one of the tested substrates. For most of these seven variants, the temperature optimum was even lower as in the wild type enzyme, with keeping a high temperature stability, making them more valuable for industrial purposes. Our results indicate that for the production of enantiomerically pure β-amino acids replacement of critical amino acid residues in the proposed signature motif of ω-TAs is a more effective strategy than modifying their catalytic center. Another finding was, that the proposed motif is not only suitable for aromatic amino acid ω-TAs, because some of the variants have a higher activity with β-alanine or β-leucine than with aromatic β-amino acids.",

Telomerase activity in most cells depends on the transcription control by the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). The introduction of an exogenous human TERT (hTERT) in cultured cells could enhance telomerase activity and elongate the lifespan of various cells. Telomere elongation mechanisms vary between insects and are complex and unusual. Whether the use of exogenous hTERT can immortalize primary insect cells remains to be investigated. In this study, we used a recombinant virus expressing hTERT to infect primary cultured cells of Periplaneta americana and evaluated its effects on insect cell immortalization. We found that hTERT was successfully expressed and promoted the growth of P. americana cells, shortening their doubling time. This was due to the ability of hTERT to increase the activity of telomerase in P. americana cells, thus prolonging the telomeres. Our study lays the foundation for understanding the mechanisms of telomere elongation in P. americana , and suggests that the introduction of hTERT into insect cells could be an efficient way to establish certain insect cell lines.",

In order to improve the conjugation transfer of N. gerenzanensis, the crucial factors affecting conjugal transfer were evaluated, including agar medium, mycelial state, donor-recipient ratio, magnesium ion concentration, and antibiotic coverage time firstly. Additionally, γ-butyrolactone (GBL) for quorum sensing (QS) and antibiotics targeting bacterial walls were applied to evaluate their effects on conjugation transfer. As a result, the optimal conditions of 5%TSB of liquid medium, 24 h of the period time, V0.1 of agar medium, 30 mM of magnesium ion, the ratio 10:1 of donor-to-recipient, and 27 h of the overlaying time of antibiotic were determined. Furthermore, the results showed that autoinducer GBL and GPA teicoplanin had a synergetic effect on the conjugation transfer of N. gerenzanensis at a working concentration of 60 µM and 0.5 µg mL-1, respectively.

    "abstract": "Abstract Most antibiotics now used in clinical practice are cephalosporins. Acremonium (A.) chrysogenum W42-I is an intermediate strain out of W42 strain improvement program whose productivity is above that of the wild-type strain to produce the broad-spectrum antibacterial cephalosporin C (CPC). As a result, fermentation process optimization is considered because it offers the ideal environment for strains to reach their full potential. Our research aimed to combine a rational design to regulate the fermentation process environment and culture media as well as to develop mutants with high productivity. Different media were tested to obtain maximum CPC production. To maximize the production of CPC, some environmental parameters were experimentally optimized via the Box-Behnken design used for response surface methodology (RSM). There were 17 tests conducted, and each experiment's reaction was recorded. Improvement of the CPC production was further achieved via mutagenesis using gamma radiation. Results revealed that a pH of 4, an incubation period of 4 days, and an inoculum size of 1% v/v using the optimized media (CPC2) were the optimum conditions for enhancing the CPC production by 4.43-fold. In addition, gamma irradiation further enhanced production to reach 3.46-fold using an optimum dose of 2 KGy. In conclusion, in comparison to initial production levels, CPC production increased 4.43-fold because of nutritional and environmental optimization. The mutant AC8 demonstrated a roughly 3.46-fold increase in activity against its parent type. Moreover, subsequent AC8 mutant culture demonstrated excellent genetic stability.",

This experiment aimed to investigate how dietary KF improves reproductive performance of obese sows. Here, 60 sows were assigned into three groups according to their backfat thickness: normal backfat sows fed with control diet (CON-N), high backfat sows fed with control diet (CON-H) and high backfat sows fed with KF inclusion diet (KF-H). The characteristics of sows and piglets were recorded. Next, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was performed on female mice, followed by recording the characteristics of female mice. The results showed that compared with CON-H group, KF-H group showed downtrend in stillbirth rate (P = 0.07), an increase in placental efficiency (P < 0.01) and average piglet weight (P < 0.01); coupled with a decrease in the values of homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (P < 0.01); as well as an increase in placental vascular density and protein expression of angiogenesis markers (P < 0.01). As expected, sows fed KF diets had improved abundance and diversity of gut microbiota. More importantly, compared with CON-H(FMT) group, KF-H(FMT) group showed improvement in reproductive performance and insulin sensitivity (P < 0.05), as well as an increase in placental labyrinth zone and protein expression of angiogenesis markers (P < 0.05). Furthermore, we found a content increase (P < 0.05) of SCFAs in both KF-H group sow and KF-H (FMT) group mice. Overall, KF supplementation could alleviate insulin resistance, promote placental angiogenesis, and ultimately improve the reproductive performance of sows via gut microbiota remodeling.",

To meet the demands for considerable amount of highly pure BLIP, this study aimed at developing an efficient expression system in eukaryotic Pichia pastoris (a methylotrophic yeast) for production of BLIP. With methanol induction, recombinant BLIP was overexpressed in P. pastoris X-33 and secreted into the culture medium. A high yield of ~ 300 mg/L culture secretory BLIP recovered from the culture supernatant without purification was found to be > 90% purity. The recombinant BLIP was fully active and showed an inhibition constant (Ki) for TEM-1 β-lactamase (0.55 ± 0.07 nM) comparable to that of the native S. clavuligerus-expressed BLIP (0.5 nM). Yeast-produced BLIP in combination with ampicillin effectively inhibited the growth of β-lactamase-producing Gram-positive Bacillus. Our approach of expressing secretory BLIP in P. pastoris gave 71- to 1200-fold more BLIP with high purity than the other conventional methods, allowing efficient production of large amount of highly pure BLIP, which merits fundamental science studies, drug development and biotechnological applications.",

In this study, we used microbial enrichment of bio-filters to assess their effect on water quality. Profiles of ammonia-oxidizing bacterial communities generated using nested PCR methods and DGGE were used to assess the expression of 16S rRNA genes using DNA sequencing. Five dominant ammonia-oxidizing bacterial strains-clones; KB.13, KB.15, KB.16, KB.17 and KB.18-were isolated and identified by phylogenetic analysis as environmental samples closely related to genera Methylobacillus, Stanieria, Nitrosomonas, and Heliorestis. The methyl ammonia-oxidizing microbes thereby found suggest a biochemical pathway involving electron donors and carbon sources, and all strains were functional in freshwater aquaculture systems. Environmental parameters including TN (2.69-20.43); COD (9.34-31.47); NH4+-N (0.44-11.78); NO2-N (0.00-3.67); NO3-N (0.05-1.82), mg/L and DO (1.47-10.31 µg/L) assessed varied in the ranges in the different tanks. Principal component analysis revealed that these water quality parameters significantly influenced the ammonia oxidizing microbial community composition. Temperature rises to about 40 °C significantly affected environmental characteristics-especially DO, TN and NH4+-N-and directly or indirectly affected the microbial communities. Although the nested PCR design was preferred due to its high sensitivity for amplifying specific DNA regions, a more concise method is recommended, as an equimolar mixture of degenerate PCR primer pairs, CTO189f-GC and CTO654r, never amplified only 16S rRNA of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria.",

However, different Lhc protein carries out distinct function in photosynthesis. For now, roles of many Lhc proteins in light acclimation are largely unknown. Here, function of Lhcx3 in marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum was examined by using reverse genetic technologies. The overexpression of Lhcx3 led to increased diadinoxanthin + diatoxanthin content and elevated non-photochemical fluorescence quenching (NPQ) while knockdown of Lhcx3 reduced NPQ level. In addition, the expression of Lhcx3 could be induced by blue light but not by red light. After addition of the photosynthetic inhibitor, upregulation of Lhcx3 transcript in high light could be inhibited by NH4Cl, but not by DCMU (3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-l,l-dim ethylurea). In contrast, DCMU addition increased expression of Lhcx3 in high light. In combination with changes of NPQ after addition of inhibitor, we concluded that the Lhcx3 played key roles in high light acclimation of diatoms. This finding will provide new clues for genetic improvement of P. tricornutum with an aim to cultivate new strains with high growth rate.",

    "abstract": "Although high levels of staphylococcal phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) in clinical methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been shown to correlate with bacterial virulence, the PSMs expression in foodborne Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), as well as its association with staphylococcal food poisoning (SFP) was not yet clear. We collected a panel of 350 foodborne and 127 clinic-derived S. aureus strains and compared their PSMs expression. Overall, foodborne strains exhibited higher PSMs than clinical isolates, indicating a potential pathological significance of PSMs in staphylococcal food contamination. Furthermore, PSMs expression and staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) levels in relation to antibiotic sensitive and resistant strains were analysed. While the co-expression of PSMs and SEs was confirmed, one typical foodborne strain simultaneously yielding PSMs, SEB and SED was selected. By comparing this wildtype strain to a series of gene-deficient mutants, we concluded that PSMs and SEs expressions both relied on staphylococcal accessory regulator A initiation in the early stage of accessory gene regulator control, yet their succedent regulations differentiated to RNAIII-dependent and independent, respectively. These data provided preliminary insight into PSMs and SEs expression in foodborne S. aureus, and may guide the further studies on PSMs effects in SFP.",

In this paper, the strain ZJUTB06-99 was domesticated with acrylonitrile-containing medium and its decyanidation and denitrification in simulated acrylonitrile wastewater were studied. The intermediate product of acrylonitrile in degradation process was identified through gas chromatography–mass spectrometer, as well as the biodegradation pathway of acrylonitrile in wastewater was deduced tentatively. The kinetics equation of biodegradation of acrylonitrile was lnC = − 0.1784t + 5.3349, with the degradation half-life of acrylonitrile in wastewater by 3.885 h. The results of this study showed that the optimum levels of temperature, pH and bacteria concentration to attain the maximum biodegradation were obtained as 30 °C, 6 and 100 g/L, respectively. The disadvantages of the biodegradation with this strain and its possible enhanced method to degrade acrylonitrile in wastewater were also discussed.",

In this study, we explored the possibility of further increasing the efficiency of the culture by repeatedly reusing cells and the system for biodegradation. Three different recycling strategies were adopted. In reuse of cells plus CPS, cells were reused for 3 times while maintaining high degradation rates (> 90%). Thereafter, the accumulation of metabolites in the dilute phase resulted in a decrease in cell viability. This inhibition was avoided in recycling the cells plus coacervate phase by replacing the dilute phase with fresh Medium. However, due to the slow adaptation of the cells to the new degradation environment and the reduction in the volume of the coacervate phase, the cells were only reused twice and their activity decreased. However, the same long degradation cycle (5 days) as the reuse of cells plus coacervate phase reduced the overall degradation efficiency of phenanthrene. Finally, a combined strategy of 3 times of cells plus CPS reuse and individual cells reuse once was employed and run for two cycles. 3 rounds of reuse of cells plus CPS improved cells utilization and phenanthrene degradation efficiency. Then, the subsequent round of reuse of cells alone relieved the effect of increasing metabolites on cell viability. This study provides a potential application for reusing cells to continuously degrade phenanthrene in soil and water in CPS.",

The understanding of mycelial processes is important to optimize industrial processes such as fermentation and contributes to the fight against pathogenic fungi. This brief study combines TLS with digital image analysis. The TLS system was adapted to get information related to the adherence and growth dynamics of filamentous fungi. This approach was used earlier to distinguish among subphases of bacterial and fungal infections of mammal cells by detecting Mycoplasma infection in cell cultures causing serious damages in cell cultures. We describe changes in adherence, germination of spores, and hyphal growth of A. fumigatus, taking place in the absence and presence of amphotericin B (AMB) and voriconazole (VRC). These growth parameters were measured by TLS in CO2 incubator under physiological Photomicrography by TLS and extended for a longer period of time up to several weeks combined with image analysis represents a comfortable and reliable means to characterize the growth dynamism of A. fumigatus. The most important observation of medical importance related to the pathomechanism of VRC was that it did not adhere to conidiospores, i.e. that it did not contribute to the attachment of spores to the growth surface, and did not prevent germination but delayed hypha protrusion and elongation. In contrast AMB adhered to conidia, inhibited germination, hypha elongation and branching. It was concluded that AMB was efficient against the therapy of growth but not against the prevention of fungal infection.",

Mechanisms involving miRs induced apoptosis still needs to be investigated. In the present work we developed a rat model of SCI, followed by microarray analysis for expression of miRs at various time points after SCI. The locomotor activity was assessed by Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan score, lesion volume was analyzed by cresyl violet staining and TUNEL staining for extent of apoptosis at various time points of post SCI. Numbers of miRs were altered after 2 weeks of SCI among which miR-466c-3p was the most significantly down-regulated. Transfection with miR-466c-3p mimics caused overexpression of miR-466c-3p, also improvement in functional recovery, decrease in apoptosis of neuronal cells and lesion size was observed in SCI rats. The Luciferase assay suggested that miR-466c-3p suppressed the expression of Bcl-2 (apoptosis regulator). It was also evidenced that upon restoring the levels of Bcl-2 with the help of pc-DNA3-Bcl-2 halted the attenuating action of miR-466c-3p in hydrogen peroxide exposed N9 microglia cells. The findings suggested that miR-466c-3p may inhibit mitochondrial apoptotic pathway via blocking Bcl-2 and cleaved capase-9/-3in rats after SCI. Altogether, the results suggested that miR-466c-3p may exert attenuating effect on functional recovery and inhibit the apoptosis of neuronal cells via halting the mitochondrial apoptosis cascade in SCI rats indicating that miR-466c-3p can be attractive therapeutic candidate in treating SCI.",

Cystatin secreted by parasites can regulate the immune response of host to facilitate parasite's survival. In this study, the secretory TK-cystatin gene, encoding a protein of 120 amino acid residues (13.65 kDa), was cloned from T. kitauei genome. Phylogenetic analysis showed that TK-cystatin gene is closely related to the cystatin-A from Hydra vulgaris. Multiple sequence alignment revealed that TK-cystatin had three conserved motifs: N-terminal G19G20, Q73VVAG77, and C-terminal L102P103. Molecular docking between TK-cystatin and three cysteine proteases showed a lower binding energy (- 13 KJ/mol) with cathepsin L whereas a higher binding energy (- 8.6 KJ/mol) with cathepsin B. TK-cystatin gene was expressed in Escherichia coli. Activity assays revealed that TK-cystatin has stronger inhibitory activity on endopeptidases (papain and cathepsin L) and weaker inhibitory activity on exopeptidase (cathepsin B). TK-cystatin was stable under the condition of acidity or alkalinity or below 57 °C. This study laid a foundation for the design and development of the anti-T. kitauei vaccine in carp culture in the future.",

The results of feeding mice recombinant L. plantarum showed that the levels of serum IgG and mucosal secreted IgA (SIgA), the number of CD4 and CD8 T cells, and the expression of IFN-γ in CD4 and CD8 T cells increased significantly, and lymphocyte proliferation occurred under stimulation with the ASFV p54 protein. Our data lay a foundation for the development of oral vaccines against ASFV in the future.",

To date, some engineered and non-engineered microbes, such as Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus buchneri, and Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum, have been used to produce 1,2-PDO. In this study, we demonstrated the production of R- and S-1,2-PDO using engineered Lactococcus lactis. The L- and D-lactic acid-producing L. lactis strains NZ9000 and AH1 were transformed with the plasmid pNZ8048-ppy harboring pct, pduP, and yahK genes for 1,2-PDO biosynthesis, resulting in L. lactis LL1 and LL2, respectively. These engineered L. lactis produced S- and R-1,2-PDO at concentrations of 0.69 and 0.50 g/L with 94.4 and 78.0% ee optical purities, respectively, from 1% glucose after 72 h of cultivation. Both 1% mannitol and 1% gluconate were added instead of glucose to the culture of L. lactis LL1 to supply NADH and NADPH to the 1,2-PDO production pathway, resulting in 75% enhancement of S-1,2-PDO production. Production of S-1,2-PDO from 5% mannitol and 5% gluconate was demonstrated using L. lactis LL1 with a pH-stat approach. This resulted in S-1,2-PDO production at a concentration of 1.88 g/L after 96 h of cultivation. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the production of R- and S-1,2-PDO using engineered lactic acid bacteria.",

In vivo, the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and metal ions leads to the formation of free hydroxyl radicals, which have an increased bactericidal activity. This study examined whether there is an additive antimicrobial effect of NCT combined with hydrogen peroxide. Additionally, it was tested if the additive effect is based on the formation of free radicals. We found by luminometry that, in the presence of H2O2, NCT caused a slow and long-lasting production of singlet oxygen in contrast to HOCl, where this burst occurred instantaneously. Both NCT and hydrogen peroxide (1.0 and 0.1%) demonstrated bactericidal and fungicidal activity. At pH 7.1 and 37 °C, hydrogen peroxide (1%, 294 mM) showed a stronger bactericidal and particularly fungicidal activity than NCT (1%, 55 mM), whereas at pH 4.0 and also in the presence of 5.0% peptone NCT revealed a stronger bactericidal activity. A combination of NCT and hydrogen peroxide led to an increased bactericidal but no increased fungicidal activity compared to both substances alone. The additive effect against bacteria was not removed in the presence of the radical scavengers NaN3, DMSO, or peptone. As a conclusion, NCT and hydrogen peroxide used concurrently interact additive against a range of microorganisms. However, the results of this study suggest that the additive effect of NCT combined with hydrogen peroxide is rather not based on the formation of free radicals.",

Therefore, β-glycosidase from Caldicellulosiruptor bescii (CB-bgl), which has a strong α-L-arabinopyranosidase activity, was used along with DT-bgl. The volumetric and specific productivities of the two-enzyme system for APPD using ginseng root extract were 38.4- and 38.7-fold higher, respectively, than those of β-glycosidase from Pyrococcus furiosus, which had the highest volumetric productivity previously reported, at the same enzyme and substrate concentrations. Thus, DT-bgl combined with CB-bgl completely converted PPD-type ginsenosides to APPD with the highest volumetric and specific productivities reported thus far.",

Production of FCdiene using a genetically modified Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been previously demonstrated with batch cultivations with a product concentration up to 10 mg/L. However, it is widely known that fed-batch processes can significantly improve product titer in yeast fermentations. This study focuses on the establishment of fed-batch fermentation for FCdiene production because fed-batch cultivations using FeedBeads® indicated that limiting glucose supply could increase yields of biomass (1.07 gCDW/gGlucose instead of 0.20 gCDW/gGlucose) and FCdiene (21.54 mgFCdiene/gGlucose instead of 9.74 mgFCdiene/gGlucose) in shake flask scale and may have implications for larger scale processes. We implemented a new exponential glucose feed profile in a 1.8 L stirred tank reactor. This reduced overfeeding and the consequent, ethanol production. As a result improvements in cell concentrations up to 246% could be achieved and FCdiene yield increased up to 2.8X in the first 28 h. FCdiene concentration reached 161 mg/L and 320 mg/L at 44 h. Fed-batch and batch mode were combined to examine dynamics of bi-modal cultivation where a fed-batch phase was used for biomass production and a batch phase used for FCdiene production potentially supported by ethanol consumption as reported on production of betulinic acid. The present study highlights the potential of process development improvements which increase high-value heterologous diterpene yields from S. cerevisiae.",

However, the underlying mechanism of SEB-induced acute liver injury (ALI) remains to be further explored. In our study, we explored the therapeutic effectiveness of berberine (BBR), a natural isoquinoline alkaloid, in the SEB-induced ALI. In our study, we found that injection of SEB into d-galactosamine (d-gal)-sensitized mice induced ALI, as demonstrated by an increase of levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, massive infiltration of immune cells into the liver, and pro-inflammatory cytokine release. However, intragastric administration of BBR attenuated SEB-induced ALI in mice. Meanwhile, we discovered that BBR treatment suppressed activation of splenocytes and pro-inflammatory cytokine release in SEB-stimulated splenocytes. Moreover, mechanistic analyses demonstrated that BBR was effective at inhibiting the expression of class I HDAC, but not class II, in SEB-stimulated splenocytes. Furthermore, trichostatin A, a standard HDAC inhibitor, alleviated activation of splenocytes and pro-inflammatory cytokine release in SEB-stimulated splenocytes. Taken together, we inferred from these results that BBR attenuated SEB-mediated ALI through repressing the class I HDAC enzyme, suggesting that BBR may constitute a novel therapeutic modality to prevent SEB-mediated inflammation and ALI.",

Our prior studies found that tannase from Lactobacillus plantarum (LP-tan) performed a higher esterase activity, while the tannase from Streptomyces sviceus (SS-tan) performed a higher depsidase activity; but the molecular mechanism is not elucidated. Based on the crystal structure of LP-tan and the amino acid sequences alignment between LP-tan and SS-tan, we found that the sandwich structure formed by Ile206-substrate-Pro356 in LP-tan was replaced with Ile253-substrate-Gly384 in SS-tan, and the flap domain (amino acids: 225–247) formed in LP-tan was missed in SS-tan, while a flap-like domain (amino acids: 93–143) was found in SS-tan. In this study, we investigated the functional role of sandwich structure and the flap (flap-like) domain in the substrate specificity of tannase. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to disrupt the sandwich structure in LP-tan (P356G) and rebuilt it in SS-tan (G384P). The flap in LP-tan and the flap-like domain in SS-tan were deleted to construct the new variants. The activity assay results showed that the sandwich and the flap domain can help to catalytic the ester bonds, while the flap-like domain in SS-tan mainly worked on the depside bonds. Enzymatic characterization and kinetics data showed that the sandwich and the flap domain can help to catalytic the ester bonds, while the flap-like domain in SS-tan may worked on the depside bonds.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella is a pathogenic bacterium contributing to food poisoning and acute infectious intestinal disease. The traditional standard detection method is based on the principle of liquid phase enrichment and has a low sensitivity on targeted bacteria. We previously developed a visual immunosensor technique for efficient detection and isolation of Salmonella by applying fluorescent nanobioprobes on a specially-designed cellulose-based swab. In this study, a whole-sample solid-phase enrichment assay (WSEA) was established by optimization of the enrichment medium using response surface methodology (RSM), a powerful statistical tool for regression analysis. The optimal formula was determined as: 0.60% polyvalent poly peptone, 0.40% buffered peptone water, 0.09% ferric citrate amine, 0.24% sodium hyposulfite, 0.035% cystine, 0.01 µg mL-1 super absorbing polymer, 0.011% sodium deoxycholate, 15.00 µg mL-1 ethyl green and 30.00 µg mL-1 sodium selenite. Using this formula, Salmonella was visualized with naked eyes by relying on the indication of black spots formed on the swab. The analytic sensitivity of the assay was determined as 101 cells mL-1 with a concentration of interfering bacteria (Escherichia coli) at 105 cells mL-1. This optimized formula was confirmed with 4006 patients' fecal samples, in which the positive rate was 0.42% by the conventional culture-based method and 2.12% by WSEA. The optimized formulation on solid phase enrichment by RSM allows relatively quick, low-cost, and large-scale detection of Salmonella, and could be used in grassroots medical institutions.",

To accomplish high-throughput production of various nanobodies, utilization of microbes is an attractive option.

We designed chimeric nanobodies with complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) against green fluorescent protein (GFP) or cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) based on the scaffold of GFP-nanobody. FLAG-tagged chimeric nanobodies were prepared by one-step cloning and produced using P. pastoris. Secreted chimeric nanobodies were purified from the culture media of P. pastoris transformants. Relative binding abilities of purified chimeric nanobodies to GFP and CD4 was tested using a BIACORE T-200. P. pastoris successfully produced a high yield of FLAG-tagged chimeric nanobodies. FLAG-tagged GFP- and CD4-nanobodies were shown to specifically bind to GFP and CD4, respectively. Chimeric nanobodies, in which the CDR2 or 3 of GFP-nanobody was replaced with CDRs of CD4-nanobody, acquired the ability to bind to CD4 without binding to GFP. These results demonstrate successful production of functional chimeric nanobodies using P. pastoris. These results also suggest that swapping of CDRs, especially CDRs 2 or 3, potentially enables a novel method of creating nanobodies.",

However, the selection basis of exogenous lipids and their effects on intracellular lipids are not very clear. In this study, five plant oils with different fatty acid compositions were selected to investigate their effects on lycopene production, fatty acid composition and the desaturation degree of intracellular lipids. Among the oils, soybean oil, with a fatty acid composition similar to that of mycelium, exhibited the best stimulating effect on lycopene formation (improvement of 82.1%). The plant oils enhanced the total content of intracellular lipids and the desaturation degree of reserve lipids due to the alteration of fatty acid composition, especially in neutral lipids. Lycopene production was increased with the improved desaturation degree of intracellular lipids, which may be attributed to the enhancement of storage capacity for lycopene in storage lipid, thus reducing the feedback regulation of free lycopene. In addition, the increase of the desaturation degree of reserve lipids through temperature-changing fermentation also enhanced lycopene production. The present study could serve as a basis for a better understanding of the relationship between the fatty acid composition of reserve lipids and lycopene production.",

Microbial utilization of the resulting oligosaccharides is one potential route of adding value to the depolymerized biomass.

Here, we investigate utilization of cellulose subjected to mechanocatalytic depolymerization, using ethanologenic Escherichia coli as a model fermentation organism. The mechanocatalytic oligosaccharides supported ethanol titers similar to those observed when glucose was provided at comparable concentrations. Tracking of the various oligomers, using maltose (alpha-1,4) and cellobiose (beta-1,4) oligomers as representative standards of the orientation, but not linkage, of the glycosidic bond, suggests that the malto-like-oligomers are more readily utilized than cello-like-oligomers, consistent with poor growth with cellotetraose or cellopentaose as sole carbon source. Thus, mechanocatalytic oligosaccharides are a promising substrate for cell factories, and microbial utilization of these sugars could possibly be improved by addressing utilization of cello-like oligomers.",

Protection of the product against microbial contamination is therefore focused on the packaging. This has prompted the emergence of a highly diverse array of so-called \"protective\", \"overprotective\", and \"barrier\" packaging. However, these designations are not normalized and the choice of the right packaging adapted to each cosmetic product is still essentially empirical, hazardous, and time consuming. The Cosmetic Valleys cluster has launched a commission to define a complete and experimentally-validated method to classify the level of protection of cosmetic packaging against microbial contamination. As reported herein, this required the development a specific bacteriostatic medium that can be used for 7 days and an in vitro procedure that reproduces in-use contamination and consumer practices. Based on tests performed on over 800 packages of different origin and performance characteristics, we propose a classification, divided into six grades, to differentiate the protective efficiency of cosmetic packaging.

    "abstract": "Abstract Rhodomyrtone has been recently demonstrated to possess a novel antibiotic mechanism of action against Gram-positive bacteria which involved the multiple targets, resulting in the interference of several bacterial biological processes including the cell division. The present study aims to closely look at the downstream effect of rhodomyrtone treatment on nucleoid segregation in Streptococcus suis , an important zoonotic pathogen. The minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values of rhodomyrtone against the recombinant S. suis ParB-GFP, a nucleoid segregation reporter strain, were 0.5 and 1 µg/ml, respectively, which were equivalent to the potency of vancomycin. Using the fluorescence live-cell imaging, we demonstrated that rhodomyrtone at 2× MIC caused incomplete nucleoid segregation and septum misplacement, leading to the generation of anucleated cells. FtsZ immune-staining of rhodomyrtone-treated S. suis for 30 min revealed that the large amount of FtsZ was trapped in the region of high fluidity membrane and appeared to be able to polymerize to form a complete Z-ring. However, the Z-ring was shifted away from the midcell. Transmission electron microscopy further confirmed the disruption of nucleoid segregation and septum misplacement at 120 min following the rhodomyrtone treatment. Asymmetric septum formation resulted in either generation of minicells without nucleoid, septum formed over incomplete segregated nucleoid (guillotine effect), or formation of multi-constriction of Z-ring within a single cell. This finding spotlights on antibacterial mechanism of rhodomyrtone involves the early stage in bacterial cell division process.",

Anguilla marmorata (eel) was listed in the Vietnam Red Data Book 2007 with a description of Vulnerability. This study used a barcode technique to analyze molecular characteristics and build genetic plants based on the cytochrome c oxidase I gene segment isolated from the mitochondrial genome of 48 individuals of A. marmorata collected in five different ecological regions of Thua Thien Hue, Vietnam. The isolated the cytochrome c oxidase I sequence has a length of 843 nucleotides, four base nucleotides of 30.03% Thymine, 25.15% Cytosine, 27.49% Adenine, and 17.43% Guanine. The percentage of Guanine + Cytosine content (42.58%) is acceptable, lower than the Adenine + Thymine content. The replacement capacity of Adenine and Guanine is 22.45% highest, the ratio between Thymine and Guanine; Cytosine and Guanine are the lowest at 2.72%. The establishment of genetically modified plants has shown the high genetic similarity of individuals in eel populations in Thua Thien Hue. The population of Anguilla marmorata eels in Thua Thien Hue, Vietnam is divided into two separate groups that are guided by the migration process and specific ecological. This is particularly important in building strategies to conserve and develop the gene for eel in Vietnam and Thua Thien Hue.",

The objective of this study was to investigate the microbial ecology of reformulated yoghurt, which was produced using bi-enzymatic modification of lactose to increase its sweetness by a factor of 2-3. Ultimately, this reformulation strategy could reduce the amount of added sugar needed for equal sweetness of the end product. The bi-enzymatic modification relied on utilisation of a β-galactosidase enzyme to convert the milk sugar lactose to galactose and glucose, followed by the enzymatic conversion of the glucose moiety to fructose using a glucose isomerase. The microbial ecology of reformulated yoghurt produced with two mixed starter culture preparations containing either Streptococcus (S.) thermophilus and Lactobacillus (Lb.) delbrueckii or S. thermophilus, Lb. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium sp. strains, was analysed during fermentation and cool storage using 16S rRNA based metagenomics. None of the yoghurt samples showed a significant difference in microbial composition between sweetness-enhanced and regular milk at all sampling time points during manufacture and storage of yoghurt. However, a significant difference between the microbiota of inoculated milk before and after fermentation was observed. In both types of yoghurt, the starter culture genera dominated the microbial ecology at the end of fermentation as expected, reducing the possibility of growth of potentially pathogenic or spoilage bacteria possibly resulting from a changed carbohydrate spectrum.",

Currently, molecular biotechnology methods, such as gene overexpression, have been widely used to increase the production of metabolites. However, AQ biosynthetic genes and enzymes are poorly understood. In this study, an integrated study coupling RNA-Seq and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) were used to identify AQ synthesis-related genes and enzymes in Antrodia camphorata during coenzyme Q0-induced fermentation (FM). The upregulated genes related to acetyl-CoA synthesis indicated that acetyl-CoA enters the mevalonate pathway to form the farnesyl tail precursor of AQ. The metE gene for an enzyme with methyl transfer activity provided sufficient methyl groups for AQ structure formation. The CoQ2 and ubiA genes encode p-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyl transferase, linking coenzyme Q0 and the polyisoprene side chain to form coenzyme Q3. NADH is transformed into NAD+ and releases two electrons, which may be beneficial for the conversion of coenzyme Q3 to AQ. Understanding the biosynthetic genes and enzymes of AQ is important for improving its production by genetic means in the future.",

In this study we developed a SYBR-qPCR to target the poultry homolog of the hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS) gene as an EIC for avian species. The avian HMBS-based qPCR was very sensitive, detecting one HMBS gene copy in a 20 µL reaction, and is highly specific for avian species. It amplified DNA from 11 organs and tissues of chickens showing it can be used as an EIC on a large variety of samples. The application of the established EIC on clinically and experimentally infected samples demonstrated that false negativity and result variations could result from samples being collected using different operators, techniques, preservatives, and storage times. The high sensitivity and specificity of the avian HMBS-based qPCR, its ability to quantify DNAs extracted from a wide range of tissues and poultry species along with its usefulness in reducing false negativity in PCR results associated with inadequate sampling and storage degradation makes it an ideal EIC for poultry DNA and RNA PCR diagnostics. The study also highlights the importance of appropriate sampling and storage of samples in ensuring accuracy of molecular diagnostic testing.",

Many serological tests have been developed to detect the disease; one of the most widely used is the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), due to its advantages, which include acceptable cost-effectiveness, applicability, sensitivity and specificity. ELISA formulations using recombinant proteins can exhibit significant sensitivity and specificity when using a single purified antigen. DTxR, Trx, TrxR, LexA, SodC, SpaC, NanH, and PknG recombinant proteins can be considered target proteins for ELISA development due to its extracellular or on the cell surface location, which allows a better recognition by the immune system. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the antigenic reactivity of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis recombinant proteins in goat and sheep serum. Of eight proteins evaluated, rSodC was selected for validation assays with small ruminant serum samples from the semiarid region of the state of Bahia, Brazil. Validation assays with goat serum samples showed that ELISA-rSodC presented sensitivity and specificity of 96% and 94%, respectively. Validation assays with sheep serum showed that ELISA-rSodC exhibited sensitivity and specificity of 95% and 98%, respectively. Analysis of 756 field serum samples showed that rSodC identified 95 positive samples (23%) in goats and 75 positive samples (21%) in sheep. The ELISA with recombinant SodC protein developed in this study discriminated positive and negative serum samples with high levels of sensitivity and specificity. This formulation is promising for epidemiological surveys and CL control programs.Trial registration AEC No 4958051018. 12/18/2018, retrospectively registered.",

Serratia fonticola is the bacterial species most frequently confused with Salmonella spp. in traditional identification methods based on biochemical characteristics, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive, and thus unsuitable for daily inspection and quarantine work. In this study, we established a duplex real-time qPCR method with invA- and gyrB-specific primers and probes corresponding to Salmonella spp. and S. fonticola. The method could simultaneously detect both pathogens in imported feedstuffs, with a minimum limit of detection for Salmonella spp. and S. fonticola of 197 copies/μL and 145 copies/μL, respectively (correlation coefficient R2 = 0.999 in both cases). The amplification efficiency for Salmonella spp. and S. fonticola was 98.346% and 96.49%, respectively. Detection of fishmeal was consistent with method GB/T 13091-2018, and all seven artificially contaminated imported feed samples were positively identified. Thus, the developed duplex real-time qPCR assay displays high specificity and sensitivity, and can be used for the rapid and accurate detection of genomic DNA from Salmonella spp. and S. fonticola within hours. This represents a significant improvement in the efficiency of detection of both pathogens in imported feedstuffs.",

When provided with corn syrup and vitamin B12 (0.03 mol B12 per mol CF), DHM-1 grew and biodegraded up to 2,000 mg/L of CF in 180 days, with only minor transient accumulation of dichloromethane and chloromethane. CT (15 mg/L) and CFC-11 (25 mg/L) were also biodegraded without significant accumulation of halomethane daughter products. The rate of CF biodegradation followed a Michaelis-Menten-like pattern with respect to the B12 concentration; one-half the maximum rate (66 mg CF/L/d) occurred at 0.005 mol B12 per mol CF. DHM-1 was able to biodegrade 500 mg/L of CF at an inoculum level as low as 10(-8) mg protein/L. The highest rate of CF biodegradation occurred at pH 7.7; activity decreased substantially below pH 6.0. DHM-1 biodegraded mixtures of CT, CFC-11, and CF, although CFC-11 inhibited CF biodegradation. Evidence for compete defluorination of CFC-11 was obtained based on a fluoride mass balance. Overall, the results suggest that DHM-1 may be effective for bioaugmentation in source zones contaminated with thousands of milligrams per liter of CF and tens of milligrams per liter of CT and CFC-11.",

The evaluation of four different surface types, including thin titanium films, silicon wafers, polystyrene cell culture dishes and dragonfly wings confirmed that this technique is particularly effective for the visualization of conductive surfaces such as metallic titanium. The technique is particularly useful for visualizing surfaces that cannot be easily analyzed using AFM. The speed and ease with which electron micrographs can be recorded, combined with a relatively simple process for generating displacement maps, make this technique useful for the assessment of the surface topography of biomaterials.",

The present work represents the first time that an inducible flocculation phenotype has been generated in a non flocculent strain of Kluyveromyces marxianus . This was accomplished by expressing Saccharomyces cerevisiae FLO5 gene in K. marxianus CECT 11769 strain. The FLO 5 gene was placed under the control of an EPG promoter, not repressed by glucose and induced by anoxia. Our experimental approach successfully generated two novel K. marxianus flocculent phenotypes: one inducible and one constitutive. The constitutive phenotype originated from deletions in the FLO5 promoter region, indicating the existence of putative upstream repressor site involved in oxygen regulation of the EPG1 promoter. The novel strains here generated had a unique set of characteristics that provided an advantage, over the wild-type strain, for the industrial co-production of ethanol and polygalacturonase.",

Using bacterial cells as reporter strains represents an advantage for detecting pollutants present in soil or water samples. Here, an Escherichia coli reporter strain expressing a chromoprotein capable of interacting with soil or water samples and responding to DNA damaging compounds is validated. The reporter strain generates a qualitative signal and is based on the expression of the coral chromoprotein AmilCP under the control of the recA promoter. This strain can be used simply by applying soil or water samples directly and rendering activation upon DNA damage. This reporter strain responds to agents that damage DNA (with an apparent detection limit of 1 µg of mitomycin C) without observable response to membrane integrity damage, protein folding or oxidative stress generating agents, in the latter case, DNA damage was observed. The developed reporter strain reported here is effective for the detection of DNA damaging agents present in soils samples. In a proof-of-concept analysis using soil containing chromium, showing activation at 15.56 mg/L of Cr(VI) present in soil and leached samples and is consistent with Cr(III) toxicity at high concentrations (130 µg). Our findings suggest that chromogenic reporter strains can be applied for simple screening, thus reducing the number of samples requiring analytical techniques.",

Twenty-four female water buffaloes were randomly divided into four groups and fed with 0, 0.11, 0.22, 044 g sodium nitrate per kg body weight diets, respectively. Results showed that the concentration of acetate, propionate, butyrate and total VFA in all sodium nitrate-adapted water buffaloes were greater than the control group (P < 0.05).

Compared to the control group, the archaea richness (ace and chao1) and diversity (Shannon index) indices were increased by nitrate supplementation (P < 0.05).

There was a tendency for Methanobrevibacter to decrease in the sodium nitrate group (P = 0.091). Comparisons of archaea communities by PCoA analysis showed significant separation between the control group and nitrate treatments (P = 0.025). It was concluded that added 0.11-0.44 g sodium nitrate/kg of body weight increased the rumen VFA production and archaeal diversity of water buffaloes but had no detrimental effect on milk yield or composition, fatty acids profile, rumen methanogen or Butyrivibrio group population related to biohydrogenation.",

    "abstract": "Small-scale plasmid DNA preparation or miniprep is a fundamental technique in estimation cloning experiments and is widely used for DNA methylation analysis in epigenetic research. Current plasmid DNA minipreps use the alkali-SDS-based method in a three-solution format and require spin column-based purification steps. This procedure requires the vortexing or pipetting of pelleted bacteria by centrifugation and manual mixing of the solutions. Here, we describe a centrifuge/mixer-based instrument with the ability to perform centrifugation, vibration, and rotor oscillation in order to perform all steps of plasmid DNA isolation by device only. We found that by applying rotor oscillation-driven mixing of solutions added in the lysis and neutralization steps, homogeneous mixing was achieved within 5 s at a rotor oscillation amplitude of 45° and oscillation frequency of 400 ± 30 rpm, yielding the maximal quantity and quality of plasmid DNA. No increase in host chromosome presence purified by this approach occurs for high-copy-number plasmids compared to manually performed miniprep, and indeed, there is a significant decrease in the presence of the chromosomal fraction in low-copy-number plasmids. The supercoiled form of plasmid DNA purified at a rotor oscillation amplitude of 45° does not turn into an open circular (OC) isoform when the plasmid is stored for 1 year at plus four degrees, in contrast to the plasmid purified with rotor oscillation amplitudes of 270°, 180° and 90°. The programmed time-work-efficient protocol of plasmid miniprep installed in the device gives the extreme simplicity of plasmid minipreps speeding up and facilitating the isolation of plasmid DNAs.",

Also, the results of three methods were compared. All stool specimens collected from CDI suspected patients were cultured on selective C. difficile cycloserine-cefoxitin fructose agar and incubated in an anaerobic jar up to 7 days. The bacterial isolates were identified using standard tests. Multiplex-PCR (M-PCR) was performed for detection of tcdA , tcdB , and tpi genes. The LAMP assay was performed to detect the tcdB gene of C. difficile . C. difficile was isolated from 20.0% (n = 10/50) of samples by culture. M-PCR showed that 34.0% (n = 17/50) of the specimens were positive for C. difficile based on the presence of tpi gene. Out of the 17 C. difficile , 13 strains (76.0%) were positive for tcdB gene using M-PCR. However, the LAMP assay showed that 30.0% (15/50) of specimens were positive for the presence of tcdB gene. M-PCR and LAMP methods showed 100.0% sensitivity compared to the culture method. However, the specificity of the LAMP (87.5%) was relatively higher than the M-PCR (82.5%) compared to the culture. Based on the results of this study, the prevalence of toxigenic C. difficile strains was high in suspected CDI patients. So, the differentiation between toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains is necessary. Our data showed that the LAMP assay is a good method for direct detection of toxigenic C. difficile strains from stool specimens.",

This study evaluated whether phage M13 can remain viable in the chicken gastrointestinal tract and whether it causes injury or humoral immune response. We inoculated phage M13 or E. coli ER2738 (ECR) infected with M13 into birds at different ages. We found the virus in faeces at 5 or 13 days after inoculation, just when it infected the ECR. The presence of phage M13 or ECR did not result in gut injuries and had no impacts on weight gain and bird health. Furthermore, the levels of IgY were similar in all treatments, which indicates that the virus can be used in chicken until 42 days without being recognised by the immune system. This work provides a scientific basis for the use of PD as a tool in numerous applications to control different pathogens.",

Although S. acidocaldarius, an extremophilic Archaeon thriving at 75 °C and pH 3.0, and related species harbor great potential for the exploitation as production hosts and biocatalysts in biotechnological applications, no industrial processes have been established yet. One hindrance is that during development and scaling of industrial bioprocesses timely monitoring of the impact of process parameters on the cultivated organism is crucial—a task that cannot be fulfilled by traditional plating assays. As alternative, flow cytometry (FCM) promises a fast and reliable method for viability assessment via the use of fluorescent dyes. In this study, commercially available fluorescent dyes applicable in S. acidocaldarius were identified. The dyes, fluorescein diacetate and concanavalin A conjugated with rhodamine, were discovered to be suitable for viability determination via FCM. For showing the applicability of the developed at-line tool for bioprocess monitoring, a chemostat cultivation on a defined growth medium at 75 °C, pH 3.0 was conducted. Over the timeframe of 800 h, this developed FCM method was compared to the plating assay by monitoring the change in viability upon controlled pH shifts. Both methods detected an impact on the viability at pH values of 2.0 and 1.5 when compared to pH 3.0. A logarithmic relationship between the viability observed via plating assay and via FCM was observed.",

In the present study, the production of cellulase by Trichoderma reesei, Trichoderma harzianum, and Aspergillus niger was optimized, and the synergistic effect of these cellulase on enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated ramie stalks was also evaluated. The maximum CMCase (Carboxymethyl Cellulase) and filter paper activity (FPA) produced by T. reesei reached to 3.12 IU/mL and 0.13 IU/mL, respectively. The maximum activities of CMCase (3.68 IU/mL), FPA (0.04 IU/mL) and β-glucosidase (8.44 IU/mL) were obtained from A. niger. The results also showed that under the premise of the same FPA activity, the contribution of β-glucosidase activity to yield of reducing sugar was greater than that of CMCase. Besides, cellulase produced by T. reesei and A. niger had the best synergistic effect on enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated ramie stalks. The highest reducing sugars yield (417 mg/g dry substrate) was achieved when enzyme cocktail was prepared at the ratio of 1:1, which was 1.36-3.35 folds higher than that of different single enzymes.

In this type of aqua-agriculture system, soil is irrigated with aquaculture wastewater, and intestinal bacteria in cultured fish species likely impact soil bacteria through irrigation. However, little is known about the relationship between soil bacteria and intestinal bacteria in some carp species commonly co-cultured in some Asian regions. Therefore, we co-cultured five carp species in aquaculture ponds and used the aquaculture wastewater to irrigate rice fields for over 5 years, and then compared carp intestinal bacterial communities with rice field soil bacterial communities. The results from analysis of similarity and SourceTracker analysis showed that a low similarity (R = 0.7908, P = 0.001) and contribution (an average of 9.9% of bacterial genera) of intestinal bacteria to soil bacterial communities although 77.5% of soil bacterial genera were shared by intestinal bacteria. Our results also indicated that intestinal bacteria in the numerically dominant fish species in the co-culture system do not necessarily impact soil bacteria more significantly than those of less abundant carp species, and that intestinal bacterial communities in one single fish species may impact certain soil bacterial phyla more significantly than others. Our results provide a better understanding of the impact of aquaculture wastewater on rice fields and will be helpful for the development of this type of aqua-agriculture system.",

We aimed to investigate the distribution of more prevalent capsular genes among different Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) types of S. agalactiae isolated from pregnant women. A total of 106 isolates were collected from 420 vaginal and rectal swabs obtained from pregnant women. The specimens were transferred using Todd Hewitt Broth and were cultured on a blood agar containing antibiotics. The S. agalactiae isolates were identified by the standard microbiological and biochemical tests. The genomic DNAs of S. agalactiae isolates were extracted using an extraction kit. Then, the PCR method was used to detection of the capsular genes. Moreover, The RAPD PCR was used to genotyping of the isolates. The colonization rate of the pregnant women was 25.23%, and there was a statistically significant correlation between the weeks of gestation and the probability of colonization (p-value < 0.05). Also, 31 (29.24%) and 18 (16.98%) pregnant women had a history of abortion and membrane rupture, respectively. In addition, 20 (18.86%), 32 (30.18%), 4 (3.77%), and 6 (5.66%) isolates carried genes encoding capsular types Ia, Ib, III, and V, respectively. None isolates had the type II capsular gene, and other 44 isolates were non-typeable. Nine clones (clusters) of S. agalactiae were observed in the present study with 70% similarity, and 53 different types were identified among the isolates. Except for capsular types III and V that belonged to clones 3, 5, 7, and 9, other capsular types were detected in different RAPD types. We found that the capsular types Ib and Ia were predominant among pregnant women in this area, indicating their significance for vaccine designation. Also, our isolates showed a lower genotypic diversity in RAPD typing. This may be due to the same sources of most isolates.",

To investigate the molecular mechanism behind the enhanced activity of variant L183I, the activation, oligomerization and pore-formation activities of L183I were evaluated, using wild-type Cry2Ab as a control. The results demonstrated that the proteolytic activation of L183I was the same as that of wild-type Cry2Ab.

    "abstract": "Interactions between microorganisms and plants can stimulate plant growth and promote nitrogen cycling. Nitrogen fertilizers are routinely used in agriculture to improve crop growth and yield; however, poor use efficiency impairs the optimal utilization of such fertilizers. Differences in the microbial diversity and plant growth of rice soil under different nitrogen application conditions and the expression of nitrogen-use efficiency-related genes have not been previously investigated. Therefore, this study investigates how nitrogen application and nitrogen-use efficiency-related gene NRT1.1B expression affect the soil microbial diversity and growth indices of two rice varieties, Huaidao 5 and Xinhuai 5. In total, 103,463 and 98,427 operational taxonomic units were detected in the soils of the Huaidao 5 and Xinhuai 5 rice varieties, respectively. The Shannon and Simpson indices initially increased and then decreased, whereas the Chao and abundance-based coverage estimator indices decreased after the application of nitrogen fertilizer. Nitrogen fertilization also reduced soil bacterial diversity and richness, as indicated by the reduced abundances of Azotobacter recorded in the soils of both rice varieties. Nitrogen application initially increased and then decreased the grain number per panicle, yield per plant, root, stem, and leaf nitrogen, total nitrogen content, glutamine synthetase, nitrate reductase, urease, and root activities of both varieties. Plant height showed positive linear trends in response to nitrogen application, whereas thousand-grain weights showed a negative trend. Our findings may be used to optimize nitrogen fertilizer use for rice cultivation and develop crop-variety-specific strategies for nitrogen fertilizer application.",

Biodiesel has emerged as one of the most promising alternatives to conventional diesel, leading to growing research interest in its production. Microbes can facilitate the de novo synthesis of a type of biodiesel in the form of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). In this study, Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolic activity was engineered to facilitate enhanced FAME production. Initially, free fatty acid concentrations were increased by deleting two acetyl-CoA synthetase genes (FAA1, FAA4) and an acyl-CoA oxidase gene (POX1). Intracellular S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) levels were then enhanced via the deletion of an adenosine kinase gene (ADO1) and the overexpression of a SAM synthetase gene (SAM2). Lastly, the S. cerevisiae strain overproducing free fatty acids and SAM were manipulated to express a plasmid encoding the Drosophila melanogaster Juvenile Hormone Acid O-Methyltransferase (DmJHAMT). Using this combination of engineering approaches, a FAME concentration of 5.79 ± 0.56 mg/L was achieved using these cells in the context of shaking flask fermentation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first detailed study of FAME production in S. cerevisiae. These results will provide a valuable basis for future efforts to engineer S. cerevisiae strains for highly efficient production of biodiesel.",

    "abstract": "Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) is an important chassis strain widely used for the development of live biotherapeutic products (LBPs). EcN strain naturally harbors two cryptic plasmids with unknown function. During the development of LBPs using EcN strain, the cryptic plasmids were cured usually to avoid plasmid incompatibility or alleviate metabolic burdens associated with these cryptic plasmids. While the cryptic plasmids curing in EcN may appear to be a routine procedure, the comprehensive impact of cryptic plasmids curing on the EcN strain remains incompletely understood. In the present study, the effects of cryptic plasmids curing on EcN were investigated using transcriptome sequencing. The results revealed that only a small number of genes showed significant changes in mRNA levels after cryptic plasmid curing (4 upregulated and 6 downregulated genes), primarily involved in amino acid metabolism. Furthermore, the flu gene showed the most significant different expression, encoding Antigen 43 (Ag43) protein, a Cah family adhesin. Mass spectrometry analysis further confirmed the significant increase in Ag43 expression. Ag43 is commonly present in Escherichia coli and mediates the bacterial autoaggregation. However, despite the upregulation of Ag43 expression, no Ag43-mediated cell self-sedimentation was observed in the cured EcN strain. These findings contribute to making informed decisions regarding the curing of the cryptic plasmids when Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 is used as the chassis strain.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) are highly active N-glycosidases that depurinate both bacterial and eukaryotic rRNAs, halting protein synthesis during translation. Found in a diverse spectrum of plant species and tissues, RIPs possess antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral, and insecticidal properties linked to plant defense. In this study, we investigated the physiochemical properties of RIP peptides from the Cucurbitaceae family through bioinformatics approaches. Molecular weight, isoelectric point, aliphatic index, extinction coefficient, and secondary structures were analyzed, revealing their hydrophobic nature. The novelty of this work lies in the comprehensive examination of RIPs from the Cucurbitaceae family and their potential therapeutic applications. The study also elucidated the binding interactions of Cucurbitaceae RIPs with key biological targets, including Interleukin-6 (IL-6). Strong hydrogen bond interactions between RIPs and these targets suggest potential for innovative insilico drug design and therapeutic applications, particularly in cancer treatment. Comprehensive analysis of bond lengths using Ligpolt + software provides insights for optimizing molecular interactions, offering a valuable tool for drug design and structural biology studies.",

Here, 69 strains of R. arrhizus were investigated by using the Biolog FF MicroPlate for the profiles of utilizing 95 carbon and nitrogen substrates. The study showed that most R. arrhizus strains were similar in average well color development (AWCD) and substrate richness (SR). Nevertheless, 13 strains were unique in principal component analyses, heatmap, AWCD, and SR analyses, which may imply a niche differentiation within R. arrhizus . The species R. arrhizus was able to utilize all the 95 carbon and nitrogen substrates, consistent with the hypothesis of a great metabolic diversity. It possessed a substrate preference of alcohols, and seven substrates were most frequently utilized, with N -acetyl- d -galactosamine and l -phenylalanine ranking at the top of the list. Eight substrates, especially l -arabinose and xylitol, were capable of promoting sporulation and being applied for rejuvenating degenerated strains. By phenotyping R. arrhizus strains in carbon and nitrogen assimilation capacity, this study revealed the extent of intra-specific variability and laid a foundation for estimating optimum substrates that may be useful for industrial applications.",

With the discovery of the biosynthetic pathways of various antibiotics pointing out the role of each gene/protein in their antibiotic-producing strains, it became apparent that the biosynthetic gene clusters can be manipulated to produce modified antibiotics. This new approach is known as the combinatorial biosynthesis of new antibiotics which can be employed for obtaining novel derivatives of these valuable antibiotics using genetically modified antibiotic-producing strains (pathway engineering). In this review and based on the available biosynthetic gene clusters of the major aminoglycoside antibiotics (AGAs), the possible alterations or modifications that could be done by co-expression of certain gene(s) previously known to be involved in unique biosynthetic steps have been discussed. In this review defined novel examples of modified AGA using this approach were described and the information provided will act as a platform of researchers to get and develop new antibiotics by the antibiotic-producing bacterial strains such as Streptomyces , Micromonospora ,…etc. This way, novel antibiotics with new biological activities could be isolated and used in the treatment of infectious diseases conferring resistance to existing antibiotics.",

Investigate the temporal changes in gut microbiota in obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery (gastric sleeve gastrectomy or Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB)) compared to healthy controls, aiming to understand their role in weight loss and metabolic health improvement. A case-control study included 30 obese patients aged 65-95 undergoing bariatric surgery, and 18 matched healthy controls. Selection criteria were based on age, race, BMI, history of antibiotics, probiotics, and prebiotics usage. Stool samples were collected at baseline, three months, and six months post-surgery for DNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR analysis to assess gut microbiota changes. Physical activity and dietary intake were evaluated using standardized questionnaires. Statistical analyses were performed using R. Post-surgery, patients showed significant reductions in weight and BMI, with changes in dietary habits and physical activity. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed substantial alterations in bacterial groups such as Bacteroides and Fusobacterium. However, some groups showed no significant changes, indicating a complex interaction between gut microbiota and bariatric surgery. Notable correlations were found between body weight, BMI, and specific bacterial groups like the C. cluster IV and Lactobacillus, particularly in RYGB patients. Bariatric surgery significantly alters gut microbiota, aiding weight loss and metabolic regulation in obese patients. Understanding these changes is crucial for developing effective obesity management strategies, requiring further research to optimize outcomes.",

This study aimed to explore the chemical composition of the aerial part of Crotalaria madurensis and evaluate its antioxidant and antibacterial properties. The impact of gamma irradiation on the antibacterial properties of the plant extract and metabolite 1 against MRSA was also examined. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) analysis was conducted on the filtrates of untreated MRSA and MRSA treated with the plant extract and metabolite 1. Four flavonol glycosides were identified as gossypetin 8-methoxy, 3- O -β-D-xylopyranoside (metabolite 1), gossypetin 8- O -β-D-glucopyranoside (metabolite 2), kaempferol 3- O -β-D-glucpyranoside (Astragalin, metabolite 3), and herbacetin 7-methoxy-3- O -β-D-glucopyranoside (metabolite 4). All metabolites exhibited significant antioxidant properties using different assays. The antibacterial efficacy of the extract and metabolite 1, which showed substantial antioxidant properties compared to the other isolated metabolites, was evaluated. Both the plant extract and metabolite 1 significantly reduced the viability and cell count of MRSA at concentrations of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/ml. The antibacterial activity of the plant extract and metabolite 1 was assessed after gamma irradiation at 50 and 100 Gy, which did not significantly affect the antibacterial efficiency. FTIR analysis indicated that the plant extract and metabolite 1 significantly altered the band frequency values, bandwidth, and peak intensity % of the treated MRSA filtrate. Molecular docking studies suggested that metabolite 1 exhibited the highest antioxidant and anti-MRSA activity, with strong binding scores like the ligand, indicating an effective interaction and high affinity between metabolite 1 and the target molecule.",

This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) mediated by Rutin-Gal(III) complex and Quercetin against A. baumannii. Absorbance spectra, fluorescence spectra, and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Rutin-Gal(III) complex and Quercetin were determined. The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), cell membrane permeability, expression of ompA and blaOXA−23, anti-biofilm activity, and anti-metabolic activity of Rutin-Gal(III) complex- and Quercetin-mediated aPDT were measured. Rutin-Gal(III) complex and Quercetin revealed absorption peaks in the visible spectra. Quercetin and Rutin-Gal(III) complex displayed fluorescence peaks at 524 nm and 540 nm, respectively. MIC values for the Rutin-Gal(III) complex and Quercetin were 64 µg/mL and 256 µg/mL, respectively. Quercetin- and Rutin-Gal(III) complex-mediated aPDT significantly reduced the colony forming units/mL (58.4% and 67.5%), EPS synthesis (47.4% and 56.5%), metabolic activity (30.5% and 36.3%), ompA (5.5- and 10.5-fold), and blaOXA−23 (4.1-fold and 7.8-fold) genes expression (respectively; all P < 0.05). Quercetin- and Rutin-Gal(III) complex-mediated aPDT enhanced notable biofilm degradation (36.2% and 40.6%), ROS production (2.55- and 2.90-folds), and membrane permeability (10.8– and 9.6-folds) (respectively; all P < 0.05). The findings indicate that Rutin-Gal(III) complex- and Quercetin-mediated aPDT exhibits antibacterial properties and could serve as a valuable adjunctive strategy to conventional antibiotic treatments for A. baumannii infections. One limitation of this study is that it was conducted solely on the standard strain; testing on clinical isolates would allow for more reliable interpretation of the results.",

Our study aimed to determine the optimal conditions for scaling up the production of CPC from A. chrysogenum W42-I starting with the optimized conditions on the shake flask level obtained from our previous study and utilizing the optimized media (CPC2). The results indicated that an inoculum size equivalent to 1% v/v, aeration at 1 vvm, and an agitation rate of 400 rpm, with controlled pH at 4, were the most favorable conditions for the CPC production using a laboratory fermentor (14 L). The concentration of generated CPC was assessed using two standard curves obtained from agar well diffusion and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). These optimized conditions resulted in a production of 399.52 µg/mL showing a significant increase of approximately 3.4 folds when compared to the unoptimized fermentation run. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated a more favorable time course for CPC production in the fermentor compared to that in the shake flask. Notably, there was a two-fold increase in production within the first three days. Fortunately, the fermentor achieved a noteworthy increase in output, generating 1.598 gm of the CPC within 4 L.",

Intervention results on 227 piglets with diarrhea showed the highest cure rate when supplemented with Lectin C, with no mortality rate, longer treatment time, and no reinfection rate. While the two antibiotic trials still had lower cure rates, mortality and reinfection rates were higher. After 05 days of recovery, piglets were tested for MCV, MCH, and MCHC, showing an apparent decrease in the group supplemented with Lectin C, while the two groups using antibiotics still had high rates, with a confidence level of P &lt; 0.05; 0.01 and 0.001. Antibiotics treat piglets in their early stages, so there is a risk of immunodeficiency and low infection response. It is necessary to supplement substances derived from dietary supplements. Supplementing Lectin C increases resistance, enhances immune response, improves the effectiveness of treating diarrhoea syndrome in piglets, and ensures safe meat quality in the future. Lectin C supplementation will improve piglet health and breed quality efficiency. This heralds a promising future for the pig industry with improved meat quality and reduced environmental impact.",

    "abstract": "Abstract To feed the world’s growing population, the agriculture sector has recently had to strike a balance between reducing its detrimental effects on ecosystems and human health and boosting resource efficiency and production. In reality, pesticides and fertilizers are vital to agriculture and are useful instruments that farmers can employ to increase yield and guarantee steady productivity throughout the seasons under both favorable and unfavorable conditions. Therefore, in the present study, fertilizing with potassium citrate as a foliar spray and humic acid (HA) as a soil application allowed for the evaluation of vegetative growth parameters (plant height, number of leaves/plant), total phenolic content, total carbohydrate, antioxidant activity, the essential oil (EO) composition, and bulb yield of garlic ( Allium sativum L.). These were carried out in two field experiments throughout the 2020–2021 and 2021–2022 growth seasons. A gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) apparatus was performed to determine the chemical composition of the isolated EOs. The antifungal activity of the EOs was assessed against two fungi, Fusarium proliferatum and Macrophomina phaseolina , that cause geranium plants to wilt and decay. The findings indicated that applying HA at a rate of 2 g/L with potassium citrate at a rate of 5 or 10 mL/L produced garlic bulbs with the highest levels of productivity and diameter. The diverse treatments between HA with potassium citrate resulted in significant variations in the bioactive components, such as total phenol content, antioxidant activity, total carbohydrate, and sulfur content. The analysis of the EOs revealed the presence of dimethyl trisulfide, diallyl disulfide, methyl 2-propenyl trisulfide, allitridin, and methyl allyl disulfide and allyl tetrasulfide as main compounds. By gradually increasing the concentration of the garlic EO to 4000 µg/mL compared to the control, the inhibition percentage of fungal growth of F. proliferatum and M. phaseolina was increased. In conclusion, a high concentration of HA with potassium citrate (5 or 10 mL/L), may be suitable and highly appreciated as a fertilizer application to enhance the productivity and EOs content of garlic plants.",

The fecal microbial composition was profiled using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Our results showed that seventeen predominant genera were present in each pig sample and constituted the phylogenetic core of the microbiota at the class level. The abundance of most of the core microbial flora were significantly higher in the CP group than in the EP group ( P &lt; 0.05), while the abundance of Gammaproteobacteria was significantly lower in the CP group than in the EP group ( P &lt; 0.05). The CP group had significantly greater community diversity, richness, and evenness than the EP group ( P &lt; 0.05). Functional prediction analysis indicated that intestinal microbial species potentially led to faster growth and an increased fat accumulation capacity in the CP group; however, disease resistance was weaker in the CP group than in the EP group. In conclusion, EP pigs have a wider range of activity and better animal welfare than CP pigs, which helps reduce the occurrence of diseases and neurological symptoms. To explore the effect of intestinal flora on disease resistance in pigs at the molecular level, Coprococcus , which is a key gut bacterium in the intestine, was selected for isolation and purification and cocultured with intestinal epithelial cells. qPCR was performed to determine the effect of Coprococcus on SLA-DRB gene expression in intestinal epithelial cells. The results showed that Coprococcus enhanced SLA-DRB gene expression in intestinal epithelial cells. The results provide useful reference data for further study on the relationship between intestinal flora and pig disease resistance.",

TG from Streptoverticillium mobaraense ( Sm TG) is used widely in food, cosmetic, biomaterial and medical industries. Sm TG is occasionally supplied as a mixture with the activator peptide glutathione. Currently, glutathione is industrially produced using a budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae , because of its intracellular high content of glutathione. In this study, active Sm TG was produced together with glutathione in S. cerevisiae . Sm TG extracted from S. cerevisiae expressing Sm TG showed cross-linking activity when BSA and sodium caseinate were substrates. The cross-linking activity of Sm TG increased proportionally as the concentration of added glutathione increased. Furthermore, Sm TG was prepared by extracting Sm TG from an engineered S. cerevisiae whose glutathione synthetic pathway was enhanced. The Sm TG solution showed higher activity when compared with a Sm TG solution prepared from a S. cerevisiae strain without enhanced glutathione production. This result indicates that a high content of intracellular glutathione further enhances active Sm TG production in S. cerevisiae . S. cerevisiae co-producing Sm TG and a higher content of glutathione has the potential to supply a ready-to-use industrial active TG solution.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Acid resistance is critical for the survival of bacteria in the dental caries oral micro-environment. However, there are few acid-resistant genes of microbiomes obtained through traditional molecular biology experimental techniques. This study aims to try macrogenomics technologies to efficiently identify acid-resistant genes in oral microbes of patients with dental caries. Total DNA was extracted from oral microbiota obtained from thirty dental caries patients and subjected to high-throughput sequencing. This data was used to build a metagenomic library, which was compared to the sequences of two S treptococcus mutant known acid-resistant genes, danK and uvrA , using a BLAST search. A total of 19 and 35 unknown gene sequences showed similarities with S. mutans uvrA and dnaK in the metagenomic library, respectively. Two unknown genes, mo-dnaK and mo-uvrA , were selected for primer design and bioinformatic analysis based on their sequences. Bioinformatics analysis predicted them encoding of a human heat-shock protein (HSP) 70 and an ATP-dependent DNA repair enzyme, respectively, closely related with the acid resistance mechanism. After cloning, these genes were transferred into competent Escherichia coli for acid resistance experiments. E. coli transformed with both genes demonstrated acid resistance, while the survival rate of E. coli transformed with mo-uvrA was significantly higher in an acidic environment (pH = 3). Through this experiment we found that identify unknown acid-resistant genes in oral microbes of patients with caries by establishing a metagenomic library is very efficient. Our results provide an insight into the mechanisms and pathogenesis of dental caries for their treatment without affecting oral probiotics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract To accurately explore the interaction mechanism between Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus , we designed an ecological experiment to monoculture and co-culture E . coli and S . aureus . We co-cultured 45 strains of E . coli and S . aureus , as well as each species individually to measure growth over 36 h. We implemented a genome wide association study (GWAS) based on growth parameters ( λ, R, A and s ) to identify significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the bacteria. Three commonly used growth regression equations, Logistic, Gompertz, and Richards, were used to fit the bacteria growth data of each strain. Then each equation’s Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) value was calculated as a commonly used information criterion. We used the optimal growth equation to estimate the four parameters above for strains in co-culture. By plotting the estimates for each parameter across two strains, we can visualize how growth parameters respond ecologically to environment stimuli. We verified that different genotypes of bacteria had different growth trajectories, although they were the same species. We reported 85 and 52 significant SNPs that were associated with interaction in E. coli and S. aureus , respectively. Many significant genes might play key roles in interaction, such as yjjW , dnaK, aceE , tatD , ftsA , rclR , ftsK , fepA in E. coli , and scdA, trpD, sdrD , SAOUHSC_01219 in S. aureus . Our study illustrated that there were multiple genes working together to affect bacterial interaction, and laid a solid foundation for the later study of more complex inter-bacterial interaction mechanisms.",

In this study, an amylase gene (amy2587) that codes a protein with 587 amino acids (Amy2587) was obtained from the metagenomic library of macroalgae-associated bacteria. Recombinant Amy2587 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and was found to simultaneously possess α-amylase, agarase, carrageenase, cellulase, and alginate lyase activities. Moreover, recombinant Amy2587 showed high thermostability and alkali resistance which are important characteristics for industrial application. To investigate the multifunctional mechanism of Amy2587, three motifs (functional domains) in the Amy2587 sequence were deleted to generate three truncated Amy2587 variants. The results showed that, even though these functional domains affected the multiple substrates degrading activity of Amy2587, they did not wholly explain its multifunctional characteristics. To apply the multifunctional activity of Amy2587, three seaweed substrates (Grateloupia filicina, Chondrus ocellatus, and Scagassum) were digested using Amy2587. After 2 h, 6 h, and 24 h of digestion, 121.2 ± 4 µg/ml, 134.8 ± 6 µg/ml, and 70.3 ± 3.5 µg/ml of reducing sugars were released, respectively. These results show that Amy2587 directly and effectively degraded three kinds of raw seaweeds. This finding provides a theoretical basis for one-step enzymatic digestion of raw seaweeds to obtain seaweed oligosaccharides.",

The phylogenetic trees of 22 strains were constructed based on ITS (Internal transcribed spacer) and SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism). Moisture, ash, water-soluble extracts, alcohol-soluble extracts, polysaccharides, and triterpenoids from 15 fruit bodies of Lingzhi were detected and analyzed based on Chinese Pharmacopoeia and the US Pharmacopoeia references. Moreover, the monosaccharide composition of polysaccharides was studied using PMP-HPLC, and the effect of polysaccharides on the proliferation rate of splenocytes was investigated in vitro. The identification results of these strains by the phylogenetic trees which were constructed based on ITS sequences and SNPs showed that most of the strains applied in the main producing areas of Lingzhi in China were accurate except for a few inaccurate strains. The moisture, ash, water and alcohol soluble extractive, polysaccharide and triterpenoid content of all samples were meet the requirements of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, while the polysaccharide and triterpenoid content of less than half of the samples meet the requirements of the U.S. Pharmacopoeia. The polysaccharide extracted from these samples have different effects on the proliferation rate of spleen cells. To sum up, this is the first study that reported on the differences in Lingzhi strains from the main producing areas in China. The quality of some fruit bodies did not meet the pharmacopeia requirements, and wrong strains were used in some production areas; thus, strains should be given special attention before legal processing.",

Microbiota in soil would impact the yield and quality of blueberries since microbial communities in soil can interact with the rhizosphere of plant. This study was conducted to determine how different mulching treatments induce changes in soil microbial composition, diversity, and functional properties. A total of 150 soil samples were collected from 5 different mulch treatments (sawdust, green weed mat, sawdust topped with green weed mat, black weed mat, and sawdust topped with black weed mat) at 3 different depths (bottom, middle, and top region of 20 cm soil depth) from 2 different months (June and July 2018). A total of 8,583,839 sequencing reads and 480 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of bacteria were identified at genus level. Eight different plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) were detected, and the relative abundances of Bradyrhizobium , Bacillus , and Paenibacillus were more than 0.1% among all soil samples. Sampling depth and month of soil samples impacted the amount of PGPR, while there were no significant differences based on mulch type. Functional properties of bacteria were identified through PICRUSt2, which found that there is no significant difference between mulch treatment, depth, and month. The results indicated that sampling month and depth of soil impacted the relative abundance of PGPR in soil samples, but there were no significant differences of functional properties and beneficial microbial communities based on mulch type.",

An ELISA checkerboard titration was performed. A validation test involving 53 individuals with leprosy, 24 with and 19 without periodontitis, was conducted and a ROC curve constructed to calculate sensitivity and specificity. The coefficient of the optical densities was 2.21 and 2.66 for P. gingivalis crude extract and the recombinant protein HmuY, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity for the P. gingivalis crude extract were 66.7% and 73.7%, respectively, and for HmuY, were 62.5% and 52.6%, respectively. Specific recognition of P. gingivalis occurred predominantly in individuals with periodontitis, which validates the use of this test for studying periodontitis in individuals with leprosy.

Thus, the objective of this work is to optimize the culture medium and solid fermentation time for production of proteases and conidia of Metarhizium robertsii ARSEF 2575 and to evaluate the interference of riboflavin and salts on virulence and resistance to abiotic stress factors. In the first step, nine groups were separated: negative control, positive control, and seven supplementation groups: ammonium nitrate, ammonium chloride, potassium nitrate, sodium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, urea. Sodium nitrate showed significant difference in protease production at the time of 20 days of solid fermentation. Then, different concentrations of sodium nitrate and riboflavin as supplement were evaluated. Response surface methodology demonstrated that riboflavin and sodium nitrate influence proteolytic activity and conidia production, but without synergism. Supplementation of the medium with the optimal concentration of sodium nitrate and riboflavin did not interfere with the germination of conidia without exposure to abiotic stress, but did increase the thermotolerance of conidia. The presence of riboflavin and sodium nitrate at optimal concentrations in the culture medium did not alter fungal virulence with and without exposure to heat stress, varying according to the presence or absence of the supernatant during exposure, evidencing that resistance to heat exposure is multifactorial and dependent on intra- and extracellular factors. Moreover, the supplementation increased the larvicidal activity of the supernatant against Aedes aegypti .",

In this study, we report the design, and construction of an omnipotent expression vector pOmni, with which a target gene can be easily cloned through innovative selection-free PCR recombination cloning strategy with only one pair of primer and two times of PCR in one work day, without using any restriction enzymes, ligase and other DNA modifying enzymes. Furthermore, the target gene cloned in pOmni is ready to be high-efficiently expressed in either Escherichia coli cells or eukaryotic cells because of the elaborate design of compatible T7 promoter and CMV promoter expression elements in the vector. The cloning capability and reliability of selection-free PCR recombination cloning with pOmni were validated through cloning of 6 DNA fragments with length from 315 to 4557 bp, and the dual-expression function of the vector was verified through the cloning and expression of EGFP in E. coli BL21 and HeLa cells. pOmni developed in our study provides a powerful tool for gene cloning and expression, and is of special value for researches in which both prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression of a target gene are necessary.",

    "abstract": "The influence of mass transfer on productivity as well as the performance of packed bed bioreactor was determined by varying a number of parameters; flow rate, glucose concentration and polymers (chitosan). Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells were immobilized in chitosan and non-chitosan coated alginate beads to demonstrate the effect on external mass transfer by substrate consumption time, lag phase and ethanol production. The results indicate that coating has a significant effect on the lag phase duration, being 30-40 min higher than non-coated beads. After lag phase, no significant change was observed in both types of beads on consumption of glucose with the same flow rate. It was observed that by increasing flow rates; lag phase and glucose consumption time decreased. The reason is due to the reduction of external mass transfer as a result of increase in flow rate as glucose is easily transported to and from the beads surface by diffusion. It is observed that chitosan acts as barrier for transfer of substrate and products, in and out of beads, at initial time of fermentation as it shows longer lag phase for chitosan coated beads than non-coated. Glucose consumption at low flow rate was lower as compared to higher flow rates. The optimum combination of parameters consisting of higher flow rates 30-90 ml/min and between 10 and 20 g/l of glucose was found for maximum production of ethanol.",

A variety of protein expression systems are available, but nowadays almost all therapeutic antibodies are produced in mammalian cell lines due to their complex structure and glycosylation requirements. However, production of clinical-grade antibodies in mammalian cells is very expensive and time-consuming. On the other hand, Escherichia coli (E. coli) is known to be the simplest, fastest and most cost-effective recombinant expression system, which usually achieves higher protein yields than mammalian cells. Indeed, it is one of the most popular host in the industry for the expression of recombinant proteins. In this work, a trivalent single-chain fragment variable (scFv)-based N-terminal trimerbody, specific for native laminin-111, was expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and in E. coli. Mammalian and bacterially produced anti-laminin trimerbody molecules display comparable functional and structural properties, although importantly the yield of trimerbody expressed in E. coli was considerably higher than in human cells. These results demonstrated that E. coli is a versatile and efficient expression system for multivalent trimerbody-based molecules that is suitable for their industrial production.",

Peptides are a promising drug scaffold because of their intermediate molecular size between that of therapeutic small molecules and antibodies. They also offer potential advantages of targeting not only membrane proteins but also intracellular protein-protein interactions. Phage display technology has been used for exploring novel peptides acting on GPCRs, but it is unclear whether the identified peptides functionally modulate targets because the technology selects peptides based on binding ability but not functional activity to targets. In a novel screening system that we established, yeast cells were utilized as a peptide producer while mammalian cells stably producing the receptor for glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1R) were used as a biosensor for receptor activation. Three kinds of GLP1R agonists secreted by yeasts were successfully detected for their functional activities without any purification and condensation of those peptides. By applying the functional screening system, we were able to identify GLP1R agonist-secreting yeasts based on GLP1R activation from the cell mixture containing a number of background yeasts that produced non-active control peptides. Further applications of this system would include not only activity evaluation of bioactive peptides without chemical synthesis but also discovery of novel peptides activating druggable GPCRs.",

SID EGYII activity was expressed quantitatively as arbitrary units [Siderophore arbitrary units (SAU)] 380 SAU/mL against E. amylovora strain EGY1 DSM 101800. Maximal SID EGYII activity was achieved upon growing P. aeruginosa strain EGYII DSM 101801 in PYB broth at 180 rpm for 24 h. SID EGYII displayed a broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against some human pathogens (i.e., Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and yeasts) and a fireblight plant pathogen. Interestingly, transformants of Escherichia coli JM109 (DE3)pSID/EGYII harboring P. aeruginosa strain EGYII DSM 101801 plasmid demonstrated a perceivable antimicrobial activity against E. amylovora strain EGY1 DSM 101800. The broad spectrum antimicrobial activity of the unusual non-fluorescent SID EGYII would underpin its high potential in targeting bacterial pathogens posing probable threats to human health and agricultural economy. The present simple low cost effective bioassay is a new insight towards an alternative to the expensive cumbersome siderophore Chrome Azurol S assay.",

    "abstract": "Kinetics of a recombinant uridine diphosphate-glucose: sterol glycosyltransferase from Micromonospora rhodorangea ATCC 27932 (MrSGT) were studied using a number of sterols (including phytosterols) as glycosyl acceptors. The lowest K m value and the highest catalytical efficiency (k cat/K m) were found when β-sitosterol was the glycosyl acceptor in the enzymatic reaction. In contrast to the enzyme’s flexibility toward the glycosyl acceptor substrate, this recombinant enzyme was highly specific to uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose as the donor substrate. Besides, the UDP-glucose-dependent MrSGT was able to attach one glucose moiety specifically onto the C-3 hydroxyl group of other phytosterols such as fucosterol and gramisterol, yielding stereo-specific fucosterol-3-O-β-d-glucoside and gramisterol-3-O-β-d-glucoside, respectively. Based on kinetic data obtained from the enzyme’s reactions using five different sterol substrates, the significance of the alkene (or ethylidene) side chains on the C-24 position in the sterol scaffolds was described and the possible relationship between the substrate structure and enzyme activity was discussed. This is the first report on the enzymatic bioconversion of the above two phytosteryl 3-O-β-glucosides, as well as on the discovery of a stereospecific bacterial SGT which can attach a glucose moiety in β-conformation at the C-3 hydroxyl group of diverse sterols, thus highlighting the catalytic potential of this promiscuous glycosyltransferase to expand the structural diversity of steryl glucosides.",

The relative concentration ratio of HbA1c to total Hb is an important biomarker for the diagnosis of diabetes. HbA1c-binding lectins were screened from 29 sources of lectin, and the lectin from Aleuria aurantia (AAL) was revealed to have higher affinity to HbA1c than to Hb. The concentration of HbA1c was determined by lectin-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the AAL lectin. Higher reproducibility of the assay was observed at 4 °C than at 25 and 37 °C. This observation is consistent with the known temperature-dependent behavior of lectins. Preincubation of HbA1c with an anti-HbA1c antibody inhibited the binding, suggesting that AAL binds to the N-terminal fructosyl valine epitope of HbA1c. Higher inhibitory effect was observed for 10 mM D-fructose than for the same concentrations of L-fucose, D-fucose, or D-glucose.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial cells are surrounded by a peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall, which is essential for cell integrity and intrinsic biogenesis pathways; hence, the cell wall is a potential target for several antibiotics. Among several lytic transglycosylases (LTs), the mltG gene plays a crucial role in the synthesis of peripheral PG. It localises the re-modelled PGs for septum formation and cleavage across the bacterial cell wall during daughter cells separation. However, the role of mltG gene in bacterial virulence, particularly in Gram-positive bacteria during dentine biofilm and caries development, has remained unexplored. Hence, we exploited Gram-positive Streptococcus mutans cells for the very first time to construct a mltG knock-out bacterial strain, e.g., ΔmltG S. mutans. Systematic comparative investigations revealed that doubling time (Td), survival, enzymatic efficiencies, pH tolerance, bio-synthesise of lipid, proteins and DNA, biofilm formation and dentine lesions were significantly (p < 0.001) compromised in case of ΔmltG S. mutans than wild type strain. The qRT-PCR based gene expression profiling revealed that transcriptional expression of critically important genes involved in biofilm, metabolism, and stress response were dysregulated in the mutant. Besides, an incredible reduction in dentine caries development was found in the molar teeth of Wistar rats and also in human extracted teeth. Concisely, these trends obtained evidently advocated the fact that the deletion of mltG gene can be a potential target to impair the S. mutans virulence through severe growth retardation, thereby reducing the virulence potential of S. mutans.",

This study aimed to investigate some virulence genes of H. pylori in gastric biopsies of patients with gastritis in Sari city, North of Iran. Informed consent forms were obtained from the studied patients, and those who needed endoscopy were included in the study. To evaluate the prevalence of c agA , iceA1 , iceA2, vacA , dupA , and o ipA genes, gastric biopsies with positive or negative rapid urease test were collected from 50 patients (25 in each group) with gastro-duodenal diseases. The bacterial DNAs were extracted by a specific kit, and the presence of the genes was analyzed by PCR using specific primers. Eighteen (72%) biopsies from 25 H. pylori -positive samples were c agA -positive, while 17 (68%) biopsies contained the vacA gene, and 11 (44%) samples had both vacA and cagA genes. However, 16 (64%), 12 (48%), 13 (52%), and 14 (56%) biopsies contained dupA , iceA1 , iceA2 , and oipA genes, respectively. Due to the significant role of the studied virulence factors in the pathogenicity of H. pylori , the high prevalence of these factors in biopsies of patients with gastritis is a concern needing to the management in this region.",

Attract-and-kill (AK) beads are sustainable, microbial alternatives to synthetic soil insecticides, whose onset of lethal effect largely depend on how fast the encapsulated entomopathogenic fungus forms virulent conidia. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a water-soluble coating accelerating the kill effect of AK beads by immediately releasing virulent Metarhizium brunneum CB15-III blastospores. We assessed three PVA types (PVA 4-88, 8-88, 10-98) which differed in their degree of hydrolysis or molecular weight for their ability to release viable blastospores from thin films after drying at 60-40 °C, and examined how polyethylene glycol and soy-lecithin impact the blastospore survival. Finally, we evaluated the effectiveness of coated AK beads in a bioassay against Tenebrio molitor larvae. The blastospore release rate quadrupled within the first 5 min with decreasing molecular weight and degree of hydrolysis, with PVA 4-88 releasing 79 ± 19% blastospores. Polyethylene glycol and soy-lecithin significantly increased the blastospore survival to 18-28% for all three PVA types. Coated beads exhibited a uniform, 22.4 ± 7.3 µm thin coating layer, with embedded blastospores, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. The blastospore coating increased the mortality rate of T. molitor larvae over uncoated AK beads, decreasing the median lethal time from 10 to 6 days. Consequently, the blastospore coating accelerated the kill effect of regular AK beads. These findings pave the way to enhanced pest control efficacy from coated systems such as beads or seeds.",

The S1/S2 junction (S1S2J) cleavage site of the S protein of PEDV is one of the major determinants of coronavirus infection success. In this study, we specifically selected the S1S2J protein of PEDV-AJ1102 (a representative strain of the G2 type) as a target protein to immunize mice and generated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) using hybridoma technology. Three mAbs with high-binding activities to the S1S2J protein and were obtained and further analyzed. To reveal the characterization of these mAbs, variable region genes of antibodies were studied by using DNA sequencing, thereby revealing differences in their CDR3 amino acid sequences. We then developed a new method to identify the isotypes of these three mAbs. Results showed that these three antibodies were of the IgM type. As for the functions of these three mAbs, indirect immunofluorescence assay confirmed their good binding ability to Vero E6 cells infected with the PEDV-SP-C strain (G1 type). Epitope analysis showed linear epitopes for all three mAbs. These antibodies were also used to detect infected cells via flow cytometry analysis. In summary, we prepared and examined three mAbs against PEDV-S1S2J. These mAbs can be employed as detection antibodies for diagnostic reagents and further developed for other applications. We also designed a novel technique for easy and cost-saving identification of isotypes of mouse mAbs. Our results lay a good foundation for the development of research on PEDV.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin D3 is a fat-soluble prohormone that is activated inside the liver to produce 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (calcidiol), and in the kidney to produce the fully active 1α, 25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 (calcitriol). A previous work piloted in our laboratory, resulted in a successful recovery of a local soil-promising Actinomyces hyovaginalis isolate CCASU-A11-2 capable of converting vitamin D3 into calcitriol. Despite the rising amount of research on vitamin D3 bioconversion into calcitriol, further deliberate studies on this topic can significantly contribute to the improvement of such a bioconversion process. Therefore, this work aimed to improve the bioconversion process, using the study isolate, in a 14 L laboratory fermenter (4 L fermentation medium composed of fructose (15 g/L), defatted soybean (15 g/L), NaCl (5 g/L), CaCO3 2 g/L); K2HPO4, (1 g/L) NaF (0.5 g/L) and initial of pH 7.8) where different experiments were undertaken to investigate the effect of different culture conditions on the bioconversion process. Using the 14 L laboratory fermenter, the calcitriol production was increased by about 2.5-fold (32.8 µg/100 mL) to that obtained in the shake flask (12.4 µg/100 mL). The optimal bioconversion conditions were inoculum size of 2% v/v, agitation rate of 200 rpm, aeration rate of 1 vvm, initial pH of 7.8 (uncontrolled); addition of vitamin D3 (substrate) 48 h after the start of the main culture. In conclusion, the bioconversion of vitamin D3 into calcitriol in a laboratory fermenter showed a 2.5-fold increase as compared to the shake flask level where, the important factors influencing the bioconversion process were the aeration rate, inoculum size, the timing of substrate addition, and the fixed pH of the fermentation medium. So, those factors should be critically considered for the scaling-up of the biotransformation process.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Natural products, such as enzymatic hydrolysates and bioactive peptides from dietary sources, are safe alternatives to synthetic compounds linked to various deleterious effects. The purpose of this study is to determine the in vitro bioactivities (antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities) of Garcinia kola seeds enzymatic hydrolysates (GKPHs) at different enzyme (pepsin)-substrate ratios. G. kola protein, isolated by alkaline solubilization and acid precipitation, was hydrolyzed with pepsin at varying enzyme–substrate (E:S) ratios. The antioxidant parameters investigated include 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)-radical scavenging, hydrogen peroxide scavenging and ferrous ion (Fe 2+ ) chelating activities. For anti-inflammatory properties, membrane stabilization and protein denaturation activities tests were used. GKPH produced at 1:32 had the highest degree of hydrolysis (66.27 ± 4.21%). All GKPHs had excellent in vitro anti-inflammatory properties. However, only enzymatic hydrolysates produced at 1:16 (E:S) ratio chelated iron (II) and as well had the highest percentage hemolysis inhibition of 84.45 ± 0.007%, percentage protein denaturation inhibition of 53.36 ± 0.01% at maximum concentration and exhibited highest DPPH scavenging activity (87.24 ± 0.10%). The enzymatic hydrolysates had excellent solubility, emulsifying and foaming properties. It could be deduced from this study that pepsin at a ratio of 1:16 of G. kola protein produced the most effective enzymatic hydrolysates in terms of their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. G. kola pepsin enzymatic hydrolysates, thus, have potential in development as functional foods and as therapeutics pharmaceutical industries in the management of diseases associated with oxidative stress and inflammation owing to their excellent functional, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.",

To gain further information about the effect of tyrosol exposure, we revealed gene transcriptional changes using total transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq). At a concentration of 15 mM, tyrosol significantly decrease the growth of fungal cells within 2 h of its addition (5.6 × 10 7 ±1.2 × 10 7 and 2.5 × 10 7 ±0.6 × 10 7 colony forming unit/mL for control and tyrosol-treated cells, respectively).

Tyrosol exerted in a 37%, 25%, 34% and 55% decrease in intracellular manganese, iron, zinc and copper contents, respectively, compared to control cells. The tyrosol treatment led to a 142 and 108 differentially transcripted genes with at least a 1.5-fold increase or decrease in transcription, respectively. Genes related to iron and fatty acid metabolism as well as nucleic acid synthesis were down-regulated, whereas those related to the antioxidative defence, adhesion and oxoacid metabolic processes were up-regulated. This study shows that tyrosol significantly influences growth, intracellular physiological processes and gene transcription in C. auris , which could highly support the development of novel treatment approaches against this important pathogen.",

Furthermore, compared to the control group, the abundance of pathogenic microorganisms and virulence functional genes decreased while defense-related functional gene abundance increased significantly in the groups treated with OA and MA. Most importantly, the OA and MA treatments improved resistance to Vm117-T6, with survival rates of 70% (OA) and 80% (MA), compared to 15% in the control group. Overall, the findings suggest that OA and MA treatments have great potential for preventing Porphyra disease, as they improve phycosphere microorganisms and increase algae resistance to pathogenic bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In terms of pig farming, pig gut microbes have a significant effect on farmers and the farm environment. However, it is still unclear which microbial composition is more likely to contribute to this effect. This study collected a total of 136 samples, including pigs’ faeces samples, farmers’ faeces samples, samples from individuals who had no contact with any type of farm animal (referred to as ‘non-exposed’ persons), and environmental dust samples (collected from inside and outside pig houses and the farm) from two pig farms, pig farm A and pig farm B. Whereafter, 16S rRNA sequencing and taxonomic composition analysis were performed. According to the study, compared to non-exposed persons, pig farmers had a significantly higher abundance of 7 genera. In addition, the farmers were grouped according to the duration of their occupational exposure, and it was shown that 4 genera, including Turicibacter , Terrisporobacter , and Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 , exhibited a rise in more frequent contact with pigs. As compared to outside the pig house, the environmental dust has a greater concentration of the 3 bacteria mentioned before. Therefore, these 3 microbes can be considered as co-occurring microbes that may exist both in humans and the environment. Also, the 3 co-occurring microbes are involved in the fermentation and production of short-chain fatty acids and their effectiveness decreased as distance from the farm increased. This study shows that the 3 microbes where pig farmers co-occur with the environment come from pig farms, which provides fresh ideas for preventing the spread of microbial aerosols in pig farms and reducing pollution.",

In vitro, illumination with blue light inhibits both the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of this hybrid kinase, as well as the phosphoryl transfer to Ypd1, the phosphoryl transfer domain of the Sln1 system. The helical alignment was carried out with conservation of the complete Jα helix of YtvA, as well as of the phosphorylatable histidine residue of the Sln1 kinase, with conservation of the hepta-helical motive of coiled-coil structures, recognizable in the helices of the two separate, constituent, proteins. Introduction of the gene encoding this hybrid histidine protein kinase into cells of S. cerevisiae in which the endogenous Sln1 kinase had been deleted, allowed us to modulate gene expression in the yeast cells with (blue) light. This was first demonstrated via the light-induced alteration of the expression level of the mannosyl-transferase OCH1, via a translational-fusion approach. As expected, illumination decreased the expression level of OCH1; the steady state decrease in saturating levels of blue light was about 40%. To visualize the in vivo functionality of this light-dependent regulation system, we fused the green fluorescent protein (GFP) to another regulatory protein, HOG1, which is also responsive to the Sln1 kinase. HOG1 is phosphorylated by the MAP-kinase-kinase Pbs2, which in turn is under control of the Sln1 kinase, via the phosphoryl transfer domain Ypd1. Fluorescence microscopy was used to show that illumination of cells that contained the combination of the hybrid kinase and the HOG1::GFP fusion protein, led to a persistent increase in the level of nuclear accumulation of HOG1, in contrast to salt stress, which-as expected-showed the well-characterized transient response. The system described in this study will be valuable in future studies on the role of cytoplasmic diffusion in signal transduction in eukaryotic cells.",

It is intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics and has been reported resistant to the drugs of choice; ceftazidime. Microbial communities in soil in the presence and absence of B. pseudomallei were investigated using metagenomics approach. The variation in bacterial species diversity was significantly higher in soil samples without B. pseudomallei. Abundances of phyla Actinobacteria and Firmicutes were found significantly higher in B. pseudomallei-negative soils. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens KKU1 in phylum Firmicutes was discovered from negative soil and its secondary metabolites could inhibit clinical, environmental and drug resistant isolates of B. pseudomallei, together with some pathogenic Gram-negative but not Gram-positive bacteria. The antimicrobial activity from KKU 1 against B. pseudomallei was abolished when treated with proteinase K, stable in a wide range of pH and remained active after heating at 100 °C for 15 min. Precipitated proteins from KKU1 were demonstrated to cause lysis and corrugated surfaces of B. pseudomallei. The minimum inhibitory concentrations and minimum bactericidal concentrations of the precipitated proteins from KKU1 against B. pseudomallei were 0.97 μg/ml and 3.9 μg/ml. Interestingly, Native SDS-PAGE showed small active compounds of less than 6 kDa, along with other information collectively suggesting the properties of antimicrobial peptides. For the first time, culture-independent information in melioidosis endemic area could lead to a suspected source of metabolites that may help defense against B. pseudomallei and other pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria.",

Under optimal conditions, strain DW-1 could completely degrade up to 1500 mg/L of 3-hydroxypyridine in 66 h. The 3-hydroxypyridine degradation pathway of strain DW-1 was suggested by HPLC and LC-MS analysis. The first reaction of 3-hydroxypyridine degradation in strain DW-1 was α-hydroxylation so that the major metabolite 2,5-dihydroxypyridine was produced, and then 2,5-dihydroxypyridine was transformed by a Fe2+-dependent dioxygenase to form N-formylmaleamic acid. N-Formylmaleamic acid will be transformed to maleic acid and fumaric acid through maleamic acid.

In the present research, following the sampling and testing phases, a system dynamics model was developed for modeling of phosphorus in facultative stabilization ponds. First, the scheme of soluble reactive phosphorous stock, its specifications and parameters were determined and created in the VenSim PLE 7.1 software. Then, mathematical relations were determined for each process. Finally, the model was calibrated and verified based on the data from the Yazd facultative ponds, Iran. Sensitivity analysis showed that the most important factors affecting phosphorus concentration in the ponds are the phosphorus settling rate, losses caused by algal respiration and excretion, while the losses caused by herbivorous zooplanktons, hydrolysis rate of inorganic carbon, and ratio of phosphorus to chlorophyll-a had the least importance. Results showed that, algal growth rate and phosphorus settling rate were important factors in phosphorus removal. Hence, with appropriate retention time in the pond, it can be managed more properly. The ratio of phosphorus to algae had less importance in the model. The ratio of carbon to phosphorus and rate of respiration of carnivorous zooplanktons did not affect the phosphorus concentration. It is recommended that this model can be used for pond management and overall assessment of facultative ponds.",

Regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs) designed to control target gene expression for applications in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology have been successfully developed and used. However, the effect on the heterologous expression of species- or strain-specific ncRNAs in other bacterial strains remains poorly understood. In this work, a Pseudomonas stutzeri species-specific regulatory ncRNA, NfiS, which has been shown to play an important role in the response to oxidative stress as well as osmotic stress in P. stutzeri A1501, was cloned and transferred to the Escherichia coli strain Trans10. Recombinant NfiS-expressing E. coli, namely, Trans10-nfiS, exhibited significant enhancement of tolerance to oxidative stress. To map the possible gene regulatory networks mediated by NfiS in E. coli under oxidative stress, a microarray assay was performed to delineate the transcriptomic differences between Trans10-nfiS and wild-type E. coli under H2O2 shock treatment conditions. In all, 1184 genes were found to be significantly altered, and these genes were divided into mainly five functional categories: stress response, regulation, metabolism related, transport or membrane protein and unknown function. Our results suggest that the P. stutzeri species-specific ncRNA NfiS acts as a regulator that integrates adaptation to H2O2 with other cellular stress responses and helps protect E. coli cells against oxidative damage.",

The bio-capsule, the fat-rich body, and some body components of the silkworm pupae, which deliver antigens passing through the harsh environment of digestive tract and reaching the intestine, have been used as a vehicle for oral vaccines. In the present study, to develop a novel oral vaccine against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), the PEDV spike (S) protein was expressed in silkworm pupae and BmN cells using the BEV system. After three doses of oral administrations with 2-week intervals in pigs, neither PEDV S protein-specific humoral nor mucosal immune responses can be detected. The failure of eliciting the PEDV-specific immune response suggested that the BEV system using BmN cells or silkworm pupae as oral immunogen-expression vehicles was not able to overcome the immunological unresponsiveness, which was possibly due to gastrointestinal specific barriers and oral tolerance. Better strategies to enhance the delivery and immunogenicity of oral vaccines should be further investigated. Nevertheless, the PEDV S protein generated in the BmN cells and silkworm pupae herein provides an efficient tool to produce the recombinant antigen for future applications.",

The metabolic processes that lead to the biosynthesis of this compound are unknown. In this study, 10 P. acidilactici , including FAM18098 and nine Pediococcus pentosaceus strains, were screened for their ability to produce AABA. All P. acidilactici strains produced AABA, whereas the P. pentosaceus strains did not. The genomes of the pediococcal strains were sequenced and searched for genes encoding aminotransferases to test the hypothesis that AABA could result from the transamination of α-ketobutyrate. A GenBank and KEGG database search revealed the presence of a species-specific aminotransferase in P. acidilactici . The gene was cloned and its gene product was produced as a His-tagged fusion protein in Escherichia coli to determine the substrate specificity of this enzyme. The purified recombinant protein showed aminotransferase activity at pH 5.5. It catalyzed the transfer of the amino group from leucine, methionine, AABA, alanine, cysteine, and phenylalanine to the amino group acceptor α-ketoglutarate. Αlpha-ketobutyrate could replace α-ketoglutarate as an amino group acceptor. In this case, AABA was produced at significantly higher levels than glutamate. The results of this study show that P. acidilactici possesses a novel aminotransferase that might play a role in cheese biochemistry and has the potential to be used in biotechnological processes for the production of AABA.",

The protective effect of DOP was estimated by assessing cognitive function using the neurological score and the Morris water maze. Neuronal apoptosis was assessed in the hippocampus using the TUNEL assay, and protein expression of caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2 was measured by Western blotting. The levels of cytokines and oxidative stress parameters were assessed by ELISA. Western blotting and RT-PCR were performed to measure the expression of NF-kB, TLR-4, Sirt-1, and cyclin B1 protein in the brain. The cognitive function and neurological function scores were improved in the DOP group compared with the ISF group. Moreover, DOP treatment reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells and the expression of caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2 protein in the brains of rats with neuronal injury. The levels of mediators of inflammation and oxidative stress were reduced in the brain tissue of the DOP group. Treatment with DOP attenuated the protein expression of TLR-4, NF-kB, cyclin B1, and Sirt-1 in the brain tissue of rats with neuronal injury. In conclusion, DOP ameliorates neuronal apoptosis and improves cognitive function in rats with ISF-induced neuronal injury.

Through enriching protein-bound DNA fragments to construct luciferase reporter libraries, we found that, of 280 clones collected and sequenced, 131 clones contained either the promoter-35 and -10 conservative sequences and/or an operator transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) region. To demonstrate the functionality of the identified clones, five of 131 clones containing LexA binding sequence have been demonstrated to be induced in response to mitomycin C treatment. To evaluate our libraries as a functional screening library, 80 randomly picked up clones were cultured and treated with and without MMC, where two clones were shown to have greater than twofold induction. In addition, two arsenite-responsive clones were identified from 90 clones, one having the well-known ArsR and another having the osmotically inducible lipoprotein (OsmE1).

We report the generation of plasmids for the expression of the heterologous mNG gene under the control of an inducible and a constitutive promoter in the filamentous ascomycete Sordaria macrospora and display a stable expression of mNG in the cytoplasm. To demonstrate its usefulness for labeling of organelles, the peroxisomal targeting sequence serine-lysine-leucine (SKL) was fused to mNG. Expression of this tagged version led to protein import of mNG into peroxisomes and their bright fluorescence in life cell imaging.",

The survival rates conferred by promoters were assessed in the presence of 100 μg.ml-1 neomycin. The correlation between the transcriptional activity of the aphII gene (estimated by RT-PCR) and the resistance to neomycin (expressed as survival rate) indicated a sigmoid rather than a linear correlation. In this issue, we propose a tentative explanation for this sigmoidal pattern of resistance in relation with the level of aphII gene expression. Beyond this specific example, our model might constitute a sound explanation for the generally observed but never explained sigmoidal shape of classical inhibition curves obtained in the presence of linearly increasing antibiotic concentrations.",

The application of the established OXD assay is thereby expanded from high-throughput activity screenings and colony-based screenings of heterologously expressed mutants to a direct identification of ω-TAs in wild-type strains: This assay can be used to detect the protein band of the respective enzyme in crude extracts of novel isolates by visual inspection of native PAGEs without any upstream protein purification, thus enabling subsequent further investigations of a newly discovered enzyme directly from the crude extract.",

The genetic manipulation was successfully achieved through the conjugation transformation method, and sulfide: quinone oxidoreductase gene (sqr) was expressed via pBBR1MCS derivative plasmid. Furthermore, a whole-cell catalyst system was developed by using the engineered strain that exhibited a higher rate of sulfide oxidation under the optimal alkaline pH of 9.0. The whole-cell catalyst could be recycled six times to maintain the sulfide oxidation rates from 41.451 to 80.216 µmol·min-1·g-1 dry cell mass.

Such variations have hindered the development of a standardized culture media to promote morel’s sustainable production. The aim of this study is developing a novel culture media that takes advantage of coconut water as a complementary component of culture media. Coconut water has been extensively used as a growth-promoting component for plant tissue cultures; however, its application as component of fungi cultivation medium has not been fully developed. This study confirms that coconut water can be efficiently used as culture media component for morels using a kinetic characterization. Morchella sp. kinetic growth is evaluated in different cultures: agar, malt extract agar (MEA), lactose, coconut water (15%) and combinations of them. Kinetic growth parameters (lag phase, λ and maximum specific growth rate, µ max ) are estimated using primary modeling methods. Among the selected models, the best fit is achieved using Baranyi’s model. A significant increase from 15.8% to 43.4% of the µ max values was observed when culture media (agar, lactose, MEA) is supplemented with coconut water. The largest values of µ max are obtained in MEA-coconut cultures (21.13 ± 0.43–22.57 ± 0.35). Micro-sclerotia and late sclerotia are observed in all cultures containing coconut water justifying the development of a feasible and cost-effective way of culturing morels. The results demonstrate that coconut water can be used for formulation of standard media for morel cultivation leading to a cheap alternative to produce dense mycelium and promote sclerotia formation.",

Medicago sativa as a common forage was also considered as control. We determined the chemical-mineral composition, buffering capacity, in vitro gas yield, ruminal fermentation, and protozoa population in a culture medium with the standard laboratory methods. A significant difference in chemical-mineral compounds was observed among the studied plants (p < 0.05). A lower crude protein range (6.28% for Cichorium intybus L. to 18.4% for Melissa officinalis L.) was observed rather than Medicago sativa (20.3%). The amount of calcium was highest in Peganum harmala L. (23.5-24.2 g/kg DM) and lowest in Ruta graveolens L. (1.15-1.25 g/kg DM). Dracocephalum moldavica L. exhibited the highest acid-base buffering capacity (235-242 mEq×10-3) among other plants. The highest decrease in total protozoa and other protozoan populations was observed when Perovskia abrotanoides Kar. was added to the culture medium. Teucrium Polium L. had the greatest potential gas yield and its total volatile fatty acid was comparable with Medicago sativa. It seems that eight plants are nutritionally suitable for partial replacement of the conventional plants such as Medicago sativa in diets of small ruminants, however dietary supplementation of Peganum harmala L. due to its alkaloids content should be done with caution.",

After entering the peaceful era, several countries around the globe have focused on the destruction of expired ammunition using safe and economical methods in terms of consumption of energy. Microorganisms exhibit a highly efficient and environment friendly degradation capability for variety of refractory substances. Therefore, in this study we screened five strains of microorganisms from five environmental soil samples for their ability to degrade HTPB. These microorganisms were identified as Microbacterium trichothecenolyticum , Microbacterium esteraromaticum , Arthrobacter pascens , Pseudonocardia carboxydivorans and Ochrobactrum anthropic based on 16S rRNA gene similarity index. We observed the uncorroded and corroded HTPB sample through scanning electron microscopy and observed the formation of lot of holes and gullies in HTPB after corrosion. An 18S rRNA gene clone library was constructed for HTPB-degrading fungi. Based on the results of library evaluation, it was found that the structure of the HTPB-degrading fungi community was relatively simple. A total of 54 positive clones were obtained. These clones represented some uncultured microorganisms that were closely related to Scytalidium lignicola , Pseudokahliella and Gonostomum strenuum . This study will help in the implementation of environment friendly degradation strategies for HTPB degradation.",

SIF was first isolated as a monoacetylated derivative (2, 4.1 mg from 655 g soybean curd residues), and its chemical structure was elucidated by field desorption mass spectrometry, electron ionization mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses. After 48-h incubation, 40 µM diacetonamine hydrochloride (1b) exhibited sporulation-inducing activity with 35% sporulation frequency toward a Bacillus amyloliquefaciens wild-type strain (AHU 2170), whereas 40 µM diacetone acrylamide (3) showed 99% sporulation induction, which was much higher than that of 1b. Although Bacillus megaterium NBRC 15308 was sporulated by the treatment with 400 µM 1b with 36 and 70% sporulation frequency after 72- and 96-h incubation respectively, 3 at the same concentration showed only 2% sporulation after 72-h incubation. Hence, diacetonamine (1) was characterized as a genuine SIF from soybean curd residues, but it was uncertain whether 1 is a natural product or an artifact. Spores of B. amyloliquefaciens induced by 1b survived after treatment with heating at 95 °C for 10 min, also suggesting that 1 is genuine SIF in soybean curd residue. As sporulation induction is likely linked to activation of antibiotic production in some spore-forming Firmicutes bacteria, compound 1 would be a possible chemical tool to develop an effective fermentation technology in Bacillus species.",

It has also not been established whether this protocol can be used for genome editing in other bacterial species. In the current study, the protocol was modified to dramatically decrease the occurrence of false-positive colonies using Pseudomonas stutzeri A1501 as a model strain. This improvement was reached by increasing the occurrence of circular-DNA cassettes of the correct size. Furthermore, the enhanced protocol was used to construct mutants in both the gram-negative Escherichia coli BL21 and gram-positive Bacillus subtilis 168 strains. The protocol works well in both strains, yielding ideal results with a low percentage of false-positive colonies.

The in vitro and in vivo investigation revealed that IFN-CSP has significant anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) effect and liver-targeting capacity. However, due to the IFN-CSP tends to form inclusion bodies in recombinant Escherichia coli (E. coli), efficient production of the soluble liver-targeting interferon is a challenge. In view of biomedical application, novel strategies for efficiently expressing liver-targeting interferon and overcoming its poor solubility are necessary and important. In the present study, a modified mu-IFN-CSP was designed base on the amino acid mutant of the native IFN-CSP. Meanwhile, the coding sequence of mu-IFN-CSP was optimized for E. coli preferred codon and the induction conditions for expression were optimized by an orthogonal test. After amino acid mutant, codon optimization and induction conditions optimization, the solubility of Mu-IFN-CSP in E. coli was up to 98.4%. The structural comparison and molecular dynamic simulation showed that the Mu-IFN-CSP formed three structure changes and were more stable than the native IFN-CSP. Tissue sections binding assays revealed that Mu-IFN-CSP was also able to specific binding to liver. In vitro anti-HBV activity assays showed that the soluble Mu-IFN-CSP has improved anti-HBV effect in HepG2.2.15 cells compared to the native IFN-CSP. The present study reports for the first time that liver-targeting interferon Mu-IFN-CSP can be expressed as soluble form, and also contributes to further support its application as liver-targeting anti-HBV medicine.",

GPxs and TPxs generally use GSH or Trx, respectively, to recycle the oxidized cysteine (Cys) residue in the protein. However, it is unclear why unlike human GPxs, the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Gpx1 (spGpx1) prefers Trx over GSH for recycling of the active-site peroxidatic Cys residue. Here, we compared spGpx1 and S. pombe Tpx1 (spTpx1) protein sequences with those of their respective homologs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and humans. Our analysis revealed that like spTpx1, spGpx1 contains a pair of conserved Cys residues (Cys36 and Cys82). These two conserved Cys residues are named peroxidatic and resolving Cys residues, respectively, and are found only in GPxs and TPxs that prefer Trx as an electron donor. Our analysis suggested that Cys36 and Cys82 in spGpx1 are most likely to form a disulfide bond upon oxidation of Cys36. Molecular modelling predicted that a conformational change might be required for the formation of this disulfide bond. Evolutionary analysis suggested that fungal GPxs and TPxs are related by divergent evolution from a common ancestor. Our analyses support a prediction that while spGpx1 and spTpx1 are phylogenetically and functionally different, they evolved from a common ancestor and use a similar mechanism for recycling of the active-site peroxidatic Cys residue.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of drug-resistant strains of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) has challenged tuberculosis control programs. So far, few studies using the 24-locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit variable number tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTR) have investigated the genetic diversity of MTB in Iran. This study aimed to determine the genetic diversity of MTB isolates resistant to first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs using 24-locus MIRU-VNTR in southwestern Iran. Out of 6620 MTB clinical isolates, 29 resistant isolates to one or more isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol were detected using drug susceptibility testing by the proportional method. The manual 24-locus MIRU-VNTR was used to determine the MTB resistant isolates' phylogenetic relationship. MIRU-VNTRplus web application tools were applied to analyze the associated data. Using 24-locus MIRU-VNTR, 13.8% of isolates (n = 4) were distributed in two clusters, and the remaining 86.2% (n = 25) showed a unique pattern. Four clonal complexes were observed in the minimum spanning tree based on the double-locus variant. Most isolates belonged to Delhi/CAS (34.5%, 10/29) and NEW-1 (24.1%, 7/29) sub-lineages, followed by EAI and LAM with a frequency of 6.9% (2/29) and 3.5% (1/29), respectively. Eight isolates (27.6%) did not match any genotype in the database. The 24-locus MIRU-VNTR showed a high discriminatory power; however, the 15-locus and 12-locus set analyses were more discriminative. Our study revealed a high degree of genetic diversity among drug-resistant MTB isolates, which could be interpreted as the low rate of person-to-person transmission in this region. The 15-locus MIRU-VNTR would be recommended for preliminary genotyping of drug-resistant MTB.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recombinant production of mussel foot proteins among marine-inspired proteinaceous adhesive materials has been attracted high attention for medical applications, due to their exceptional versatility potential of hierarchically arranged nanostructures. Various biochemical and proteinous factors such as amyloid CsgA curli protein have been used as a synergistic factor to enhance the constancy of obtained bio-adhesion but their mechanistic interactions have not yet been deeply investigated widely in different pH conditions. To this end, the present study has first sought to assess molecular simulation and prediction by using RosettaFold to predict the 3-dimensional structure of the fused CsgA subunit and the MFP3 protein followed by in vitro verification. It was developed an ensemble of quantitative structure-activity relationship models relying on simulations according to the surface area and molecular weight values of the fused proteins in acidic to basic situations using PlayMolecule (protein preparation app for MD simulations) online databases followed by molecular dynamic simulation at different pHs. It was found that acidic conditions positively affect adhesive strength throughout the chimeric structure based on comparative structure-based analyses along with those obtained in prevailing literature. Atomic force microscopy analysis was confirmed obtained in silico data which showed enhanced adhesive properties of fused protein after self-assembly in low pH conditions. In conclusion, the augmented model for reactivity predictions not only unravels the performance and explain ability of the adhesive proteins but in turn paves the way for the decision-making process for chimeric subunits modifications needed for future industrial production.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Contaminated surfaces are vehicles for the spread of infectious disease-causing microorganisms. A strategy to prevent their spread is applying antimicrobial coatings to surfaces. Both nanostructured anatase rutile and carbon (NsARC), a TiO 2 formulation, and copper are examples of antimicrobial agents that are used in making or coating door handles and similar surfaces, to reduce microbial loads. Antimicrobial surfaces have been extensively tested for antimicrobial activity but not sublethal effects, such as exposure-associated multiple antibiotic resistance phenotypes usually caused by induction of efflux pump genes. The possibility of NsARC and copper inducing indicative efflux pump pathways was investigated by monitoring the expression of mScarlet fluorescent protein (FP) in two reporter strains of Escherichia coli. There was an increase in the expression of FP in the reporter strains exposed to NsARC and copper relative to the inert control composed of stainless steel. Furthermore we tested E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus following 8 h of exposure to NsARC for changes in resistance to selected antibiotics. E. coli that were exposed to NsARC became more susceptible to kanamycin but there was no significant change in susceptibility of S . aureus to any tested antibiotics. These findings suggests that even though NsARC and copper are antimicrobial, they also have some potential to cause unintended phenotypes.",

In addition to the microbial resistance of the currently available therapeutic drugs as well as, its prolonged side effects make its use is of health care concern. Green nanotechnology approach is a promising solution for controlling such infectious diseases and many biomedical purposes. In the present study, green synthesis approach based on microwave-assisted hydrothermal method is an innovative and environmentally friendly method for preparation of bioactive CeO 2 and ZnO nanorod structured materials using Olea europaea (O. e.) leaf plant extract as a natural medicinal capping agent for controlling the shape and size of nano-products. The optical and structural analyses of the obtained nanorod-structures are characterized using; TEM, FTIR, XRD, SBET analyses and particle size analyzer. The green-synthesized ZnO and CeO 2 nanorods display an average crystallite size of approximately 15 and 5 nm, respectively. The antimicrobial activity of ZnO and CeO 2 nanorods compared with the traditional hydrothermal methods, was examined on six clinical pathogens including; ( E. coli Serratia sp. , S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus mutant, and MRSA ). The results indicated superior antimicrobial and anti-tumor activities towards hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (IC 50 = 117.24 and 103.50 μg mL −1 for ZnO and CeO 2 and LD 50 &gt; 3000 mg kg −1 ). This demonstrates that the green microwave process is a promising approach for the synthesis of effective ZnO and CeO 2 nanomaterials applied for many biomedical applications.",

The synthetic hEKL gene was cloned into the pET-15 expression vector and transferred into the three different expression strains of E. coli BL21(DE3), NiCo21, and SHuffle T7 Express. Different growth and induction conditions were studied using a statistical response surface methodology (RSM). Recombinant hEKL protein was expressed at high levels in soluble form with 0.71 mM IPTG after 4 h of induction at 25 °C. Autocatalytic process cleaved TRX tag with enterokinase recognition site by the impure hEKL and yielded the mature enzyme. The target protein was then purified to homogeneity (> 95%) by affinity chromatography. The activity of hEKL was comparable to the commercial enzyme. From 1 L culture, 80 mg pure active hEKL was obtained with the specific activity of 6.25 × 102 U/mg. Three main parameters that help us to produce the enzyme in the folded and active form are the type of strain, SHuffle T7 strain, TRX and histidine fusion tags, and growth conditions including the increase of OD of induction and IPTG concentration and the decrease of induction temperature.",

The wide substrate specificity makes POx potential for application in various biotechnological industries. In the present study we reported the gene cloning and heterologous expression of a POx from the basidiomycete Trametes sp. and functionally expressed the gene in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Based on sequence alignment, three residues were chosen for site-directed mutagenesis to obtain two single mutants (K312E and E539K) and two double mutants (T166A/E539K and K312E/E539K). In comparison to the wild-type, K312E shifted its optimal pH to 5.5 while the optimal temperature of E539K and K312E/E539K increased by 10 °C. The mutants retained more activities over broader pH ranges and higher temperatures and catalyzed d-glucose at higher efficiency (5800‒12,667 M−1 s−1 for the mutants versus 5083 M−1 s−1 for the wild-type). The recombinant POx and its mutants were all useful in gluten agglomeration and enlarging the loaf volume, which depends on the amounts of enzymes added. Interestingly, adding the same amount (0.5 nkat/g of flour) of wild-type and mutant enzymes differed in the change of loaf volumes, pinpointing that the catalytic activity is not the sole determinant in applying POx in breadmaking.",

IPP application can increase crop yield, and also lead to insecticide residue and pollution in soils, which will affect microbial population and community composition in soils. In this study, four different types of soils were employed to inquire into the impact of IPP on eukaryal community and species-group through pyrosequencing of 18S rRNA gene amplicons. Fungal population differed in different soils at different days after IPP treatment (DAT). Eukaryal community species in CK (control check) groups were more rich than that with Paichongding sprayed at 5 DAT, while eukaryal species in CK soils at 60 DAT was relatively slight. Shannon's H' analysis indicated fungal species in CK soils were also higher at 5 DAT and relative lower at 60 DAT, except in soil C. There are also differences in the phyla and genus levels of the eukaryotic communities in the soil. After IPP application, the relative abundance of Nectriaceae increased 3–4 times in soil C. In soil F, Phaeosphaeriaceae increased to 57.3% at 5 DAT. The genus of Guehomyces, Aspergillus and Alternaria increased from 3.1 to 9.7, 1.1 to 4.6, 1.5 to 6.7% in soil H, respectively.",

The results showed that the production of VSCs positively correlated with the cell biomass, but it seemed that no clear relationship with l-methionine concentration existed. Temperature and pH significantly affected the formation of VSCs with more production at 30 °C and pH 5, respectively. Nitrogen supplementation (in the form of diammonium phosphate, DAP) repressed the production of VSCs. It is interesting to note that DAP and yeast extract supplementation induced the production of methional, but not Mn2+ supplementation. The presence of Mn2+ improved the production of methionol and dimethyl disulphide, but inhibited the formation of S-methyl thioacetate. The study indicated that optimization of physicochemical conditions and media composition would be crucial for producing l-methionine-derived VSC bioflavor.",

While the PsJN culture became stationary after entire (S)-β-PA consumption, BS115 showed further growth at a considerably slower rate, consuming (R)-β-PA without generation of AP which points to a different degradation mechanism for this enantiomer.

The largest (280-kDa) component protein, called S1, has cellulose-binding ability and xylanase activity, thus was considered to function like the scaffolding proteins found in cellulosomes. S1 consists of 863 amino acid residues with predicted molecular mass 91,029 Da and includes two N-terminal surface layer homology (SLH) domains, but most of its sequence shows no homology with proteins of known function. Native S1 (nS1) was highly glycosylated. Purified nS1 and recombinant Xyn11A (rXyn11A) as a major xylanase subunit could assemble in a complex, but recombinant S1 (rS1) could not interact with rXyn11A, indicating that S1 glycosylation is necessary for assembly of the multienzyme complex. nS1 and rS1 showed weak, typical endo-xylanase activity, even though they have no homology with known glycosyl hydrolase family enzymes. S1 and its SLH domains bound tightly to the peptide-glycan layer of P. curdlanolyticus B-6, microcrystalline cellulose, and insoluble xylan, indicating that the SLHs of S1 bind to carbohydrate polymers and the cell surface. When nS1 and rXyn11A were co-incubated with birchwood xylan, the degradation ability was synergistically increased compared with that for each protein; however synergy was not observed for rS1 and rXynA. These results indicate that S1 may have a scaffolding protein-like function by interaction with enzyme subunits and polysaccharides through its glycosylated sites and SLH domains.",

The consortia were found to cluster according to digester type rather than substrate or metal(loid) composition. For selected plants, individual As species in the liquid and gaseous phases were quantified, showing that the microorganisms actively metabolize and thereby remove the As from their environment via the formation of (methylated) volatile species. The As metabolites showed some dependency on the microbial consortia, while there was no statistical correlation with the substrate mix. Finally, slurry from one agricultural biogas plant and one sewage sludge digester was transferred into laboratory scale reactors (\"satellite reactors\") and the response to a defined addition of As (30 and 60 µM sodium arsenite) was studied. The results corroborate the hypothesis of a rapid conversion of dissolved As species into volatile ones. Methanogenesis was reduced during that time, while there was no discernable toxic effect on the microbial population. However, the utilization of the produced biogas as replacement for natural gas, e.g. as fuel, may be problematic, as catalysts and machinery are known to suffer from prolonged exposure even to low As concentrations.",

In this study, the growth rate and DHA production in C. cohnii were optimized in a new defined media, and the biosynthesis of U- 13 C-DHA from U- 13 C-glucose and U- 14 C-DHA from U- 14 C-glucose were analyzed by HPLC–MS/MS. Approximately 40 nmoles of U- 13 C-DHA with higher isotopic purity of 96.8% was produced in a 300 μL batch, and ~ 0.23 μCi of U- 14 C-DHA with significant specific activity of 5–6 Ci/mol was produced in a 300 μL batch. It was found that C. cohnii had the optimal growth and DHA accumulation at 25 °C in this defined media (C/N = 10). An efficient protocol for the biosynthesis of U- 13 C-DHA and U- 14 C-DHA were set up firstly, which provides the basic support for the analysis of oxidative degradation products of DHA in AD.",

    "abstract": "Despite the threat of Fusarium dieback posed due to ambrosia fungi cultured by ambrosia beetles such as Euwallacea spp., the wood-degradation mechanisms utilized by ambrosia fungi are not fully understood. In this study, we analyzed the 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes of the microbial community from the Ficus tree tunnel excavated by Euwallacea interjectus and isolated the cellulose-degrading fungus, Fusarium spp. strain EI, by enrichment culture with carboxymethyl cellulose as the sole carbon source. The cellulolytic enzyme secreted by the fungus was identified and expressed in Pichia pastoris, and its enzymatic properties were characterized. The cellulolytic enzyme, termed FsXEG12A, could hydrolyze carboxymethyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, xyloglucan, lichenan, and glucomannan, indicating that the broad substrate specificity of FsXEG12A could be beneficial for degrading complex wood components such as cellulose, xyloglucan, and galactoglucomannan in angiosperms. Inhibition of FsXEG12A function is, thus, an effective target for Fusarium dieback caused by Euwallacea spp.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus suis, a major emerging pathogen in swine and humans, expresses immunoglobulin G (IgG)-binding proteins (IBPs), which contribute to the ability of organism to evasion of host immune system. The objective of this study was to identify novel pig IgG (pIgG) and human IgG (hIgG)-binding proteins and characterize the binding regions of enolase from Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2). Here, four pIgG-binding proteins (pIBPs) and five hIgG-binding proteins (hIBPs) were identified from S. suis 2 surface proteins by 2D-Far-western blot assays. All the newly captured proteins were expressed and further confirmed their binding activity to pIgG or hIgG by Far-western blot and dot blot. In addition to previously identified factor H, fibronectin, collagen, fibrinogen, plasminogen and laminin, we also found that both pIgG and hIgG can specifically interact with enolase. Binding assays indicated that interactions of S. suis 2 enolase with pIgG and hIgG is primarily mediated by the enolase C-terminal portion (Enolase-C, a.a. 142-432). We found that hIgG exhibited stronger binding ability to Enolase-C than pIgG. Further analysis of the C-terminal regions of enolase (Enolase-C1 and Enolase-C2) suggested that the C-terminus possessed two different binding domains with distinct host IgG proteins. Strikingly, we confirmed that pIgG interacted with the Enolase-C1 (a.a. 142-271) and hIgG interacted with the Enolase-C2 (a.a. 271-432). These observations of enolase provide interesting insights in the pathogenesis of S. suis infection.",

    "abstract": "Porcine pleuropneumonia caused by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP) is a swine respiratory disease with an important impact around the world either as a single infection or part of the porcine respiratory disease complex. The data of interaction between hosts and pathogens has becoming more crucial for exploration of the mechanism. However, up to now, comparatively little information is available on the systemic and dynamic changes that occur in pig serum in response to APP infection. This study used iTRAQ to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in pig serum in response to APP infection. Compared with the APP un-infected group (S0),there were 137 up-regulated and 68 down-regulated proteins at 24 h (S24), and 81 up-regulated and 107 down-regulated proteins at 120 h (S120). At 24 h, the immune response was not significantly enriched, but cell adhesion, cytosol, Golgi apparatus, GTP and ATP binding and regulation of cell cycle were extremely active, implying host preparation of immune response starting. Subsequently, innate immune response, negative regulation of apoptotic process, immunological synapse, adaptive immune response, the regulation of inflammatory response, positive regulation of T cell proliferation were more enhanced at 120 h then that of 24 h, representing innate immunity transferring to the adaptive, while endocytosis, cell adhesion and platelet aggregation showed obvious decline. The pathways of T cell receptor signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, complement and coagulation cascades, leukocyte transendothelial migration were active remarkably during all infection period, and more pathways could connect to form innate immune defense networks. Surprisingly, the pathways like amoebiasis, rheumatoid arthritis and malaria had been found up-regulated. As a conclusion, APP could delay host inflammatory response to the infection at early stage, and induced innate immunity to convert from adhesion, interaction into complement activation, proteasome digestion, bacterial invasion at later stage. This would increase our understanding of the porcine distinct response to APP infection.",

Recent advances in membrane-bioreactor-based open mixed microbial cultures, enable robust conversion of fluctuating streams of food residues to a mixture of volatile fatty acids (VFAs). In this study, such a mixed stream of VFAs was investigated as a substrate for Escherichia coli, a well-studied organism suitable for application in further conversion of the acids into compounds of higher value, and/or that are easier to separate from the aqueous medium. E. coli was cultured in batch on a VFA-rich anaerobic digest of food residues, tolerating up to 40 mM of total VFAs without any reduction in growth rate. In carbon-limited chemostats of E. coli W3110 ΔFadR on a simulated VFA mixture, the straight-chain VFAs (C2-C6) in the mixture were readily consumed simultaneously. At a dilution rate of 0.1 h-1, mainly acetic-, propionic- and caproic acid were consumed, while consumption of all the provided acids were observed at 0.05 h-1. Interestingly, also the branched isovaleric acid was consumed through a hitherto unknown mechanism. In total, up to 80% of the carbon from the supplied VFAs was consumed by the cells, and approximately 2.7% was excreted as nucleotide precursors in the medium. These results suggest that VFAs derived from food residues are a promising substrate for E. coli.",

Our previous study showed the possibility that 4-amino-4-deoxyarabinitol was enzymatically converted to nectrisine but the enzyme was not known. In order to characterize the enzyme, which is designated as NecC, it was purified from the fungus using ammonium sulfate precipitation and anion exchange chromatography. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of NecC tryptic digests revealed partial NecC protein sequences. Subsequently, the partial DNA fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction with degenerate oligonucleotide primers and cloned. Then, necC complete genomic DNA was cloned by screening a genomic library of the fungus. Recombinant NecC also had NecC enzymatic activity, thus providing verification for the necC gene. NecC presumably belonged to the family of glucose methanol choline oxidoreductases, forming oligomers ranging approximately from 8 mer to 16 mer based on the results of native PAGE, and was also found to have a melting temperature of 57 °C, an optimal reaction condition of pH 7 at 30 °C, an activity inhibited by Cu(2+) or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and 4-amino-4-deoxyarabinitol as its preferred substrate. It was also indicated that not nectrisine but 4-amino-4-deoxyarabinitol was mainly extracted from the mycelium, and then was converted to nectrisine by the enzyme NecC in vitro. We believe that these findings are helpful to establish a nectrisine manufacturing process at large scale with the fungus.",

Here, we found a method to suppress Bac7 (1–35) toxicity in E. coli to establish its high expression system, in which Bac7 (1–35) was fused to the C-terminal end of protein S, a major spore-coat protein from Myxococcus xanthus, using a linker containing a Factor Xa cleavage site.

The combination of protein S fusion and its expression in the SPP system at low temperature appeared to suppress Bac7 (1–35) toxicity. Both the purified His6-PrS2-Bac7 (1–35) and His6-PrS2-Bac7 (1–35) treated by Factor Xa were proven to be a potent inhibitor for cell-free protein synthesis.",

The experiment successfully constructed a cofD gene knock-out M. ruminantium via homologous recombination technology. The results showed that the logarithmic phase of mutant M. ruminantium (12 h) was lower than the wild-type (24 h). The maximum biomass and specific growth rate of mutant M. ruminantium were significantly lower ( P &lt; 0.05) than those of wild-type, and the maximum biomass of mutant M. ruminantium was approximately half of the wild-type; meanwhile, the proliferation was reduced. The synthesis amount of coenzyme F 420 of M. ruminantium was significantly decreased ( P &lt; 0.05) after the cofD gene knock-out. Moreover, the maximum amount of H 2 consumed and CH 4 produced by mutant were 14 and 2% of wild-type M. ruminantium respectively. In conclusion, cofD gene knock-out induced the decreased growth rate and reproductive ability of M. ruminantium . Subsequently, the synthesis of coenzyme F 420 was decreased. Ultimately, the production capacity of CH 4 in M. ruminantium was reduced. Our research provides evidence that cofD gene plays an indispensable role in the regulation of coenzyme F 420 synthesis and CH 4 production in M. ruminantium .",

    "abstract": "Abstract Brisket disease (BD) is common among Holstein heifers in high-altitude environments, and this disease may result in serious economic loss. At present, no effective treatment is available for brisket disease. In this study, liver and cecum samples were collected from five heifers with BD and five healthy heifers (HH) for analyses of the metabolome and microbiota. The mean pulmonary arterial pressure and systolic blood pressure were significantly higher in BD heifers, whereas the average breathing rate, blood oxygen saturation, and glucose level were significantly lower in BD group than in the HH group. Further, 16S rDNA data showed that the abundance of Firmicutes was significantly lower and that of Bacteroidetes was significantly higher in BD group than in the HH group. At the genus level, the BD group heifers harbored fewer Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae than the HH group. Several metabolites, including beta- d -fructose, d -ribose, 1,4-beta- d -glucan, sucrose, and glucose-6-phosphate were present at low levels in BD heifers. Moreover, the mean pulmonary arterial pressure was negatively correlated with beta- d -fructose (r = − 0.74; P = 0.013), d -ribose (r = − 0.72; P = 0.018), and acetyl-tyrosine-ethyl-ester (r = − 0.71; P = 0.022). We also found that mean pulmonary arterial pressure was negatively correlated with most of the genera, including those in the families of Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae. In summary, the decreased levels of metabolites and microbial genera might affect BD by limiting the energy supply. This study may help us better understand the role of the microbiota in BD and provide new insights into the management of feeding to decrease the rate of BD in Holstein dairy cows in the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau.",

L-arabinose is the second most abundant pentose sugar present in the plant materials. Model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is incapable of catabolism of L-arabinose as a source of carbon and energy. In this study, all the heterologous genes expressed in Synechocystis were derived from Escherichia coli K-12. Initially we constructed four Synechocystis strains that expressed AraBAD enzymes involved in L-arabinose catabolism, either in combination with or without one of the three arabinose transporters, AraE, AraFGH or AraJ. Among the recombinants, the strain possessing AraJ transporter was observed to be the most efficient in terms of dry biomass production and L-arabinose consumption. Later, an additional strain was generated by the expression of AraJ in the AraE-possessing strain. The resultant strain was shown to be advantageous over its parent. This study demonstrates that AraJ, a protein with hitherto unknown function plays a role in the uptake of L-arabinose to boost its catabolism in the transgenic Synechocystis strains. The work also contributes to the current knowledge regarding metabolic engineering of cyanobacteria for the utilization of pentose sugars.",

The host immune response induced by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP) is the basis for elucidating pathogenesis and controlling disease.

In this study, piglets were infected with APP and differentially expressed proteins of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral serum were identified by iTRAQ-LC-MS/MS, and differentially expressed genes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by RNA-seq. The results of the integrated analysis of serum, BALF and PBMC showed significant metabolism and local immune responses in BALF, the general immune response in PBMC mainly involves cytokines, while that in serum mainly involves biosynthesis, phagosome, and complement and coagulation cascades. Furthermore, immune responses in PBMCs and serum were rapid and maintained compared to the lung where metabolism and cell adhesion activities were enriched. Some innate immunity pathways of the cellular response to ROS, neutrophil mediated immunity, granulocyte activation and leukocyte cell-cell adhesion were identified as central points, connecting multiple signaling pathways to form an integrated large network. At 24 h post-infection, 14 molecules were up regulated in BALF, 10 of which were shared with PBMC, but at 120 h, 20 down-regulated molecules were identified in BALF, 11 of them still up- regulated in PBMC. We conclude that, the immune response in the lung is different from that in blood, but there is a similarity in response in PBMC and serum.",

This antigen has proved to be highly immunogenic in experimental models and humans, presenting a significant potential for further development of a new vaccine for tuberculosis. Glycosylation plays a key role in the immunogenicity of the APA protein. Because plants are known to promote post-translational modification such as glycosylation and to be one of the most economic and safe hosts for recombinant protein expression, we have over expressed the APA protein in transgenic tobacco plants aiming to produce a glycosylated version of the protein. Seeds are known to be a well-suited organ to accumulate recombinant proteins, due to low protease activity and higher protein stability. We used a seed-specific promoter from sorghum, a signal peptide to target the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum and ultimately in the protein storage vacuoles. We show that the recombinant protein accumulated in the seeds had similar isoelectric point and molecular weight compared with the native protein. These findings demonstrate the ability of tobacco plants to produce glycosylated APA protein, opening the way for the development of secure, effective and versatile vaccines or therapeutic proteins against tuberculosis.",

    "abstract": "Fluridone is widely used as a herbicide for controlling invasive aquatic plants such as hydrilla in surface water bodies. When applied on surface waters fluridone can attach to bed sediment, requiring rigorous extraction methods prior to analysis. Currently, very limited information exists in terms of fluridone residue detection in delta sediment. In this study, we researched fluridone detection in both water and sediment. To extract fluridone from sediment, here we have tested two extraction methods: (1) a rotavapor method (RM); and (2) a quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe (QuEChERS) method (QM). The extraction results of RM were compared with those of QM. To quantify fluridone concentrations in extracts, a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-UV detector was used. HPLC separation was achieved using an Allure C18 5 µm 150 × 4.6 mm column with a mobile phase composed of acetonitrile and water (60:40, v/v). The UV detector was operated at 237 nm. The method was tested and validated using a series of water and sediment samples taken from Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California. The average recovery of fluridone was 73% and 78% using RM and QM respectively. The proposed method can be used for testing fluridone in water and sediment samples.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is a severe cardiovascular disease characterized by narrowing of the lumen, plaque formation, and blood flow turbulence as a result of cholesterol and lipid accumulation in the inner lining of arteries. Bishkhapra (Trianthema portulacastrum Linn.) is a well-known common weed belonging to the family Aizoaceae. Several bioactive compounds have been isolated from this weed and widely used against several diseases. The present study evaluated the protective and therapeutic efficacies of T. portulacastrum against atherosclerosis in a rat model. The animals were divided into the sham, control (diabetes- + atherosclerosis-inducing diet), 100 mg/kg T. portulacastrum treatment, 200 mg/kg T. portulacastrum treatment, and positive control groups. Blood glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, and other lipid parameters, as well as the expression of G-protein-coupled receptor 124 (GPR124), were measured. Glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides were significantly reduced to near normal levels. The serum levels of fibrinogen, sVCAM-1, and oxidized low density lipoproteins were substantially increased in control rats. Treatment with the T. portulacastrum extract reversed these levels to near normal levels. The mRNA expression of GPR124 was increased by 150% in the control group. However, treatment with T. portulacastrum extract decreased the mRNA expression up to 40% compared with the control group. Rats treated with 100 and 200 mg/kg T. portulacastrum extract showed a decrease in GPR124 protein expression by 9.5% and 33.3%, respectively. Taken together, the results suggest that an extract of T. portulacastrum is effective against atherosclerosis in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A82846B, producing by Kibdelosporangium aridum , is an important precursor of the semi-synthetic glycopeptide antibiotic Oritavancin. K. aridum produces three components A82846A, B and C, so it is essential to increase A82846B titer and reduce A82846A and C titers by overexpressing halogenase and glycosyltransferase genes. Firstly, we constructed the genetically engineered strain SIPI-3927- attB harboring artificial attB site via homologous recombination. Secondly, two strains SIPI-3927-C1 and C2 were also constructed by integrating halogenase genes vcm8 and orf10 into artificial attB sites of SIPI-3927- attB , respectively. Meantime, three strains SIPI-3927-C3, C4 and C5 containing overexpressing glycosyltransferase A, B and C genes were obtained, respectively. Through fermentation analyses, the results showed that SIPI-3927-C1 and C2 could increase A82846B ratios, in which SIPI-3927-C1 showed a better performance. Moreover, the titer of SIPI-3927-C3 was highest in those of three strains. Finally, the strain SIPI-3927-C6 was constructed by integrating both orf10 -encoded halogenase and orf11 -encoded glycosyltransferase A, of which the yield and ratio of A82846B in shake-flask fermentation reached 1200 mg/L and 73.6%, respectively. Besides, the yield and ratio of A82846B in SIPI-3927-C6 grew up to 2520 mg/L and 86.5% in the 5-L fermenter culture, respectively. In conclusion, overexpressing orf10 gene can increase A82846B ratio,while overexpressing orf11 gene can increase A82846B titer as well. The artificial attB site is effective for inserting new genes.",

    "abstract": "Most bacteria live in biofilms in their natural habitat rather than the planktonic cell stage that dominates during traditional laboratory cultivation and enrichment schemes. The present study describes the establishment of a flow-based enrichment method based on multispecies biofilm communities for directing biofilm functionality using an environmental inoculum. By controlling flow conditions and physio-chemical properties, the set-up aims to simulate natural conditions ex situ for biofilm formation. The functionality of the method was demonstrated by enrichment of biofilm microbiomes using consortia from a warm compost pile and industrial waste materials as growth substrate, and further exploring the metagenomes by biotechnological tools. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing results revealed a difference in consortium composition and especially in genus abundance, in flow experiments compared to traditional liquid-shake experiments after enrichment, indicating good biofilm development and increased abundance of biofilm-forming taxa. The shotgun sequence mining demonstrated that different enzymes classes can be targeted by enriching biofilms on different substrates such as oat husk, pine saw dust, and lignin. The flow-based biofilm method is effective in reducing bacterial consortia complexity and in selecting biofilm-forming bacteria, and it is possible to enrich the biofilm community in various directions based on the choice of sample material, environmental conditions, and nutritional preferences, targeting enzymes or enzyme classes of industrial interest.",

The potential enzyme-substrate binding sites were anchored by analysis of the complex. Then, site-directed mutagenesis and activity verification clarified that W290, W224, and F352 were critical residues of the substrate tunnel and directly bonded to ALA-CoA. H94 and H69 were indispensable for transporting electrons with heme. H452, N445, and H358 significantly influenced the recognition and attraction of MpFADS6 to the substrate.

To understand this bioconversion process on a molecular level, a transcriptomic study during the bioconversion process was conducted to elucidate gene expression patterns. Differentially expressed genes, cellular transporters as well as transcriptional factors involved in the bioconversion process could be described. Additional enzymes known for xenobiotic degradation were differentially expressed and a potential membrane vesicle mechanism was detected. The bioconversion mechanism on a transcriptional level of P. aromaticivorans could be elucidated and results can be used for strain optimization. Additionally, the transcriptome study showed the high potential of the strain for other degradation applications.",

Reducing EC is one of the key research priorities to address security of fermented foods. Enzymatic degradation of EC with EC hydrolase in food is the most reliable and efficient method. However, poor tolerance to ethanol severely hinders application of EC hydrolase. In this study, the mutants of EC hydrolase were screened by diphasic high pressure molecular dynamic simulations (dHP-MD). The best variant with remarkable improvement in specific activity and was H68A/K70R/S325N, whose specific activity was approximately 3.42-fold higher than WT, and relative enzyme activity under 20% (v/v) was 5.02-fold higher than WT. Moreover, the triple mutant increased its stability by acquiring more hydration shell and forming extra hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, the ability of degrading EC of the immobilized triple mutant was both detected in mock wine and under certain reaction conditions. The stability of immobilized triple mutant and WT were both improved, and immobilized triple mutant degraded nearly twice as much EC as that of immobilized WT. Overall, dHP-MD was proved to effectively improve enzyme activity and ethanol tolerance for extent application at industrial scale.",

However, its product auricin is structurally different from all known angucyclines. It contains a spiroketal pyranonaphthoquinone aglycone similar to griseusins and is modified with D-forosamine. Here, we describe the characterization of the initial steps in auricin biosynthesis using a synthetic-biology-based approach. We have created a plasmid system based on the strong kasOp* promoter, RBS and phage PhiBT1-based integration vector, where each gene in the artificial operon can be easily replaced by another gene using unique restriction sites surrounding each gene in the operon. The system was validated with the initial landomycin biosynthetic genes lanABCFDLE, leading to the production of rabelomycin after its integration into Streptomyces coelicolor M1146. However, the aur1DEFCGHA homologous genes from the auricin aur1 BGC failed to produce rabelomycin in this system. The cause of this failure was inactive aur1DE genes encoding ketosynthases α and β (KSα, KSβ). Their replacement with homologous aur2AB genes from the adjacent aur2 BGC resulted in rabelomycin production that was even higher after the insertion of two genes from the aur1 BGC, aur1L encoding 4-phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase) and aur1M encoding malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase (MCAT), suggesting that Aur1L PPTase is essential for the activation of the acyl carrier protein Aur1F. These results suggest an interesting communication of two BGCs, aur1 and aur2, in the biosynthesis of the initial structure of auricin aglycone.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The early diagnosis of leprosy serves as an important tool to reduce the incidence of this disease in the world. Phage display (PD) technology can be used for mapping new antigens to the development of immunodiagnostic platforms. Our objective was to identify peptides that mimic Mycobacterium leprae proteins as serological markers using phage display technology. The phages were obtained in the biopanning using negative and positive serum from household contacts and leprosy patients, respectively. Then, the peptides were synthesized and validated in silico and in vitro for detection of IgG from patients and contacts. To characterize the native protein of M. leprae , scFv antibodies were selected against the synthetic peptides by PD. The scFv binding protein was obtained by immunocapture and confirmed using mass spectrometry. We selected two phase-fused peptides, MPML12 and MPML14, which mimic the HSP60 protein from M. leprae . The peptides MPML12 and MPML14 obtained 100% and 92.85% positivity in lepromatous patients. MPML12 and MPM14 detect IgG, especially in the multibacillary forms. The MPML12 and MPML14 peptides had positivity of 11.1% and 16.6% in household contacts, respectively. There was no cross-reaction in patient’s samples with visceral leishmaniasis, tuberculosis and other mycobacteriosis for both peptides. Given these results and the easy obtainment of mimetic antigens, our peptides are promising markers for application in the diagnosis of leprosy, especially in endemic and hyperendemic regions.",

    "abstract": "Bloodstream infection (BSI) caused by bacteria is highly pathogenic and lethal, and easily develops whole-body inflammatory state. Immediate identification of disease-causing bacteria can improve patient prognosis. Traditional testing methods are not only time-consuming, but such tests are limited to laboratories. Recombinase polymerase amplification combined with lateral flow dipstick (RPA-LFD) holds great promise for rapid nucleic acid detection, but the uncapping operation after amplification easily contaminates laboratories. Therefore, the establishment of a more effective integrated isothermal amplification system has become an urgent problem to be solved. In this study, we designed and fabricated a hermetically sealed integrated isothermal amplification system. Combining with this system, a set of RPA-LFD assays for detecting S. aureus, K. peneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and H. influenza in BSI were established and evaluated. The whole process could be completed in less than 15 min and the results can be visualized by the naked eye. The developed RPA-LFD assays displayed a good sensitivity, and no cross-reactivity was observed in seven similar bacterial genera. The results obtained with 60 clinical samples indicated that the developed RPA-LFD assays had high specifcity and sensitivity for identifying S. aureus, K. peneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and H. influenza in BSI. In conclusion, our results showed that the developed RPA-LFD assay is an alternative to existing PCR-based methods for detection of S. aureus, K. peneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and H. influenza in BSI in primary hospitals.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Enzymatic detection of citrulline, a potential biomarker for various diseases, is beneficial. However, determining citrulline levels requires expensive instrumental analyses and complicated colorimetric assays. Although l -amino acid oxidase/dehydrogenase is widely used to detect l -amino acids, an l -citrulline-specific oxidase/dehydrogenase has not been reported. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to develop an l -citrulline-specific enzyme by introducing a mutation into l -arginine oxidase (ArgOX) derived from Pseudomonas sp. TPU 7192 to provide a simple enzymatic l -citrulline detection system. The ratio of the oxidase activity against l -arginine to that against l -citrulline (Cit/Arg) was 1.2%, indicating that ArgOX could recognize l -citrulline as a substrate. In the dehydrogenase assay, the specific dehydrogenase activity towards l -arginine was considerably lower than the specific oxidase activity. However, the specific dehydrogenase activity towards l -citrulline was only slightly lower than the oxidase activity, resulting in improved substrate specificity with a Cit/Arg ratio of 49.5%. To enhance the substrate specificity of ArgOX, we performed site-directed mutagenesis using structure-based engineering. The 3D model structure indicated that E486 interacted with the l -arginine side chain. By introducing the E486 mutation, the specific dehydrogenase activity of ArgOX/E486Q for l -citrulline was 3.25 ± 0.50 U/mg, which was 3.8-fold higher than that of ArgOX. The Cit/Arg ratio of ArgOX/E486Q was 150%, which was higher than that of ArgOX. Using ArgOX/E486Q, linear relationships were observed within the range of 10–500 μM l -citrulline, demonstrating its suitability for detecting citrulline in human blood. Consequently, ArgOX/E486Q can be adapted as an enzymatic sensor in the dehydrogenase system. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Streptococcus agalactiae ( S. agalactiae ) is an important pathogen that can lead to neonatus and mother infection. The current existing techniques for the identification of S. agalactiae are limited by accuracy, speed and high-cost . Therefore, a new multiple cross displacement amplification (MCDA) assay was developed for test of the target pathogen immediately from vaginal and rectal swabs. MCDA primers screening were conducted targeting S. agalactiae pcsB gene, and one set of MCDA primers with better rapidity and efficiency was selected for establishing the S. agalactiae- MCDA assay. As a result, the MCDA method could be completed at a constant temperature of 61 °C, without the requirement of special equipment. The detection limit is 250 fg (31.5 copies) per reaction, all S. agalactiae strains displayed positive results, but not for non- S. agalactiae strains. The visual MCDA assay detected 16 positive samples from 200 clinical specimen, which were also detected positive by enrichment/qPCR. While the CHROMagar culture detected 6 positive samples. Thus, the MCDA assay is prefer to enrichment/qPCR and culture for detecting S. agalactiae from clinical specimen. Particularly, the whole test of MCDA takes about 63.1 min, including sample collection (3 min), DNA preparation (15 min), MCDA reaction (45 min) and result reporting (6 s). In addition, the cost was very economic, with only US$ 4.9. These results indicated that our S. agalaciae -MCDA assay is a rapid, sensitive and cost-efficient technique for target pathogen detection, and is more suitable than conventional assays for an urgent detection, especially for 'on-site' laboratories and resource-constrained settings.",

The esxA was cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris , after which the effects of the EsxA protein on rice seedling growth were analyzed to determine whether EsxA contributes to the plant growth-promoting activity of strain NK3-4. The esxA was successfully cloned from the NK3-4 genome and ligated to the eukaryotic expression vector pPICZαA. The resulting pPICZαA- esxA recombinant plasmid was transinfected into yeast cells, and esxA expression in the yeast cells was confirmed. The treatment of seed- buds with the EsxA protein increased the root length by 1.35-times, but decreased the bud length. Additionally, in rice seedlings treated with EsxA, the root and shoot lengths increased by 2.6- and 1.7-times, respectively. These findings imply that EsxA is important for the promotion of rice plant growth by P. terrae strain NK3-4. Furthermore, the construction of the esxA expression vector and the engineered strain may be useful for future investigations of the mechanism underlying the plant growth-promoting effects of EsxA, with implications for the application of EsxA for regulating plant growth.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Acetic acid bacteria (AAB) can selectively oxidize diols into their corresponding hydroxyacids. Notably, they can convert 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) into 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP), which is a promising building-block. Until now, 3-HP production with AAB is carried out in batch and using resting cells at high cell densities (up to 10 g L −1 of cell dry weight). This approach is likely limited by detrimental accumulation of the intermediate 3-hydroxypropanal (3-HPA). Herein, we investigate an alternative implementation that allows highly efficient 3-HP production with lower cell densities of growing cells and that prevents 3-HPA accumulation. First, growth and 3-HP production of Acetobacter sp. CIP 58.66 were characterized with 1,3-PDO or glycerol as growth substrate. The strain was then implemented in a bioreactor, during a sequential process where it was first cultivated on glycerol, then the precursor 1,3-PDO was continuously supplied at a varying rate, easily controlled by the pH control. Different pH set points were tested (5.0, 4.5, and 4.0). This approach used the natural resistance of acetic acid bacteria to acidic conditions. Surprisingly, when pH was controlled at 5.0, the performances achieved in terms of titer (69.76 g 3-HP L −1 ), mean productivity (2.80 g 3-HP L −1 h −1 ), and molar yield (1.02 mol 3-HP mol −1 1,3-PDO ) were comparable to results obtained with genetically improved strains at neutral pH. The present results were obtained with comparatively lower cell densities (from 0.88 to 2.08 g L −1 ) than previously reported. This feeding strategy could be well-suited for future scale-up, since lower cell densities imply lower process costs and energy needs.",

In this vector, a tetrameric glycoprotein neuraminidase (NA) from influenza A virus (H5N1) serves as a baculovirus surface protein to improve baculovirus transduction efficiency and a partner for displaying the target peptide antigen. Nucleotides encoding target peptides could be fused to a full length NA gene, at the lower part of its head structure, integrated into Autographa californica multinucleopolyhedrovirus genome and expressed under the control of a White Spot Syndrome Virus IE-1 shuttle promoter. Angiotensin II (AngII) peptides, a potent vasoconstrictor that causes high blood pressure, was our target antigen. The recombinant NA-AngII pseudotyped baculovirus had the AngII peptides fused to the NA and displayed on its surface. In vitro studies revealed that this recombinant baculovirus successfully delivered AngII peptides, as DNA vaccine, into human HEK293A cells. A single subcutaneous injection of the recombinant NA-AngII pseudotyped baculovirus into moderately high blood pressure rats at 4 × 109 pfu/rat, stimulated anti-AngII antibody production and their systolic blood pressure (SBP) levels were found to have decreased. In addition, a single intranasal immunization at 8 × 108 pfu/rat, raised anti-AngII antibodies in a rat and its SBP was also reduced. The recombinant neuraminidase pseudotyped baculovirus is a potential vector for AngII peptide antigen and DNA vaccine for subcutaneous or intranasal immunization for treatment of hypertension.",

The benzoyl-CoA ligase gene was expressed individually, and in combination with benzoyl-CoA reductase and a putative benzoate transporter. This effort also assessed heterologous expression from a synthetically designed operon whereby each coding sequence was proceeded by a unique C. bescii ribosome binding site sequence. The F. placidicus benzoyl-CoA ligase gene was expressed in C. bescii to produce a full-length protein with catalytic activity. A synthetic 6-gene operon encoding three enzymes involved in benzoate degradation was also successfully expressed in C. bescii as determined by RNA analysis, though the protein products of only four of the genes were detected. The discord between the mRNA and protein measurements, especially considering the two genes lacking apparent protein abundance, suggests variable effectiveness of the ribosome binding site sequences utilized in this synthetic operon. The engineered strains did not degrade benzoate. Although the heterologously expressed gene encoding benzoyl-CoA ligase yielded a protein that was catalytically active in vitro, expression in C. bescii of six benzoate catabolism-related genes combined in a synthetic operon yielded mixed results. More effective expression and in vivo activity might be brought about by validating and using different ribosome binding sites and different promoters. Expressing additional pathway components may alleviate any pathway inhibition and enhance benzoyl-CoA reductase activity.",

Among LA catabolic processes in Pseudomonas putida KT2440, ligation of coenzyme A (CoA) to LA by levulinyl-CoA synthetase (LvaE) is known to be an initial enzymatic step in LA metabolism. To identify the genes involved in the first step of LA metabolism in Pseudomonas citronellolis LA18T, RNA-seq-based comparative transcriptome analysis was carried out for LA18T cells during growth on LA and pyruvic acid. The two most highly upregulated genes with LA exhibited amino acid sequence homologies to cation acetate symporter and 5-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase from Pseudomonas spp. Potential LA metabolic genes (lva genes) in LA18T that clustered with these two genes and were homologous to lva genes in KT2440 were identified, including lvaE2 of LA18T, which exhibited 35% identity with lvaE of KT2440. Using Escherichia coli cells with the pCold™ expression system, LvaE2 was produced and investigated for its activity toward LA. High performance liquid chromatography analysis confirmed that crude extracts of E. coli cells expressing the lvaE2 gene could convert LA to levulinyl-CoA in the presence of both HS-CoA and ATP. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that LvaE2 and LvaE formed a cluster with medium-chain fatty acid CoA synthetase, but they fell on different branches. Superimposition of LvaE2 and LvaE homology-based model structures suggested that LvaE2 had a larger tunnel for accepting fatty acid substrates than LvaE. These results indicate that LvaE2 is a novel levulinyl-CoA synthetase.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Using herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) as a therapeutic tool has recently emerged as a promising strategy for enhancing the treatment of various cancers, particularly those associated with the nervous system, which is the virus's natural site of infection. These viruses are specifically engineered to infect and eradicate tumor cells while leaving healthy cells unharmed. To introduce targeted mutations in specific viral genes, gene-modification techniques such as shuttle vector homologous recombination are commonly employed. Plaque purification is then utilized to select and purify the recombinant virus from the parental viruses. However, plaque purification becomes problematic when the insertion of the desired gene at the target site hampers progeny virus replication, resulting in a lower titer of cell-released virus than the parental virus. This necessitates a laborious initial screening process using approximately 10–15 tissue culture dishes (10 cm), making plaque purification time-consuming and demanding. Although the recently developed CRISPR-Cas9 system significantly enhances the efficiency of homologous integration and editing precision in viral genes, the purification of recombinant variants remains a tedious task. In this study, we propose a rapid and innovative method that employs non-permissive Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, representing a remarkable improvement over the aforementioned arduous process. With this approach, only 1–2 rounds of plaque purification are required. Our proposed protocol demonstrates great potential as a viable alternative to current methods for isolating and purifying recombinant HSV-1 variants expressing fluorescent reporter genes using CHO cells and plaque assays.",

A concentration of 50 mM Phe was used to test its potential in counteracting the deleterious effect of BAA amorphous aggregates in vivo. After 21 days of daily subcutaneous injections of the native enzyme to mice, amorphous aggregates of BAA, as well as aggregates produced in presence of 50 mM Phe, the tissues located at the site of injection were studied histologically. Amorphous aggregates caused an increase in macrophages and lipid droplets. Serum levels of IL6 and TNF-α were also accordingly elevated and indicative of an inflammation state. Aggregates also resulted into increased levels of glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol, as well as liver enzymes SGOT and SGPT. On the other hand, the presence of Phe prevented this exacerbated inflammatory state and the subsequent impairment of biochemical parameters. In conclusion, Phe is an interesting compound for both stabilizing proteins and counteracting the pathological effect of amorphous aggregates.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (ARB) are responsible for increased mortality and morbidity. Therefore, this study focuses on evaluating traditional and molecular diagnostic tools of carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria (CRGNB). In order to achieve this, 94 samples, from different patients' specimens, and surrounding environment, were collected from intensive care units (ICUs) at Ain Shams University Specialized Hospital and the National Cancer Institute, Cairo, Egypt. The swabs were cultured on appropriate media, including Chromogenic medium (HiCrome KPC Agar Base \"HIMEDI AM1831\"), and MacConkey-10 µg imipenem disc resulting in 136 isolates with different culture characteristics. Next, the selected isolates were subjected to VITEK 2 machine and 16SrRNA (16 S ribosomal RNA) sequencing. The sensitivity of HiCROME KPC agar for CRGNB detection was 99.3% and 94.7%, in reference to the MacConkey-disc and VITEK-2 methods, respectively. The HiCrome KPC agar assumptions for bacterial identification were not as consistent as those of VITEK 2 (with only 47.4% agreement) and 16SrRNA gene sequencing analysis. The approaches discussed in this study facilitate providing rapid diagnosis and treatment of CRGNB, which helps increase survival rates. HiCrome KPC agar is considered a relatively accurate and easy method that can be used in any laboratory. In addition, the selected strains were deposited in the gene bank with the accession numbers OR553657, OR553658, and OR553659. It is noteworthy that Genus Acinetobacter is the major CRGNB isolated from the patients and environmental surfaces in the hospitals. This highlights the importance of proper environmental and terminal cleaning procedures in healthcare facilities and applying control measures to ensure infection prevention.",

To investigate the role of the gut microbiome in pediatric neuro-oncology, microbiome analysis has been included in multiple prospective pediatric neuro-oncology clinical trials (NCT05009992, NCT04732065, NCT04775485). In these trials, the OMNIgene-GUTtm preservation tubes are used for the collection of the feces. OMNIgene-GUTtm has demonstrated reliability in preserving the composition of the gut microbiome in adults; however, its validation for use in the pediatric population remains limited. Therefore, we compared the quality of the DNA by 16S rRNA gene sequencing after various methods of stabilizing fecal samples in pediatric populations, from the direct freeze method at − 80 °C to preserving samples with OMNIgene-GUTtm at room temperature for various durations. Our results showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the alpha-diversity, and beta-diversity. However, pairwise differential abundance analyses demonstrated that OMNIgene-GUT™ is superior in maintaining microbial community structure compared to storing samples without any preservation method. With the OMNIgene-GUTtm's stabilization of the fecal samples being superior and its ease-of-use benefits, it proves to be a valid and ideal method of stabilizing fecal samples for current and future pediatric clinical trials.",

In this study, two CHO cell lines, namely K1 and DG44, along with their corresponding mAb-producing lines, K1-Pr and DG44-Pr, were cultivated with or without NaBu. A SWATH-based profiling method was employed to analyze the proteome. Cells cultured in the presence of NaBu exhibited a reduction in mitosis and gene expression, supported by their culture data demonstrating growth inhibition. The presence of NaBu corresponded to upregulation of intracellular trafficking and secretion pathways, aligned with an observed increase in mAb production, and was associated with an elevated glycosylation pathway and a slight alteration in the glycosylation profile of the mAbs. Increased fatty acid oxidation, redox interactions, and lipid biosynthesis were also observed and are likely attributable to the metabolism of NaBu. A comprehensive understanding of the systemic effects of NaBu will facilitate the discovery of strategies to enhance or prolong the productivity of CHO cells.",

The biofilm and persister cells formation ability of MRSA and Staphylococcus epidermidis often companied with extremely high antimicrobial resistance. Pinaverium bromide (PVB) is an antispasmodic compound mainly used for irritable bowel syndrome. Here we demonstrate that PVB could rapidly kill MRSA and S. epidermidis planktonic cells and persister cells avoiding resistance occurrence. Moreover, by crystal violet staining, viable cells counting and SYTO9/PI staining, PVB exhibited strong biofilm inhibition and eradication activities on the 96-well plates, glass surface or titanium discs. And the synergistic antimicrobial effects were observed between PVB and conventional antibiotics (ampicillin, oxacillin, and cefazolin). Mechanism study demonstrated the antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects by PVB were mainly mediated by proton motive force disrupting as well as reactive oxygen species inducing. Although, relatively poor pharmacokinetics were observed by systemic use, PVB could significantly reduce the viable bacterial cell loads and inflammatory infiltration in abscess in vivo caused by the biofilm forming strain ATCC 43,300. In all, our results indicated that PVB could be an alternative antimicrobial reagent for the treatment of MRSA, S. epidermidis and its biofilm related skin and soft tissue infections.",

    "abstract": "Previously, we identified 49 undeletable chromosomal regions harboring only non-essential genes in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We proposed that there might be unknown synthetic lethal combinations of genes present in such undeletable regions of the genome. In this study, we chose four of the smallest undeletable chromosomal regions among the 49 and performed extensive further analyses to narrow down the gene-pairs responsible for lethality by replacing sub-regions in various combinations with a DNA module comprising the CgLEU2 marker. Although the methodology was different from previous study, interestingly the results revealed that not only the sub-regions but also the entire region was replaceable. To solve the apparent discrepancy between previous and present results, we further conducted additional analysis including investigation of suppressor mutation and mini-chromosome loss assay through the construction of mini-chromosome harboring two particular chromosomal regions with marked with URA3 marker by employing 5-FOA system. Based upon careful observation on the phenotype of colony formation on 5-FOA medium by spot test, we came to an important conclusion that particular chromosomal regions harboring only non-essential genes can be categorized into three classes, i.e., essential, non-essential and intrinsically essential. Intrinsically essential region is defined as appearance of papillae after mini-chromosome loss which implicates that the region is essential but compensatable against cell lethality. Our present study indicates that prudent and multiple approaches as performed in this study are needed to judge whether a particular chromosomal region of the S. cerevisiae genome is essential, non-essential or intrinsically essential but compensatable.",

The aim of this study was to isolate the microbial community and to identify a single microbial strain that can degrade CL-20 with desirable efficiency. Metagenomic sequencing methods were performed to investigate the dynamic changes in the composition of the community diversity. The most varied genus among the microbial community was Pseudomonas , which increased from 1.46% to 44.63% during the period of incubation (MC0–MC4). Furthermore, the new strain was isolated and identified from the activated sludge by bacterial morphological and 16s rRNA sequencing analyses. The CL-20 concentrations decreased by 75.21 μg/mL and 74.02 μg/mL in 48 h by MC4 and Pseudomonas sp. ZyL-01, respectively. Moreover, ZyL-01 could decompose 98% CL-20 of the real effluent in 14 day’s incubation with the glucose as carbon source. Finally, a draft genome sequence was obtained to predict possible degrading enzymes involved in the biodegradation of CL-20. Specifically, 330 genes that are involved in energy production and conversion were annotated by Gene Ontology functional enrichment analysis, and some of these candidates may encode enzymes that are responsible for CL-20 degradation. In summary, our studies indicate that microbes might be a valuable biological resource for the treatment of environmental contamination caused by CL-20 and that Pseudomonas sp. ZyL-01 might be a promising candidate for eradicating CL-20 to achieve a more biosafe environment and improve public health.",

So, the present study aimed to validate the efficiency of gamma radiation or dry heat techniques to sterilize contaminated paper sheets with different indicator pathogens while retaining their structure. The results showed that gamma radiation at 6, 12, or 24 kGy can successfully kill Gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus , Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi, and fungi such as Candida albicans . Moreover, dry heating at 100 °C for 60 min, 150 °C for 30 min, or 200 °C for 15 min can be successful in paper decontamination of all tested species. Surprisingly, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs proved that gamma radiation at 6 kGy, dry heat at 100 °C for 60 min or 150 °C for 30 min or 200 °C for 15 min, is suitable for paper sheet sterilization while maintaining their structure. Ultimately, dry heat is a simple, effective, fast, safe, and inexpensive technique for paper sterilization. It may be used as a precautionary step inside educational institutions, especially during written examination periods, to ensure a safe life for academic members during biological pandemics such as COVID-19.",

In particular, multi-species living in biofilms could boost biomass production and enhance treatment resistance.

These isolates mainly belonged to Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, which occupied more than 80% of the total strains according to the 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Four species (Acinetobacter sp. CTS3, Corynebacterium sp. CTS5, Providencia sp. CTS12, and Pseudomonas sp. CTS17) were observed co-existing in the synthetic medium. Quantitative comparison of biofilm biomass from mono- and multi-species showed a synergistic effect towards biofilm formation among these four species. Three metabolic inhibitors (sulfathiazole, 3-bromopyruvic acid, and 3-nitropropionic acid) were employed to prevent biofilm formation based on their inhibitory effect on corresponding metabolic pathways. All of them displayed evident inhibition profiles to biofilm formation. Notably, combining these three inhibitors possessed a remarkable ability to block the multi-species biofilm development with lower concentrations, suggesting an enhanced effect appeared in simultaneous use. This study demonstrates that combined utilization of metabolic inhibitors is an alternative strategy to prevent multi-species biofilm formation.",

    "abstract": "Inanimate objects/surfaces become fomites upon contacting infectious agents such as disease-causing bacteria, fungi and viruses. Smartphones are one of the most prominent among these fomites. COVID-19 pandemic has raised the awareness on mobile sanitization, as an active measure to curb fomite-mediated viral transmission. Available mobile sanitizers and ultraviolet (UV) ray mediated mobile sanitization have their own sets of pros and cons, often being less user-friendly. This study explored the germicidal efficacy of an herbal-based sanitizer, Germi-X spray, on hands and mobiles, through microbiological techniques of micro-broth dilution and Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion assay, thumb print assay and swab test. Notably, Germi-X spray was found to be 6-67% more effective against surface pathogens, like, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as compared to a very popular product in the Indian market, which was taken as a control for this study. The observed anti-bacterial activity of the spray from disc-diffusion assay suggests its greater surface retentivity as compared to the control. Germicidal potency of Germi-X spray, when used to sanitize hands, was found to be greater than 80%. There was ~ 17-fold reduction in microbial counts after sanitizing smartphones with Germi-X spray. The novelty of this study lies in providing experimental evidence for this herbal-based surface sanitizer in efficiently disinfecting one of the super contaminated fomite, the smartphones. In conclusion, having an herbal base with a high germicidal efficacy against surface pathogens, together with longer surface retention, Germi-X spray appears to be an eco-friendly and cost-effective sanitizer for the surfaces of electronic gadgets like smartphones.",

Previous study demonstrated that Vip3Aa and Vip3Ad showed significant difference in insecticidal activities against Spodoptera exigua , while the molecular mechanism remained ambiguous. Here we demonstrated that the difference in insecticidal activities between Vip3Aa and Vip3Ad might be caused by the difference in stability of Vip3Aa and Vip3Ad in S. exigua midgut protease. Vip3Aa was quite stable while Vip3Ad could be further degraded. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed that Vip3Aa was more stable than Vip3Ad, with smaller RMSD and RMSF value. Amino acid sequence alignment indicated that three were three extra prolines (P591, P605 and P779) located on Vip3Aa. We further identified that residue P591 played a crucial role on stability and insecticidal activity of Vip3Aa. Taken together, our study demonstrated that the stability was essential for the insecticidal activity of Vip3A toxins, which might provide new insight into the action mode of Vip3A toxins and contribute to the design Vip3A variants with improved stability and insecticidal activity.",

During winter 2017 to 2018, a sharp surge of influenza activity dominated by type B/Yamagata lineage virus caused unprecedented medical burden in Beijing. This research aimed to understand the underlying mechanism for this circulation and prepare for epidemics in the future. Sera samples collected from the patients in 2016–2017 and 2017–2018 flu seasons were tested for profiling hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) antibodies against both prevailing Victoria and Yamagata lineages of type B influenza viruses. It showed that the seroprevalence against both lineages of the virus in 2017–2018 winter was higher than that in 2016–2017, while no difference of the seroprevalence was observed between the two viruses. Meanwhile, significant elevated geometric mean titer (GMT) against both lineages of influenza B viruses was found in the specimens collected during 2017–2018 flu season than that from 2016 to 2017, suggesting the viruses might undergo antigenic changes. These results also suggested that lower GMT against both type B variants in 2016–2017 might serve as an immunological niche for the dominating of B/Yamagata virus in China during 2017–2018 winter season. Our findings have implication that there was a significantly elevation of HI antibodies to influenza viruses B in 2017–2018 than in 2016–2017. On the other hand, the low level of HI antibodies to both B/Y and B/V in 2016–2017 could contribute to the severe B/Y epidemic in 2017–2018 to some extent.",

In this study, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of some main genes important to apoptosis and anti-apoptosis in humans.Expression profile arrays of Genomic Spatial Event (GSE) 113666, GSE113667, and GSE113679 obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus were used for meta-analysis using R commands. Cytoscape and STRING databases used the protein-protein Interaction network. Then, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Gene Ontology analysis was performed. Similar genes in Homo sapiens were identified using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool analysis. The validation was performed on eight people using real-time Polymerase chain reaction. In addition to the candidate genes, the gene expression of some other genes, including Serine/Threonine Kinase 1 (AKT1), Cyclin Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A), Kirsten Rat Sarcoma (KRAS), and Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-Bisphosphate 3-Kinase Catalytic Subunit Alpha (PIK3CA) were also examined. Analysis of the expression of serum amyloid A1 (SAA1), Regenerating Islet-Derived 3 Gamma (REG3G), and REG3A genes did not show any difference between the two groups of healthy and diseased people. Examining the mean expression of the four genes AKT1, CDKN2A, KRAS, and PIK3CA showed that three genes of AKT1, CDKN2A, and KRAS had increased expression in people with a history of giardiasis compared to healthy people. We showed that the gene expression pattern differs in apoptosis and anti-apoptosis signaling in people with a history of giardiasis. Giardia duodenalis seems to induce post-non-infectious symptoms with stimulation of human gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Efficient utilization of galactose by microorganisms can lead to the production of valuable bio-products and improved metabolic processes. While Bacillus subtilis has inherent pathways for galactose metabolism, there is potential for enhancement via evolutionary strategies. This study aimed to boost galactose utilization in B. subtilis using adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) and to elucidate the genetic and metabolic changes underlying the observed enhancements. The strains of B. subtilis underwent multiple rounds of adaptive laboratory evolution (approximately 5000 generations) in an environment that favored the use of galactose. This process resulted in an enhanced specific growth rate of 0.319 ± 0.005 h-1, a significant increase from the 0.03 ± 0.008 h-1 observed in the wild-type strains. Upon selecting the evolved strain BSGA14, a comprehensive whole-genome sequencing revealed the presence of 63 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Two of them, located in the coding sequences of the genes araR and glcR, were found to be the advantageous mutations after reverse engineering. The strain with these two accumulated mutations, BSGALE4, exhibited similar specific growth rate on galactose to the evolved strain BSGA14 (0.296 ± 0.01 h-1). Furthermore, evolved strain showed higher productivity of protease and β-galactosidase in mock soybean biomass medium. ALE proved to be a potent tool for enhancing galactose metabolism in B. subtilis. The findings offer valuable insights into the potential of evolutionary strategies in microbial engineering and pave the way for industrial applications harnessing enhanced galactose conversion.",

However, the time needed for such a bioconversion process was up to 5 days. Therefore, the objective of this study was to shorten the bioconversion time by using cell-free lysate and studying different factors influencing bioconversion. The crude cell lysate was prepared, freeze-dried, and primarily fractionated into nine fractions, of which, only three fractions, 50, 100, and 150 mM NaCl elution buffers showed 22, 12, and 2 µg/10 mL, calcitriol production, respectively. Ammonium sulfate was used for protein precipitation, and it did not affect the bioconversion process except at a concentration of 10%w/v. Secondary fractionation was carried out using 80 mL of the 50 mM NaCl elution buffer and the results showed the 80 mL eluent volume was enough for the complete elution of the active protein. The pH 7.8, temperature 28 °C, and 6 h reaction time were optimum for maximum calcitriol production (31 µg/10 mL). In conclusion, the transformation of vitamin D3 into calcitriol was successfully carried out within 6 h and at pH 7.8 and 28 °C using fractionated cell lysate. This process resulted in a 10-fold increase in calcitriol as compared to that produced in our previous study using a 14 L fermenter (32.8 µg/100 mL). Therefore, cell-free lysate should be considered for industrial and scaling up vitamin D3 bioconversion into calcitriol.",

However, the detection results of environmental swabs cannot always reflect the accurate status of viral pollution, leading to persistent ASFV environmental contamination. In this study, we developed an ASFV eluant with higher environmental ASFV detection efficiency relative to 0.85% saline solution, which obtains the patent certificate issued by the China Intellectual Property Office (patent number:202010976050.9). qPCR analysis showed that in the environmental swab samples, the number of viral copies was 100 times higher for the ASFV eluant treatment than the traditional eluant treatment (0.85% saline solution). And besides, the high sensitivity of the ASFV eluant had be verified in a slaughterhouse environmental sampling detection. In soil samples, the ASFV eluent showed the same extraction effect as the TIANamp Soil DNA Kit, in contrast to no extraction effect for 0.85% saline solution. Simultaneously, this eluent could protect ASFV from degradation and allow the transportation of samples at ambient temperature without refrigeration. In clinical practice, we monitored the environmental contamination condition of the ASFV in a large-scale pig farm. The results shown that the ASFV load decreased after every disinfection in environment. This study provides an effective solution for surveilling the potential threat of ASFV in environment.",

However, despite high sensitivity and specificity, they have limitations that in some cases may result in false negative results. Therefore, it is reasonable to search for additional tools that could support microbiological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. The aim of the study was to develop a highly specific molecular test capable of detecting and visualizing SARS-CoV-2 infection. A universal probe and a set of 18 specific oligonucleotides with a FLAP sequence attached to them on both sides were designed to visualize SARS-CoV-2 virus infection based on the fluorescence in situ hybridization method (FISH). FISH conditions using the developed kit were standardized on the Vero CCL-81 cell line infected by SARS-CoV-2 virus. The method was tested on 290 nasopharyngeal swabs (collected in a doublet) from patients with clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2. Each one swab from the doublet was subjected to RNA isolation and amplification by rRT-PCR. From the second swab, a microscopic preparation was performed for FISH. The use of the rRT-PCR allowed obtaining 200 positive and 90 negative results, while our FISH method allowed for 220 positive results and 70 negative results. The differences obtained using both methods were statistically significant ( p = 0.008). The obtained results support the use of FISH as an additional method in microbiological diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2.",

It is also a cause of congenital malformation and abortion in both animals and humans and is considered one of the most important foodborne pathogens worldwide with different strains showing variable distribution and differing pathogenicity. Thus, strain-level differentiation of T. gondii isolates is an essential asset in the understanding of parasite's diversity, geographical distribution, epidemiology and health risk. Here, we designed and implemented an Oxford Nanopore MinION protocol to analyse genomic sequence variation including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertion/deletion polymorphisms (InDel's) of four different genomic loci, part of protein coding genes SAG2, SAG3, ROP17 and ROP21. This method provided results with the sequencing depth necessary for accurate differentiation of T. gondii strains and represents a rapid approach compared to conventional techniques which we further validated against environmental samples isolated from wild wood mice. In summary, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) of both highly conserved and more polymorphic areas of the genome, provided robust data for strain classification in a platform ready for further adaption for other strains and pathogens.",

Consequently, the exploration of novel compounds for N. ceranae control becomes imperative. Dithiocarbimate derivatives emerge as promising antifungal candidates under evaluation for combating various pathogens, particularly those affecting plants. This study assessed the toxicity profile of six dithiocarbimate derivatives on A. mellifera worker survival and N. ceranae pathogen. Among these, four compounds exhibited minimal bee mortality and proceeded to further evaluation against N. ceranae . In vitro assays demonstrated their inhibitory effects on spore germination. Remarkably, the most potent compound suppressed N. ceranae spores by 62% at a concentration of 20 µmol L −1 in vivo . Thus, these dithiocarbimate derivatives represent promising new antifungal agents for combatting nosemosis in honey bee populations.",

Our detailed investigation of the substrate specificity of the GH43_22 protein using a wide spectrum of natural and artificial substrates showed that the enzyme hydrolyzed neither linear xylooligosaccharides nor glucuronoxylan. Xylose was released only from the artificial 4-nitrophenyl β-D-xylopyranoside (1.58 mU/mg). The corresponding α-L-arabinofuranoside was by three orders of magnitude better substrate (2.17 U/mg). Arabinose was the only monosaccharide liberated from arabinoxylan and α-1,3- or α-1,2-singly arabinosylated xylooligosaccharides. Moreover, the enzyme efficiently debranched sugar beet arabinan and singly arabinosylated α-1,5-L-arabinooligosaccharides, although short linear α-1,5-L-arabinooligosaccharides were also slowly degraded. On the other hand, debranched arabinan, arabinogalactan as well as 2,3-doubly arabinosylated main chain residues of arabinan and arabinoxylan did not serve as substrates. Thus, the enzyme encoded by the BAD_1527 gene is a typical α-L-arabinofuranosidase of AXH-m specificity.",

    "abstract": "Tobacco bacterial wilt is a major limiting factor for tobacco production and development, and it is more likely to occur under perennial single cropping of tobacco. In recent years, the rotation of tobacco-radish has gradually become popular. Therefore, we studied the effects of years of tobacco-radish rotation on tobacco bacterial wilt occurrence and rhizosphere microorganisms. The results indicated that both SY and TY could significantly reduce the risk of tobacco bacterial wilt occurrence, and SY had the lowest disease index. The rotation of radish plants significantly increased the soil pH but decreased the contents of alkali-hydrolysed nitrogen and organic matter in the soil. Alkali-hydrolysed nitrogen and pH are the key factors affecting the composition of the bacterial community. Furthermore, radish rotation changed the composition of the soil microbial community, increased the diversity of the bacterial community, and significantly altered the bacterial community structure. At the genus level, the abundance of Sphingomonas species negatively correlated with Ralstonia increased significantly, while the relative abundance of Rhodanobacter species positively correlated with Ralstonia decreased significantly. Disease index, pH and available phosphorus were the main factors affecting the variation in different bacterial genera. The network analysis results showed that Ralstonia was less connected in the network than in the CK group, and the SY treatment group had a more complex bacterial network structure. Overall, 2 years of tobacco and radish rotation improved the bacterial community structure of the rhizosphere soil and alleviated the harm caused by tobacco bacterial wilt, which is highly important for the stability and health of the rhizosphere soil ecosystem.",

After analyses using molecular docking and spatial structure analysis, site-directed mutagenesis mutants were performed as Amp0279-R131E, Amp0279-R131H, Amp0279-R131A and Amp0279-E349D. The optimum pH of Amp0279-R131E was shifted from the original 8.5 to 7.5, and the overall electrostatic potential was shifted towards acidic. Compared with the original enzyme, the mutant proteins all gained better structural stability, especially the apparent melting temperature (Tm) of Amp0279-R131H increased from 41.8 to 45.5 °C. Morever, when protein was bound to the substrate, the Tm of Amp0279-R131E was increased by 7.3 °C and Amp0279-R131H increased by 5.4 °C, compared to the original enzyme. This is consistent with the results that the mutants acquired higher binding energies to the substrates, and an increase the hydrogen bonding force. In addition, the molecular docking of mutant and substrate revealed that the truncation of R131 contributes to the increase in the binding capacity of the substrate molecules to the active centre. In contrast, the presence of π-Cation interactions generated by R131 with the substrate has an important effect on the ability of Amp0279 to hydrolyse the substrate. This study demostrated that R131 is a key site for activity and stability, which is important in the future exploration of the functional structure of Amp0279. For aminopeptidase Amp0279, R131 is a key site for activity and stability. The mutant of Amp0279-R131E shifted its optimal pH from 8.5 to 7.5, and the Tm value increased by 7.3 °C with binding the substrate, in comparison with Amp0279.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The human prolactin antagonist Δ 1-11 -G129R-hPRL is a 21.9 kDa recombinant protein with 188 amino acids that downregulates the proliferation of a variety of cells expressing prolactin receptors. Periplasmic expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli has been considered an option for obtaining a soluble and correctly folded protein, as an alternative to cytoplasmic production. The aim of this work was, therefore, to synthesize for the first time, the Δ 1-11 -G129R-hPRL antagonist, testing different activation temperatures and purifying it by classical chromatographic techniques. E. coli BL21(DE3) strain was transformed with a plasmid based on the pET25b( +) vector, DsbA signal sequence and the antagonist cDNA sequence. Different doses of IPTG were added, activating under different temperatures, and extracting the periplasmic fluid via osmotic shock. The best conditions were achieved by activating at 35 °C for 5 h using 0.4 mM IPTG, which gave a specific expression of 0.157 ± 0.015 μg/mL/A 600 at a final optical density of 3.43 ± 0.13 A 600 . Purification was carried out by nickel-affinity chromatography followed by size-exclusion chromatography, quantification being performed via high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). The prolactin antagonist was characterized by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and MALDI-TOF–MS. The final product presented &gt; 95% purity and its antagonistic effects were evaluated in vitro in view of potential clinical applications, including inhibition of the proliferation of cancer cells overexpressing the prolactin receptor and specific antidiabetic properties, taking also advantage of the fact that this antagonist was obtained in a soluble and correctly folded form and without an initial methionine.",

    "abstract": "dTMP-GH is a chimeric protein containing a tandem dimer of thrombopoietin mimetic peptide (dTMP) fused to human growth hormone (hGH) prepared previously by our team. It shows significant bioactivity in promoting thrombocytopoiesis, but detection of intact dTMP-GH in plasma is still a challenge due to the presence of endogenous hGH. In this study, a rabbit polyclonal antibody with high affinity to dTMP was obtained with a BSA-conjugated immunogen composed of 20 amino acids sequence spanning two TMP and the linker. A monoclonal antibody termed as 3B2 was screened out by using immunizing mice with whole dTMP-GH, which was proved to simultaneously interact with rhGH, TMP-GH, and dTMP-GH, respectively. In this study, we developed a specific and sensitive sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with two antibodies (one polyclonal and one HRP-conjugated monoclonal) to quantify dTMP-GH. The polyclonal antibody and HRP-conjugated monoclonal antibody 3B2 were applied as the capture antibody and detection antibody, respectively. A good correlation between ELISA and bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay in the quantification of diluted dTMP-GH was observed (r2 = 0.996). Meanwhile, the standard curve of this ELISA method was found in a linear relationship between 0.2 and 10 ng/mL in the presence of rabbit plasma. In vivo experiments demonstrate that the newly developed method is effective to detect dTMP-GH in rabbits, which paves the way for further pharmacokinetic evaluation.",

    "abstract": "In the interest of preventing the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic from spreading, it is crucial to promptly identify and confine afflicted patients. Serological antibody testing is a significant diagnostic technique that is increasingly employed in clinics, however its clinical use is still being investigated. The present study was carried out to scrutinize how well Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody testing using in-house developed rapid antibody assay worked against the chemiluminescence (CLIA) assay. Either IgG positive (IgG + IgM-) or IgM positive (IgM + IgG-); both IgG and IgM positive (IgM + IgG+); and negatives (IgM- IgG-) have been evaluated. A total of 300 samples with diverse age and sexual identity data were included. The combined sensitivities for IgG + IgM+, IgM + IgG-, IgG + IgM- and IgG-IgM- were evaluated. More accurate diagnostic results may be obtained using molecular diagnostic tools. The Antibody Rapid Diagnostic kit's (in-house developed) performance was satisfactory for determining the presence of Covid-19 infection with IgG and IgM positivity. The IgG and IgM positivity helped evaluate the immune response in the individual for the COVID-19 infection. These results lend support to the additional utilisation of serological antibody tests in the COVID-19 diagnosis.",

Despite its importance in the context of industrial biotechnology, the use of synthetic biology approaches in K. phaffii is hampered by the fact that few genetic tools are available for precise control of gene expression in this system. In this work, we used an RNA aptamer activated by tetracycline to modulate protein production at the translational level. Using lacZ as gene reporter, we have demonstrated significant reduction of the heterologous protein upon addition of tetracycline. Furthermore, this genetic control device was applied for the control of Ku70p. This protein is involved in non-homologous recombination and the control of its production paves the way for the development of strains exhibiting higher rates of homologous recombination.",

However unlike other bacteria, there is still a paucity of available tools for Mycobacteria. We constructed a new plasmid containing tetracycline-repressive expression system (TetRr1.7) and Xer Site-Specific recombinase system to generate label-free controllable expression strains. The plasmid was subsequently used to construct a strain of M. tuberculosis expressing the only copy of D-alanine:D-alanine ligase under the control of the tetracycline-repressive promoter. The results showed that the mutant strain lost the ability of colony formation, became more sensitive to D-cycloserine and the cell wall of the mutant strain was disrupted when anhydrotetracycline was added to the medium. Taken together these observations, confirmed that the expression of D-alanine:D-alanine ligase was tightly controlled by the promoter. In conclusion, the new plasmid is a convenient tool for constructing stable conditional mutant strains in Mycobacteria and can be used for future target identification.",

Mesoporous silica is known as thermally stable materials with controllable porosity and morphology. It is specified that these materials possess external and internal surfaces that can be selectively adsorbed the various compounds. In the present study, the synthesized mesoporous silica was studied to remove bisacodyl from polluted solutions. Mesoporous silica was synthesized by simple chemical method from tetraethylorthosilicate, ethanol (C2H5OH) and deionized water at 70 °C temperature. Characteristic of synthesized mesoporous silica was investigated by scanning electron microscopy. The effective parameters such as contact time, pH, adsorbate dose, and initial bisacodyl concentration were optimized for bisacodyl removal using 27 batch adsorption experiments according to design of experiment. The residual bisacodyl concentration was measured by UV-Vis spectrometer at the maximum wavelength of 580 nm. The statistical test and linear regression model were used by MINITAB 16 software for investigation of the main and interaction effects of each factor in the adsorption process. The ANOVA result showed 84% of bisacodyl was removed by synthesized mesoporous silica at optimum condition. The result of regression (R2 > 0.99) indicated that the adsorption process followed the Langmuir isotherm and second order kinetic at optimum conditions. The mesoporous silica is an efficient adsorbent for removing of bisacodyl from the polluted solutions so that it can be used for refining wastewaters containing medical compounds such as bisacodyl.",

    "abstract": "In our previous study, a novel genome engineering technology, PCR-mediated chromosome duplication (PCDup), was developed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that enabled the duplication of any desired chromosomal region, resulting in a segmental aneuploid. From one round of transformation, PCDup can duplicate a single chromosomal region efficiently. However, simultaneous duplication of multiple chromosomal regions is not possible using PCDup technology, which is a serious drawback. Sequential duplication is possible, but this approach requires significantly more time and effort. Because PCDup depends upon homologous recombination, we reasoned that it might be possible to simultaneously create duplications of multiple chromosomal regions if we could increase the frequency of these events. Double-strand breaks have been shown to increase the frequency of homologous recombination around the break point. Thus, we aimed to integrate the genome editing tool CRISPR/Cas9 system, which induces double-strand breaks, with our conventional PCDup. The new method, which we named CRISPR-PCDup increased the efficiency of a single duplication by up to 30 fold. CRISPR-PCDup enabled the simultaneous duplication of long chromosomal segments (160 kb and 200 kb regions). Moreover, we were also able to increase the length of the duplicated chromosome by up to at least 400 kb, whereas conventional PCDup can duplicate up to a maximum of 300 kb. Given the enhanced efficiency of chromosomal segmental duplication and the saving in both labor and time, we propose that CRISPR-PCDup will be an invaluable technology for generating novel yeast strains with desirable traits for specific industrial applications and for investigating genome function in segmental aneuploid.",

In this study, we developed a rapid genotyping method for discriminating LVAS-associated high-frequency variants in SLC26A4 gene. The genotyping technique consists of 3' terminal exonuclease-resistant phosphorothioate-modified allele specific primer extension mediated by exo+ polymerase. In PCR amplification by Pfu polymerase, allelic specific primers perfectly matching wild type allele were extended while no specific products were yielded from primers targeting variant allele. Similarly, allelic specific primers perfectly matching variant allele were extended and no specific products were observed from primers targeting wild type allele. The clinical application of 3' terminal phosphorothioate-modified allele specific primer extension mediated by Pfu polymerase identified both homozygous for SLC26A4 gene c.919-2A > G variant in two patients clinically diagnosed as LVAS by temporal bone CT scan. The genetic results from this method are consistent with that of DNA sequencing. The data suggest that exo+ polymerase-mediated 3' terminal phosphorothioate-modified primer extension is reliable in the identification of SLC26A4 gene high-frequency variant prior to high-resolution CT scan. The method is extremely suitable for quickly molecular etiologic screening and early diagnosis and aggressive prevention therapy of LVAS.",

An increase in circulatory levels of inflammatory cytokines has been found in patients with CAD, while the molecular mechanisms of inflammation still remain elusive. This study was designed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and to explore the molecular mechanism and hub genes that are involved in the effects of Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (Lp299v) supplementation. Microarray dataset (GSE156357) was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The DEGs were identified by the R software. Then, the Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses and construction of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were performed by DAVID, STRING, and Cytoscape software. In daily alcohol user (DAU) group, 7,541 DEGs were identified, including 206 up-regulated and 7,335 down-regulated DEGs. In non-daily alcohol user (non-DAU) group, 2,799 DEGs were identified (2,491 up-regulated and 308 down-regulated DEGs). The GO enrichment analysis revealed that miosis was up-regulated and immune response was down-regulated. The KEGG enrichment analysis showed that Lp299v supplementation reduced the levels of chemotactic cytokines, and weakened immune response. Proteins of G protein-coupled receptor, inflammatory response, regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis-related proteins were found in the PPI network. The hub genes were associated with G protein-coupled receptor, inflammatory response, and cell proliferation and apoptosis. The weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) enriched the DEGs in 4 modules. This study indicated the expressions of chemokine receptors and regulation of immune response in the Lp299v supplementation. Meanwhile, it was supposed that chemokine receptors may have a cellular effect.",

    "abstract": "Aquatic environmental microbial biofilms grow in a broad range of redox environments from oxic to methanogenic, and they often also establish internal redox gradients. In technical applications, biofilms are also subjected to controlled redox conditions. Studies on biofilms often make use of fluorescence microscopic imaging techniques together with lectin binding analysis to gain insights into structure, composition, and functions of the biofilms. Here we studied the direct influence of redox potentials on fluorescence lectin binding analyses (FLBA) for two commonly used lectin-fluorophore conjugates. An effect of the electrical potential on signal intensity was observed and found to be statistically significant. The signal intensity changes however, remained within the range of a few percent total. A significant drop in intensity was only observed for extremely oxidizing potentials, typically not found under environmental conditions. Our results showed that the fluorophore itself and not the lectin binding to the respective glycoconjugate causes fluorescence changes. The two tested lectin-fluorophores are shown to be suitable for studying the distribution and composition of EPS in environmental biofilms or technical applications and under varying redox conditions.",

Although structurally and mechanistically similar to the human lysosomal α-N-acetylglucosaminidase (hNAGLU) in GH89 which is involved in the degradation of heparan sulfate in the lysosome, the reported bacterial GH89 enzymes characterized so far have no or low activity toward α-N-acetylglucosamine-terminated heparosan oligosaccharides, the preferred substrates of hNAGLU. We cloned and expressed several soluble and active recombinant bacterial GH89 enzymes in Escherichia coli. Among these enzymes, a truncated recombinant α-N-acetylglucosaminidase from gut symbiotic bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron ∆22Bt3590 was found to catalyze the cleavage of the terminal α1-4-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) from a heparosan disaccharide with high efficiency. Heparosan oligosaccharides with lengths up to decasaccharide were also suitable substrates. This bacterial α-N-acetylglucosaminidase could be a useful catalyst for heparan sulfate analysis.",

    "abstract": "Histamine is an immune mediator that is mainly secreted when an immediate, rapid response is needed in the body, and an excessive secretion of histamine or lack of enzymes that degrade histamine can result in various side effects. Histamine binding protein (HBP) is secreted by a mite species to prevent the host's histamine-induced immune responses by binding the histamine molecule in the blood. Cloning was performed to express HBP on the yeast surface (MBTL-GWL-1), and immunofluorescence (IF) and western blot was performed to confirm the expression of the recombinant protein. The histamine inhibitory ability of GWL-1 cells was tested according to the cell concentration. The highest inhibitory ability of 1.30 × 107 CFU/ml of GWL-1 cells was of about 60 %. The GWL-1 cell concentration and the degree of histamine inhibition were confirmed to be dose-dependent, and dead cell debris was shown to have a histamine inhibitory effect, although not as much as that of whole cells. Phagocytosis assays were performed to determine whether histamine affected the RAW 264.7 cell's phagocytosis, and to indirectly confirm the GWL-1 cell's histamine inhibition. By confirming that, we found that GWL-1 captures histamine. Therefore, it can be expected to become a competitive material in the anti-allergy market.",

    "abstract": "Robust statistical tools such as the Skellam model and Bayesian networks can capture the count properties of transcriptome sequencing data and clusters of genes among treatments, thereby improving our knowledge of gene functions and networks. In this study, we successfully implemented a model to analyze a transcriptome dataset of Cucumis sativus and Botrytis cinerea before and after their interaction. First, 4200 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from C. sativus were clustered into 17 distinct groups, and 670 DEGs from B. cinerea were clustered into 12 groups. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were applied on these DEGs to assess the interactions between C. sativus and B. cinerea. In C. sativus, more DEGs were divided into terms in the molecular function and biological process domains than into cellular components, and 277 DEGs were allocated to 19 KEGG pathways. In B. cinerea, more DEGs were divided into terms in the biological process and cellular component domains than into molecular functions, and 150 DEGs were allocated to 26 KEGG pathways. In this study, we constructed networks of genes that interact with each other to screen hub genes based on a directed graphical model known as Bayesian networks. Through a detailed GO analysis, we excavated hub genes which were biologically meaningful. These results verify that availability of Skellam model and Bayesian networks in clustering gene expression data and sorting out hub genes. These models are instrumental in increasing our knowledge of gene functions and networks in plant-pathogen interaction.",

    "abstract": "Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase, EC 5.2.1.8) catalyzes the racemization reaction of proline residues on a polypeptide chain. This enzyme is also known to function as a molecular chaperon to stabilize protein conformation during the folding process. In this study, we noted FK506 binding protein (FKBP)-type PPIase from a hyperthemophilic archaeon Thermococcus sp. strain KS-1 (PPIase KS-1) to improve the solubility of Pseudomonas putida aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) that is an indispensable enzyme for fermentative production of plant isoquinoline alkaloids. AADC fused N-terminally with the PPIase KS-1 (PPIase KS-1-AADC), which was synthesized utilizing Escherichia coli host, showed improved solubility and, consequently, the cell-free extract from the recombinant strain exhibited 2.6- to 3.4-fold elevated AADC activity than that from the control strain that expressed the AADC gene without PPIase KS-1. On the other hand, its thermostability was slightly decreased by fusing PPIase KS-1. The recombinant E. coli cells expressing the PPIase KS-1-AADC gene produced dopamine and phenylethylamine from L-dopa and phenylalanine by two- and threefold faster, respectively, as compared with the control strain. We further demonstrated that the efficacy of PPIase KS-1-AADC in solubility and activity enhancement was a little but obviously higher than that of AADC fused N-terminally with NusA protein, which has been assumed to be the most effective protein solubilizer. These results suggest that PPIase KS-1 can be used as one of the best choices for producing heterologous proteins as active forms in E. coli.",
