    "abstract": "The assessment of biota in rivers is a widely recognised means of determining the condition or 'health' of rivers. Benthic macroinvertebrates, in particular, are recognised as valuable organisms for bioassessments, due largely to their visibility to the naked eye, ease of identification, rapid life cycle often based on the seasons and their largely sedentary habits. Numerous bioassessment techniques have been developed over the last three decades, varying in complexity and region of implementation. South Africa has an exemplary history in this field, culminating in the refinement of invertebrate and other techniques and their application in a National River Health Programme. The method presented here is a refinement of the highly successful SASS (South African Scoring System) method developed by Chutter (1994), which forms the backbone of this programme. This paper takes the method to a level where it can, and has been, accredited to ISO standards. The principal changes made include the tighter definition of the technique and the sampling and analytical methods, as well as the introduction of quality control procedures. Some changes have also been made to the list of invertebrates used in this method. Field trials were conducted to test the variability of the method. Of the various indices available to the method, the Average Score per Taxon (ASPT) is the most consistent over all biotopes (lowest CV%). On the other hand, of the biotopes examined the Gravel/Sand/Mud (GSM) combination is the most variable with respect to the SASS Score and number of taxa encountered. The spatial variability on a reach of river with similar water quality characteristics was found to be statistically negligible. However, one generally finds that statistically significant differences occur between the SASS Scores and the number of taxa counted by different operators. The ASPT, on the other hand, is a more consistent and repeatable measure of river health assessment and, within a given reach of river and considering all biotopes, the differences in results produced by different operators were statistically negligible. The results highlight the need for appropriate competency-based training and consistent application of the method.",

    "abstract": "For nearly three decades, the Whitfield (1992) characterisation scheme served as a reference framework to type South African estuaries. We outline a revised ecosystem classification scheme that incorporates biogeographical zonation and introduces new types. Coastal outlets were re-categorised as estuaries or micro-systems. For functional estuaries, the Estuarine Lakes, Estuarine Bays and Predominantly Open Estuary types were largely retained. New types are Estuarine Lagoons and Arid Predominantly Closed Estuaries. The numerically dominant, temporarily open/closed category was subdivided into Small and Large Temporarily Closed Estuaries, with a total habitat area of 15 ha, serving as threshold separating these two subdivisions. River mouths were renamed Fluvially Dominated Estuaries and divided into large and small size categories to reflect dissimilar catchment influences. Micro-systems were separated into micro-estuaries, micro-outlets, and waterfalls. South Africa’s 290 estuaries were classified into 22 estuarine ecosystem categories arising from nine estuary types occurring across four biogeographical zones. In addition, 202 micro-systems were classified into nine ecosystem types, of which only the micro-estuaries (42) share possible functionality with estuaries. Estuaries subjected to functional shifts were also identified. The classification system provides a framework that integrates biogeography and the range of biophysical parameters evident in South Africa, and can be used for red listing of ecosystem types and determining estuarine sensitivity to pressures.",

    "abstract": "Water quality deterioration in sub-Saharan Africa has attained a scale that requires scientific intervention. It is therefore important to devise appropriate and reliable techniques to investigate the water quality of lakes and reservoirs for the development of water resource management strategies. Whilst conventional water quality monitoring methods have been widely used due to their accuracy, these methods are time-consuming, costly and practically impossible to use at broader scales. This paper reviews the literature on various remote sensing platforms and techniques used for assessing and monitoring water quality in sub-Saharan Africa, and highlights their strengths and weaknesses. The use of remote sensing technology could enhance water quality monitoring, since remotely sensed data offer timely, up-to-date and comparatively accurate information, which is necessary for water resource management and strategic decision making. However, the use of this technology in some parts of sub-Saharan Africa is still at its infancy because of its high cost and limited availability.",

    "abstract": "Nutrient pollution in South African estuaries is described using a Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response framework. The root cause (‘driver’) of deteriorating water quality is rapid population growth that leads to increasing inputs from wastewater treatment works (WWTWs), stormwater run-off and agricultural return flow (‘pressures’). Nationally, half of the country’s estuaries are affected by nutrient pollution (‘state’). This has elicited marked primary producer and secondary (hypoxia, fish kills, loss of ecosystem services) responses (‘impact’). The Sundays and Swartkops Estuaries are eutrophic with phytoplankton blooms (>20 µg l−1) and bottom-water hypoxia. Similarly, the nationally important Knysna Estuary experiences eutrophic conditions associated with macroalgal blooms, whereas the Wildevoëlvlei and Zeekoe systems have transitioned to alternate stable states characterised by toxic cyanobacteria blooms, as a result of WWTW inputs and increased water residence times. The health of the St Lucia Estuary, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is under threat from agricultural inputs from the uMfolozi system. Nationally, better treatment and recycling of WWTW inputs is required to improve and restore estuary health. Owing to excessive WWTW effluent volumes, treatment to South Africa’s uniform effluent standards no longer prevent eutrophication. Other urgent interventions needed are compliance monitoring, engineering solutions to reduce stormwater and wastewater input, and prudent application of agricultural fertilisers.",

In this study a Tanzanian macroinvertebrate-based biotic method, Tanzania River Scoring System (TARISS), was developed in 2012, based on the South African Scoring System (SASS). Macroinvertebrate samples were collected from 101 sites, including both reference and test sites, in the Pangani, Rufiji and Wami–Ruvu basins in the Pangani highlands and central eastern Africa ecoregions. TARISS modification involved adjustments of the list of taxa and the assigning of sensitivity weightings to three new families. Six SASS taxa were excluded and three new taxa were included, resulting in a total of 96 TARISS taxa. Assigned sensitivity weightings of the new taxa were: 10 for Dicercomyzidae, 9 for Ephemerythidae and 4 for Neritidae. Through validation, TARISS proved to be reliable in distinguishing reference from test sites, based on macroinvertebrate assemblages and TARISS metrics. The degree of reliability in distinguishing reference from test sites was higher when river types were used. TARISS scores and average score per taxon (ASPT) showed stronger correlations with the disturbance gradient, and were more reliable in distinguishing between reference and test sites than the number of taxa.",

Hybridisation between escaped O. niloticus and native Oreochromis species is of concern due to potential negative effects on wild genetic resources for conservation, aquaculture and capture fisheries. We document the 2008–2010 extent of O. niloticus established in the Kafue River, Zambia, test for hybridisation with two native species, O. andersonii and O. macrochir, using eight microsatellite loci, and evaluate losses in genetic diversity. We genotyped parental O. niloticus (n = 6), O. andersonii (n = 22) and O. macrochir (n = 28) to provide genetic baselines, and compared these to 33 fish from the Kafue River that possessed hybrid phenotypes. Analysis using the program STRUCTURE suggested that most specimens were of hybrid ancestry, representing an admixture of O. niloticus, O. andersonii and O. macrochir. Using the program NEWHYBRIDS, one individual was identified as probably being a recent hybrid. The state of tilapia biodiversity in the Kafue River suggests that non-native tilapia introduction may have negative impacts on the genetic resources available for aquaculture and fisheries. Managers should carefully account for these risks when considering further exotic introductions to regions where non-native tilapia have not yet become established.",

However, these ecosystems in Ethiopia are deteriorating, because of economic growth, unwise use and pollution (eutrophication). This paper reviews existing trends of eutrophication in Ethiopian water bodies, identifies principal sources of nutrient pollution, highlights major consequences, and proposes measures to control eutrophication. The trophic state of all major Ethiopian lakes considered in the current assessment ranges from eutrophic to hypereutrophic. A major cause of eutrophication is the use of chemical fertilisers that has grown > 186 times between the 1970s and 2012. Similarly, the large livestock population has contributed to the increase in nitrogen and phosphorus accumulated in the soil, which is often washed into aquatic ecosystems. Urbanisation and industrial effluents and associated wastewaters are the other causes of eutrophication. The major consequences include shifts to bloom-forming cyanobacteria, prolific growth of water hyacinth, hypoxia, fish kills and health risks. To control eutrophication and avoid its devastating consequences, raising public awareness, creating buffer strips, development of chemical fertiliser use guidelines based on plant removal rates and soil types, wastewater treatments, issuance of policy on Water Quality Guidelines, and the establishment of a National Aquatic Ecosystem Monitoring Program are recommended.",

Nevertheless, due to an increase of human activities and to climate change, in less than 20 years these ecosystems have lost one fifth of their global surface area. In response to this decrease, mangrove reforestation incentives have spread throughout the world. The scientific and societal legitimacy of reforestation actions still remain in question. Focusing on two case studies, the Saloum Delta and Lower Casamance, Senegal, our methodology was mainly based on the analysis of environmental narratives and discourses between 2009 and 2013, and on reforestation campaigns conducted by NGOs. We highlight the complexity of the system of values associated with the mangroves, as well as the positive and negative interactions between the services. Even although the reforestation campaigns were generally successful in terms of reforested surfaces and international visibility, they were poor in terms of biological and cultural diversities and led to spatial injustice. Moreover, the extensive reforestation with a unique mangrove species, Rhizophora mangle, was perceived as means of 'green grabbing', and the simultaneous buying of carbon tax by industrial conglomerates induced disempowerment of the local communities. More integrated research programmes must be developed towards the extensive knowledge of the mangroves.",

Landsat images from 1984, 1995, 2001 and 2011 were used to compute a normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), which was then used as a proxy for indicating areas infested by surface floating aquatic weeds. Forest and shrubs covered 310.8 km2 in 1984, but had deteriorated by 24.87% to 77.3 km2 in 2011, while the area under cultivation increased by 51.44% between 1984 and 2011. Runoff from surrounding farms could be responsible for washing soil nutrients into Lake Mutirikwi, enriching its water. A large aggregation of surface floating aquatic weeds concentrated upstream along tributaries of Lake Mutirikwi, mainly the Mucheke which received sewage from Masvingo town, with less coverage in the central parts of the lake.

The delta comprises a large curvilinear spit that widens in its central portion due to the adjunction of successive sandy beach ridges. The appearance of a distinct spit, in lieu of a continuous barrier from the present mouth of the Volta River to the Bight of Benin coast, may be an outgrowth of a natural change in the location of the mouth of the Volta. The spit marks a segmentation of the unique sand drift cell that hitherto prevailed on this bight coast. Spit growth has been accompanied by a wave of erosion over the last century of the immediate downdrift sector of the bight coast, endangering the town of Keta. Erosion since the 1960s may have been aggravated by the construction of the Akosombo hydropower dam. The tip of the spit has recently welded to the shoreline, thus assuring resumption of sand supply from the Volta towards the rest of this formerly sand-starved sector of the bight coast. Blocking of sediment by the Akosombo Dam is, in due course, likely to become the overarching factor in delta shoreline stability.",

    "abstract": "Eutrophication is a serious phenomenon that leads to vigorous algal blooms that alters the structure of ecosystems. It is caused by non-point sources of nutrients; as nitrogen and phosphorus, and point sources as wastewater effluent. Distinctive algae groups are responsible for this phenomenon, such as diatoms, blue-green algae, green algae, and dinoflagellates. Numerous solutions have been considered to control eutrophication and harmful algal blooms such as the biological removal of nitrogen and phosphorus. Advanced treatments (i.e. green technology) depend upon the remediation of wastewater before discharge, such as the removal of phosphorus using agricultural waste-based biosorbents (AWBs) from water and wastewater, and phosphorus sorption performance by both unmodified and modified AWBs. Phyto-remediation includes many procedures that encompass the cost-effective and environmentally friendly methods used to remove or reduce excess natural/inorganic contaminants in groundwater, surface water, and soil. Due to the rapid growth of duckweeds and their ability to rapidly remove minerals as phosphates and nitrogen from the water, duckweed may be the most promising plant for controlling eutrophication and, therefore, harmful algal blooms.",

    "abstract": "A Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (B-IBI) was developed for the Moiben River. The index assesses effects of human disturbance on the biotic condition of stream macroinvertebrate communities. Eight stations were selected to represent different land-use types including forestry, settlement, grassland and mixed farming, practiced at different intensities. A total of 22 metrics were correlated against habitat quality and water quality parameters to determine their interrelationships. Ten metrics were shown to be responsive to changes in water and habitat quality, so could be used to separate sites according to levels of degradation. These were taxa richness (of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and intolerant taxa richness), assemblage composition (percentage Ephemeroptera + Plecoptera + Trichoptera [EPT] individuals, and percentage of individuals in dominant taxa), pollution tolerance (percentage of tolerant individuals) and three functional feeding group metrics (ratio of scraper:filterer individuals, percentage gatherer genera, and percentage predator individuals). We calculated B-IBIs by summing metrics for each site, after transforming them to a discrete 1, 3, 5 scale. Values for the final index correlated well with measures of human influence based on qualitative assessment of habitat quality (Pearson's r 2 = 0.88). This preliminary benthic macroinvertebrate B-IBI shows promise for developing biological standards, which would facilitate long-term monitoring of streams in the upper reaches of Lake Victoria Basin.",

Population HAI results showed that O. andersonii was most affected in terms of necropsy-related alterations, followed by S. angusticeps, whilst identical low values were calculated for C. ngamensis and C. gariepinus. Quantitative histological results corresponded with the HAI results. The liver and gills of O. andersonii were most affected in terms of the percentage prevalence of the histological alterations identified. These were mostly associated with inflammation, and progressive and regressive changes. The histology of the liver and gills was also more affected in terms of the type and severity of the histological alterations identified, compared to that in the gonads of all four species. The majority of alterations were most likely caused by the prevalence of parasitic infections.",

Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera dominated the headwater stations, whereas Coleoptera, Oligochaeta and Chironomidae dominated further downstream. Significant relationships were recorded between physico-chemical parameters — conductivity, BOD, temperature, and discharge — and the occurrence of specific taxa, mainly Heptagenia, Caenis, Baetis, Branchiobdella, Potamon, Ilyocoris, Elmis and Chironomus. Significant changes in macroinvertebrate assemblages were primarily due to changes in water quality.

    "abstract": "Public concern has recently escalated over pesticide contamination of South African aquatic ecosystems. This review of published literature on the occurrence of pesticides within South African freshwater systems indicates that fewer than 50 studies of selected pesticides have been undertaken, with emphasis being on organochlorines. Extensive historical usage has led to the widespread persistence of selected organochlorines. Few studies have established linkages between pesticides, exposure pathways, environmental concentrations and the monitoring of toxicological effects on non-target organisms. Emphasis is now being placed on developing more field-relevant assessments, including microcosm and mesocosm studies, in situ bioassays and field studies. There are few data relating to the extent of exposure and effects of pesticides in South African aquatic environments, and thus further research is needed. Research should focus on multidisciplinary approaches that increase effective decisionmaking in data-poor circumstances. A pesticide risk assessment programme for aquatic ecosystems needs to be implemented in South Africa, which could feed into the National Toxicity Monitoring Programme. Preliminary risk assessment models should be used to detect pesticides posing possible or definite risks, whereafter more detailed chemical, toxicological and biological monitoring assessments should be performed if risks are predicted.",

    "abstract": "Fire is an extensively used wetland management tool in both tropical and temperate areas, but its effects on wetlands are not well understood. The purpose of this paper is to review the effects of fire on wetland hydrology, biogeochemical cycling and vegetation composition, including primary effects that take place during the fire such as combustion of plant material, loss of volatile substances to the atmosphere and deposition of ash on the soil surface, and secondary effects such as alteration of soil pH as a result of ash deposition, exposure of the soil surface to solar radiation, and increased availability of nutrients. Several of the secondary effects are most dramatic immediately after a fire, but become progressively modulated by newly stimulated vegetation growth. The findings suggest that the effects of fire depend upon a wetland's characteristics, including its climatic and hydrological context, as well as upon interactions with other disturbances such as grazing. Thus, similar fire regimes may have dramatically different outcomes. Where knowledge gaps were identified, some general predictions are offered, drawing from comparable ecosystems such as mesic grasslands. These predictions provide potential hypotheses for further research.",

Macroinvertebrates were sampled seasonally between August 2009 and July 2010 using the South African Scoring System version 5 (SASS5) protocol at one reference site upstream of Uitenhage and three downstream sites. Assessment of water quality impacts on macroinvertebrates was based on the discriminatory ability of metrics between the reference and impaired sites, and on their correlation with the physico-chemical variables. The metrics' discriminatory ability was explored using box plots, and their relationships with water chemistry variables elucidated with Pearson's correlation. Trichoptera abundance, %Chironomidae + Oligochaeta, %Ephemeroptera–Trichoptera–Odonata–Coleoptera (ETOC), %Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera–Plecoptera–Trichoptera (EPT) richness, ETOC richness, Margalef's family richness index, equitability, Shannon and Simpson diversity indices, SASS5 score and average score per taxon (ASPT) discriminated between the reference and impacted sites, and also exhibited significant correlations (p < 0.05) with water chemistry variables. Conversely, Gastropoda abundance, EPT abundance, ETOC abundance, EPT:Chironomidae ratio, %EPT, %Corixidae, %Oligochaeta + Hirudinae, Chironomidae + Oligochaeta abundance and Hemiptera + Diptera richness did not discriminate between the reference and impacted sites.

Lower molecular weight PAHs were predominant, with naphthalene accounting for the highest concentration in all samples. Carcinogenic PAHs detected included benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(a)anthracene and chrysene.

Water samples, collected during dry and wet seasons at locations chosen on the basis of their dominant land use, were analysed for physical, chemical and biological contamination. Increased anions and cations were found downstream of urban areas, although most values were within acceptable levels. Total coliforms increased by 176.1% and Escherichia coli counts increased by 157% downstream of urban areas, these levels being above the permitted local and international standards. Water quality index computations showed that the overall river water quality in both wet and dry seasons were 'medium' and 'bad' at the sampled locations, showing that the water was unsuitable for human consumption without treatment. Waste management, the enforcement of buffer zones on river banks, urban land-use regulation for improving water quality, improved sanitation, the provision of civic education to communities and the employment of an ecosystem approach in management of the catchment are recommended.",

The effect of the BCH families on the EPT index was evaluated and alternatives were considered to improve its performance. The hypothesis that the removal of the BCH families improves sensitivity of the EPT index to human-induced stressors in streams and rivers was tested. Macroinvertebrates were collected in January–March 2009 at 22 sites in the Nyando and Nzoia Rivers, Lake Victoria basin, Kenya. Nine derivatives and modifications of the EPT index were tested for responses to a disturbance gradient, ranked into three condition categories (reference, intermediate and impaired). The sensitivity of the proportionate abundance derivative of the EPT index improved when the BCH families were removed, whereas that of the richness derivative improved marginally. Other modifications considered performed poorly when compared with the EPT-BCH metrics. Wide distribution of the BCH across all sites, irrespective of the level of disturbance, reduced the sensitivity of the EPT index in the studied streams. The removal of the BCH families enhanced the sensitivity of the index to multiple stressors in Afrotropical streams and rivers.",

    "abstract": "The transformation of Lake Victoria that began in 1980 followed the population explosion of Nile perch Lates niloticus, causing the apparent extirpation of 500+ endemic haplochromine species and dramatic physico-chemical changes. Officially introduced in 1962–1963, but present earlier, the reasons for the long delay before its population exploded are discussed. The hypothesis that it occurred only after the haplochromine decline is evaluated, but haplochromines declined only after the Nile perch expansion began. The sudden eutrophication of the lake was attributed to Nile perch, but evidence of eutrophication from 1950 onwards led some researchers to conclude that it was the result of climatic changes. We conclude that the haplochromine destruction disrupted the complex food webs that existed prior to the upsurge of Nile perch. The depletion of fish biomass by Nile perch may have been the source of extra phosphorus responsible for the eutrophication of the lake. After the Nile perch explosion in 1980 the fish population came to be dominated by only three species, but fisheries productivity increased at least 10-fold. Fishing has caused demographic changes in Nile perch, which may have allowed some haplochromine species to recover. The condition of the lake appears to have stabilised since 2000, partly because the fish biomass has risen to at least 2 × 106 t, replacing the ‘lost’ biomass and restoring some ecosystem functioning.",

However, it is under constant anthropogenic pressures, which include the quest for socioeconomic development within the lake ecosystem itself as well as other activities within the catchment. The lake is an important source of fresh water in an otherwise water-deficient zone. It supports a thriving fishery, an extensive flower-growing industry and geothermal power generation. It is home to a wide range of aquatic and terrestrial flora and fauna, including vegetation, birds, fish and mammals. The adjacent area is ideal for horticulture, which plays a crucial role in the development of both the local and national economy, providing employment to more than 30 000 people. The Lake Naivasha area produces up to 70% of Kenya's total horticultural output and contributes significant foreign exchange to the national economy. However, the lake and its surrounding areas are fragile ecosystems that face increasing threats from irrigated agriculture, water abstraction, the fast-growing Naivasha Township, and human population growth throughout the basin. Agricultural and livestock farming activities within the 3 376km2 catchment area are also a threat to the lake ecosystem. This paper reviews some of the adverse socioeconomic activities that exert pressure on the lake, as well as bioindicator data that may be useful in assessing the overall quality of the lake as an important wetland ecosystem.",

The Manyame and Mukuvisi rivers are severely polluted by industrial and domestic effluent, whilst the Gwebi River is not influenced by urban effluent. Key water quality parameters, including dissolved oxygen and conductivity, clearly showed a pollution gradient in the Mukuvisi and Manyame rivers, but water quality in the Gwebi River was good. Levels of zinc, iron, copper, nickel and lead in fish tissues from the three rivers sampled were unusually high, with zinc and iron concentrations being the highest in all the tissues. This was also positively correlated with the concentrations of these metals in water and sediments. Notable differences existed between the water (zinc and copper) and sediments (iron and zinc) of each river. The relatively high metal concentrations in the Gwebi River, as well as conductivity and dissolved ions, were explained by the geological influence of the Great Dyke in its subcatchment. Metals are bound in the sediment but these can be rapidly mobilised into water if environmental changes occur, therefore efforts to monitor and prevent further water quality deterioration are required. The results of this study may have significant negative implications for aquatic organisms and for human health through fish consumption and therefore risk assessment investigations are imperative.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Alien fishes are considered the most serious threat to native headwater stream fishes in South Africa. A 4 km reach of the Rondegat River is the first section of a South African river to be rehabilitated through the attempted removal of alien fish by using the piscicide rotenone. The objectives of the current study were to establish the distribution and relative abundance of native and alien fish prior to treatment, and to assess the immediate impact of the treatment on the fish population. Forty-three sites were sampled using backpack electrofishing, snorkel transects and underwater video analysis. In the invaded lower reaches, native Labeobarbus capensis was detected only at very low densities, while three other native fish species were not detected. Alien fish were not detected above a barrier waterfall 5 km upstream of the river's confluence with a reservoir. The fish density of 97 fish per 100 m2 in non-invaded reaches was more than an order of magnitude higher than that of 7 fish per 100 m2 in the invaded reach. A total of 470 Micropterus dolomieu and 139 L. capensis were removed from a 4 km treatment zone during the rotenone operation. No fish were detected in this area after the rotenone treatment.

The effect of acute exposure to ibuprofen was evaluated using changes in behaviour and haematological parameters under static bio-assay method in Clarias gariepinus. Test specimens were exposed to acute concentrations of ibuprofen (0.28, 0.33, 0.38, 0.43 and 0.48 mg l−1) for 24, 48, 72 and 96 h durations respectively. Behavioural and phenotypic changes were observed in surviving fish. There were significant (p < 0.05) concentration and duration-dependent increases in erythrocyte (RBC), haemoglobin (Hb), pack cell volume (PCV) and leukocytes (WBC) in treated fish compared to the control. Insignificant decreases (p > 0.05) in mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) were observed in treated fish compared to the control. Ibuprofen elicited dose and duration- dependent decrease in neutrophil counts with the decreases being significant (p < 0.05) in the higher doses of 0.43 and 0.48 mg l−1. Ibuprofen did not elicit any significant changes in monocytes, basophils and eosinophils. Changes observed in this study showed that ibuprofen negatively affected the health of the fish and we recommend that discharge of ibuprofen into the aquatic environment should be monitored and controlled.",

    "abstract": "Sea-level rise is a significant threat to salt marshes. However, these habitats can respond by increasing their relative elevation, or by migrating into adjacent areas. Here we provide the first report on surface elevation change for salt marsh at the Knysna Estuary, South Africa, and predict the responses of these habitats to sea-level rise using the Sea-Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM). Recent (2018) surface elevation measurements at lower intertidal salt marsh sites were compared with those from 2009–2011. The long-term (1960–2017) relative sea-level rise (RSLR) was estimated as 2.19 mm y−1 and only two of the seven sites assessed are keeping pace with this RSLR. The SLAMM, which was applied to a focus area near Thesen's Island, predicted up to 40% loss of upper intertidal salt marsh by 2100, because development in the adjacent area prevents habitat migration. Currently, salt marsh habitats cover a total of 667 ha, and artificial structures are present along 20.7 km of the perimeter. Protecting areas for salt marsh migration should be a conservation priority, because this estuary supports the third largest area of intertidal salt marsh in the country. Monitoring the responses of coastal wetlands should be prioritised so that natural capital contributes towards future resilience.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacterial blooms have increased in freshwater ecosystems worldwide in the last century, mostly resulting from eutrophication and climate change. These blooms represent serious threats to environmental and human health because of the production of harmful metabolites, called cyanotoxins. Like many countries, Egypt has been plagued with cyanobacterial blooms in most water sources, including the Nile River, irrigation canals, lakes and fishponds. However, the data about cyanotoxins produced in these blooms are limited. Only two types of cyanotoxins, microcystins and cylindrospermopsin, have been identified and characterised, mainly from Microcystis and Cylindrospermopsis blooms. The data revealed the presence of microcystins in raw and treated drinking waters at concentrations (0.05–3.8 µg l−1), exceeding the WHO limit (1 µg l−1) in some drinking water treatment plants. In addition, Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus caught from ponds containing heavy cyanobacterial blooms have accumulated considerable amounts of cyanotoxins in their edible tissues. The data presented here could be the catalyst for the establishment of a monitoring and management programme for harmful cyanobacteria and their cyanotoxins in Egyptian fresh waters. This review also elucidates the important research gaps and possible avenues for future research on cyanobacterial blooms and cyanotoxins in Egypt.",

    "abstract": "Although biomonitoring of freshwater bodies is important in East Africa as a result of increasing environmental threats, the identification guides of benthic macroinvertebrates used to generate data for developing metrics for this purpose are mainly not regionally specific. This casts doubt on the reliability and utility of generated data, given varying macroinvertebrate taxa in biogeographical regions. This review examined literature on freshwater macroinvertebrate studies and focused on the types of identification guides that are in use in East Africa, with a view of developing local ones for the region, to enable reliable and effective data collection and usage. The literature examined included peer-reviewed papers, books, dissertations, and un-refereed reports. Currently, it is mainly macroinvertebrate identification guides from temperate and other regions that are used in East Africa. Therefore, there is a need to develop identification guides that are based on local benthic macroinvertebrate species of East Africa. To achieve this, both lotic and lentic freshwater macroinvertebrates in various localities of East Africa should be collected through standardised protocols, taxonomically characterised and documented. Molecular phylogenetic tools, coupled with creation of a database should be considered to aid species identification of macroinvertebrates and freshwater biomonitoring in East Africa.",

    "abstract": "Aquatic ecosystems contribute to human well-being by delivering ecosystem services, but their protection has been given low priority in Africa. Lake Ziway in the Ethiopian Rift Valley basin provides services including irrigation, drinking water and fish food in the region. This paper reviews the biological resources and spatio- temporal variation of water quality of the lake focussing on nutrients, metals and pesticides. Lake Ziway is under increasing agricultural and urban pressure and is exhibiting deteriorating trends in several water quality and ecological parameters. Nutrients and trace metals, including PO43−, NO3−, NH4+, Ca2+, Cu and Ni of the lake have shown increasing temporal trends in concentration. Spatially, higher values of major parameters (e.g. NO3 −, NH4 +, K, Na and electrical conductivity) were observed at shoreline sites near floriculture farming. The water quality of the lake exceeded guideline values for drinking water (alkalinity and Fe) and for aquatic life (NH +, Fe, Cr, Cu and Se). The recently reported pesticides in the lake possibly cause ecological and human health effect. Accordingly, agriculture and urbanisation are affecting water quality of Lake Ziway, with likely negative effects on human health and the lake ecosystem function unless appropriate interventions are taken. Our results may be useful in assessing other African lakes subject to similar anthropogenic pressures in their catchments.",

Despite formal protection the estuary is open access and vulnerable to resource exploitation, development, pollution and freshwater inflow alterations. Through a review of current research and available data, the current study evaluated the ecological status of the Knysna Estuary, identified major pressures and proposed future management and conservation actions. Notable impacts included deteriorating water quality, development and resource use pressures. Nuisance macroalgal blooms in response to eutrophication have increased, displacing important seagrass habitats and affecting biota, including an increase in alien species. This review found that the ecological health of the Knysna Estuary is deteriorating, which suggests limited success from current conservation and management actions. Monitoring data to effectively assess system change over time were notably absent. Suggested remediation actions include halting non-compliant discharges from the Knysna Waste Water Treatment Works and the development of goal-orientated monitoring programmes to enable proactive conservation. Successful conservation depends on cross-sectorial management of the estuary and surrounds, and support is required from multiple institutions to achieve this.",

In many studies the second, and sometimes the first, most serious identified threat to indigenous aquatic fauna is introduced fish species. Brown trout, Salmo trutta, and rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, were first introduced into South African waters as angling species in the later part of the nineteenth century, when environmental impact studies were neither considered nor undertaken. Trout have since been introduced mainly into the cooler upper catchments of rivers, many of which are now known to contain rare endemic aquatic species which urgently require conserving. Countries such as South Africa need to review the environmental costs of the presence of trout, and to take these costs into consideration when new policies and legislation are promulgated. Whilst there should be a complete ban on the introduction of trout into currently troutless sections of river, some rivers, particularly those harbouring threatened species, urgently need to be rehabilitated by having their trout eradicated. Part of the cost of this exercise should be borne by anglers from fees collected at approved trout angling areas. A number of recommendations are presented to help solve the present problems.",

The estuary mouth closed in June 2002 and has remained so for more than two-and-a-half years. A lack of information on biotic responses during extended closed-mouth conditions prompted a study to ascertain the current status of the fish fauna in the system. Fish were sampled with seine and gill-nets at six sites spread throughout the system. At the time of sampling in December 2004, the system had become partitioned into four isolated compartments. A total of 4 475 fish comprising 30 species were recorded during the survey. The CPUEs were generally low, except for those of Oreochromis mossambicus, Liza dumerili and Ambassis ambassis. The freshwater cichlid O. mossambicus made up 45% of the total catch. The species composition in each of the four compartments of the system were very different. Historical data indicated a loss of about 40% of the commonly-occurring species from the lake since mouth closure, reflecting a substantial change in species composition from that which occurs under 'normal' conditions. It is expected that the decline in the number of species and the abundance of remaining taxa will continue if drought conditions persist and the mouth remains closed.",

    "abstract": "Invasive fish and plants are widespread in the rivers and riparian zones of the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa and represent potential threats to the highly endemic freshwater fauna. We investigated the impact of invasive smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) and black wattle (Acacia mearnsii) on assemblages of macroinvertebrates and fish in a cobble-bed foothill river, the Rondegat River, in the Cederberg mountains, by sampling from sites representing four invasion conditions: no invasion; invasive trees; invasive fish; invasive trees and fish. Invertebrate assemblages were sensitive to invasion from bass and/or wattle: in the presence of A. mearnsii the abundance of some cobble-dwelling taxa were reduced, while those of particle-feeding mayflies and chironomids increased, reflecting increased leaf litter and sediment produced by acacias. In the presence of bass the abundance of most invertebrate taxa, particularly Chironomidae and Baetidae, increased, whereas the algal-grazing Heptageniidae and Elmidae were moderately reduced. These changes in invertebrate assemblages, coupled with data on the biomass and diet of fishes, indicate that smallmouth bass, in contrast to indigenous fish, do not exert a strong influence on the abundance of their invertebrate prey. Bass remove indigenous insectivorous fish predators, thereby reducing predation on invertebrate prey, with consequent food-web effects that influence the invertebrate community assemblage.",

A quantitative assessment of aquatic invertebrates in the Wit River, Sundays River catchment, Eastern Cape, South Africa, was undertaken to assess the impact of the alien fish Micropterus salmoides on their relative abundance and community structure. Communities in the stones-in-current and marginal vegetation biotopes were sampled in the presence and absence of M. salmoides in late summer (February–April) 2008. Results suggest that the presence of M. salmoides does have an impact on indigenous macroinvertebrate fauna and communities. Community structure in the stones-in-current biotopes did not differ significantly between sections of the river with or without fish. However, there was a significant difference in community structure in marginal vegetation between sections of river. In sections with M. salmoides several large or conspicuous taxa (Odonata, Hemiptera and Coleoptera) were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) or even absent, while cryptic/inconspicuous taxa (Trichoptera, Leptoceridae and Mollusca, Physidae) were significantly more abundant (p < 0.05).

We investigated whether the degree of predictability in a stream's water temperature profile provides insights into the structure and functional predictability of macroinvertebrate communities. Quarterly macroinvertebrate sampling over 11 months at five paired sites along the longitudinal axes of the Keurbooms River, Western Cape, and the Kowie/Bloukrans River, Eastern Cape, was undertaken in conjunction with collection of hourly water temperatures. Macroinvertebrate taxonomic turnover across seasons was higher for sites having lower water temperature predictability values than for sites with higher predictability, while temporal partitioning was greater at sites with greater temperature variability. Macroinvertebrate taxa responded in a predictable manner to changes in their environment. Specialist taxa preferred sites with greater temperature variability, and generalist taxa those with less temperature variability. Water temperature is an important abiotic driver of stream ecosystems, and should be expressed in terms of predictability metrics, as mean values do not adequately measure the components of water temperature that are important for biotic communities. Water temperature predictability provided an indication of the structure, functional predictability and seasonal turnover in macroinvertebrate communities. These findings have implications for streams experiencing temperature modifications due to the onset of climate change.",

This study aimed to identify the environmental variables shaping phytoplankton community composition and succession patterns during a typical spring/summer harmful algal bloom (HAB) period. Monitoring of abiotic and phytoplankton variables was undertaken over the period of a month in 2016. Surface water salinity corresponding to mesohaline conditions (9 to 12) was a prerequisite for site selection. During the study, two HABs (>550 µg Chl a l−1) of H. akashiwo occurred, each lasting for approximately a week in duration. Analyses highlighted nutrient depletion (i.e. nitrate and phosphate concentrations) as the key constraint on bloom duration. When the density of H. akashiwo decreased, the community composition became more diverse with species belonging to Bacillariophyceae and Dinophyceae becoming more abundant; albeit to a lesser degree (<180 µg Chl a l−1). Dissolved oxygen shifted from super-saturated conditions (>14 mg l−1) during peak HAB conditions, to instances of bottom water oxygen depletion (2–4 mg l−1) during the decay phase. These findings highlight the potential severity of transforming a catchment from natural to one that is highly regulated by agricultural practices, while also emphasising the need for management intervention.",

However, few studies have quantified the impact of this weed economically and ecologically, and even fewer studies have quantified the benefits of its control. This paper focuses on water loss saving as the benefit derived from biological control of this plant between 1990 and 2013 at New Year's Dam, Alicedale, Eastern Cape, South Africa. Estimates of water loss due to evapotranspiration from water hyacinth vary significantly; therefore, the study used three different rates, high, medium and low. A conservative raw agriculture value of R 0.26 per m3 was used to calculate the benefits derived by the water saved. The present benefit and cost values were determined using 10% and 5% discount rates. The benefit/cost ratio at the low evapotranspiration rate was less than one, implying that biological control was not economically viable but, at the higher evapotranspiration rates, the return justified the costs of biological control. However, at the marginal value product of water, the inclusion of the costs of damage to infrastructure, or the adverse effects of water hyacinth on biodiversity, would justify the use of biological control, even at the low transpiration rate.",

In the tropics, aestivation is one of the adaptive strategies for survival and is used by snails in times of extremely high temperatures and desiccation. Aestivation therefore plays an important role in maintaining the transmission of schistosomiasis. This review assesses the possible impacts of climate change on the temporal and spatial distribution of schistosomiasis-transmitting snails with special emphasis on aestivation, and discusses the effect of schistosome infection on aestivation ability. The impacts of parasite development on snails, as well as physiological changes, are discussed with reference to schistosomiasis transmission. This review shows that schistosome-infected snails have lower survival rates during aestivation, and that those that survive manage to get rid of the infection. In general, snail aestivation ability is poor and survival chances diminish with time. Longer dry periods result in fewer, as well as uninfected, snails. However, the ability of the surviving snails to repopulate the habitats is high.",

A total of 5 933 fish weighing 95 322g (mean individual weight 16.0g) belonging to 51 species, 47 genera and 34 families were sampled. An abundance of juveniles was observed, confirming the importance of the lake as nursery grounds, rich in exploitable habitats like other tropical estuaries and lagoons. The fish fauna comprised three main components: i) an estuarine component (strict, freshwater and marine origins) which is the basis of the lagoon fauna community and which is stable in space and time; ii) a marine component containing fishes which appeared in the lagoon during the dry season where the salinity remains high (>20‰) and iii) a freshwater component with fishes coming into the lagoon from the river during the flood period. The magnitude of the spatial and seasonal fluctuations of the last two components varies depending on the area: marine (Zogbo), freshwater (Vêki) or intermediate (Ganvié). The global species richness and the relative abundances of fish vary between stations and from month to month. November, with 20 species on average, and January, with 6 species on average, are significantly different as regards species richness.",

These concentrations are lower than in the same fish species from elsewhere in Napoleon Gulf and are in the middle of the range of THg concentrations from across Lake Victoria. The rate of THg biomagnification, as indicated by the regression slope of log-THg vs stable nitrogen isotope values (0.28), is within the ranges of biomagnification rates observed in temperate and tropical lakes, suggesting that THg is biomagnifying at a similar rate in Thruston Bay as elsewhere. The low THg concentrations in fish were attributed to the storage capacity, high oxygen concentrations and high organic matter content of the wetlands surrounding Thruston Bay. However, caution is required because the storage capacity and the methylation rates present in the wetlands of Thruston Bay are unknown and the gradual accumulation of THg contamination from other sources (e.g. atmospheric THg) may result in unexpected THg increases in the biota of this system.",

Seasonal surveys were conducted at five sites above, and five below, the waterfall. Physical habitat was measured at each site. Four of the five indigenous fish species were absent at bass-invaded sites. Labeobarbus capensis (Smith), while still present below the waterfall, appeared to have suffered a near-total loss of post-spawning recruits. Analyses of physical habitat quality failed to explain the loss of indigenous fish below the waterfall, although sedimentation may have increased the vulnerability of the catfish Austroglanis gilli (Barnard) to M. dolomieu predation by obliterating benthic cover. Consequently, predation by M. dolomieu was presumed to be the critical mechanism explaining the loss of indigenous fishes in the lower Rondegat River.",

Low Secchi transparency (0.15–0.50 m) and high total suspended matter were recorded when phytoplankton was abundant. According to the trophic state index, Lake Burullus could be classified as hypereutrophic with bad to very bad environmental conditions. A degree of nitrogen (N) limitation was recorded, possibly favouring N-fixing cyanobacteria, amongst which toxic species can exist.

Active predatory insects (Coleoptera, Odonata, Hemiptera) and zooplankton (Cladocera, Copepoda, Rotifera species) were associated with long-lived pools. As pool duration increased, early phytoplankton communities dominated by short-residence green algae were replaced by blue-green algae. The number of species present increased as pool area increased. Using depth as a proxy for disturbance, species composition in rock pools was influenced by the duration of inundation. A unique rock pool community with a filter-feeding component dominated by Cladocera, and from which large branchiopods were absent, is described. Nutrient status and community diversity in rock pools are determined by pool size, and pool depth, a proxy for habitat duration, is a major structuring factor in these temporary aquatic habitats.",

Monitoring of salinity, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity has been undertaken since 1991 in the intensively utilised, modified, and managed temporarily open/closed Touw Estuary and its associated three interconnected estuarine lakes, Eilandvlei, Langvlei and Rondevlei, of the Wilderness Lakes System, South Africa, a national park and Ramsar site. Spatial variability of salinity, pH and turbidity was pronounced in the Touw Estuary but largely absent in the lakes. Significant differences in median salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity occurred between lakes, with reverse salinity and pH gradients frequently occurring. Seasonal variability in temperature and dissolved oxygen occurred in all waterbodies. Significant long-term declines in salinity have occurred in the more inland lakes, with decreases in turbidity and pH also occurring in some waterbodies. Water chemistry of the Wilderness Lakes is changing from that of an estuarine to a lacustrine system. Both biological and physical features were driving water quality changes, including reductions in river inflow, reduced marine connectivity, constriction of flow between waterbodies, and declines in submerged plant biomass. Management actions are proposed relating specifically to addressing the apparent causes for water quality changes.",

    "abstract": "Climate change may threaten the fisheries of Lake Victoria by increasing density differentials in the water column, thereby strengthening stratification and increasing the intensity and duration of deoxygenation in the deeper waters. Between 1927 and 2008 the lake's temperature increased by 0.99 °C at the surface and by 1.34 °C at depths >50 m, with the rate of warming increasing most rapidly between 2000 and 2008. In February 2000 there were marked thermal discontinuities in the water column at a number of deep stations, with marked oxyclines at depths ranging from 30–50 m, and with all stations being anoxic from 50 m downwards. In contrast, in February 2007 the lake's temperature had risen, especially at the bottom, and both the thermal discontinuities and oxyclines were much reduced, only one station recording a dissolved oxygen concentration of <2.0 mg l–1 at 50 m. This may reflect the fact that deeper waters were warming faster, and the reasons for this are discussed. These data suggest that the impacts of warming on the thermal regime of African lakes may be highly variable and unpredictable and, in this case, may have reduced its threat to the fisheries.",

The macrophyte cover decreased after the heavy El Niño rains of 1961, and the area of wetlands decreased by 48.5% between 1994 and 2008 mainly because of their conversion to agriculture. The main lake was infested with water hyacinth in the 1990s but subsequently this was brought under control. The native fishes were overexploited and non-native fishes, including a top piscivore, Nile perch Lates niloticus L., were introduced and boosted fish production, but they also were overexploited. Nile perch also preyed upon and decimated native species, which survived only in satellite lakes. Populations of some of these species recently have started to recover in the main lake. Efforts should be made to control habitat loss and water-level fluctuations, wetland loss, overexploitation of the fishes, conserve the surviving fish species and address the emerging challenge of climate change.",

The 96 h LC50, estimated by probit analysis in a semi-static bioassay experiment, was 0.861 mg l-1. Fish were exposed to two sublethal concentrations, one-fifth LC50 = c. 172 µg l-1 and one-tenth LC50 = c. 86 µg l-1, and blood was sampled at 5, 10 and 15 d post-exposure. Fish exposed to 172 µg l-1 Termifos showed significantly lower red blood cell count and haematocrit values, and both sublethal concentrations significantly lowered the white blood cell count. The haemoglobin level did not change significantly at either dosage. Mean corpuscular haemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration values were significantly elevated, compared to the control specimens. Glucose concentration showed an ascending trend and a positive correlation with Termifos concentration, whereas protein concentration declined and was negatively correlated with pesticide concentration. Following exposure to the pesticide, the fish showed remarkable behavioural abnormalities including erratic swimming movements, hyperactivity, faster opercular movement, surfacing to gulp air, secretion of copious mucus and loss of balance. Chlorpyrifos should be applied with caution in the environment, especially near water bodies, to avoid the possible ecotoxicological risks associated with its use.Keywords: blood indicesfishglucoseorganophosphorus pesticideproteinsublethal toxicity",

Chironomids (non-biting dipteran midges) are often used for biological water quality assessment because their larvae tend to respond rapidly and sensitively to changes in the aquatic environment. Larval chironomid assemblages from 37 sites in 20 Ethiopian rivers were analysed in 2010 to assess the relationship between species composition and water quality. Cluster analysis of local physical and chemical variables was used to classify sites into three different water quality classes: 15 sites were classified as not or slightly polluted, 16 as moderately polluted and six as heavily polluted. We recovered 21 chironomid taxa, representing three subfamilies, with Chironominae (13 taxa) making the largest contribution, followed by Tanypodinae and Orthocladinae (four taxa each). Polypedilum nubifer, P. wittei, Polypedilum type Wabe, Cryptochironomus sp. and Conchapelopia sp. were the dominant species in unpolluted or slightly polluted sites. Chironomus alluaudi and C. imicola were indicators of heavily polluted sites, typified by low (<2 mg l−1) concentrations of dissolved oxygen. Heavily polluted sites, such as the Modjo and Sebata rivers, also held a lower number of species and genera than less-impacted sites. Larval chironomid assemblages proved useful as indicators of river water quality in Ethiopia when taxa are identified at the species and/or genus level.",

The present study reviews historical and current information on alien freshwater crayfish species introduced into South Africa and aims to indicate which areas are at risk from invasion. As is the case elsewhere, South Africans have shown a keen interest in both farming and keeping freshwater crayfish as pets, which has resulted in Cherax cainii, Cherax destructor, Cherax quadricarinatus and Procambarus clarkii being introduced to the country. There is evidence of successful establishment in the wild for C. quadricarinatus and P. clarkii in different parts of the country. Species distribution models suggest that the eastern part of the country and parts of the Eastern and Western Cape are at higher risk of invasion. At present, illegal translocations represent the most likely pathway of crayfish spread in South Africa. A continued risk of invasion by freshwater crayfish species in South Africa is highlighted, which reinforces the need for more research, as well as for strong mitigation measures, such as stronger policing of existing regulations, management or eradication where feasible and public education.",

The mouth had been closed to the sea since 2002 as a result of artificial mouth closure and drought, which had resulted in non-tidal, dry and hypersaline aquatic conditions. Sediment characteristics, mangrove population structure, and snail and crab abundance, were measured at four sites of differing salinity and water level to determine if there was a relationship between environmental characteristics and biotic response. A site fringing the main channel had the lowest elevation and the highest density of mangrove seedlings and saplings at the water's edge, whereas a dry site at the highest elevation had the lowest density of mangroves with mostly tall adult trees and few saplings. At these two sites the salinity (>34.5) was significantly higher and the surface sediment water content (<30%) was significantly lower than at other sites. Highest tree density was found at a freshwater seepage site, where all size classes were represented, while the permanently flooded site between the Mfolozi River and St Lucia Estuary had the tallest trees but no seedlings or saplings. At the freshwater seepage and permanently flooded sites, porewater and sediment salinity (<10) were significantly lower, while sediment moisture (>55.5%) was significantly higher, than at the fringing and dry sites. Low sediment moisture was unfavourable for mangrove growth and recruitment. Long-term monitoring is needed to document the response of the mangroves to closed-mouth, non-tidal conditions.",

Five sites were monitored monthly from 2010 to 2012. Of the 269 diatom taxa belonging to 51 genera identified, the dominant taxa were mostly those considered to be pollution-tolerant: Amphora pediculus, Craticula buderi, Fragilaria biceps, Nitzschia frustulum, Nitzschia paleacea, Planothidium lanceolatum and Rhopalodia gibba. A number of diatom-based numerical indices were used to infer water quality, including the generic diatom index, the specific pollution sensitivity index, the biological diatom index, and percentage pollution-tolerant valves, which forms part of the UK trophic diatom index. All index scores showed the Great Fish River to be impacted, and showed significant correlations of diatom species abundance with pH, NO3-N, electrical conductivity, NH4-N and CaCO3. Analysis revealed EC and NO3-N as the main environmental drivers affecting diatom community composition, followed by pH and PO4-P. The percentage of diatom deformities at all sites was high, at 3.5%. Diatom indices showed the river to be impacted by decades of agricultural activity, which was confirmed by chemical water analysis. Thus diatom indices can be used for biomonitoring in semi-arid areas.Keywords: agricultural impactsaquatic ecosystembiomonitoringdeformed valvesepilithic diatomsfreshwaterKaroo",

    "abstract": "The aquatic plant water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) was first recorded in South Africa during the early part of the 20th century. The plant has since spread across the country and is found in water bodies in both sub-tropical and temperate areas. The biology, ecology and impacts of water hyacinth are well studied, but sound and cost-effective management of it remains an enormous challenge in South Africa. Since the 1970s, control programmes have focused on the use of herbicides, with some success, while biological and integrated control have historically received less effort and investment, despite the successes of the latter control approaches in other parts of Africa and elsewhere in the world. The reasons for the relative successes and challenges associated with the various control approaches vary substantially. Herbicidal control has been an effective short-term solution with highly visible results. However, the cases used in this study show that herbicidal control is approximately five times (R1 481/ha) less costeffective than either biological or integrated control, mainly because it requires resource-intensive follow-up procedures. The effectiveness of large-scale herbicidal control has mainly been influenced by inappropriate field application, plus management and institutional inconsistencies. Biological control offers a longer term, cheaper (R309/ha and potentially R3.60/ha) and less resource-intensive solution compared to herbicidal treatment, but the effectiveness of this approach relies heavily on the successful release of control agents, the ability of biocontrol agents to thrive under a range of climatic conditions and the extent to which affected water bodies are nutrient-enriched. Based on the analysis here, integrated control was the most cost-effective control option at an average cost of R277/ha. This approach enables managers to integrate selected aspects of herbicidal and biological control and it is also more likely to facilitate the development of partnerships in water hyacinth control programs. Discussion of a possible 'no control' option suggests that the economic and environmental costs of no control may be far greater than any control. Recommendations include: the selection of appropriate management option/s should be based on management needs across different time scales and on objective cost-benefit information—this will help to determine how the costs and benefits of different control approaches could be distributed amongst those who pay for and benefit from the management of water hyacinth. Successful management will also rely on selecting appropriate and sound ecological approaches suited to local conditions; management will also need to facilitate the integration of control efforts at the catchment level as well as institutional and partnership integration to ensure continuity in the ownership of water hyacinth control.",

These can be described as follows: (1) open water; (2) intertidal shoreline; (3) 'dry' shoreline and island (i.e. those habitats without any freshwater source other than rainfall); and (4) groundwater-dependent shoreline. The responses of these habitats to changes in water level, salinity and other determinants have been described. An understanding of these responses facilitates the management of the estuary mouth. Past records indicate that the mouth closed naturally at the start of a drought, but the management policy was to keep it open by dredging the berm which developed at the mouth. While the mouth was open, seawater replaced estuary water lost to evaporation and the system eventually became hypersaline. An assessment of the range of physical conditions that occur in St Lucia Estuary and the response in each habitat indicated that the open mouth hypersaline condition is the most detrimental, resulting in die-back of shoreline vegetation. This understanding supported the management decision that resulted in the mouth being kept closed since 2002. Since then, the estuary has been characterised by high salinity but low water levels, and therefore large-scale die-back of shoreline vegetation has not occurred.

    "abstract": "Although macroinvertebrates are potentially useful for assessing the condition of temporary wetlands, little is yet known about them. Macroinvertebrate assemblages were assessed in 138 temporary wetlands in the south-western Cape, recording 126 taxa. However, predicted richness estimates were all higher than the observed richness. Five new species were collected—three hydraenid beetles, one streptocephalid fairy shrimp and one hydryphantid acarine—indicating the current paucity of knowledge about temporary wetland macroinvertebrates. The occurrence of the invasive snail Aplexa marmorata (Physidae) in this region was recorded for the first time. Assemblages were dominated by a few widespread taxa. Only four out of 73 genera accounted for more than half the total relative abundance and only two of these occurred in more than half the wetlands. Vegetated biotopes supported a higher relative abundance than open-water biotopes, but no difference existed between wetlands with one, two or three biotopes, indicating the conservation potential of wetlands with homogeneous biotopes. Wetlands from the different wetland regions did not show a clear separation based on their assemblage composition.",

In the glasshouse study, plants were subjected to 2%, 10%, 20%, 40% and 80% sea water, with tidal simulation, for 10 months. Increase in salinity from 2% to 20% sea water increased biomass accumulation, CO2 exchange, quantum yield of Photosystem II (PSII), electron transport rate (ETR) through PSII, and intrinsic photochemical efficiency of PSII, while further increases in salinity to 80% resulted in significant decreases in these parameters. Concentrations of proline increased significantly with increase in salinity up to 80% sea water. In the field study, soil physicochemical conditions between streamside and inland sites were compared, and the constraints imposed by any differences on plant ecophysiological responses determined. At the inland site, soil water potential (ψ), electrical conductivity of the soil, total cations, and the concentrations of Na+, Ca2 +, Mg2 + and P, were significantly higher than those of the streamside site, while CO2 exchange, quantum yield of PSII, ETR through PSII, and intrinsic photochemical efficiency of PSII were significantly lower. The results suggest that S. maritima grows optimally at a salinity of about 20% sea water, and that higher salinity decreases growth and photosynthetic performance.",

Host pathogens and their distributions are listed. To date, fish health research has focused on the occurrence and taxonomy of parasites mainly in wild hosts. Very limited research output and knowledge exist on bacterial, viral and fungal disease agents and on fish culture systems, as well as on parasites' life cycles and/or vectors, epidemiology, pathogenicity, prevention and control. The current fish disease control and preventive strategies and diagnostic facilities are basic and non-specific. Although the five countries have legislation for the management of fisheries that clearly mention the restriction of movement of fish and fish products, they lack comprehensive policy and regulatory provisions to ensure an appreciable level of disease prevention and control. With the intensifying fish farming in the region, the research gaps in fish pathology, the potential impacts of the pathogens and the lack of appropriate management framework for fish diseases highlight the need to strengthen aquatic biosecurity.",

    "abstract": "The water quality index (WQI) has emerged as a central tool for analysing and reporting quality trends since 1965. It provides a better overview of water quality variability in a catchment than conventional monitoring programmes that use individual variables. Since water quality is not static, due to point and non-point pollution sources, water managers require tools that are easily adaptable to changing trends. For aquatic environments, different WQIs have been developed to classify specific areas and to determine the fitness of various water resources for specific uses such as drinking. The development of indices poses the challenge of standardising methods for selecting input variables, data transformation and aggregation. Inappropriate input variables may lead to a wrong evaluation of the overall water quality status, possibly resulting in the use of polluted water. This paper reviews methods and aspects to consider when developing ecosystem-specific WQIs – their strengths, limitations and the suitability of the methodologies. These could be applied when developing a water quality index for the uMngeni Basin, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, where ecosystem-specific modelling is being done to enhance basin management.",

    "abstract": "African floodplains are an excellent example of coupled human–natural systems because they exhibit strong interactions among multiple social, ecological, and hydrological systems. The intra-annual and interannual variations in seasonal flooding have direct and indirect impacts on ecosystems and human lives and livelihoods. Coupled human and natural system (CHANS) is a broad conceptual framework that is used to study systems in which human and natural components interact. While there are other conceptual frameworks to study social-ecological systems, the CHANS framework offers a clear way of studying the interactions, called couplings, between human and natural systems. Core features of the framework are the following: human and natural systems are analytically separated; focus is on processes within and couplings between systems; and the goal is to build an integrative, quantitative model of the coupled system. This paper explains the conceptual framework of coupled systems, using the case study of the Logone floodplain in Cameroon. We compare the CHANS framework with other frameworks that have been used to study the same floodplain, and argue for its usefulness in the study of African floodplains.",

Remote sensing techniques, based on the Landsat 8 sensor, offer promising alternatives to accurately detect, map and monitor the extent of the water hyacinth invasion in Rwandan waterbodies. The aim of the current study was to investigate the utility of multispectral remote sensed imagery using Random Forest and Support Vector Machine algorithms to detect and map water hyacinth in Rwandan waterbodies. Random Forest had a high overall accuracy of 85%, compared with Support Vector Machine (65%). These algorithms confirmed different levels of water hyacinth infestations in three main Rwandan rivers. Many of the wetlands along these riparian systems and most of the lakes, particularly those from the Eastern Province of the country were found to be invaded by water hyacinth. These findings would, therefore, assist government partners and policy makers to put in place sustainable methods, such as biological control, along with integrated pest management, to control the of water hyacinth invasion in Rwanda.",

A total of 20 benthic macroinvertebrate taxa were collected from nine sampling sites in four streams, representing the different levels of degradation. Human activities, such as laundry (GR1), livestock watering (MT1), and crop cultivation (KR2) minimally affect the receiving rivers and streams with a dissolved oxygen concentration of 5.01–7.86 mg l−1, which helps to support 9–13 benthic macroinvertebrate taxa. Wastes and effluents from tannery (AB3), textile (GR2), brewery (MT2) and liquor (AB2) factories, however, greatly impact the receiving streams and rivers resulting in high loads of total phosphorus (up to 35.14 mg l−1) and very low dissolved oxygen concentrations (up to 1.54 mg l−1), which supports only 5 to 8 benthic macroinvertebrate taxa. Streams and rivers flowing through Sebeta town are highly degraded, because of industries established in the vicinity and research should focus primarily on waste minimisation and treatment technologies to maintain healthy river ecology.",

The study also compared phytoplankton species composition, abundance and biomass between the fish-poultry integration and non-integrated system. After 180 days of the experiment, all male O. niloticus cultured under fish-poultry integration exhibited significantly higher growth rates than those in the non-integrated system (p < 0.05). Gross fish yield (GFY), net fish yield (NFY) and net annual yields (NAY) obtained from fish-poultry integration were significantly higher than those from non-integrated system (p < 0.05). Partial enterprise budget analysis revealed that fish-poultry integration was more profitable than the non-integrated system. Moreover, fish-poultry integrated system produced significantly higher phytoplankton abundance and biomass than those from the non-integrated system. Results demonstrate that rural smallholder farmers can achieve higher growth rate, farm net yields and income by integrating all male O. niloticus with other on-farm activities than practising a stand-alone fish culture system.",

    "abstract": "Prolonged mouth closure in estuaries is often associated with hypersalinity, mainly as a result of reduced freshwater inflow. However, on the KwaZulu-Natal coast, South Africa, temporarily open/closed estuaries have a tendency towards hyposalinity during closed mouth conditions, primarily because of their perched nature reducing saltwater intrusion, but also due to persistent freshwater inputs, together with seepage of saline water through the sand berm into the sea. We investigated a system, the uMdloti Estuary, experiencing extended periods of mouth closure over two years with the aim of documenting the response of invertebrates to such conditions. Specifically, estuarine invertebrate biodiversity was severely diminished, which was attributed to persistently low salinity, rather than poor water quality due to the absence of flushing. Secondly, a distinct brackish/freshwater community established itself within the mesozooplankton and benthic invertebrate assemblages, including invasive species. Marine overwash of the berm and a short mouth breaching aided the return of estuarine species for only very brief periods (weeks). We conclude that although estuarine species are quick to re-colonise the estuary after a breach, prolonged mouth closure along extended stretches of coast might severely reduce estuarine invertebrate biodiversity. Management options are preferably the provision of an adequate freshwater inflow to allow natural breaching, or else artificial breaching, to facilitate several openings per year as well as for a long enough tidal phase to permit the establishment of an estuarine salinity gradient.",

We present a systematic approach to identify, characterise and rank global pressures affecting estuaries. Six main pressure categories are reviewed: freshwater flow modification; pollution; exploitation of fish and invertebrates; land-use and development; manipulation of inlets; and biological invasions (plants and fish). Patterns in pressure effects are evaluated across biogeographic regions and estuary types. Activities contributing to these pressures are identified to prioritise management interventions and assessments of the trajectories of change and data availability are estimated, with associated confidence ratings on these. Approximately 15% of national estuarine area is under severe flow modification pressure. Land-use and development result in severe pressures on 40% of the area. Approximately 15% of inlets are artificially manipulated, which affects 60% of estuarine area. Pollution places 34% of the area under severe pressure and 78% of the area is severely impacted by overfishing. Invasive terrestrial vegetation has infested a third of South African estuaries, and aquatic invasive plant species occur in at least 8% of estuaries. Alien or extralimital (translocated) fish cause severe pressure in 35% of the estuaries. Management responses to mitigate these impacts are recommended for systems under severe pressure and future research directions are identified.",

    "abstract": "Invertebrates are often used as indicators of ecosystem health. In community ecology, the use of organism traits (e.g. behavioural, biological or ecological) can be of value in relation to impact diagnosis and assemblage prediction. It has also been recognised that certain traits are related to ecosystem function, and their use in biological monitoring provide insights into ecosystem functional responses to stressors. However, the paucity of trait information and non-availability of a local trait database for southern African invertebrates impede progress in using this approach for biological monitoring. To address this critical gap, we compiled an updateable trait database for southern African freshwater invertebrates. The database contains information on 40 trait categories and 204 trait attribute/modalities. Of the 40 trait categories included in the database, 12 are biological, 12 are behavioural, and 16 are ecological preferences. The database is designed to accommodate taxonomic flexibility. In this regard, trait information is entered at multiple taxonomic levels: family, genus, and species, allowing researchers working at different taxonomic resolutions to retrieve relevant information. While there are still gaps in the database, this effort represents the first attempt to synthesise available trait information on southern African freshwater invertebrates.",

Sampling was undertaken at reference sites using the rapid bioassessment method SASS4 (South African Scoring System, Version 4). This study examined the influence of sampling season on the occurrence of taxa, macroinvertebrate assemblages and SASS scores. In the Western Cape a few taxa were more common at certain times of the year, and multivariate analysis of macroinvertebrate assemblages showed that assemblages grouped by season. The number of taxa and the Average Score per Taxon (ASPT) were significantly different among seasons in the Western Cape, with fewer taxa recorded in winter compared to summer, and significantly higher ASPT values recorded in winter and spring than summer and autumn. Whereas more taxa were recorded in autumn than in spring, a higher proportion of sensitive and high-scoring taxa were recorded in spring. In Mpumalanga macroinvertebrate assemblages did not group by season, and differences in SASS scores were not significant, although more taxa were recorded in winter than in spring or autumn, and ASPTs were slightly higher in winter than in spring. Results are discussed in relation to ecological reference conditions and the interpretation of bioassessment data.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a rapid bio-assessment method for assessing the ecological condition of streams and rivers in Namibia. The method uses the composition and abundance of aquatic invertebrates, which are identified in the field, mostly to family level. The method is based on the South African Scoring System version 5 (SASS5), which has been modified to account for additional tropical invertebrate taxa that occur in northern Namibia. The method was applied to the Zambezi River near Katima Mulilo and NASS results were found to fluctuate predictably with changes in water level. Training of Namibian personnel to apply the method, as part of the National Water Quality Monitoring Programme, is recommended.",

A similar decline was evident from shore patrol data collected by Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife staff in the southern areas of the Greater St Lucia Wetland Park. As the distribution of fishing effort has decreased considerably since the promulgation of a beach vehicle ban in January 2002, this decline in the abundance of stumpnose has not been attributed to overfishing but rather to the closure of the mouth of the St Lucia estuary and lake system. The reason for this is because tropical stumpnose make extensive use of St Lucia as a nursery area and, since the mouth closure in June 2002, there has been no recruitment of juvenile fish into, or adult fish out of, the system. This emphasises the importance of estuarine nursery areas and highlights the need for ongoing catch and effort monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Wood harvesting is reducing the density of adult mangrove trees in the Mngazana Estuary. This is expected to decrease the amount of litter produced as well as the availability of organic carbon to the estuary and the nearshore environment. Pools of organic carbon were identified and measured in non-harvested areas of the forest so that the effect of future (mangrove) harvesting on organic carbon production could be determined. Litter production was higher in summer (2.4 ±0.2gm−2 d−1) than in winter (0.3 ± 0.1gm−2 d−1). Leaf litter on the forest floor was minimal, as a result of tidal flushing and consumption by crabs. Using previous studies it was hypothesised that the fate of litter produced was as follows: 43% is consumed by crabs, 10% decomposes on the forest floor and is taken into the sediment by bacteria, forming a sink of dissolved organic carbon, and the remaining 47% is exported out of the creeks and the estuary to the sea. Particulate organic carbon (POC) that is available for export was derived from crab faeces and the mechanical breakdown of leaves by crabs and tidal action. Significantly higher concentrations of POC were found during summer than winter and significantly more during a spring tide (5.3 ± 0.9mg l−1) than a neap tide (3 ± 0.4mg l−1). Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were mostly below detectable limits (<0.2mg l−1). The estuary is probably a sink for DOC, as very little to no DOC was exported out of the estuary. Organic matter comprised 12% (0.3g C) and 9% (0.46g C) of the sediment in the mangrove forests in Creeks 1 and 2, respectively, these concentrations being higher at Mngazana than at other estuaries in South Africa. If mangrove harvesting continues at the current rate of 1ha per year, and if there is no re-growth, no mangrove vegetation will be left after 118 years, and as a result no POC would be exported. But if harvesting increases to 3ha per year, the mangrove forest would disappear after just 40 years. Mngazana Estuary is an important source of mangrove litter and POC for the adjacent marine environment, possibly sustaining nearshore food webs.",

The presence of deformities in chironomid larvae was a sufficiently sensitive proxy measurement to indicate the presence of low concentrations of heavy metals. The higher incidences of mouthpart deformities observed in the larvae of Chironomus sp. II could make them potential bioindicator organisms for heavy metal pollution.",

LC50 values for three of the drugs were between 12 and 82 mg l−1, with algae and protozoans being most sensitive. Fluoxetine showed LC50 values between 40 and 830 µg l−1, algae again being most sensitive. The lower test concentrations of fluoxetine enhanced the growth rates of both B. calyciflorus and D. longispina. Even at low test concentrations, erythromycin decreased the growth rates of all the tested organisms. Paramecium caudatum was the species most sensitive to naproxen exposure. After 24 h, gemfibrozil had the least effect on all tested organisms. All the surviving tested organisms underwent oxidative stress to different degrees as a result of drug exposure. The activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase was reduced, and lipid peroxidation levels were elevated in all tested species after exposure, compared to their levels in the control group. Although the test concentrations were above those commonly found in the environment, the occurrence of sublethal effects at all test concentrations suggests that the potential risk for non-target organisms warrants further investigation.",

Macroinvertebrate abundance was higher in the shallow nearshore waters than in the deep offshore waters. The communities of the shallow, intermediate and deep environments were composed mainly of molluscs, worms and insects. Gastropods (52.68%) and bivalves (40.18%) constituted the major part of the benthic community. Bellamya unicolor, Melanoides tuberculata and Coelatura spp. were the most abundant molluscs. Various macroinvertebrates showed depth preferences, with gastropods having a strong preference for shallow waters and bivalves a weak preference for deep waters. The present findings contrast with those of most studies done before 1984, but agree with many done after that period. The presence of macrophytes and abundant detritus, a food resource for macroinvertebrates, account for their high abundance in shallow waters.

This unique biodiversity has made it widely recognised as one of the world's most significant freshwater ecosystems. Here we report the first occurrence records of two invasive tilapiines, Oreochromis niloticus and Oreochromis leucostictus, inside the Lake Malawi catchment. The introductions took place during initiatives to develop aquaculture and new capture fisheries. Oreochromis niloticus is an important competitor and predator of native species, has potential to hybridise with indigenous Oreochromis species, and has been widely implicated in biodiversity loss globally. It was a key contributor to the destruction of the Lake Victoria indigenous Oreochromis fishery. In light of apparent risks to unique biodiversity, and in the absence of robust evidence that introductions will bring enhanced socio-economic benefits over indigenous species, it is advisable that efforts be made to eradicate invasive species. The precautionary principle holds that future fisheries and aquaculture development in the region should be based exclusively on non-invasive indigenous species.",

A total of 133 984 gastropod specimens belonging to 15 species were recorded, 14 from Mbita and 12 from Ndere. Two species, Ferrissia kavirondica and Cleopatra cridlandi, which were recorded only from undisturbed habitats, could be indicators of least disturbed habitats. Water chemistry did differ between fish landing sites and undisturbed habitats at some sampling times, indicating that differences due to human impact do exist, but these are dependent on periods of calm weather. The study shows that anthropogenic disturbances cause ecological changes that can be exploited by some snail species, especially Biomphalaria choanomphala and Melanoides tuberculata, while other species may not tolerate these changes. In order to protect gastropod diversity and avoid dominance of intermediate hosts, such as B. choanomphala, a management plan for the use of these fish landing sites should be developed. This could include rules on how to dispose of fish remnants and other wastes so as to reduce local eutrophication, thereby reducing risks associated with transmission of potential snail-borne diseases. © 2013",

However, because several regions, including Zimbabwe in general and its south-eastern lowveld in particular, remain largely unstudied, interpretations of species distribution patterns are often based on limited data. A detailed study of large branchiopods was carried out, with repeated sampling of 36 seasonal pans, in 2004-2008 in the Save Valley Conservancy, south-eastern lowveld. Sixteen large branchiopod species were collected, comprising eight Anostraca, one Notostraca, two Laevicaudata, four Spinicaudata and one cyclestherid species, representing 33% of all species known in southern Africa. Most species were new records for Zimbabwe. The enigmatic morphotype, Streptocephalus cf. bidentatus, was encountered for the first time in Zimbabwe, presenting an opportunity to resolve its taxonomic status. Streptocephalus wirminghausi, a species endemic to Zimbabwe, was also recorded. Large endorheic pans had higher species richness (an average of eight species) than small endorheic pans (average of six species), whilst floodplain pans housed fewest species (average of four species), probably due to predation by fish after floods. Since regional diversity and coexistence levels in the Save Conservancy were high, compared to other regions, this area should be considered a hotspot of large branchiopod diversity.",

The low water level in Wolwedans Dam resulted in no annual environmental flow releases being made, causing mouth closure. The response of primary producers to this prolonged period of mouth closure was investigated in 2010/2011. Urban and agricultural development in the river catchment and along the estuary banks had increased the nutrient inputs into the estuary. Mouth closure, combined with elevated nutrient concentrations, increased the growth of both macroalgae and microalgae, but little change was observed in the submerged macrophytes. Macroalgal mats covered large areas of open-water surface, smothering the salt marsh and causing a decrease in its cover. These results have important implications for the management of temporarily open/closed estuaries, as increased development, freshwater abstraction and reduced river flow will result in prolonged periods of closure and reduced tidal exchange, which is likely to lead to eutrophication.Keywords: eutrophicationmacroalgaemacrophytesnutrientsphytoplanktonsalt marsh",

At Flag Boshielo Dam the recommended hazard quotient (HQ) of 1 was exceeded for lead and chromium in all L. rosae analysed, and 53% exceeded that for antimony. At Phalaborwa Barrage almost all L. rosae analysed exceeded the recommended HQ for lead, and <25% exceeded that for arsenic. Weekly consumption of 150 g of L. rosae muscle tissue from these impoundments may pose an unacceptable health risk to rural communities.",

PAHs were ubiquitous, at concentrations between 36–6 800 ng g−1 dry mass (dm). Congener ratio diagnosis suggests the PAHs were derived predominantly from pyrogenic sources. Four OCPs and/or their metabolites were detected at varying frequencies and concentrations. Of these, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (ddT) and metabolites were most frequently detected and were at a high concentration in sediment in some systems. Toxaphene was detected at a high concentration at some sites. The total PCB concentration varied widely, from below the method detection limit to 110 ng g−1 (dm). Based on the comparison of chemical concentrations to international sediment quality guidelines, PAH, OCP and PCB concentrations in most sediment samples posed a low risk to sediment-dwelling organisms. However, in some instances the risk was moderate or high. It is recommended that these compounds be monitored more frequently and comprehensively in aquatic ecosystems to better understand the ecological and human health implications.",

Data were used to develop and test a new Rapid Bioassessment Protocol (the Zambian Invertebrate Scoring System: ZISS) for assessment of water quality and river condition in both wadeable and non-wadeable rivers. ZISS, which is based on the South African Scoring System (SASS), includes a total of 85 taxa, of which 79 are shared with SASS. Assignment of sensitivity weightings to new ZISS taxa was based on sensitivity weightings of closely related SASS families; known life-history modes and anatomical adaptations; and correlation of occurrence to impact ratings. The ability of the ZISS to measure impacts was assessed by determining the relationships between ZISS metrics and impacts. ZISS data for the Kafue River demonstrated the efficacy of the ZISS for detecting moderate to high impacts on water quality and river condition. ZISS represents a major step in developing a user-friendly, widely applicable, macroinvertebrate-based biotic index, which can provide easily interpretable assessments of river condition for southern tropical African rivers.",

Therefore, this research aimed to quantify the occurrence of selected pharmaceuticals in wastewater from pharmaceutical industries, receiving waters and fish.

High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) Agilent 1100 series was used to quantify metronidazole and tetracycline HCl in wastewater, the receiving water and fish for Company A, whereas caffeine, diazepam and ibuprofen were assessed in the same sample matrices for Company B. Metronidazole, tetracycline HCl, caffeine, diazepam, and ibuprofen concentrations in wastewater were 8.04 ± 0.56 µg l−1, 5.77 ± 0.98 µg l−1, 7.53 ± 0.56 µg l−1, 25.89 ± 2.47 µg l−1, and 37.99 ± 0.83 µg l−1, respectively. The risk quotients of the concentrations of ibuprofen in the wastewater and the receiving water were >1 and therefore could be of environmental concern. The concentrations of the pharmaceuticals in fish from the receiving waters ranged from 1.29 to 95.27 ng g−1. This study has revealed the accumulation of pharmaceuticals in fish tissues in Nigeria and the risk assessment showed ibuprofen could pose environmental risks. There is a requirement for studies on the acute and chronic toxicity tests of these emerging contaminants on aquatic organisms native to Africa to determine their ecotoxicological implications on African waters.",

Surveys were done during a drought period between February 2015 and April 2016, as part of the River Health Programme, a national river monitoring assessment. The Fish Response Assessment Index (FRAI) was used to evaluate the condition of the sites, and redundancy analysis was used to evaluate the habitat, water quality and fish community relationships. The FRAI scores showed four sites to be in a 'Seriously Modified' condition. These areas were associated with intensive agricultural activities and urban environments. The presence of invasive fish species, abstraction and industrial use all had negative impacts on the ecological state of the rivers. When compounded by excessive water use, the drought resulted in poor fish community integrity, highlighting the vulnerability of fish communities in this region. The absence or low abundances of some indigenous fish alongside the high presence of invasive fish requires additional investigation. Results highlight the importance of mitigation measures against anthropogenic impacts should be enforced to ensure sustainable use of KZN water resources.",

Predation by Lates niloticus, species hybridisation, overfishing, pollution and eutrophication have negatively impacted endemic fish stocks in these lakes. Four tilapiine species, Oreochromis niloticus, Oreochromis leucostictus, Coptodon zillii and Coptodon rendalli, and three tilapiine species, O. niloticus, C. zillii and O. esculentus, were hence introduced into Lake Victoria and Lake Naivasha, respectively, to improve fish catches following collapse of native fish stocks. Establishment of these non-native species was associated with declines in populations of the native Oreochromis esculentus and Oreochromis variabilis, and O. niloticus now dominates commercial tilapiine fishery in Lake Victoria. The fishery catches in Lake Naivasha were dominated by the introduced O. leucostictus and O. niloticus, whereas C. zillii is rarely caught. The biological and population attributes of the tilapiines in both lakes have shown great variations over time. There is, therefore, a need for implementation of effective management measures, including control of fishing effort, pollution control and protection of surrounding wetlands, to promote recovery and long-term sustainability of the fishery resources of these lakes.",

Branchipodopsis species are particularly dominant in small short-lived and clear rock pools, to the vagaries of which they are extremely well adapted. Such rock pools were studied in the Drakensberg region, in the eastern Free State and in south-eastern Botswana. Common features of Branchipodopsis-inhabited rock pools are the transparency of the water and the very low conductivity values (generally below 50μScm−1, often less than 10μScm−1). These shallow (usually less than 50cm) water bodies with limited buffering capacity show major fluctuations in pH values (often between about pH 4 and 11), depending on the time of the day and the stage in the hydrocycle. Rock pools also closely follow ambient air temperatures with resulting fluctuations of values between 10 and 40°C. Depending on local climatic conditions, small rock pools are usually short-lived and have several wet/dry cycles during one rainy season. Branchipodopsis species are the record-holders in this race against time with maturation usually being reached within the first week after inundation. Broods of resting eggs are generally small (less than 80 eggs) but are produced almost daily. Often (in 30% of cases in south-eastern Botswana), erratic rainfall does not allow sufficient time for successful maturation and reproduction. As a safe-guarding mechanism in B. wolfi in south-eastern Botswana, only some of the eggs hatch on each occasion, depending on environmental conditions, thus extending the chances for successful recruitment. While short-range dispersal of floating eggs by overflows is common, long-range dispersal (e.g. by wind) seems to be rare and to be restricted to shallow pools with little vegetation. Limited effective dispersal may explain the high number of endemic species (e.g. four in the Drakensberg region) and the large morphological variation in some widespread species such as B. wolfi.",

    "abstract": "Reliable indicators of water quality and river health are often difficult and expensive to derive. This paper reports on a process to develop a low technology, scientifically reliable and robust technique to monitor water quality in rivers and streams. With these requirements in mind the authors set about developing a simplified method of biomonitoring based on the tried and tested SASS (South African Scoring System) technique. This involved reducing the taxonomic complexity of SASS to a few aquatic invertebrate 'groupings' which would act as surrogates for the complete suite of SASS taxa. To be efficient the technique had to satisfy the following requirements: 1. minimise the number of aquatic invertebrate groupings necessary to perform miniSASS; 2. aquatic invertebrate groups should be easily identifiable; 3. the method should be robust and produce results comparable to the full SASS technique; and 4. be geographically widely applicable. These requirements were met in this development and for a large set of data (>2 000 records) covering the Mpumalanga / Eastern Seaboard (Umgeni Water) and Western Cape regions there appear to be no statistically significant differences between SASS and miniSASS scores. However, once the data becomes split into various water quality classes (as defined in the Draft Procedures for the Water Quality Reserve, Department of Water Affairs and Forestry 2002) statistically significant differences between SASS and miniSASS become apparent. Nonetheless, these differences are relatively small and are usually less than 1 ASPT score different. Potentially, every school, environmental or community group in the country could become a monitoring cell, and with this geographical spread use the miniSASS tool as a 'red flag' for the identification of aquatic pollution sources and events in their immediate environment. The parallel and supporting initiative, to be able to enter this 'real aquatic biomonitoring data' onto an internet web-based mapping programme (see www.riverhealth.co.za), extends the application of the resource making networking and broad based catchment water quality monitoring a real possibility. miniSASS can therefore be used with some confidence, producing data which vary slightly from SASS, but which is sufficiently accurate to be of value to all stakeholders with an interest in river health. The increased opportunity for communities to become involved, use a scientifically valid tool and undertake real biomonitoring of their river systems is probably the most important aspect of the development of this resource. Through this involvement, live, real-time monitoring and investigation of pollution sources in their systems is possible, and the opportunity for improved environmental management a reality.",

Data were collected over two 24h periods, using mixed method sampling with WP2 nets and a pushnet to sample both channel and margin waters. Larval fishes collected included 20 species from 12 families. Density varied with tide and diel state during the study period, with significantly higher catches recorded on the spring tide. Density of larval fishes peaked after the onset of darkness, predominantly associated with the nocturnal ebb tide. Large numbers of preflexion gobiid larvae were recorded on this tide state, this behaviour serving to facilitate movement out of the estuary for gobies that undergo a marine phase in their development. Spatial variations in larval fish distribution were also noted. Preflexion larvae were caught mainly in mid-channel waters, whilst postflexion larvae were more often encountered in the slower-flowing marginal waters. Data for a hydrodynamic model of tidal exchange of fish larvae in the estuary mouth region were collected concurrently with sampling and were used to model exchange of larval fishes over the neap and spring tidal cycle by extrapolating actual densities, using modelled tidal volume.

    "abstract": "Abstract The Cape galaxias, Galaxias zebratus, is part of the paleao-endemic fauna characteristic of the south-western Cape, South Africa, and is the only galaxiid found in continental Africa. A 284-bp fragment of the cytochrome b region of the mtDNA was sequenced from 48 individual galaxiids, representing 10 populations from the Cape Peninsula. Five sequences, for four additional populations sampled at the extremes of the species range, were obtained from the literature. Analysis of cyt b mtDNA from these 14 populations of G. zebratus revealed five distinct and highly divergent lineages with low levels of intra-population mtDNA haplotype diversity. A new and distinct genetic lineage is described from the southern part of the Cape Peninsula. Estimates of genetic divergence between populations ranged from <1% to >17%. The observed level of sequence divergence represents the largest yet reported for any single fish species. The distribution of these lineages and their degree of sequence divergence refutes a model of isolation by distance. Results suggest that periods of low sea level may have been important in creating opportunities and alternative routes for dispersal and migration for Cape Peninsula populations.

    "abstract": "This study describes some physical oceanography features of an estuary maintained by fresh groundwater inflow. The mesoscale variability of currents, temperature and salinity are documented from moored current meter observations of 12 days duration at three stations. Current speeds exceeded 0.7m.s−1 during spring tides and decrease to 0.1m.s−1 during neap tides. Current directions followed the major channel axes, reversing by 180 degrees between the flood and the ebb tides. Harmonic analysis indicated that tidal currents were mainly semi-diurnal, with a predominance of the M2 harmonic, but included M4 and M6 sub-harmonics, possibly resulting from non-linear interactions of the flow with the shallow bottom and channel curvatures. Close to the lagoon entrance the water is of marine character but, further upstream, salinity decreased significantly. In the absence of river runoff, this decrease must result from some yet undisclosed underground freshwater inflow. The water renewal time estimated using the tidal prism method was at least two tidal cycles. Using the fresh-water fraction method, the groundwater inflow was estimated to be 2.3m3.s−1 at most. Coupled 2D hydrodynamic and advection-dispersion models (MIKE21) were then used to verify some renewal times. The tidally averaged renewal time for the whole lagoon was found to be 7 days, while the local renewal time at the upstream end of the lagoon was 25 days. Finally, an inverse modelling approach using MIKE21 was used to estimate the groundwater inflow required to produce the observed salinities. That inflow was found to be 0.25m3.s−1 for the period under consideration, showing that the tidal prism method gave flows that were far too high.",

Seahorses were found only in the Knysna, Swartvlei and Keurbooms estuaries. Sex ratios were even and, in most cases, more adults were found than juveniles. During the first year of study, seahorse densities were higher in the Swartvlei and Keurbooms estuaries than in the comparatively larger Knysna Estuary but, during the second year, seahorses were absent from the Keurbooms estuary, and the population size in the Swartvlei Estuary had decreased by more than 80%. These results suggest that, although the two smaller estuaries are able to support comparatively high densities of seahorses, population sizes may fluctuate considerably. Population size estimates for the Knysna Estuary were similar to those obtained in a previous study, suggesting that this estuary may represent a more stable environment and may thus be particularly important for the survival and conservation of this species.

    "abstract": "The effort to conserve fisheries resources and improve the welfare of small-scale fishing households is an important objective of poverty reduction strategies in Tanzania. The success of such strategies depends on both the diversity and the level of efficiency within small-scale fishing households. This paper examines the technical efficiency of Tanzanian small-scale fishing households, based on data from two coastal villages located near Bagamoyo and Zanzibar, using a stochastic frontier model with technical inefficiency. The estimated mean technical efficiency of small-scale fishing households was 52%, showing that they were operating far below optimum efficiency. The efficiency of individual fishing households was positively associated with fishing experience, size of farming land, distance to the fishing ground and potential market integration; it was negatively related to non-farm employment and bigger household sizes. Future policies aimed at conservation and development in fishing communities should provide mechanisms that improve the access of small-scale fishing households to less-destructive fishing tools (via the provision of credit facilities) and to markets, as well as the creation of new employment opportunities in other sectors. In addition, measures which check the use of illegal fishing gear, overcapitalisation and open-access problems should be considered.",

Results from this 2006 study suggest that the presence of alien predatory largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, may have influenced abundance and habitat selection of the native Galaxias zebratus at one location in a small CFR mountain stream. Numbers of adults, but not of juveniles, were significantly lower where M. salmoides was present, suggesting a size-specific influence on G. zebratus abundance. Because other studies have found the influence of a predator to be affected by prey size and the diel activity of predator and prey, we measured microhabitat use by adult and juvenile G. zebratus by day and by night. Galaxias zebratus selected deeper, faster-flowing microhabitats more strongly where M. salmoides was present than where it was absent. This suggests that G. zebratus adjusts its habitat use in the presence of M. salmoides, although differences in available habitat, or in interactions with other indigenous species, could be partly responsible for the observed differences. In-stream vegetation presence was strongly positively related to depth and strongly negatively related to velocity at positions where G. zebratus was observed, suggesting that the deeper, slower-flowing microhabitats occupied by G. zebratus were structurally more complex than the shallower, faster-flowing ones.",

Uni- and multivariate analyses revealed significant spatial differences between sites on the Mvoti River and those on the tributaries, as well as between sites on the Mvoti above and below the confluences of these tributaries. No significant trends in temporal distributions were recorded. Spatial differentiation was attributed to the abundance of insensitive taxa such as chironimids and oligochaetes at impacted sites. Increased salts and chemical oxygen demand, with lower dissolved oxygen concentrations, were identified as the driving water quality parameters affecting macroinvertebrate community structures.

Salinity fluctuated between fresh and mesohaline conditions with values ranging from 0.4 to 5.2, and conductivity ranged from 16.9 to 36.0 μS cm–1. The upper creek was relatively free of gross pollution, with high dissolved oxygen and low nutrient and salinity levels. At its lower end, BOD5 was relatively high and nutrient levels were high, indicating substantial organic input. The middle and upper creek were dominated by Naboandelus africanus, Appasus sp., Laccotrephes sp., Plea sp. (Hemiptera) and Georissus sp. (Coleoptera). Sensitive taxa such as Neoperla sp.

Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that dissolved oxygen, conductivity, total nitrogen, BOD and temperature structured the invertebrate assemblages. Overall, human activities and land-use practices around the creek resulted in varying degrees of habitat degradation and nutrient enrichment, reflected by the macroinvertebrate assemblages which can be used effectively to monitor the effect of such activities on Niger Delta creeks.",

The aim of this project was thus to provide baseline data for metal concentrations in the Nyl River floodplain system and to determine whether there were any point sources of pollution or if its metal levels were natural. Eighteen localities along the course of the Nyl River were selected as sampling sites. Water samples were collected quarterly, between August 2001 and July 2002, and analysed using ICP-MS to determine metal content. Zinc, copper, iron, selenium, cadmium, lead, aluminium, arsenic, chromium and manganese concentrations were determined. Although metal concentrations in the water were greater than target water quality range (TWQR) values for aquatic ecosystems, they remained relatively constant throughout the system and posed little or no potential threat to the system. The results suggest that the metal content originates from natural sources.",

In contrast to perennial rivers, temporary rivers have periods where surface flow ceases resulting in a highly variable flow regime. Existing bioassessment methods in South Africa are designed for use in perennial rivers, and thus the potential application of the rapid bioassessment protocol SASS (South African Scoring System) in temporary rivers forms the basis of this paper. Temporal variation in macroinvertebrate assemblages was studied at four sites on the ephemeral Seekoei River, South Africa. The upstream Sites 1 and 2 were significantly different from the downstream Sites 3 and 4 with respect to physical and chemical properties. When data were pooled, there were no significant differences in macroinvertebrate assemblages among biotopes, months, seasons or years. Assemblages grouped largely on the basis of hydrological phase. A comparison among macroinvertebrate sensitivity in perennial, ephemeral and seasonal rivers indicated that ephemeral rivers had a higher proportion of insensitive taxa. Variable and limited habitats, dominance by generalist taxa and variable flow/no-flow periods impeded the application of SASS and MIRAI (macroinvertebrate response assessment index) to temporary rivers. An alternative approach to bioassessment and interpreting data for temporary rivers is discussed.",

Most Kenyan catfish farmers use stocks with unknown genetic characteristics, with uncertified seeds and inter-basin exchange of brood stocks threatening the genetic distinctness of wild populations. Using 346 base pairs of D-loop sequence variation, genetic diversity and gene flow between C. gariepinus populations from Lake Victoria and its satellite, Lake Kanyaboli, were explored. A total of 17 haplotypes were identified in 52 individuals sampled, with the two populations sharing four haplotypes, and one haplotype being the most frequent (50%) in both populations. Catfish from Lake Victoria showed marginally higher genetic variation compared to those from Lake Kanyaboli, reflected in the higher number of haplotypes, singletons, polymorphic sites and haplotype and nucleotide diversities. Yet neither population showed signs of significant loss of diversity compared to other wild populations of the species. Clarias gariepinus from Lakes Victoria and Kanyaboli clustered into one clade, showing low population structuring and with a between-population FST value of 0.026, which was not indicative of significant (p ≥ 0.05) differentiation between the two lakes. Nevertheless, each population contained 60–64% of unique haplotypes. Inter-basin transfer of Clarias populations and human impact on Lake Kanyaboli should be controlled to conserve the unique Clarias genetic resources in the lake basin of Kenya.",

Fish presence and abundance were enumerated using multiple survey techniques, and their association with key habitat variables and the presence or absence of M. salmoides were assessed. A total of 14 native fish species were recorded, besides introduced M. salmoides, which occupied the majority of the mainstem and several tributaries downstream of barriers to upstream movement. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that only one native species, the Marico barb Barbus motebensis, had a negative spatial association with M. salmoides. Assessment of relative distributions showed this species to be excluded from M. salmoides-invaded river reaches, whereas the other native species were not visibly affected by the invader. This species-specificity of the impact of M. salmoides indicates that their impacts in South African streams may be dependent on predator-naiveté of prey.",

    "abstract": "The water quality of the Okhuaihe River, Edo State, Nigeria was investigated from February to June 2016 to determine its suitability for drinking and other domestic purposes. Water samples collected from three stations were tested for fifteen physico-chemical parameters using standard analytical procedures. Biochemical oxygen demand and sodium were significantly different across the three stations. Except for calcium and iron, all other parameters were within the permissible limits recommended by the Nigerian Standard for Drinking Water Quality (NSDWQ) and World Health Organization (WHO). Water Quality Index (WQI) values ranged from 9.17 to 10.40, indicating excellent water quality. Although the quality of the water from the Okhuaihe River is suitable for drinking and domestic usage, regular monitoring of human activities along the water front and control of effluents discharged into the river is recommended to sustain and improve water quality.",

    "abstract": "There is evidence that global warming is changing the thermal regimes of tropical lakes and this paper examines the impact of warming on the limnology of Lake Kariba. Between 1986 and 2011 the mean temperature of the lake rose by 0.7 °C, a rate equivalent to 0.03 °C y−1, but this increase was not uniform, being most pronounced in March and May (1.5 and 1.4 °C, respectively) and least in August and October (0.1 °C in both). These changes appear to have disrupted the thermal regime which now seems to be less predictable than before. Thermal gradients have weakened and, as a result, oxyclines are now less pronounced and persistent than in the past. Previous workers suggested that warming in Lake Kariba has strengthened stratification and has caused the thermocline to rise, reducing the volume of the epilimnion and thus reducing the productivity of the pelagic fishery. But this does not appear to be the case. Warming was not accompanied by more pronounced stratification or upward shift in the thermocline, but instead there was a downward transfer of heat that caused the thermocline to descend and weaken, thus reducing thermal stability. The dynamic nature of the thermocline highlights the need to exercise caution in making simple predictions and conclusions about biotic responses in a large complex ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "The construction of Pongolapoort Dam in 1973 on the Phongolo River in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, has considerably altered the hydrological behaviour and ecological response of the downstream floodplain. Changes in the flooding regime have had implications for the socio-economic importance of the floodplain and for the structure and functioning of its associated wetlands. Previous studies have recommended annual releases of water from the dam to sustain floodplain ecosystem goods and services. The current artificial water releases are limited by the size of the dam's sluices and by the demand for water from the local community. Therefore, water releases do not always follow the original natural flooding regime. To date, the influence of the changed hydrology on the ecology of the Phongolo floodplain system remains poorly known. As a basis for future integrated interdisciplinary research we synthesised the ecological and hydrological work conducted to date on the Phongolo floodplain. We suggest hydro-ecology as an important research direction needed to set environmental flows for the sustainable utilisation and management of the floodplain. Understanding the hydrological behaviour and ecological response of the Phongolo floodplain could help in the implementation of environmental flows by managers at the Department of Water and Sanitation and other stakeholders such as Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife.",

The harmful species monitored included the potential producers of amnesic shellfish poisoning (Pseudo-nitzschia spp.), paralytic shellfish poisoning (Alexandrium spp.), diarrheic shellfish poisoning (Dinophysis spp. and Prorocentrum spp.), ichthyotoxins (Cochlodinium polykrikoides, Akashiwo sanguinea and Karenia mikimotoi), yessotoxins (Gonyaulax spinifera) and the discolouration of water (Neoceratium lineatum and Protoperidinium sp.). These were numerically dominated by potentially toxic species of the diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia, which were present year-round at all stations. Prorocentrum spp., Dinophysis spp. and Neoceratium lineatum were the most abundant and recurrent harmful dinoflagellates, exhibiting their highest densities at the shellfish farming stations. Alexandrium spp. bloomed only on one occasion, reaching its highest densities at a shellfish farming station. Canonical correspondence analyses revealed significant relationships between the harmful phytoplankton species monitored and the environmental conditions. The widespread distribution of harmful phytoplankton in Bizerte Lagoon, with the permanent presence of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. and the high frequency of dinoflagellate blooms in the shellfish areas, suggests a potential risk of shellfish poisoning events in the region.",

The Okavango Delta, the fifth largest Ramsar site in the world, has experienced a series of large floods since 2007, following the much lower flooding of the 1990s and early 2000s. This study aimed to establish inundation frequency and duration maps of the Okavango Delta for 2001 to 2012 using MOD09Q1 and MOD11A1. An earlier methods paper testing MODIS for flood mapping in the delta showed 99.4% overall accuracy for inundation mapping of the delta, with a kappa coefficient of 80%. A method based on a time-varying threshold derived from bimodal single-band histograms was used to classify the images into inundated and non-inundated areas. The method relies on the difference in reflectance between waterbodies and dry or vegetated soil, with the former having low reflectance and the latter displaying higher reflectance values. The method takes into account seasonal changes in reflectance. Inundation maps showed a gradual decrease in the delta's maximum annual inundation extent from 2001 to 2003, followed by a gradual increase from 2004 to 2012, with maximum inundation extent during 2010–2012.",

We evaluated the functional organization of macroinvertebrates in response to changes in habitat type and seasonality in the Afromontane Moiben River in western Kenya. In-stream substrate characteristics were evaluated at the reach, channel unit/habitat and microhabitat scales at nine sites in different land-use areas. Water and habitat quality were assessed during the dry (January–March) and wet (April–June) seasons. A total of 81 macroinvertebrate samples were collected every month from three channel units (pools, riffles and runs) defined by different substrate types and classified into five functional feeding groups (FFGs): collector-filterers, collector-gatherers, predators, scrapers and shredders. Numerical abundance differed significantly between FFGs, with gatherers > filterers > predators > scrapers > shredders. Coarse substrate (bedrock, boulders and cobbles) in riffles had the highest richness and abundance of filterers and scrapers while sand, mud and detritus in pools recorded the lowest richness and abundance. Shredders and scrapers occurred predominantly in upstream sites with minimal human disturbance, while gatherers were most abundant at disturbed sites. The greatest variability in FFGs was at the smallest microhabitat scale, and not at the reach scale. This study shows that attention should be given to both reach-scale and in-stream disturbances when assessing the ecological condition of streams and rivers.Keywords: anthropogenic activitiesbenthic invertebratesmicrohabitats",

In addition, zooplankton biomass was determined monthly over the same period. During the course of the study, 13 overtopping and two breaching events were documented. Freshwater inflow into the estuary resulted in a decrease in salinity coupled with increases in total suspended solids (TSS), particulate organic matter (POM) and turbidity. Chlorophyll-a ranged between 0.29 and 8.01mg chl-a m−3 and microphytobenthic biomass between 3.87 and 209.09mg chl-a m−2. Generally, the highest chl-a concentrations were recorded during the wet season (spring to early summer). In contrast the microphytobenthic biomass attained highest levels during periods of little or no freshwater influx into the estuary. The influx of freshwater into the estuary resulted in a change in the size structure of the phytoplankton community from one dominated by nano- (2–20μm) and picophytoplankton (<2.0μm) to a community dominated by microphytoplankton (>20μm). Densities of microheterotrophs (<200μm) (range 1760 to 13750cells l-1) demonstrated an inverse relationship to total phytoplankton with maximum densities (>5000cells l-1) recorded during winter. Total zooplankton biomass ranged between 15.91mg Dwt m−3 and 106.93mg Dwt m−3 and demonstrated a similar pattern to chl-a with maximum biomass recorded during the wet season. These data indicate that riverine input into the temporarily open closed Kasouga estuary is important for estuarine structure and function.",

    "abstract": "Hydrological regimes play a major role in structuring the biotic diversity within river ecosystems and hydrological variation is recognised as a primary driving force within those ecosystems. The US Nature Conservancy developed a method known as the Indicators of Hydrological Alteration, IHA (Richter et al. 1996, 1997, 1998), for assessing the degree of hydrological alteration attributable to human induced changes within an ecosystem. The method is based on the statistical analyses of 33 hydrological parameters representing five streamflow characteristics that can be attributed to playing major roles in determining the nature of aquatic and riparian ecosystems (Richter et al. 1996, 1997, 1998). The Range of Variability Approach, RVA, is an application of the IHA, incorporating the concepts of hydrological variability and river ecosystem integrity, and was developed to enable river managers to define and adopt preliminary flow management targets before conclusive, long-term ecosystem research results are available. This paper presents an application of the RVA to simulated streamflows at two of the four Instream Flow Requirements (IFR) Sites on the Mkomazi River in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, in order to assess the extent of alteration caused by human induced changes to the hydrological regime. The assessment was achieved by comparing the range of variation of the hydrological regime simulated under natural catchment conditions (pre-impact) with the variation resulting from catchment development (post-impact). The 25th and 75th percentile values of each of the 33 parameters were selected as the lower and upper thresholds within which streamflow management targets could be set. By setting preliminary streamflow management thresholds that can be modified and refined when ecological data and information become available, the RVA incorporates flexibility and adaptability.",

    "abstract": "Most estuarine studies in South Africa have focused on larger estuaries, while numerous, smaller, temporarily open estuaries have received little research attention. This study examines the phytoplankton distribution in relation to physical and chemical variables through a quasi-seasonal cycle (from March to November 1997, including a flood event) in the Nyara, one of the smaller Eastern Cape estuaries. Vertical stratification of salinity was a persistent feature, indicating limited mixing of the water-column, except during flood events. Average chlorophyll-a concentrations for the estuary decreased from 1.3μg/l in March to 0.1μg/l in September, corresponding to the seasonal decline in rainfall and freshwater inflow. With the exception of the period during the November flood, the shallowness of the estuary as well as low chlorophyll-a concentrations always allowed an average of 30% of surface light to reach the sediment surface. Diatoms were most abundant in the water-column in March (mean = 105 cells/l), but numbers declined to below 104 cells/l in May and September. Picoplankton numbers increased over the study period, while nanociliates and dinoflagellates were fairly constant at 104 and 105 cells/l respectively. The most common group in terms of carbon, were the dinoflagellates. Freshwater, or possibly the input of nutrients associated with it, appears to be the most significant factor affecting phytoplankton biomass in the Nyara Estuary. When not receiving pulses of nutrients through freshwater inflow, the Nyara is best described as a predominantly low nutrient, low phytoplankton biomass, stratified system, dominated by the microbial food-web and possibly fed by detritus. This state can however, be altered rapidly by flood events that cause mouth opening.",

The two macrophytes were also grown experimentally under controlled nutrient conditions. There were no significant differences between the rhizome sizes of Miscanthidium in the different wetlands, but those of papyrus varied significantly. Papyrus showed no significant differences in root lengths and numbers under different nutrient conditions in the different wetlands studied. Miscanthidium on the other hand tended to have more and shorter roots in nutrient-rich wetlands as opposed to fewer and longer roots under low nutrient concentrations. Below-ground biomass values for floating papyrus swamps had an average of 1296g dry wt m−2 and rooted papyrus swamps, 776g dry wt m−2. The aerial biomass of papyrus showed a positive response to higher nutrient conditions. In wetlands receiving domestic wastewater, values ranged from 3973–6255g dry wt m−2: in wetlands without wastewater, the aerial biomass values were lower (1983–2862g dry wt m−2). Miscanthidium did not show any clear response to nutrients, having a more or less uniform aerial biomass of 2065 ± 98g dry wt m−2. Results from growth experiments showed that above- and below-ground biomass values were higher for papyrus than Miscanthidium. Whilst papyrus gave a clear positive growth response to increased nutrient conditions, Miscanthidium did not.

The objective of this study was to determine the extent of harvesting in the Mngazana mangrove forest, using available aerial photographs and ground surveys. At 19 sites where harvesting was evident the number of juveniles, adults and stumps were counted in three replicate 25m2 quadrats. GIS was used to generate maps, which indicated that approximately 80% of the mangrove forest showed signs of medium to high harvesting intensity, and that harvesting was taking place in easily accessible areas, especially where Rhizophora mucronata was the dominant species. The ESRI ArcMap density function was used to illustrate the number of harvested stumps and adults within a specific area. GIS analyses classified the mangrove area according to three harvesting intensity classes: low intensity with a ratio of adults to stumps of 2:1, medium intensity 1:1 and high intensity 1:2. According to the classes, 21% of the mangrove area was classified as harvested at low intensity, 35.5% was medium intensity and 43.5% was high intensity. The results indicate that areas dominated by Rhizophora mucronata showed a high intensity of harvesting, while areas where Avicennia marina was dominant showed a low intensity of harvesting. The information from this study can be used to make recommendations for the conservation and management of mangroves in the estuary. In a management plan, access to areas where harvesting is concentrated should be controlled so as to minimise impacts and to allow regeneration to take place.",

    "abstract": "Lake St. Lucia, South Africa's largest estuarine system, was isolated from the sea by a beach berm throughout a severe drought from 2002 to 2007, with the lake water level being extremely low over much of its total area. A reverse salinity gradient resulted, with the lowest salinity in the south near the sea and the highest in the northern lakes. Cholnoky (1968), the first to examine the diatoms of St Lucia and the streams flowing into it, identified 159 diatoms, of which 79 taxa were from the freshwater streams and 80 from the saline lakes. A further study between 1973 and 1975 by Johnson (1976) showed the presence of neritic diatoms as the dominant group in the phytoplankton. During the present survey carried out during 2004 and 2006 only a few taxa from the 1965 survey, and no taxa from the 1976 survey, were recorded. Raphid diatoms were found to survive for months in dry lake bed sediments, in salinity up to five times that of seawater. Species richness increased with depth into the dry sediment, leading to the hypothesis that, when the rains return, the diatom flora would regain species richness and diversity within weeks. Species composition was different at the same sites at different times, indicating that water circulation is responsible for distributing species around the lake, especially during shallow-water, hypersaline drought conditions. No centric diatom taxa were found in the water column, suggesting that there was no true phytoplankton community, only resuspended benthic taxa, in St Lucia at the time of the study.",

Catch per unit effort (kg fishing unit–1 night–1) showed two strong peaks in February and August–September, which followed peak catches of Stolothrissa tanganicae. Stolothrissa was the most abundant species in the pelagic catches, followed by the centropomid Lates stappersi and Limnothrissa miodon. Chlorophyll a concentrations correlated positively with high clupeid catches. Wind speed accounted for over 56.7%, of the variability in clupeid catches, while chlorophyll and phosphate, accounted for 44.0% and 55.4%, respectively. The results confirm seasonal fluctuations in pelagic fish catches and the dependence of the lake's hydrodynamics on the weather system prevailing in the lake region. However, fluctuations in nutrient concentrations in the photic zone were less apparent than in previous studies. Regression analysis indicated that environmental factors have a significant impact on the fluctuations of the pelagic fish catches. More multidisciplinary data are required to confirm the dependence of clupeid catches on environmental factors.",

We examined its chemical and biological properties in order to develop a plan to improve its ecosystem services. The pH ranged between 7.8 and 8.5, salinity was 17 ppt and conductivity was 28 mS cm−1, indicating brackish water. The pelagic zooplankton community comprised Rotifera (16%), Protozoa (Ciliophora and Rhizopoda) (18%) and Copepoda (16%). Cladocera were seldom recorded. Hexarthra, Brachionus and Rotaria were the dominant rotifer taxa. Several characteristics — including the community composition, the dominance of small ciliates and nauplii, the abundance of Cyanobacteria, and the absence of macrophytes — indicated that it is a severely eutrophic lake. To improve the water quality we recommend that: (1) domestic sewage inflow should be stopped so as to reduce nutrient loading into the basin; (2) the growth of rooted macrophytes should be encouraged so as to increase water transparency by reducing phytoplankton biomass through competition for nutrients; and (3) piscivorous fish should be introduced to control zooplanktivorous fish in the lake and thus promote the growth of large filter-feeding zooplankton.

    "abstract": "Two small dams on the Munwahuku River was investigated in relation to the influence of hydrology on their water chemistry over the period January 2000–August 2001. The water level of the upper dam fluctuated more than that of the lower dam and their theoretical water retention times were nine days and 3.6 days, respectively. Seasonal fluctuations in conductivity, TDS, TSS and transparency were due to effects of the first rains, while increases in BOD and COD suggested increased organic matter at low water levels. There were no dramatic seasonal variations in pH, alkalinity or nutrients, although total nitrogen was higher in the upper dam. The N:P ratios ranged from 0.57–3.75 in the upper dam and 0.92–14 in the lower dam and generally reflect the high levels of phosphorus in the dams. This could make them susceptible to colonisation by Cyanophyta. There were significant differences (p < 0.05) between the dams in total phosphorus, reactive phosphorus, nitrites and chlorophyll a. Small differences observed in the water quality of the two dams could be due to short water residence times. Extremes in water quality conditions were experienced during the dry season, when water levels were low, and during the rainy season when levels were higher. Peaks in phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance occurred during summer in both dams, and differences observed between the plankton community of the period January–October 2000 and that of November 2000–August 2001 were unexpected. The changes in the plankton communities, especially in the lower dam, were remarkable. There were no significant differences in plankton abundances between the dams. Phytoplankton dynamics were weakly associated with environmental factors in both dams and, apart from predation by fish and grazing by zooplankton, washouts during the rainy season and unstable stratification regimes were considered to be contributory factors. Canonical Correspondence Analysis showed that temperature and water transparency (also linked with suspended solids) were important variables in zooplankton dynamics in both dams. Hydrological factors, such as water retention time, floods and water levels, are key determinants of plankton communities in small dams.",

A total of 44 taxa were recorded, comprising 7 phyla, more than 20 orders and 35 families. The copepod Pseudodiaptomus hessei dominated the zooplankton (59% of the total catch by number) and occurred in similar densities to those observed in other South African estuaries. The copepod Acartia africana was the second most abundant species and, together with the amphipod Grandidierella lignorum, was restricted to the south coast estuaries. Zooplankters were more abundant in summer, although high numbers of P. hessei (>66 000 ind m3) were recorded in the Klein Estuary in winter when the estuary was closed. Pseudodiaptomus hessei, with a maximum density of 97 962 ind m3 , dominated in the mesohaline zone, and A. africana, with a maximum density of 49 994 ind nr3 , dominated in the poly ha line zone. These patterns were the result of the combined influence of freshwater inflow, mouth condition and the biogeography of the region on zooplankton density and diversity.

Xonxa Dam, a turbid irrigation dam situated in the White Kei catchment, rural Eastern Cape, is shown to provide fisheries potential for two alien species — smallmouth yellowfish Labeobarbus aeneus and sharptooth catfish Clarias gariepinus — that had been previously introduced into the catchment. Rapid appraisal of the biology, relative abundance, and population dynamics of the fish was effected during three sampling events in 2007. Using a combination of empirical yield and dynamic pool models, it was shown that two discrete fisheries can be developed. For L. aeneus a 60 mm stretched mesh gill net fishery could harvest 23 t y–1 and for C. gariepinus a longline fishery could yield 4 t y–1. The combined fisheries could be valued at c. R135 000 (USD 18 000) per annum. Periodic monitoring would be necessary; firstly, to ensure that spawner biomass per recruit is not reduced below 40% of current levels and, secondly, to refine the potential harvest available from the resource once harvesting is initiated.",

    "abstract": "The Mfolozi–Msunduzi estuarine system historically shared a common mouth with the St Lucia estuarine system. In 1952, a separate mouth was created, 1.5 km south of St Lucia mouth, to prevent silt carried by the Mfolozi River from entering Lake St Lucia. Despite its proximity to the comparatively well-studied St Lucia Estuary, there is very little information on the Mfolozi– Msunduzi estuarine system in general and no information on its benthos. In the present study, 17 taxa were recorded from biannual quantitative sampling in 2007 and 2008. Results indicated that the system was dominated by the polychaetes Ceratonereis sp., Dendronereis arborifera and Capitella capitata, the crab Paratylodiplax blephariskios and the tanaid Apseudes digitalis. The main factors influencing the distribution of the benthos were oxygen concentration, temperature, the open or closed state of the mouth, and salinity, with particle size and organic content of the substratum also being important in determining community structure. Although the dominant taxa were previously recorded as abundant in St Lucia, numbers present in the Mfolozi–Msunduzi system were generally lower than those recorded in St Lucia, suggesting that periodic flooding and the unstable nature of the sediments in the Mfolozi–Msunduzi prevented its benthos from attaining the densities recorded in the adjacent St Lucia Estuary. While the Mfolozi–Msunduzi system is classified as a river mouth, its benthos was more similar in composition to that of the Mhlathuze and Mlalazi estuaries, which are classified as an estuarine bay and a permanently open estuary, respectively. It is suggested that reclassification of the Mfolozi–Msunduzi system as a permanently open estuary would be more appropriate in terms of its benthos.",

The apparent effects of pollution type on the ratio between ectoparasites and endoparasites are discussed. Environmental stressors such as flood conditions resulted in immunological responses, reflected statistically as changes in white blood cell percentage (WBC%). It is suggested that endoparasite and WBC% data provide the best overall assessment of fish condition in the Olifants River system.

Fish were sampled biannually with seine-nets during March and August in 2007 and 2008 at five sites throughout the system. A total of 5 886 fish from 59 species were recorded, with a higher number of species and CPUE in the Mfolozi Estuary than in the Msunduzi Estuary. Seine-net catches were dominated by Ambassis gymcocephalus, Ambassis natalensis, Leiognathus equula and Valamugil cunnesius. Juveniles of marine spawning species were present throughout the study period, even when the mouth was closed. The sampled fish assemblage structure was influenced by significant temporal differences between the four biannual sampling seasons, with relatively small spatial differences between the sampling areas. Temperature, salinity and sediment characteristics were most responsible for the structure of the fish assemblage as sampled by seine-nets. The results emphasise the importance of the Mfolozi–Msunduzi estuarine system as an alternate nursery area. Keywords: assemblagefishMfolozirecruitmentturbidity",

A stratified random sample of 30 sites was surveyed for species composition and abundance in March–June 2007, using multiple quadrats along transects orthogonal to the floodplain long axis. A combination of indicator species analysis and ordination was used to derive a hierarchical classification system for floodplains, based on species assemblages. Indicator species analysis was used to identify ecologically meaningful levels of division, at four and nine classes. The four main classes of floodplain were: (1) Dry Floodplain Grassland (main indicators Urochloa mosambicensis, Ipomoea coptica, Chloris virgata and Pechuel-Loeschea leubnitziae); (2) Seasonally Flooded Grassland (Nicolasia costata, Eragrostis lappula, Cyperus sphaerospermus and Setaria sphacelata); (3) Seasonally Flooded Sedgeland (Eleocharis dulcis, Leersia hexandra, Oryza longistaminata and Cyperus articulatus); and (4) Seasonal Aquatic Communities (Sacciolepis typhura, Eleocharis variegata, Fuirena pubescens and Cycnium tubulosum).

Procamburus clarkii occurs in the Maramba River at Livingstone, close to a former fish farm, whereas Cherax quadricarinatus, deliberately introduced to a number of sites in the Zambezi and Kafue River catchments since 2001, is now widespread and highly invasive. High rates of dispersal, up to 111 km y−1 downstream, might be the result of passive transport on floating vegetation. Significantly more synodontid Synodontis sp. catfish were caught in Fladen traps in the Kafue River in crayfish-free areas compared with crayfish-infested areas, but the possibility that synodontids became trap averse in the presence of crayfish was not ruled out. No difference was found in the numbers of Single-spined River Crab Potamonautes unispinus caught in crayfish-free and infested areas. Alien temnocephalans, commonly found on crayfish, are now also present on crabs P. unispinus on the Kafue Flats. The artisanal gill net fishery has been harmed by the introduction of C. quadricarinatus and no significant commercial fishery has developed. However, without more information on the adverse impacts, and stronger fisheries regulation, there is a high risk C. quadricarinatus and P. clarkii will be introduced to uninfested catchments with irreversible consequences for artisanal fishermen and the environment.",

We present here the current status of toxicity testing in South Africa and propose a future prognosis for such tests. We propose a path forward for the development of ecotoxicology in South Africa and also globally. Toxicity testing issues dealt with are the use of surrogate species as opposed to indigenous species, their comparative tolerances, and the selection of relevant endpoints as measures of toxicity. Ecotoxicological considerations need to address the following key ecological realities: tolerance (both physiological acclimation and genetic adaptation), trophic redundancies, resilience, compensation (e.g. density dependence), evolution, and recovery. We believe that predictive ecotoxicology will play a major role in the future management of ecosystems that are constantly changing. We also believe that such management must be proactive to the point of intervention to create desired change, specifically the maintenance of ecosystem services.",

The occurrence of oestrogenic and androgenic endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in effluents and water bodies around the city of Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, and their effects on wild fish was investigated in 2013. Effluent and water were sampled from sewage treatment plants, an urban stream, and effluent-polluted dams, and were compared with a ‘pristine’ dam upstream of Bulawayo. Organic pollutants were extracted by solid-phase extraction and tested for EDCs using a yeast oestrogen/androgen screen. Oestrogenic and androgenic potencies were expressed as 17β-oestradiol equivalent (EEq) or dihydrotestosterone equivalent (TEq). Tilapia and catfish from the dams were analysed for gonado-somatic indices and testis histopathology. Effluents from STPs, which directly flow into Umguza Dam, had EEq of 33 ng l−1 and 55 ng l−1, respectively. Umguza Dam, Khami Dam and Matsheumhlope Stream had EEqs of 237 ng l–1, 9 ng l−1 and 2 ng l−1, respectively. Androgenic activity was detected in only one STP (TEq = 93 ng l−1). Tilapia sampled from effluent-polluted dams had high incidences of testis-ova, but catfish had no signs of reproductive dysfunction. These findings underscore the need for greater attention to EDCs in developing countries where there is scant literature regarding their occurrence and impacts.",

The lake was established as a National Park, together with Lakes Shalla and Chitu, to conserve water birds. It has high pH and electrical conductivity and is hypersaline. It presents an inhospitable limnochemical environment that limits biodiversity, although there are organisms adapted to these hostile conditions. The biodiversity of the lake is threatened by anthropogenic activities. Deforestation, expansion of agriculture, livestock, soda ash extraction and upstream irrigation led to a drop in water level and surface area, a change in physico-chemical and biological conditions, and a general deterioration in ecosystem condition. The phytoplankton community structure has switched from populations of Arthrospira fusiformis to non-Arthrospira fusiformis, zooplankton communities have moved towards small-bodied rotifers, such as Brachionus, Filinia and Lecane spp., the fishery has totally collapsed and birds, such as lesser flamingoes (Phoeniconaias minor Geoffroy) and great white pelicans (Pelecanus onocrotalus), have migrated to nearby lakes. These ecological changes over the past years point to the need for a new conservation and management plan to restore the ecosystem's health. A few recommendations are given for lake management as mechanisms to protect the ecosystem.",

Despite increased human activities and livestock, physical water quality parameters lay within the ranges set out in the water quality guidelines of South Africa, while most chemical substances were below detection limits. The microbiological water quality indicated that microbial concentration was highest in areas of increased human and livestock activity.

A total of 351 aquarium fish specimens, representing 185 traded taxa, were sequenced for the mitochondrial COI barcoding marker in 2011 and 2012. Lake Malawi cichlids were treated as a single group due to a lack of resolution in their COI marker, resulting in a data set of 137 successfully sequenced taxa.

The genetic identification matched the scientific name inferred from the trade name for 60 taxa (43.8%) using BOLD, and for 67 taxa (48.9%) using GenBank. A genetic ID could not be assigned in 47 (34.3%) cases using BOLD and in 37 cases (27%) using GenBank.

Metal contamination in dams around the city of Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, were monitored during October 2014 to assess ecological and public health risks. Heavy metals were measured in water, sediment and fish in dams located downstream of effluent discharge zones in Bulawayo and were compared to those in a pristine upstream dam. Water conductivity indicated pollution of downstream dams. Levels of lead (0.13–0.28 ppm) and cadmium (0.02–0.06 ppm) in water from downstream dams exceeded WHO safe limits for drinking water. Cadmium levels in polluted dams also exceeded the safe limit for agricultural use. Sediments of effluent-polluted dams had metal contamination factors ranging from 8.8 to 31.2 relative to the control, and fish from the dams had higher metal content and were unfit for human consumption. Metal levels were also measured along an urban stream to establish the sources of metals. The city's industrial zone had the highest levels of metals, suggesting that industrial effluents were major sources of contamination. The environmental consequences and human health risks of the pollution of peri-urban water bodies from urban effluents are discussed.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAquatic biota have been used for decades in water quality assessment since they reflect the changing physicochemical conditions of waterbodies. Among the aquatic organisms used in biological assessment are diatoms. Initially, morphological studies of diatoms were preferred in monitoring but today the new technique of diatom DNA meta-barcoding is gaining preference. This study aimed at (1) summarising the thematic study areas on diatom DNA meta-barcoding for water quality monitoring, (2) identification of past and future trends of research on diatom DNA meta-barcoding for water quality monitoring, and (3) determination of regional and institutional trends in studies involving diatom DNA meta-barcoding for water quality monitoring. We obtained data from the Web of Science (WoS) using research queries like \"Diatoms DNA meta-barcoding for water quality monitoring\", \"Diatoms DNA meta-barcoding for water quality biomonitoring\", and \"Diatoms DNA sequencing for water quality monitoring\". We identified 127 articles that had published on diatoms DNA meta-barcoding in water quality monitoring between the years 2003 and 2022. Our study revealed that the developed nations, led by France, followed by Germany and USA, dominated the research areas involving the use of diatoms DNA meta-barcoding in water quality monitoring. Additionally, our present study showed that DNA meta-barcoding was related to biodiversity assessment, rbcL, species identification and taxonomy, a finding which is in line with previous studies conducted recently that have revealed that DNA-based approaches, for example the use of rbcL genes, are more effective in the determination of diatom community structures compared to morphological methods. Although DNA meta-barcoding is rapidly gaining popularity in water biomonitoring, there are biases when explaining the differences between morphological and molecular based diatom indices, among them the incompleteness of the reference library such as R-syst::diatom database. To address this disparity, there is need to use environmental sequences from high-throughput sequencing (HTS) runs which can subsequently be related to morphological observations, followed by integration of the same into the reference libraries after setting up several guidelines and quality criteria. Consequently, the findings of this study present insights that will contribute globally to the development of water quality monitoring frameworks using diatoms.Keywords: aquatic biotabiodiversity assessmentbiomonitoringrbcL genestaxonomy",

Although it is shallow and oligotrophic, it is one of the most important lakes in Egypt as a source of good quality fish and a habitat for wildlife. Phytoplankton biomass is generally low but is highest in summer when dinoflagellates are most abundant and lowest in fall when diatoms dominate the plankton. Green and blue-green algae are relatively unimportant in the plankton. The light environment is always good, although transparency is lowest in summer when chlorophyll-a was highest, up to about 2μg/l. Nutrient limitation, as indicated by dissolved nutrient concentrations, shifted from N-limitation in spring and summer to P-limitation in summer and fall. Nutrient-cycles are probably driven by the winter influx of seawater from the Mediterranean and the growth cycle of the sea grass, Ruppia. This coastal lagoon is currently oligotrophic, but trophic status and the phytoplankton community composition should be monitored if the drainage basin becomes developed.

Trout stomach contents revealed that invertebrates dominate trout diet within the study area, whilst only six fish were recovered from 45 stomachs. The apparent low fish predation success of O. mykiss within the stream suggests a smaller impact compared to that of other alien piscivores such as bass (Micropterus spp.). Galaxias zebratus was the only fish species identified as prey, and its conservation status in the river requires further investigation. Snorkelling surveys revealed that rainbow trout co-exist with S. capensis and adult P. burgi within pools on this river. Galaxias zebratus was absent from the pools, while P. burgi juveniles were segregated from rainbow trout along a depth gradient, possibly indicating avoidance behaviour. Sandelia capensis juveniles may avoid predation by hiding under rocks. Rainbow trout probably compete with indigenous fish for food and space in the pools, though this could not be quantified. The impacts of O. mykiss on all indigenous fauna within the river are likely to be density-dependent.

    "abstract": "Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, a problem-causing cyanobacterium capable of releasing potent toxins, has become increasingly prevalent in South African freshwaters, especially in the lower reaches of the Orange River. This organism was first detected during the summer (January to March) of 2000 in the lower reaches of the Orange River. During this period, and again in 2003 and 2005, it formed severe summer blooms, occasionally reaching concentrations of 1 000 000 cells ml–1. Blooms of C. raciborskii lead to several problems including taste and odours, as well as making water treatment difficult (conventional treatment processes were unsuccessful). Fish kills were also reported during the time of the bloom. According to the World Health Organisation, cyanobacterial concentrations greater than or equal to 100 000 cells ml–1 may be detrimental to human health. It seems as if this organism is slowly spreading into other freshwater systems in the country. While it was restricted mainly to the lower Orange River system during 2000, it has since been found in low concentrations in a large number of rivers throughout South Africa. The spread of this organism should be monitored, because it may have devastating consequences for the precious and scarce water resources in the country. The primary aim of this paper is to act as a report on the presence of C. raciborskii in the lower Orange River and as a warning of its potential to form blooms in other South African freshwaters. A short overview of its distribution of this species in South Africa is provided, as well as a brief summary of environmental conditions during the 2005 bloom period. Management recommendations are also listed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Eutrophication, phytoplankton blooms and changes to the phytoplankton composition are some of the problems facing the managers of Hartbeespoort Dam and Roodeplaat Dam. Trends, both decreasing and increasing, are visible in the phosphorus concentrations, temperatures, dissolved oxygen concentrations and chlorophyll a concentrations in the water of the two impoundments. In order to investigate a decrease in phosphorus concentration (averaging 25μg l−1 per year) with an increase in chlorophyll a concentration (averaging 6.8μg l−1 per year) in Hartbeespoort Dam, the authors assessed trends in temperature and dissolved oxygen concentrations in this impoundment. From 1980–2000, surface water temperatures in both Hartbeespoort Dam and Roodeplaat Dam increased at an average rate of 0.14°C/year. These increases may be the result of a number of external factors, including climate. In Roodeplaat Dam the total phosphorus concentration first decreased by an average rate of 19μg l−1 per year from 1980– 1990, then increased by 27μg l−1 per year from 1990–2000. The average increase between 1980 and 2000 was 5μg l−1. These increases in total phosphorus concentration were accompanied by increases in chlorophyll a concentration in Roodeplaat Dam, averaging 0.8μg l−1 per year. The dissolved oxygen concentration displayed no measurable trends. Between 1997 and 2000, changes in dominant phytoplankton species occurred in both reservoirs. In Hartbeespoort Dam, Cyanophyta used to predominate in the summer period each year; however, since 1999, Ceratium hirundinella (Pyrrhophyta) have become more dominant for extensive periods. Similarly, in Roodeplaat Dam, Cyanophyta used to be the dominant group annually, but from 1997 to 2000, a Scenedesmus sp. (Chlorophyta) became increasingly important in the phytoplankton composition.

Environmental variables that best predicted group membership for each of four classifications (stones, vegetation, sand and these three biotopes combined) were identified. Variables at several scales, including catchment, site and habitat, contributed to observed spatial patterns in macroinvertebrate assemblages. Altitude and longitude were important for combined, stones, and vegetation classifications, reflecting the importance of longitudinal zonation and geographic location, respectively. The characteristics of the substratum, including type (bedrock rapid versus cobble riffle), depth, and quality (deposition of silt on stones), were important at habitat scale. Canopy cover was identified as an important predictor in the stones classification. Geological type, which affects overall water chemistry, was important in the stones and combined classification, and temperature was important in the combined classification. Whilst this study is based on correlative data only, it demonstrates that the structure of macroinvertebrate assemblages is a function of both large-scale variables measured at catchment scale and smaller-scale variables measured at site and habitat scale. The study highlights the importance of measuring environmental variables within bioassessment programmes, especially when classifying and assessing reference sites.",

Blood lactate levels were used as a biomarker for angling-induced metabolic stress in tigerfish caught by angling in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Blood was drawn and analysed for blood lactate from 66 anaesthetised fish. The landing time, handling time, body mass and total length were recorded prior to reviving and keeping the fish in aerated water for recovery before release. A strong positive relationship (r2 = 0.607) was found between landing time and body mass, as well as significant elevations in blood lactate concentrations following rod-and-line angling, regardless of angling time. These data suggest that longer angling time significantly increases physiological stress, which may have an impact on breading success and mortality in tigerfish.

The Kariega Estuary is considered a freshwater-deprived system, while the Great Fish Estuary is freshwater-dominated due to an interbasin transfer scheme. Results from a study undertaken in April 2005 indicate that in the Kariega Estuary carbon sources assimilated by the zooplankton are derived from riparian vegetation in the upper reaches and from salt marsh and submerged macrophytes in the lower reaches of the system. In contrast, within the freshwater-dominated Great Fish Estuary the zooplankton appear to be sustained largely by allochthonous phytoplankton derived from freshwater inflow due to the interbasin transfer scheme. The magnitude of outflow of fresh water appears to play an important role as a carbon source for copepods and filter feeders in the marine environment adjacent to the Great Fish Estuary. The export of estuarine-derived particulate organic matter (POM) was evident up to 12 km downstream (west) of the Great Fish Estuary. Conversely, estuarine-derived POM appears to be utilised only directly adjacent to the Kariega Estuary mouth.",

Spatial and temporal patterns in zooplankton distribution in the lower, middle and upper reaches of the estuary before, during and after breaching were compared over three months from 27 January to 26 April 2004. Thirty-five taxa were identified, with the dominant copepod Pseudodiaptomus hessei accounting for 42% and 58% of the total abundance and biomass, respectively. Breaching resulted in a 98% loss of zooplankton biomass. While a temporary recovery was recorded during open-mouth conditions, it was not sustained due to continual sediment scouring and flushing. Pre-breaching zooplankton abundance and biomass levels were only attained nine days after mouth closure, with peaks being recorded after 19, 28 and 35 days in the lower, upper and middle reaches, respectively. Recovery was, therefore, faster in the lower reaches. Mouth state was primarily responsible for regulating zooplankton stock. However, the zooplankton in the various reaches did not recover in synchrony after mouth closure, because abiotic factors and food availability were different in the three estuarine reaches.",

Silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, ranked as one of the world's 100 worst invasive species, were introduced into South Africa in 1975, but the potential spread of this invader has not yet been addressed, despite recent studies indicating its potential ecological impacts in South Africa. The potential range of silver carp in South Africa was identified based on ecological niche modelling (ENM) using the maximum entropy method. Models were constructed using occurrence records and a defined background, and calibrated using a k-fold method. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was used to evaluate model performance. Both the native and introduced range model accurately predicted species occurrences (AUC 0.98 and 0.94, respectively). Most of the north-eastern part of South Africa, including the Limpopo River Basin, where the presence of silver carp has been recorded, was correctly predicted as climatically suitable for silver carp. Other areas with suitable climatic conditions for silver carp but with no known introductions were also identified. The model demonstrated the potential use of ENM to predict the potential range of silver carp in South Africa.Keywords: Asian carpcorrelative approachCyprinidaeecological niche modellingexoticmaximum entropy",

Fish health was assessed using a modified health assessment index (HAI) protocol, with the inclusion of the inverted parasite index (IPI) and condition factor (K). These biomonitoring tools provide relatively simple and rapid indications of how well fish are coping in their environment. To verify the biomonitoring results, water quality analyses were included in the study. The nutrients and mining-related pollutants in the three dams differed to a great extent and showed an increasing trend in the order: Luphephe–Nwanedi Dams < Flag Boshielo Dam < Return Water Dam. The HAI score varied across the three sampling sites, with individual mean values of 93.3, 84 and 42.7 at the Return Water Dam, Flag Boshielo Dam and Luphephe–Nwanedi Dams, respectively. The top six metrics that correlated best with fish health scores were the levels of ectoparasites, haematocrit values and the condition of the gills, liver, skin and fins. Although the HAI successfully differentiated among the three localities, which differed in water quality, it was non-specific in response to contaminants. Notably, the premise set forth by the IPI that endoparasites increase with a decrease in water quality was not supported.

    "abstract": "With the continued establishment of man-made lakes within the natural distribution range of tigerfish in southern Africa, many artificial tigerfish populations now exist in the region. Very little of the behavioural ecology of these artificial but ecologically important populations is known. Letsibogo and Schroda man-made lakes are two such systems in the Limpopo River catchment. Currently, an established population of tigerfish occurs in Schroda, which is proposed to be used to establish another population in Letsibogo. This study evaluates the suitability of Letsibogo for tigerfish and the behavioural ecology implications associated with an artificial population in the lake. The behaviour of a small population of tigerfish relocated from Schroda to Letsibogo was monitored and compared with the behaviour of the established Schroda population. In Letsibogo the tigerfish established behavioural patterns suggesting that it is suitable to maintain a tigerfish population. To conserve the locally threatened tigerfish in the Limpopo catchment, the establishment of populations in man-made lakes such as Letsibogo is recommended. The effect of tigerfish on indigenous fishes in Letsibogo is unknown and should be considered.",

To understand perceptions of changes in ecosystem services that resulted from observed land-use changes discussions were held with local key informants and focus group participants. Accuracy assessment was done on the 2013 classified image. In 1973, the land-use classes of the wetland comprised wetland and grazing land, with area coverages of 764.5 and 268.4 ha, respectively. The land-use classes in 1986 were wetland, grazing land and cultivated land, with area coverages of 585.7, 198.3 and 248.9 ha, respectively. The land use of the study area in 2002 was similar to that of 1986. In 2013–2014, however, there was a substantial increase in cultivation and grazing lands at the expense of the wetland, as compared to 2002. Respondents confirmed that free grazing, the harvesting of vegetation, deforestation and expansion of cultivated land were the major threats. This study indicated that land-use change is the main driver of wetland degradation and loss. It is recommended that government organisations should give due emphasis to overcome the anthropogenic effects and to develop a management plan for the sustainable utilisation of the wetland's ecosystem services.",

To enhance the largemouth bass fisheries, Florida bass Micropterus floridanus were introduced into KwaZulu Natal, South Africa, in 1980. Knowledge on the status of M. floridanus in South Africa is required, because it lives longer and reaches larger sizes than M. salmoides, which may result in heightened impacts on native biota. Because M. floridanus are morphologically similar, but genetically distinct from M. salmoides, the distribution of this species was assessed by genetically screening 185 Micropterus sp. individuals sampled from 20 localities across South Africa using the mitochondrial ND2 gene. Individuals with mitochondrial DNA matching M. salmoides were recovered from 16 localities, whereas M. floridanus mitochondrial DNA was recovered from 13 localities. At nine localities (45%), the mitochondrial DNA of both species was detected. These results demonstrate M. floridanus dispersal to multiple sites across South Africa.",

The purpose of this study was to assess anaesthetic and sedative effectiveness of menthol and its safety in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Juvenile rainbow trout 180 ± 28 g (mean ± SD) within a range of 152–208 g fish−1 were individually exposed to menthol concentrations between 10 and 150 mg l−1 and observed for behavioural responses, induction time to anaesthesia and recovery time. Menthol concentrations of 40–150 mg l−1 induced anaesthesia with varying exposure times. There was an exponential relationship (p < 0.001) between induction time and menthol concentration. Menthol concentrations of 80–150 mg l−1 induced anaesthesia within three minutes of exposure and fish recovered within three minutes. Induction and recovery data showed that 80 mg l−1 was most suitable for anaesthesia in juveniles of this species. Concentrations of 10–20 mg l−1 had sedative effects. Menthol stock solutions prepared using ethanol and acetone and storage time of stock solutions at room temperature for up to 48 h showed no significant differences in anaesthetic efficiency. When exposure time to menthol was kept constant at three minutes, 22% of fish had temporary cessation of gill ventilation. These fish had longer recovery times than those that did not show that response. Menthol was an effective anaesthetic and could be tested as a sedative for trout.",

Different stressors originating from industries and agricultural activities were assessed to see their effect on Chironomidae taxa. Chironomidae larvae were collected using a square frame handnet with frame dimensions of 25 × 25 cm and a mesh size of 500 μm. Six chironomid taxa were identified from nine sampling sites in four streams. Based on physico-chemical parameters, the sampling sites were clustered into four categories (minimally polluted, moderately polluted, highly polluted and extremely polluted). Chironomus alluaudi and Chironomus imicola were the dominant species in the highly polluted sites and were considered indicators of highly polluted streams and rivers. Abundances of Polypedilum wittei, Polypedilum bipustulatem and Dicrotendipus septemmaculatus, however, were relatively higher in moderately impacted sites and therefore described as indicators of moderately polluted sites. The genus Conchapelopia was mostly found in less impacted sampling sites and can be considered as an indicator of excellent water quality. Extremely polluted sites support low numbers of chironomid taxa in general and, as such, larval Chironomidae assemblages are important tools in assessing human impact on rivers when identified to genes/species level.",

The water quality and macroinvertebrate assemblages were assessed at 40 sampling sites. The chemical and ecological water quality was evaluated using the Basic Prati index and the Ethiopian Biological Score Index (ETHbios), respectively. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was used to evaluate the relationship between abiotic factors and macroinvertebrate metrics. A total of 5 876 invertebrates belonging to twentyfive families were recorded. The Coleoptera was the most dominant order represented by four families with a relative abundance of 68%. According to the ETHbios scoring system the sites receiving industrial effluent had very poor water quality (ETHbios score <12), whereas the upstream sites had moderate to good water quality (ETHbios 53 to 76). Likewise, the Basic Prati Index of the sites receiving industrial effluent was considered as very heavily polluted (Index score >8). Overall, the industrial effluents had a significant negative impact on water quality and macroinvertebrate diversity. Therefore, proper management of industrial effluent is urgently needed to prevent further deterioration of water quality and loss of biodiversity in the Lake Hawassa and Shallo Wetland ecosystems.",

The city's wastewater treatment plant discharges partially treated and untreated sewage directly into Kamfers Dam, creating elevated water levels, poor water quality and hypereutrophication. Subsequently, a crash in the A. fusiformis population compromised the lesser flamingos' food source. The water quality and algal community of Kamfers Dam were monitored using historical water quality data plus water quality analyses from 2009 to 2011. Conductivity, pH, sodium, chloride and total dissolved salts showed significant decreases over time. Spearman rank correlation was used to measure relationships among physico-chemical parameters and densities of algae. Arthrospira fusiformis was positively correlated with conductivity (Spearman ρ = 0.561, p = 0.029), total dissolved salts (Spearman ρ = 0.572, p = 0.026) and negatively correlated with total phosphorus (Spearman ρ = −0.718, p = 0.003). While significant correlations were found, attempts to develop a model for predicting algal community composition were unsuccessful due to strong multicollinearity among the water chemistry parameters.",

Small bass were more dependent on estuary-associated fish species as prey than were larger bass, with the latter relying more on freshwater crabs and aquatic insects as primary food sources. This was reflected in the stomach contents analyses of the three different size classes of bass, as well as in the δ13C and δ15N isotope results. The study highlights the need for careful consideration prior to the introduction of predatory alien fish into South African waterbodies in future.

Allopatric samples of M. lacerda Castelnau 1861 from the Upper Zambezi/Kwando system and Cunene River, Namibia, showed some differentiation regarded as infrasubspecific, similar to that of the M. rume samples from the Bandama River compared to those of the Comoé River, both in Côte d'Ivoire.

Five stations in a communal area upstream of Umfurudzi National Park, four on the edge of the park and six in the park were sampled monthly from April to July 2013 for physico-chemical variables and aquatic macroinvertebrates. Phosphates and siltation levels were significantly higher at stations in the communal area, compared to those in the park. Vegetation cover and conductivity were significantly higher at stations in the park compared to those in the communal area. Recovery of macroinvertebrate communities along a disturbance gradient from the highly disturbed, silted, low percentage vegetation cover communal area stations through the semi-disturbed park edge area to the less disturbed, less silted, high percentage vegetation cover stations in the park was demonstrated. Consequently, the management of tropical catchments should include practices that minimise loss of riparian vegetation and that guard against siltation of aquatic systems. The study also demonstrates the capacity of macroinvertebrates to act as indicators of these disturbances.Keywords: land usemacroinvertebratesriparian vegetationsiltationwater quality",

Seasonal and hydroclimatic changes, as well as anthropogenic activities were the overriding factors affecting environmental variables investigated. Analysis of macroinvertebrate community structure with several indices revealed a community structure changing across seasons and differing between the sites. Mollusca, Crustacea and Polychaeta were most abundant in the dry seasons, especially at sites close to the ocean, whereas Oligochaeta and Insecta (Diptera, Heteroptera, Coleoptera, Odonata and Ephemeroptera) were abundant in the wet seasons, especially during flood periods (short wet season) at the sites receiving fresh water and on roots of macrophytes. A redundancy analysis placed habitat suitability (temperature and macrophytes) and trophic status variables (NO2−, NO3−, conductivity and pH) as structuring drivers for macroinvertebrate assemblages. The current study demonstrates that spatial heterogeneity of macroinvertebrates of Lake Nokoue is related to the dynamics created by input of fresh water (wet seasons) or salt water (dry seasons), as well as spatial heterogeneity of anthropogenic activities (nutrients). It offers insights into the macroinvertebrate dynamics linked to the limnology of a West African lagoon, which could contribute to a better understanding of management and conservation measures.",

    "abstract": "The possible impacts of extreme events on the ecology of selected aquatic biota within the Mbhashe Estuary were investigated during a four year (2010–2013) spring sampling programme. During periods of low to average flow conditions the estuary is shallow, turbid and characterised by the presence of fluid mud and the build-up of mud and clay deposits. During these conditions, extremely high biomasses of intertidal microalgae and zooplankton are present. Fish and macroinvertebrate abundance and diversity are also highest during low-flow conditions. Flood events can reset, or partially disrupt, the sediment erosion/depositional cycle and decrease the biomass and diversity of plankton, fish and macroinvertebrate species. The Mbhashe Estuary's unique fluid mud habitat is therefore subjected to regular resetting, which potentially contributes to the fluid nature of the muds. A storm surge in 2011 resulted in the temporary dieback of an area of mangroves, as a result of the deposition of marine sediment. Although extreme events seem to play an important role in the deposition and erosion cycle of the estuary, an increased frequency of both types of extreme events may ultimately result in estuarine habitat loss, which will adversely affect the biota of the estuary.",

Pesticides, plastics, wastewaters and pharmaceuticals are sources of xenoestrogens, and are carried through surface runoffs to water bodies at concentration levels that are harmful to aquatic organisms. Fish absorb xenoestrogens through ingestion of contaminated food items, respiratory gills and dermal contact. Xenoestrogens bioaccumulate in fish tissues, eliciting various reproductive abnormalities, e.g. males may abnormally produce vitellogenins and present with reduced sperm counts, whereas females experience reduced fecundity and hatchability of eggs. Through the food web, xenoestrogens biomagnify in fish predators, e.g. seals and humans, which in turn risk suffering from reproductive malfunctions. Studies of adverse impact of xenoestrogens on fish have mainly been limited to developed countries, yet fish are a major food and trade commodity for developing sub-Saharan African countries. This review serves as a basis for research on adverse impacts of xenoestrogens on fish reproduction, and other consumers of aquatic organisms in Lake Victoria. The lake receives high levels of pollutants from untreated or poorly-treated domestic and industrial wastes and agro-chemicals. Control of xenoestrogens requires concerted effort from multistakeholders to undertake activities such as surveillance, advocacy, legislation and biodegradation to minimise their adverse impacts.",

    "abstract": "Fish parasitological surveys, conducted during different times of the year in the Okavango and Upper Zambezi River systems from 1997 to 2013, revealed the presence of five branchiuran species. Dolops ranarum from the Okavango system was found on the skin and in the branchial chambers of 12 fish species. Adults and various larval stages of Chonopeltis lisikili were collected from five Synodontis species. In some cases, both larval stages and adults were found on the same fish. This implies that host-change does not occur in C. lisikili, as was reported for other Chonopeltis species. Chonopeltis liversedgei was found in the branchial chamber of the western bottlenose Mormyrus lacerda. A solitary specimen of Argulus ambloplites was found on the skin of the sharptooth catfish Clarias gariepinus. In the Zambezi system, A. cunningtoni was collected from C. gariepinus and Serranochromis robustus. This paper includes data collected over a long period on the branchiurans from two river systems, and is compared to data from other published information from the Zambezi and Limpopo systems, the latter being the most southern distribution range of D. ranarum. Information is provided on new hosts and distribution records of these branchiurans found in their natural, almost undisturbed habitats, contributing to our understanding of the biodiversity of African branchiurans.",

No historical data on the benthic macrofauna are available for the past 20 years, creating a significant gap in our understanding of the ecology and benthic assemblage of this system. The primary aim of this study was to provide updated information on the ecology of the macrobenthic community. Benthic samples were collected quarterly using a Zabalocki grab during the period 2016–2017. The 87 taxa recorded were largely dominated by the tanaid Halmyrapseudes cooperi, followed by the brachyuran crab, Paratylodiplax blephariskios and the amphipod Grandierella bonnieroides. A multivariate data analysis was performed and PERMANOVA results indicated significant differences (p < 0.05) between sites in number of taxa, species diversity and density. A stable system with limited seasonal influences and the effect of May 2017 flood were highlighted in the study. The 100 benthic taxa recorded in previous studies, of which 46 species are still present, suggests a marked decline in macrobenthic diversity and a change in community, possibly linked to reduced freshwater inflow and agricultural effluent. The continuing ecological relevance of this protected area relies on reducing catchment activities that are detrimental in sustaining benthic populations.",

(2) What are the health risks from consuming freshwater fishes? (3) Who currently uses inland fisheries and what are their harvests? (4) What can we learn from historical constraints to inland fisheries development? (5) How will governance of fisheries have to change in an evolving sectoral environment? (6) What are the options for fisheries enhancement? (7) What are the most appropriate fisheries technologies? (8) What value chains and employment opportunities are associated with inland fisheries?

Based on RDA analysis, most species were abundant in Shala Gike Shore station. Their distribution was negatively correlated with salinity and EC, whereas pH, alkalinity, NO3–N, SRP, TP, NH3–N and SiO2 had a positive correlation. Previously Lake Shala was dominated by Cryptophyta but this has switched to a diatom-dominant community. Such changes in phytoplankton taxa may be suggestive of ecological change. This study provides baseline data on the phytoplankton community structure of Lake Shala associated with physico-chemical changes, against which future community structure can be evaluated.",

Despite the many benefits of mangrove ecosystems, mangroves in the Niger Delta region are often cleared for electric powerline and oil pipeline rights-of-way, recreation, road construction, housing and farming. The study assessed the impacts of mangrove clearance on physico-chemical parameters of interstitial water and macrozoobenthic primary community structure in Oproama Creek, Nigeria, from February to July 2016. Three stations were selected for the study: two stations in more natural and undisturbed mangroves and one station at a mangrove clearing (for a national grid powerline right-of-way). Species richness and diversity were slightly higher at the undisturbed mangrove sites than the cleared site. Removal of mangrove canopy shade alters microclimate temperature regime and other temperature-dependent parameters, imposing thermal stress on stenothermal taxa and ancillary stressors that compositely affected primary community structure indices. Deliberate loss of mangroves through clearing waterfront vegetation as a driver for improved visual monitoring and enhanced security in the Oproama Community in the Niger Delta is reported for the first time. The wider implications of mangrove clearance and fragmentation on ecosystem-based goods and services are discussed. Limiting mangrove spatial loss owing to construction of an electric tower cutline within coastal landscape is strongly recommended.",

This study aimed at understanding the spatial distribution of the dominant zooplankton taxa in Lake Hawassa, Ethiopia. Collection of samples and in situ measurements of physico-chemical parameters were carried out at four sites for five consecutive months from April to August in 2019. Twenty-two species of zooplankton were identified. Among these, rotifers were the most important with regard to both species richness and abundance. Copepods were the second most important group in terms of species richness and abundance, whereas cladocerans were the least abundant taxa. All zooplankton groups were very rare at the inlet of the Tikur Wuha River, which could be mainly due to stress, associated with extreme turbidity. Rotifers were predominant at the inlet of influents from referral hospital revealing their adaptation to less clear water and pollution. Copepods attained their highest abundance at the macrophyte zone indicating their preference for water with high clarity and refuge. We concluded that the spatial variation of the zooplankton density in relation to water quality parameters has implications for the applicability of zooplankton as a cost-effective water quality assessment tool in lakes.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDespite Africa experiencing a substantial rise in inadequately managed agricultural practices, studies examining the effects of these activities on the functional organisation of macroinvertebrates in tropical streams are underdeveloped. The responses of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPTs) functional feeding groups (FFGs) to agricultural pollution were investigated in the Kat River, Eastern Cape, South Africa, to identify potential FFG indicators. Physicochemical parameters and macroinvertebrates were sampled from eight sites delineated into four land-use impact categories (highly impacted, HIC; impacted category, IC; moderately impacted, MIC; and least impacted, LIC) based on the percentage of agricultural land cover. The Permutational multivariate analyses of variance (PERMANOVA) results revealed land use (F = 4.2, 3.62; p < 0.05) and season (F = 2.89, p < 0.03) influenced FFGs in the river, with shredder abundances decreasing with increasing agricultural stress. Conversely, collectors, predators and scrapers were tolerant of agricultural disturbance. Nutrient variables (NO3-N, NO2-N and NH4-N), canopy and depth were the critical variables that affected FFG structure in the river. Our findings provided more understanding and insights into the functional structure of EPT in relation to agricultural pollution and can contribute to developing trait-based biomonitoring tools in Africa.Keywords: agricultural pollutionfunctional organisationmacroinvertebrate biomonitoring",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess and compare the water quality of the Gwebi and Mukuvisi Rivers, on the basis of selected physicochemical variables and macroinvertebrate community structure. Five sites where selected on both rivers and these were sampled on three separate occasions between January and July of 1998. The water variables measured were the concentrations of iron, chromium, zinc, lead, copper, manganese, chlorides, fluorides, sulphates, total phosphates, nitrates, ammonia, total dissolved salts, dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand, as well as pH, conductivity, temperature, water surface velocity and discharge. The concentration of most of the chemical variables was relatively similar along the course of the Gwebi River, but there were drastic increases in the levels of iron, chromium, copper, zinc, chlorides, fluorides, sulphates, and ammonia along the Mukuvisi River. The two rivers were different with respect to the physicochemical variables, with the exception of the first site on the Mukuvisi, which was similar to sites on the Gwebi River. This was because of the differences in the levels of human activities on the two rivers. Industrial, sewage and domestic pollution has had an adverse effect on the water quality of the Mukuvisi River. There was a sharp decline in the number of macroinvertebrate taxa along the Mukuvisi River. The lower reaches of the river where dominated by oligochaetes and Chironimidae larvae. Sample score classification of water quality based on the South African Scoring System Version 4 (SASS4) showed that most of the Mukuvisi river had poor quality water quality, whilst much of the Gwebi River had fair quality water. The HABS1 habitat assessment index was used to assess habitat quality at each site. Although much of the Mukuvisi recorded fair to good habitat scores and had generally higher habitat scores than sites on the Gwebi, the SASS scores were generally lower compared to those along the Gwebi. The sample scores and average score per taxon (ASPT) of the SASS4 showed that the Mukuvisi River was of much lower quality than the Gwebi. Both the sample score and ASPT were negatively and significantly (p<0.05) correlated to most of the physicochemical variables. The water quality variables accounted for 61.1% and 59.0% of the differences in the sample score and ASPT respectively. There was a marginal decrease in the Margalef and Shannon indices along the Gwebi River, but the Simpson's index remained relatively constant. Along the Mukuvisi River, there was a clear and distinct decrease in the magnitude of all three diversity indices, indicating decreasing macroinvertebrate community structure. The change in water physicochemical variables accounted for 61.3%, 69.2% and 87.2% of the changes in the Margalef, Shannon and Simpson's index respectively. The study provides evidence that the changes in macroinvertebrate community structure along the Mukuvisi River is due to decline in the water quality. On the Gwebi, water quality is not the main factor determining macroinvertebrate community structure.",

    "abstract": "The spatial distribution of aquatic macroinvertebrates in the Okavango River Delta, Botswana, was investigated during the low-water period in February 2003. This complements an earlier study undertaken during high-water in June 2000. Seventy-five samples were taken in a range of aquatic habitats at 29 georeference points in four focal areas: Upper Panhandle (UPH), Lower Panhandle and Guma Lagoon (LPH), Moremi Game Reserve/Xakanaka (MGR), and Chief's Island (CI). Over 180 morphospecies (approximately 63 families) were recorded during the survey. Multivariate analyses of macroinvertebrate assemblages indicated that assemblages in each of the four focal areas were at least 54% similar at morphospecies level, and 71% similar at family level, although some taxa were more or less common in different areas. Differences in macroinvertebrate assemblages were observed amongst different habitat types, with differences most pronounced between the deltaic habitats and isolated seasonally-flooded pools and temporary rain-filled pools in MGR and CI. The highest number of taxa was recorded in the MGR (125), followed by the UPH (96), CI (93) and the LPH (89) areas. The most families were recorded in the Hemiptera (11), followed by Mollusca (10), Diptera (nine), Coleoptera (nine), Crustacea (six), Ephemeroptera (six) and Odonata (four). Three families of Hirudinea and Trichoptera, and one family of Lepidoptera, were also recorded. Hydracarina were common but not identified beyond order, while Oligochaeta were less frequently recorded. With respect to the different aquatic habitats sampled, the highest number of taxa was recorded in marginal vegetation in the channels and lagoons, although inundated floodplains, floating vegetation and marginal vegetation in backwaters also supported many taxa. The fewest taxa were recorded in sediment. This survey, whilst representing a 'snapshot' of the system under low-water conditions, highlights the importance of maintaining a mosaic of aquatic habitats in the Delta. Further studies would enhance our knowledge of the aquatic macroinvertebrate biodiversity of the Okavango Delta, thereby contributing to its conservation.",

All surveys took place during the spring months and allowed for a comparison of a wet and a dry spring period. The 2006 freshwater pulse generated a strong horizontal salinity gradient within the estuary. In the absence of freshwater inflow, the ichthyofaunal community in the littoral zone was numerically dominated by estuarine resident species, whilst after the freshwater pulse an increased contribution of marine migrant species was observed. Within the demersal zone, marine straggler species dominated during the dry spring period and estuarine residents during the wet spring period. Numerical analyses of the littoral and demersal fish assemblages indicated the presence of three distinct groupings — corresponding to the upper and middle reaches during separate wet and dry periods, and a community associated with the lower reaches of the estuary. It is suggested that the shift in community structure between the dry and wet spring periods could be related to altered physico-chemical and trophic conditions within the estuary, as well as the increased presence of freshwater and estuarine olfactory cues within the coastal zone, which would have resulted in the recruitment of 0+ estuary-associated marine species into the Kariega system.

No living aquatic macroinvertebrates were found at sites with severe oil deposits, but they were present within a few metres of these sites and their abundance increased as the amount of oil present decreased, within a few metres of such sites. Abundance and taxonomic richness declined with increasing oil levels, suggesting that oil negatively affected macroinvertebrate assemblages. Based on preliminary observations, other significant factors that influenced biodiversity were pH, water permanence, terrestrial vegetation type, and canopy cover. Further sampling of contaminated and clean sites in the region will be crucial in determining the natural biodiversity of wetland habitats such that the restoration success of these areas can be more rigorously evaluated.

Seasonal and spatial variability of nutrient concentrations in the system were influenced by freshwater inflow from the Bia and Tanoé rivers. The decrease in the salinity gradient in Aby Lagoon, which is permanently stratified during the long dry season, increased the bottom inputs of soluble reactive phosphate and soluble reactive silicate which, in combination with good light penetration during the long dry season, enhanced phytoplankton production in the system. During the rainy seasons, water discharges into the system washed phytoplankton biomass out, preventing the development of blooms. Overall, 192 taxa from eight phyla were recorded: Bacillariophyta (32%), Chlorophyta (31%), Cyanobacteria (23%), Euglenophyta (12%), Dinophyta (0.5%), Xanthophyta (0.5%), Chrysophyta (0.5%) and Rhodophyta (0.5%). During the long dry season, Cyanobacteria cells comprised >50% of the phytoplankton abundance. The main phytoplankton taxa responsible for this high abundance were Microcystis aeruginosa, Oscillatoria princeps, Pseudanabaena limnetica, Aphanizomenon sp. 2 and Anabaena planctonica.",

Although relatively dilute, fish ponds had higher levels of all physico-chemical variables measured compared to those of locations upstream and downstream of farms, and to reference locations. Total nitrogen and BOD5 were most clearly statistically significant. Of 292 earthen fish ponds surveyed in central Ghana, approximately 92% were used for either Oreochromis monoculture or Oreochromis–Clarias polyculture. These had similar pond water (i.e. potential effluent) quality but different management practices. The study ponds had the potential to pollute effluent-receiving streams, but their actual impacts will depend on how pond effluents are managed.

Small fishes were sampled in the marginal zone of the floodplains using a throw-trap net and a suite of physicochemical properties were measured. Both physicochemical water quality parameters and densities of small fishes showed spatiotemporal variations across the temporary floodplain types. Turbidity, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, woody debris and chlorophyll a were all highest in rarely flooded floodplains compared to both primary and secondary floodplains (ANOVA, p < 0.05). Fish from 38 fish taxa belonging to 11 families were identified and classified during the study. The fish families Cichlidae (dominated by tilapias), Poeciliidae (Aplocheilichthys spp.) and Cyprinidae (Barbus spp.), were the most abundant across the study floodplains. The poeciliids were most abundant in frequently flooded primary and secondary floodplains, whereas juvenile cichlids dominated in rarely flooded floodplains. During high floods the rarely flooded portions of the delta function as important nursery habitats for juvenile cichlids, implying that a significant reduction in flooding may have negative effects on the delta's tilapia stocks due to reduced recruitment success.

Most Labeo and Chiloglanis species migrated in late summer and autumn, possibly to seek refugia, whereas Barbus and Labeobarbus species moved upstream in spring, possibly for spawning. There were strong diel differences in upstream movement, with most species moving at night, as well as interannual variation among species, possibly reflecting differing recruitment. Although some fish moved both up- and downstream through the fishway, the fishway functioned poorly, as significantly higher numbers of fish were only occasionally able to ascend the full length of the fishway when its discharge and turbulence were low (>70 W m−3). Further experimental research on appropriate turbulence, water velocity and fishway design for South African fishes is recommended. For future field evaluation, sampling of the population immediately downstream of the weir and fishway is recommended to enable a more quantitative evaluation.",

The lowest concentration of extracellular MCYST-LR equivalent was recorded in the lacustrine zone, where no cyanobacterial cells were observed, while the highest concentration (3.25 µg l−1), 3.25 higher than World Health Organization standard, was observed in the riverine zone.

Microscopic analyses of the stomach content of both fish species revealed low numbers of cyanobacterial Microcystis aeruginosa cells in comparison to other phytoplankton. The extracellular MCYST-LR equivalent of the decomposing bloom may have played a major role in the high levels observed in the livers of the two fish species.

Along the uppermost and lowermost reaches of the wetland, where dolerite outcrops occur along the main valley, hydrogeomorphic features typical of geological control on wetland formation are present, including a meandering river channel, oxbow lakes and <3 m deep organic-poor alluvial fill. Along the main body of the wetland, however, floodplain features are absent, alluvial fill is up to 4.5 m deep and contains up to 2 m deep accumulations of peat. These characteristics deviate from the traditional model of dolerite control on wetland formation described by several other studies on Highveld wetland systems. The formation of Wakkerstroom Vlei has been controlled by a combination of geological, geomorphic and biotic factors, including the formation of a relatively wide, gently sloping valley along the middle reaches, creating accommodation for floodplain wetland formation, followed by impoundment of the main channel by laterally impinging alluvial fans, and the dense growth of robust vegetation, which has promoted flood-out of the main channel and peat formation. This knowledge has been important for identifying catchment and wetland land-use practices that threaten the longevity of Wakkerstroom Vlei.

In addition, glucose, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were significantly increased while protein levels were reduced (p < 0.05) in the plasma throughout the exposure period. Prolonged exposure of C. gariepinus juveniles to NPK can lead to physiological dysfunction in the fish.",

The analysis was done using gas chromatography with an electron capture detector. The concentrations of OCPs in water and sediment ranged from 0.00 to 2.24 µg kg−1 and 0.00 to 1 673.57 µg kg−1, respectively. The sediment had the highest deposition of OCPs, with a total concentration of 2 953.84 µg kg−1. Lindane and heptachlor epoxide had the highest mean concentrations in the sediment, 1 673.57 µg kg−1 and 1 122.74 µg kg−1, respectively, while other OCPs were also found in the biota. Bentho-pelagic fishes had the highest biota-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF) in nine OCP residues, ranging from 1 to 32, and benthic invertebrates had the highest BSAF in three OCP residues, ranging from 1 to 91. The trend in total concentration of OCPs in the lagoon was sediment > Melicertus kerathurus > Eleotris soaresi > Pomadasys jubelini > Tilapia guineensis > Callinectes amnicola > plankton>water. The transfer of organochlorine residues in the food chain and its distribution in the trophic levels was influenced by habitat, environmental conditions, feeding habit and biochemical composition of individual populations. The total residual concentration of OCPs in shellfish and fish ranged between 0.16 ppm and 0.69 ppm. This concentration is quite high compared to the Federal Ministry of Environment limit of <0.01 ppm, and can be harmful if the trend is not checked. Continuous monitoring procedures need to be put in place for environmental safety.",

The locomotory habits of wild Polypterus senegalus from Lake Albert, Uganda, were investigated in 2014. High-speed videography demonstrated the capability of large Polypterus to move overland successfully. Contrary to previous evidence, field observations found that terrestrial locomotion in Polypterus is not inherently restricted by body size. Evidence that Polypterus exhibit this behaviour as part of their natural life history can be found in the existence of environmental challenges and the presence of adaptations for amphibious life.",

Higher density, species richness and diversity were recorded in open intertidal areas, compared to nearby mangrove forests. Non-metric multidimensional scaling indicated differences in assemblages between mangrove and open intertidal samples. These differences were confirmed by analysis of similarity. SIMPER identified an average dissimilarity of 97.24% between mangroves and open intertidal samples, most of which were due to the malacostracan Uca annulipes and the gastropod Cerithidea decollata. PRIMER RELATE indicated significant correlation between macroinvertebrate assemblages and the measured physico-chemical parameters salinity, pH, redox potential and sediment particle size, whereas BIOENV and the Monte Carlo permutation test indicated that redox potential, sediment particle size and pH contributed significantly to variation in species composition. Mangroves were dominated by the gastropod C. decollata, and by the malacostracans Neosarmatium africanum and U. annulipes, and open intertidal areas by the bivalves Dosinia hepatica and Eumarcia paupercula. Due to the rich biodiversity in open intertidal ecosystems, it is recommended that conservation efforts along the Tanzanian coast should focus here.Keywords: benthic macrofaunacommunity structurelittoral zoneTanganyikaWestern Indian Ocean",

Tarebia granifera was well established throughout the Nseleni River system, with an overall preference for shallow waters and seasonal temporal patterns of abundance.

A 285 cm long sediment core sample was collected using a Rod-Operated Single-drive Stationary Piston corer. Lake level was inferred using indices based on the proportion of planktonic to benthic diatom taxa (P/B ratio). The sediment archive presented distinct zones dominated by planktonic and benthic diatom flora. An initial transgression in the early 19th century was characterised as a shallow water environment dominated by planktonic Aulacoseira spp. This was a response to extreme drought during the late 18th to early 19th century. Mid-19th century was defined by a high lake stand. The late 19th to early 20th centuries experienced low water level following the widely documented aridity at the time. The mid-20th century was marked by a spectacular rise in water level that coincided with remarkably wet years during the early 1960s and late 1970s. The first decade of the 21st century witnessed widespread changes in water level. The proxy records show that lake ramping and drawdown over the years follow approximately 50-year climatic cycles.",

    "abstract": "Historically, the St Lucia Estuarine Lake System and uMfolozi River joined via an estuarine bay before exiting to the sea. In 1952, separate mouths were created, because of sediment problems originating from the uMfolozi River. During the 2004 drought, the mouth of the 525 km2 St Lucia System closed and has remained so to date, except for a single opening in 2007, lasting six months. From 2008, management actions have been implemented to 'reconnect' St Lucia to uMfolozi. This study assessed the effects of a new channel between the two on the St Lucia fish community and its effectiveness for recruitment of marine species. Twelve marine species previously absent and a 67% increase in abundance in the Lower Narrows were recorded after channel opening, which allowed for limited recruitment of marine species. This paper reviews the effects of a permanent connection between St Lucia and uMfolozi, via the uMfolozi Spillway, established in 2012, which has pushed the system into a prolonged freshwater state severely reducing the estuarine fish fauna. This, the lack of a connection to the sea for 15 years and issues potentially associated with increased sedimentation in the lower reaches are reviewed in relation to management decisions that have been implemented.",

    "abstract": "Restoration of estuarine function to the Lake St Lucia system, the largest estuary in South Africa, was initiated in 2010. Significant change began with the reversal of a mouth management policy that was adopted in 1952 and maintained for the next 60 years, focusing on the separation of a major tributary, the uMfolozi River, from the rest of the estuary. This represented the loss of an essential source of fresh water, as well as the natural driving force in the breaching of the sand bar that develops across the mouth during low river flow periods. The desiccation of the estuary between 2003 and 2012 was unprecedented despite historical dry cycles during the past century. The devastating regional and national effects of this situation were instrumental in driving a reconsideration of the historic management policy. This paper focuses on the interactions between people and the estuary over the past century, management policies and actions, and the catastrophic loss of the largest estuary on the subcontinent. This was followed by a reassessment of management policies based on intensive studies and workshops, examining alternatives to historic policies, and extensive consultations with a plethora of interest groups that culminated in changing policy and the implementation of restoration actions.",

Larvae and juveniles of important fishery species recruit from the ocean into estuaries, but research has shown that estuaries are one component of broader nursery use patterns. Early stage fish recruit into many shallow water habitats, utilising various niche types, extending into low salinity waters, including rivers, where abundant larval insect prey have been identified in their diet. However, marine and estuarine fishes that use this nursery mosaic are impacted on by various threats transcending traditional habitat boundaries. These include reductions in freshwater supply, pollution, barriers to migration, introduction of invasive species, overharvesting and climate change. Compounding this is the lack of law enforcement, a lack of implementation of effective management covering nursery habitat mosaics and a lack of public understanding of the plight of coastal fish. This review details the life history of estuarine fish and the threats that they face, and how management of these threats, can continue to improve into the Anthropocene, to rebuild coastal fish stocks.",

The zooplankton community living, which was constituted of 38 species, was dominated by Rotifers, followed by copepods and cladocerans at both sites. The variations in the abundance of zooplankton and species richness (d) between the two sites were significant with higher mean values in the non-infested sites (p < 0.05). The existing infestation level of water hyacinth poses a significant effect on the composition and abundance of zooplankton.

Lake Barombi Kotto is one of the volcanic crater lakes in Cameroon that serves as a prime source of drinking water for the Barombi Kotto community. The overall objective of the study was to determine the water quality of Lake Barombi Kotto making use of some physico-chemical parameters, Carlson's Trophic State Index (TSI), Heavy Metal Pollution index (HPI) and some bacteriological parameters. Water samples were collected over two seasons across a longitudinal transect at two depths and subjected to physico-chemical, bacteriological, nutrient, Chlorophyll a and phytoplankton analyses using standard methods. Descriptions, Analyses of Variance, ordinations and correlations were used to analyse resulting data at α = 0.05. Lake Barombi Kotto had a TSI of 93.67 and 87.92 in the dry and rainy season, respectively, indicating it is eutrophic. Of the six heavy metals studied, only the concentration of Fe was above the WHO (2008) drinking water quality limits. The HPI of the lake was 4.17 and 6.19 for the dry and rainy seasons, respectively, well below the critical index limit of 100. This lake is contaminated with faecal coliforms and pathogenic bacteria, such as Salmonella. This study has not only set baseline conditions for additional monitoring, but has exposed key dynamics and significant socio-economic and public health risks to humans.",

The current study aimed to assess the water quality of Rosetta Branch using the Nile Chemical Pollution Index (NCPI), and a microbiological analysis, where the physical and chemical parameters of water branch were measured. Complete depletion of dissolved oxygen was recorded at the discharge points of El-Rahawy and Sobal drains, whereas COD, BOD and nutrient salts, recorded highest levels compared with the reference site of Nile River. The abundance of the major ions was in the following order: HCO3− > Cl− > Na+ > SO42− > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+. NCPI values ranged from 15 to 45 with an average of 31, where, a sudden increase was recorded at sites affected by human activity (Sites 3 and 6) to be grossly polluted, and then the water quality improved slightly farther downstream. Microbial analyses indicated that the total bacterial counts and the total diazotrophs were present in high population densities (up to 105 CFU ml−1). Significant differences in counts were recorded among seasons, whereas no spatial changes were recorded. The total and faecal coliforms populations exceeded the permissible limits cited by World Health Organization (WHO) for drinking water. An intensive water-quality monitoring program is recommended for the Rosetta Branch, and the treatment of wastewater prior to discharge to mitigate health problems outbreaks or any aquatic ecosystem disorders.",

    "abstract": "Water hyacinth invaded Lake Victoria in the 1980s and, by 1998, had attained peak coverage of approximately 2 000 ha in the Ugandan waters of the lake. Control interventions, especially via biological means, significantly reduced the weed's coverage to non-nuisance levels (<10 ha) by 1999. Although resurgence was noticed in 2001, total coverage never reached the infestation levels attained between 1994 and 1998. By March 2012, infestations still occurred in hotspot bays, including MacDonald (52.1 ha, SE 3.0), Fielding (38.0 ha, SE 1.4), Bunjako (33.7 ha, SE 1.9), Murchison (17.1 ha, SE 0.9), Lwera (8.5 ha, SE 0.3), Napoleon Gulf (2.9 ha, SE 0.3) and Berkeley (2.1 ha, SE 0.1), in addition to some bays of the Ssesse Islands (47.8 ha, SE 0.5) and on the Kagera River. These hotspots were characterised by shelter from offshore winds and ample macronutrients (NO3-N > 13.8 µg l−1, SE 1.6; SRP > 17.2 µg l−1, SE 3.2) in the water column. Control efforts, mainly the use of biological control agents on a large scale, manual and mechanical removal at strategic sites, plus a reduction in nutrient loading, should therefore target the identified hotspot bays of the lake.",

A priori river classification by abiotic variables and validation of classifications obtained using aquatic macroinvertebrates from reference sites for selected Tanzanian rivers was done in 2010–2012. A classification framework for Tanzanian rivers based on ecoregions and geomorphologic features is proposed. This gives 12, 36 and 144 river types for the whole country derived from ecoregions, ecoregion–slope classes and ecoregion–landforms, respectively. The proposed classifications were validated in the Pangani, Rufiji and Wami–Ruvu river basins using aquatic macroinvertebrates. Results suggested that macroinvertebrate assemblages reflect the differences among river types in all three regional classifications. Ecoregion–landform classification showed greater significant differences among macroinvertebrate assemblages, whereas classification by ecoregion–slope class resulted in a moderate number of river types, which include sufficient reference sites for ecological assessment.Keywords: ecoregiongeomorphologymacroinvertebrateregional classificationriver type",

Length at age was described by the von Bertalanffy equations L(t) = 32.4(1 - exp(-0.25(t + 2.3))) and L(t) = 30.2(1 - exp(-0.23(t + 3.73))) for O. niloticus and O. mortimeri, respectively, in 1997–2000, and by L(t) = 44.6(1 - exp(-0.29(t - 0.05))) and L(t) = 36.8(1 - exp(-0.64(t - 0.73))), respectively, in 2003–2005. There were more older (≥10 years) age classes and lower L∞ in the 1997–2000 dataset for both species than in the later sampling periods. Mean length at age of O. niloticus was higher than that of O. mortimeri for the 1997–2000 dataset, but similar for the 2003–2005 dataset. This study supports the hypothesis that, in Lake Kariba, the alien O. niloticus has a higher growth rate than O. mortimeri, and infers its competitive advantage over the indigenous species.",

Twenty-nine fish species were recorded in experimental gillnets. Catches were dominated by Brycinus lateralis and Schilbe intermedius, contributing 39.5% and 38.5% by weight, respectively. Large-meshed (3–4.5 inch) monofilament and multifilament gillnets emulating those used in the commercial fishery caught mostly Oreochromis andersonii (42.7% by weight) and Serranochromis macrocephalus (28.3% by weight), respectively. Commercial gillnet catch per unit effort (CPUE) averaged 7.0 kg 100-m net−1 night−1, and the annual yield for 2011/2012 was estimated at 2 700 tonnes. Aquatic macrophytes and fishes quickly recolonised the lake and, just two years after refilling, the lake supported a thriving fishery that yielded 4.5 times more than the 600 tonnes recorded in 1974.",

    "abstract": "Few studies have addressed the terraces adjacent to the Tana River and delta. In May 2012 a survey assessed the woody vegetation of the terraces in anticipation of their conversion to a biofuel farm. The 64 000 hectares targeted by Bedford Biofuels for clearing for Jatropha curcas would have released over 1 million Mg of carbon at a social cost of the order of US$36 million. The lease agreement set the payment to the communities at US$0.75 per hectare per year, i.e. about US$100 000 annually. The intact terraces are a resource for famine food, fodder, traditional medicine for humans and livestock, firewood, fencing and housing, but are especially important for pastoralist communities at the beginning of the dry season when waiting for the deltaic floodplain pastures to become accessible. They are also important migratory routes for wildlife, including elephants, dispersing to and from the Tsavo ecosystem. It is unlikely that the communities would have derived substantial benefits from conversion. Maintaining and even improving the carbon storage on these semi-arid lands would therefore be a better option, especially if compensation was available through the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) programme. The biofuel company has since abandoned the project.",

A change detection analysis in the herbaceous wetlands of KwaMbonambi, South Africa, which were subject to frequent fires, revealed that in 1937 the study area comprised grassland (69%), herbaceous wetland (25%), indigenous swamp forest (4%) and tree plantations (1%). However, by 1970, tree plantations occupied 78% of the landscape and grasslands and herbaceous wetlands had declined to 9% and 6%, respectively, whereas indigenous swamp forest had increased to 6%. By 2009 tree plantations had been removed from the wetland areas. Despite this opportunity for herbaceous wetlands to recover their historical extent, they decreased to only 2%, mostly changing to indigenous swamp forest or to an herbaceous/fern (Stenochlaena tenuifolia)/woodland mosaic. Fire records showed suppression of fire to be an important contributing factor, particularly in wetlands that had been disturbed by tree plantations, although subsequently removed. A pilot burning experiment revealed that S. tenuifolia did not inhibit fire. It is therefore practicable to increase fire frequency to prevent the mosaic developing into forest. A conceptual model of the influence of fire regime on wetland vegetation type is presented and priorities for further research on wetlands and fire are recommended.",

A total of 37 waterbodies were sampled in 2001 and 2003, ranging from small ephemeral pools to large permanent lakes along broad gradients in altitude (700–2 800 m) and salinity (37–67 200 µS cm−1). Between 0 and 12 species were recorded per site. Lack of ostracods was associated with either hypersaline waters, or the presence of fish in fresh waters. Three of the 32 recovered ostracod taxa, Physocypria sp., Sarscypridopsis cf. elizabethae and Oncocypris mulleri, combined a wide distribution with frequent local dominance. Canonical correspondence analysis on species–environment relationships indicated that littoral vegetation, altitude, surface water temperature and pH best explain the variation in ostracod communities. Presence of fish and water depth also influence species occurrence, with the larger species being more common in shallow waterbodies lacking fish. Based on Chao's estimator of total regional species richness, this survey recovered about two-thirds (60–68%) of the regional ostracod species pool. Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) of the valve morphology of 14 ostracod taxa are provided, in order to facilitate their application in biodiversity and water-quality assessments and in palaeoenvironmental reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Seasonal changes significantly affect tropical ecosystems; hence, verification of how these changes affect water quality is important for waterbodies that serve as water and food sources, particular as such changes are often associated with shifts in plankton diversity and microbial loads. This study assessed the seasonal changes in water quality, plankton diversity and microbial load in four lakes serving as sources of drinking water. Temperature, hardness and phosphate concentration were elevated in the dry season, and pH, biochemical oxygen demand, transparency, turbidity, total dissolved solids, conductivity, alkalinity and nitrate concentrations were elevated in the wet season. A phytoplankton analysis revealed that Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta, Cyanophyta and Dinophyta were most common, with the families Desmidiaceae, Microcystaceae and Euglenaceae (phylum Euglenophyta) displaying dominance. For zooplankton, Rotifera was most common, with Branchionidae dominating the lakes in both seasons. In the wet season, Chlorophyta, Cyanophyta, Bacillariophyta and Dinophyta dominated, with Aphanizomenonaceae and Microcystaceae the most diverse families. Disease-causing pathogens, Ascaridae, Trichuridae and Ancylostomatidae (phylum Nematoda), were detected during periods of high rainfall. The waters in the dry season had higher microbial loads than in the wet season, ranging from 1.50 to 233.50 CFU g−1 (p < 0.05). This demonstrates the seasonal variations in risk to users and underlies the importance of regular assessment of water quality particularly given the threat of seasonal changes elated to climate change.",

The extent of estuarine habitat loss and land-use pressures are understudied in South Africa, particularly in the numerically dominant temporarily closed estuaries. Remote sensing techniques are effective tools for monitoring estuarine habitat loss, and the type and intensity of anthropogenic influences that derive from land-use, such as water quality deterioration. This study quantified land-use/land-cover within and adjacent to 57 temporarily closed estuaries in KwaZulu-Natal, on the subtropical east coast of South Africa, to investigate spatio-temporal land-use trends over the past four decades. Urban and agricultural land-use pressures were high in the estuarine functional zone and adjacent ecotones (32.1% and 52.1% transformed, respectively). The rate of land-cover change has stabilised, following a decline in transformation over time due to the withdrawal of cultivation from some wetland areas. There was, however, evidence of land-use intensification between the 1980s and 2018 as former agricultural land was progressively developed for urban or peri-urban use, and sand mining was identified as an important local land-use. High intensity sand mining, continued urban expansion and the introduction of urban land-uses in rural areas will intensify local land-use pressures, leading to further declines in regional estuary health.",

Mangrove ecosystems act as pollutant sinks, increasing the likelihood of heavy metal accumulation in aquatic organisms. This study examines heavy metal contamination and bioaccumulation in crabs (Callinectes amnicola) and snails (Tympanotonos fuscatus) from mangrove ecosystems along the Bayelsa coast, Nigeria. Water, sediment, crab and snail samples were collected from three stations and analysed using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry for lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu). Biota-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF) analyses for crabs revealed significant bioaccumulation of Ni, As and Zn, particularly in highly contaminated stations. The target hazard quotient (THQ) suggested low immediate health risks for human consumers. Ongoing monitoring and pollution control measures are essential to mitigate potential long-term exposure risks and protect public health and ecosystem integrity.",

Heavy metal contents (Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn, Cd, Fe, and Pb), germination tests in lettuce, turnip, and alfalfa as well as micronucleus assay of Vicia faba were performed to assess phytotoxicity and genotoxicity. This study revealed that the Souani wadi had the highest concentration of Pb and Fe, and the highest concentrations of Zn, Cu, and Cd were recorded at the Aliane wadi. The heavy metal content in surface sediments is characterised by a high abundance of Fe followed by Zn and a low abundance of Cd in all river sediments studied. The germination index in water and sediment samples overreaches 80% in some cases. The highest mitotic index reaches 8.29% in the Souani wadi with a minimal value noted in the Oued el Maleh wadi (3.47%). The lowest micronucleus frequency is observed in the Martil wadi (1‰) and the highest value was noted in the Oued el Maleh (16.86‰), which reveals the genotoxic effect related to high levels of metals and salinity. These results support the use of micronucleus in V. faba as a tool in effectively monitoring genotoxicity in estuary.",

    "abstract": "This study provides the first quantitative assessment of the light-attraction component of a small-scale purse seine, locally known as a chilimira net, fishery in two areas of southern Lake Malawi. For monitoring purposes the shoreline of Lake Malawi is divided into a number of statistical strata. Two strata ('2.1' in the southeast arm and '3.1' in the southwest arm of the lake) were selected for this study. Catch per unit effort in stratum 2.1 was generally lower than that recorded in stratum 3.1 but nets in stratum 2.1 fished more frequently, leading to similar annual catches in the two strata. Annual catch was estimated as 19.4 (CI = 15.9–23.5) tons net–1 year–1 in stratum 2.1 and 23.5 (CI = 19.5–28.1) tons net–1 year–1 in stratum 3.1 respectively. A total of 62 species from 28 cichlid genera, and 13 species from nine non-cichlid genera, were identified from the samples. Of the 37 genera identified, only five; Copadichromis, Dimidiochromis, Engraulicypris, Oreochromis and Rhamphochromis, contributed more than 5% to the total annual catch in either stratum. Their combined contribution to the annual catch was in excess of 85% in both strata. Comparisons showed that catch-composition was dependent on area. Length-frequency distributions of major target species in the catch showed that the fishery targeted juveniles in stratum 2.1, while in stratum 3.1 most individuals were harvested after reaching their length-at-maturity. The dependence of catch-composition and size-selection on area indicates that management interventions for this fishery need to be area-specific. Since the fishery targets a diverse species assemblage, effort limitation or area closure may be the only viable management options, until such time as additional biological and fisheries data are available for the application of stock assessment models.",

The mouth closed in June 2002 and has remained closed for more than three years. The St Lucia Estuarine System is an important nursery ground for juveniles of many marine fish species. Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife initiated a once-off survey to investigate the effects of the drought on the fish fauna and to establish if any fish were breeding in the system under the existing drought conditions. Fish were sampled at six sites throughout the system, using seine and gill-nets. In December 2004, the system had become partitioned into four isolated compartments, and at this time a total of 4 475 individuals comprising 30 species were recorded. An analysis of size class data indicated the presence of juveniles of at least 12 species, including nine estuarineassociated marine species, which had spawned after mouth closure. Although some estuarine species had spawned within the system, most appeared to have recruited into the Narrows and lake sections of the St Lucia system during January 2004 when the adjacent Mfolozi River, which is linked to the open Mfolozi Estuary, flooded and overtopped into St Lucia Estuary. Should the St Lucia mouth remain closed for four or more years, it can be expected that the lack of recruitment of first-time spawners from the St Lucia nursery grounds into the off-shore marine breeding stocks will have major impacts on these estuaryassociated marine species.",

With the exception of Zn, the concentrations of dissolved metals were generally less than 1μg l–1 in all samples. Higher concentrations of metals were recorded in SPM in samples from the Mzinga Creek mangrove forest, on ebb tides during the rainy season. Concentrations of Cd in SPM ranged from 33.9–85.5μg g–1 dw and, for Cr, from 23.9–138.1μg g–1 dw. The concentration of Pb ranged from 56.5–114.0μg g–1 dw and the concentration of Zn in SPM from Mzinga Creek was 35 times higher than that of Ras Dege, with concentration ranges between 229.8 and 1 427.3μg g–1 dw. In Ras Dege, concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu and Pb in SPM were generally lower than those of Mzinga Creek. Metal concentrations in oysters were of an order of magnitude higher in Mzinga Creek than in Ras Dege. These results are indicative of the contributions of heavy metal pollution from several anthropogenic sources, such as industrial and agricultural activities, in the Mtoni Creek catchment. Dar es Salaam seaport is a potential source of heavy metals to the Mzinga Creek mangrove stand. In comparison with the less-impacted Ras Dege mangrove stand, Mzinga Creek's environmental condition calls for urgent management intervention.",

The recorded parasitic infections were associated with degenerative, necrotic, inflammatory and proliferative changes in the skin and underlying muscles. Imported ornamental goldfish may be a source of infection to carp and native tilapia. Histopathology and transmission electron microscopy demonstrated the etiology and pathogenesis of infection and the preliminary diagnosis of viral infection, which is not common in Egypt.

Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife proposed a scheme whereby the Mfolozi–Msunduzi mouth would be closed, causing fresh water to enter the St Lucia Estuary to prevent excessively hypersaline conditions (>65) from developing in the lower and middle reaches of the St Lucia system. Although this proposal caused concern about the impact of mouth closure on the ecology of the Mfolozi–Msunduzi estuarine system, it raised its potential as a source of benthic fauna dispersal into, and the restocking of, the St Lucia system. Quantitative benthic sampling in the Mfolozi–Msunduzi system in 2007 and 2008 revealed a benthic community generally dominated by polychaetes which, although low in terms of total species richness compared with St Lucia, included elements of a core benthic group present in the St Lucia system throughout the current drought. The presence of the gravimetrically important crab Paratylodiplax blephariskios in the Mfolozi–Msunduzi system was considered important as a source from which the once-abundant population in the St Lucia Narrows could be restocked via dispersal through the channel linking the Mfolozi–Msunduzi Estuary to St Lucia. It was concluded that, while the input of fresh water from the Mfolozi River is necessary to ameliorate hypersaline conditions and conserve the important core benthic group in the Narrows and South Lake, consideration must be given to allowing sufficient tidal exchange in the Mfolozi–Msunduzi system to maintain its stocks of benthos with an obligate marine phase.",

Shallow nearshore waters had the highest abundance of phytoplankton (mean 2.12 × 108 ind. l−1), compared to the intermediate (1.96 × 108 ind. l−1) and deep offshore waters (7.59 × 107 ind. l−1). Bacillariophyta was the most abundant group (48.17% of total phytoplankton) and was uniformly distributed in all waters, followed by Cyanobacteria (33.33%), which decreased with distance offshore. Chlorophyta, the third highest in abundance (15.5%), increased with distance offshore. A total of 92 phytoplankton species were recorded. The most diverse phyla were Chlorophyta with 37 species, of which Staurastrum sp. and Siphonctosiphon polymorphus were the most abundant species, followed by Bacillariophyta with 25 species and Cyanobacteria with 21 species. In general, the phytoplankton community was dominated by the less nutritious species Nitzschia acicularis (Bacillariophyta), Lyngbya circumcreta and Microcystis flos aquae (Cyanobacteria). These findings contrast with those of most studies from before 1990, but agree with many thereafter. Eutrophication, affecting availability of nutrients etc., and pollution, affecting transparency and water pH, were the forces responsible for the observed spatial and temporal variability in phytoplankton abundance patterns and composition.

Since factors determining Nile perch distribution are not well understood its spatial distribution in the Mwanza Gulf of Lake Victoria was analysed in relation to depth, temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. Of these factors, DO concentration and the interaction of depth and DO concentration explained the distribution of Nile perch, whilst temperature had no significant effect. In periods of normoxia, Nile perch preferred to stay near the bottom at depths of 12–35 m, where densities of shrimps, their main prey, were high. However, Nile perch were apparently driven away from these areas by hypoxic conditions in the rainy season. They apparently escaped the seasonally hypoxic layers in deep water by horizontal inshore migration and by vertical movement in upward direction. Sudden upwelling of these deep layers is a threat to the Nile perch stock and the Nile perch fishery.

High Fe, Al and Cr concentrations in water and sediments in lakes Chivero and Manyame derive from geogenic background sources in addition to anthropogenic loads and intensity. Elevated concentrations of Al, Pb, Cu, Cd, Fe and Zn detected in gills, liver and stomach tissue of catfish corroborate concentrations in water and sediments, and pose the highest ecological and health risk for hydrobionts in lakes Chivero and Manyame.

The metrics that correlated best with fish health scores were haematocrit values and ecto- and endoparasite indices. Differences in K, HAI, and HAI using IPI determinations, were insignificant (p > 0.05) between species, while water contaminants, with the exception of ammonium (NH4), nitrate (NO3) and aluminium (Al) concentrations in summer, fell within the levels stipulated by the South African target water quality range guidelines for aquatic ecosystems.

Canonical correspondence analysis, used to examine spatial patterns of diatom communities in relation to environmental gradients, was statistically highly significant (p < 0.001). The first axis accounted for 45% and the second for 22% of the total variance. Seasonal and physicochemical gradients were clearly defined and indicated the water quality. A cluster analysis was then carried out to represent the different groups of the sampled stations sharing the same flora. Agglomerative cluster analysis grouped the sampled sites into seven clusters according to the community data. For clusters gathering more than one single sample, typical diatom taxa were determined with an indicator species analysis. The reliability of the biological diatom index BDI 2007 was tested under our environmental conditions and it was concluded that, considering the very particular geochemical context of this wadi, a specific diatom index should be developed.",

After 15 days, both crayfish and catfish had significantly reduced the populations of Bulinus globosus. Crayfish consumed 6.9 snails d−1, whereas catfish consumed 5.9 snails d−1. However, when supplied with an alternative prey, Melanoides tuberculata (100 individuals per tank), crayfish clearly preferred M. tuberculata (100% consumed over seven days) to B. globosus (100 individuals per tank) (54% consumed over the same period). Catfish, conversely, did not have a clear preference for either prey species, consuming 77% and 88% of M. tuberculata and B. globosus, respectively. It was also observed that young catfish were more efficient predators than older ones, because of ontogenetic shifts in their diet with age. Hybrid catfish retain the molluscivorous characteristics of their parent stock and red claw crayfish also preys on Schistosoma host snails. However, the effectiveness of both predators is affected by the presence of an alternative prey. Therefore, under suitable conditions, these species can be considered for biological control of schistosomiasis transmission.",

The sediment acted as a sink for NO3− with fluxes of between −200 and 100 µmol m−2 h−1. Benthic nutrient fluxes in the estuary were positively related with sediment organic content and silt. Nutrient fluxes in the Ashmead channel were significantly greater than the other regions because of the anoxic sediment, reduced flushing and a legacy of pollutant and organic matter retention. This condition can only be improved by removing wastewater input and dredging.

In an environmental rehabilitation programme, non-native smallmouth bass were removed from the lower reaches of the Rondegat River, Western Cape, South Africa, in 2012 and again in 2013 using the piscicide rotenone. A monitoring programme tracked the ecological response of organisms to these activities using quantitative sampling of macroinvertebrates on stones and the ISO-certified SASS5 rapid bioassessment method for assessing macroinvertebrate community integrity. We recorded a significant decrease in macroinvertebrate densities from the stones-in-current biotope following both rotenone treatments. The average score per taxon (ASPT) declined after the first treatment, indicating a loss of taxa sensitive to diminished water quality, then recovered prior to the second treatment, and subsequently no decline was detected after the lower dose used in the 2013 treatment. The SASS values were too variable to reveal trends. The ASPTs indicated that the community may have been resistant to low dose and resilient to high dose, due to inter-treatment recovery following the 2012 treatment, suggesting that the invertebrate assemblage is resilient to the conservative use of rotenone for localised river rehabilitation when upstream sources of recruitment exist.Keywords: freshwaterinvasionmacroinvertebratespisciciderehabilitationSASS5",

An assessment of ecological response was conducted in the Killarney and Kruisfontein wetlands, KwaZulu-Natal, in 2005 prior to rehabilitation in 2006, and again in 2011 and 2012, respectively, following rehabilitation. The assessment criteria included an evaluation of changes in ecological integrity, the supply of ecosystem services, and vegetation composition. Improvements in hydrological and geomorphic integrity were recorded in both wetlands, resulting in improved ecosystem delivery. However, investigation of vegetation composition using the wetland index value and floristic quality assessment index indices showed that, seven years after rehabilitation, Killarney's vegetation composition had improved, but Kruisfontein's vegetation was still largely dominated by pioneer species and appeared to be stable, but in a severely transformed state. The response of these wetlands has shown that sites for rehabilitation should be screened before work begins, and wetlands requiring intensive management of vegetation recovery should be assessed in terms of the objectives and the anticipated benefits of the project.",

Therefore a survey of the macroinvertebrates of the Olifants River, one of the most polluted rivers in South Africa, was conducted in 2010–2011. Four surveys were conducted at a total of seven sampling sites in four ecoregions, Highveld-Upper, Highveld-Lower, Lowveld-Lower and Eastern Escarpment mountain range, using sweepnets to sample vegetation and substratum. Conductivity, pH and temperature were measured in situ. Macroinvertebrates were identified to family level and counted. Ninety-four taxa were collected, of which 12 were each represented by more than 1% of the total number specimens collected. The influence of abiotic factors on biodiversity was assessed through canonical correspondence analysis, species richness, Shannon–Wiener index and Pielou's evenness index. Ecoregion and associated temperatures played dominant roles in the distribution of families. Although the level of organic enrichment at some sites could benefit families tolerant to, or with a preference for, such conditions, this proved insufficient to exclude the less-tolerant families from those sites.Keywords: biodiversityecoregionenvironmental influencesfreshwater macroinvertebratesriver health",

Samples were collected once per season between winter 2007 and autumn 2009 by means of boat-based plankton tows. A total of 19 taxa was recorded. Numerically, the copepod Pseudodiaptomus hessei dominated the zooplankton, with Paracartia longipatella and Halicyclops sp. also contributing significantly to the assemblage. Mysids were dominated by Mesopodopsis wooldridgei and Rhopalopthalmus terranatalis. Among the Brachyura, Hymenosoma orbiculare larvae and Paratylodiplax edwardsii larvae were prevalent. Zooplankton density varied with season, site and salinity zone, as has been reported in previous studies of temperate estuaries worldwide. Density peaked in summer, with means of 3 331 ind. m−3 in 2008 and 8 031 ind. m−3 in 2009. Highest densities of P. longipatella occurred in the lower estuary (Sites 1–3) and P. hessei in the upper estuary (Sites 8–10). Highest density occurred in the euhaline zone, due largely to the high density of P. longipatella. Site 1, closest to the mouth, typically supported the highest diversity of zooplankton. Patterns in zooplankton density and diversity resulted from the combined influence of salinity, temperature and fresh water inflow.",

The piscicide rotenone has been identified as a potential tool to aid the conservation of indigenous species through the removal of invasive fish. Rotenone was used in the Rondegat River, Cederberg, where smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu had extirpated the indigenous fish. An initial rotenone treatment in March 2012 was followed by another in March 2013. Due to concerns following the first treatment about possible build-up of rotenone between treatment stations, the second treatment included monitoring of rotenone concentrations during the treatment. Measured concentrations were consistently below the selected treatment concentration of 37.5 µg l−1 and dropped to below the tested effective piscicidal concentration of 12.5 µg l−1 at some sampling points. There was no build-up of rotenone within the treatment zones, but rotenone took longer than expected to clear out of the treatment area. The rotenone was effectively neutralised when the neutralisation station was operational, but was still detectable after neutralisation was terminated.Keywords: freshwater fishinvasive fishhigh-performance liquid chromatographyMicropterus dolomieupiscicide",

Longitudinal pH and salinity gradients, and seasonal variability of temperature and dissolved oxygen, were typical of many southern African estuaries. Differences to comparable systems occurred with respect to temperature range, and within-system variability of salinity, pH and dissolved oxygen. The influence of differing marine and freshwater inflows, and of submerged macrophyte composition and biomass, on such variability are discussed. No significant long-term changes occurred in salinity or pH up until 2006. Significant freshwater flooding in mid-2006 and late 2007, and following increases in open-mouth conditions, resulted in significant decreases in pH in both Swartvlei Estuary and Swartvlei Lake, and increases in salinity throughout the system. Long-term declines in turbidity occurred in Swartvlei Estuary throughout the study period. No long-term changes in water temperature were recorded. Long-term data indicate that the Swartvlei system is not undergoing a rapid deterioration in water quality, but rather exhibiting both short- and long-term fluxes characteristic of estuarine systems.",

The protective effects of salicylic acid (SA) in mitigating Cd-induced oxidative and histopathological injury were also investigated. We found that Cd exposure caused several histopathological changes in leech testes, such as vacuolisation of spermatogenic cysts which were strongly destroyed and disorganised. Biochemical study showed oxidative stress damage marked by a substantial increase in malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxidase levels as well as disturbance in the activity of the leech antioxidant system. Interestingly, the testes from the Cd and SA leech-exposed group exhibited increased enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant mechanism defenses, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione, oxidized glutathione, thiols, and ascorbic acid, in comparison with the testes of leeches exposed to Cd alone. Thus, SA supplementation considerably attenuated the histopathological lesions induced by Cd exposure, thereby restoring the normal appearance of the testes. In summary, the findings of this study indicate that SA treatment ameliorated the testicular histopathological and oxidative stress-induced damages caused by exposure to Cd through enhancing the antioxidant defense system.",

Sediment samples for metal and macrobenthic analyses were collected quarterly at seven sites during 2016−2017 using a Van Veen sediment grab sampler. Sediment samples were acid digested using a microwave digester and analysed for metal concentrations using ICP-OES. Highest metal concentrations (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn) were associated with areas most affected by industrial activities, while concentrations of most metals at the remaining sites were low. Pollution indices confirmed significant enrichment of Cd, Cr and Cu in bulk terminal sediment. Sediment quality guidelines revealed potential toxicity associated with Cu, Cr and Ni. The dominant taxa were Halmyrapseudes digitalis (two sites), Mediomastus capensis (three sites) and Sigambra parva (two sites). A significant inverse correlation existed between pollution indices and M-AMBI scores, confirming the adverse effect of metals on habitat quality. The need for a biomonitoring programme incorporating relevant biotic and abiotic indices is emphasised to assess the long-term effects of sediment contamination on aquatic communities in South African estuarine environments.",

Data generated through in situ measurements and laboratory analyses of physico-chemical parameters and the plankton communities were compared with results from the literature. Turbidity, salinity, nitrates and soluble reactive phosphorous showed an increasing trend in Lake Abaya, while in Lake Chamo conductivity, salinity, nitrates and soluble reactive phosphorous showed an increasing trend. In both lakes the water transparency and chlorophyll a concentration showed a declining trend. Despite higher available nutrients in Lake Abaya compared with Lake Chamo, higher turbidity with suspended solids contributed to lower chlorophyll-a concentrations and lower zooplankton abundance. The abundances of rotifers and crustaceans were lower in Lake Abaya compared with Lake Chamo. The mean trophic state index using total phosphorus, Secchi depth and chlorophyll-a shows that both lakes are in a eutrophic state. Our findings are consistent with previous studies and indicate that changes in major limnological features are a signal to take intervention measures to prevent further ecological degradation and to sustain the ecological services and livelihoods of fishers who are directly dependent on the lakes.Keywords: chlorophyll-anutrientsphysico-chemicaltrend analysiswater transparencyzooplankton",

    "abstract": "Abstract The proposed construction of a second hydroelectric power-generating dam on the Cunene (Kunene) River on the Namibia-Angola border, more than 100km downstream of the Ruacana hydroelectric power plant, will have a major influence on the aquatic biota of this river. In order to assess the potential impact of this impoundment a more detailed inventory of the biota in the river prior to this development was needed. Unfortunately the river presently does not represent an entirely undisturbed system as the operation of the Ruacana hydroelectric power station since 1970 has had a long-term effect on its biota. In the low-flow mid-summer season in particular, large areas of the river become irregularly inundated and exposed, sometimes on a daily basis, making them unsuitable for macroinvertebrate colonisation. There are six impoundments along the Cunene River upstream of the Ruacana Falls in Angola. These, however, do not have any major disruptive effects on daily flow variation in the Cunene River in Namibia although whole system biological consequences could be considerable but are unstudied. The Cunene River has a diverse freshwater fish fauna but, prior to the surveys reported here, the aquatic macroinvertebrates had been poorly studied. Surveys conducted by staff of the Department of Water Affairs (DWA) of Namibia and the Albany Museum, Grahamstown, in 1997 and 1998 have resulted in 216 aquatic macroinvertebrate species being recorded from Ruacana to the river mouth. The lower Cunene River, flowing through a very arid region, is biogeographically isolated and therefore highly vulnerable to change. The biota recorded reflects a fauna of widespread species and several elements of tropical origin. Several undescribed species may reflect some endemics but because of limited knowledge of the tropical rivers, this cannot be ascertained with certainty. From the aspect of conservation, the river contains a diversity of species with an abundance of filter-feeding species. Further surveys conducted during different seasons will undoubtedly record more taxa.

Results of the analysis indicated that there were distinct differences in the primary sources of carbon utilised by zooplankton in the three estuaries. In the Kariega estuary two distinct zooplankton feeding guilds were identified, the first having moderate ∂13C values ranging between −16‰ and −18‰, the second having more enriched ∂13C values varying between −10‰ and −12‰. Zooplankters of the first guild utilised carbon derived mainly from the microbenthic algae, whereas those of the second guild appeared to obtain theirs from eelgrass, Zostera capensis, and its associated epiphytes. In the temporarily closed/open Kasouga estuary, zooplankton had isotopic values ranging between −17.8‰ and −18.1‰. The most likely source of carbon for the zooplankton in this estuary is the extensive microphytobenthic alga stocks usually recorded in the system. In contrast to the freshwater-deprived estuaries, the depleted isotopic values of the zooplankton samples (−28‰ to −26‰) from the Great Fish River estuary suggest that the primary source of carbon consumed there was derived from phytoplankton. Data obtained in this study are in agreement with those of previous studies conducted in the region and highlight the importance of freshwater input in determining the trophodynamics in estuarine systems in southern Africa.",

There was no seasonality in the stable isotope ratios of the dominant producers and consumers in the estuary. Two distinct zooplankton assemblages were identified. The first assemblage, comprising the different developmental stages of the copepods Acartia longipatella, A. natalensis and Pseudodiaptomus hessei and the mysid Mesopodopsis wooldridgei, had intermediate ∂13C values ranging between −16 and −18‰. These values indicate a carbon source relatively depleted in carbon, most likely particulate organic matter derived mainly from the salt marsh and riparian vegetation. The second zooplankton assemblage, consisting of the caridean shrimp Palaemon peringueyi, the cumacean Iphinoe truncata and the amphipod Grandidierella lignorum, had ∂13C values (range −9 to −12‰) enriched in carbon. The most likely sources of carbon for these zooplankters were the eelgrass Zostera capensis, its associated epiphytes and/or Spartina maritima. The isotope compositions of the seven most abundant fish species were also divided into two groups. The first group, comprising Atherina breviceps and Gilchristella aestuaria, had isotope values ranging between −14 and −15‰, suggesting that they consume mainly zooplankton. The ∂13C values of the second group, comprising Rhabdosargus holubi, Liza richardsonii, L. dumerilii, Caffrogobius natalensis and C. gilchristi ranged between −11 and −12‰. These values suggest that these species assimilate a carbon source enriched in carbon derived either from eelgrass, Zostera capensis, its associated epiphytes or S. maritima. Results of the study suggest that there are two main carbon pathways for plankton and nekton in the Kariega estuary, carbon derived from the eelgrass and its associated epiphytes and carbon which has its origins in the salt marsh riparian vegetation and zooplankton.",

Human attitudes to the conservation of fishes and freshwaters have changed radically over the past 100 years. Three case histories illustrating the growth and development of conservation of freshwater fishes in southern Africa are presented. The Maloti minnow, discovered and described in 1938, was considered possibly extinct in the 1960s. Its rediscovery in high altitude streams in Lesotho and subsequent research on its biology and ecology established it as an icon of conservation for a nation whose development and well-being depends largely on its freshwater resources. The Clanwilliam yellowfish population has declined markedly over the past fifty years. Efforts to conserve the species illustrate the changing directions, frustrations and problems of riverine conservation in recent times. The illusions and problems of alien fish introductions provide a third dramatic example to illustrate the state of fish conservation at the end of the 20th Century.",

The present paper shows that transmission, as evidenced from presence of intermediate hosts, along open shorelines is occurring in the southern part of the Lake.

    "abstract": "Abstract Since the early 1990s the fishery of Lake Malombe, Malawi, has been dominated by haplochromine cichlids which are mainly harvested with a small-scale purse seine called an nkacha net. The annual landings from the fishery declined from 9 500 tons in 1990 to less than 4 000 tons in 2001. The catch rate, species- and size-selectivity of nkacha nets were assessed between April 2000 and March 2001. The catch per unit effort was 164.5 ± 8.4kg trip–1. While a total of 56 taxa were identified in the catch, five cichlid species, Copadichromis chrysonotus, Copadichromis virginalis, Lethrinops turneri, Otopharynx argyrosoma sp. 'red' and Otopharynx tetrastigma contributed more than 60% to the total catch composition by weight. Differences in the mean length-at-50%-selectivity (φ) into nkacha nets with mesh sizes ranging from 6mm to 19mm were marginal. For all five species, the length-at-50%-selectivity into the fishery was less than the length at maturity. Comparisons with previous work show that C. virginalis, L. turneri and O. argyrosoma sp. 'red' declined in abundance in nkacha net catches between 1991 and 2000. The fishery therefore tends towards both growth and recruitment overfishing.

Experiments with 1μm latex beads showed that Cyclidium, Halteria, Dysteria, Aspidisca and Vorticella are bacterivores. Examination of food vacuole contents showed that the ciliate communities also included herbivores, carnivores, omnivores and mixotrophs. While some herbivorous ciliates grazed picoplanktonic algae or flagellates, large omnivores such as Frontonia and Linostoma ingested cyanobacterial filaments or preyed on other ciliates. Most predaceous ciliates were haptorids, and consumed other ciliates or metazoa. Growth rate estimates for planktonic ciliate populations in East African lakes ranged from 0.18 to 6.56d−1. From these growth rates and biomass, the estimated production of ciliate populations ranged from 5.9 to 2 335μg carbon l−1 d−1 and increased with lake trophic status and water electrical conductivity. Bacterivores, herbivores, carnivores and mixotrophs accounted for 36%, 39%, 21% and 4% of total production, respectively, over all the lakes. Zooplankton were the probable consumers of much of this ciliate production, although some taxa were consumed mostly within the microzooplankton community, presumably by other ciliates.

Total Dissolved Salts and several individual chemical variables showed positive linear regression with distance from Aswan. The creation of the Aswan High Dam has reduced the ionic concentrations discharged to the Nile, but there is a gradual increase as the river flows though Egypt. Benthic macroinvertebrates show overall low taxon richness with taxa typical of a lowland riverine region. Changes in taxon richness appear to be influenced by either pollution and/or sedimentation. Sites downstream of the Kema Factory and downstream of organic discharge from Etsa Drain from Minia city show severe pollution. A Bray-Curtis Diversity Index shows these sites to be biodiversity outliers consistent with the negative impact of pollution. Examination of 95% outlying chemical values confirms gross pollution from these sites and the data as a whole suggest other sites that may also be affected by pollution. A contributor to high macroinvertebrate taxon richness appeared to be increased sedimentation, particularly in midstream samples. It is concluded that the low ionic concentrations resulting from the Aswan High Dam construction, localised pollution, and the occurrence of sediment are the main factors governing macroinvertebrate taxon richness. These factors will require careful monitoring, assessment and management if the biodiversity of the Nile is to be conserved. Keywords: BIODIVERSITYPOLLUTIONSEDIMENTATIONTAXON RICHNESSWATER QUALITY",

These are discussed in relation to sustainable management of the lagoons' fisheries for both human and waterbird use. With the exception of small pelagic foraging fish-eating birds, human fishing practices in the lagoons were in direct competition with crab- and fish-eating birds, because of the overlap of same-sized fish and crabs, and also in indirect competition because many of the exploited fish and crabs were immature. Fishing practices were also in direct competition with food foraging by invertebrate-eating birds. Intense exploitation of swimming crabs was linked to the use of drag nets, in comparison to the exclusive use of cast nets in some lagoons. In order to reduce the incidence of waterbird-human interactions and conflict during the energy-demanding phase of the birds' non-breeding season, it is recommended that the practice of closed seasons be extended to include crab fisheries and be strictly enforced at all Ramsar sites on the Ghanaian coast.",

This was deposited via a pipeline onto the adjacent beach and spilled into the swash zone. Current reversals in the near-shore environment resulted in transportation of some of the sediment to the south, rather than the north — as had been predicted by sediment-disposal models — and this has resulted in fine sediment intruding into the nearby Mhlathuze Estuary, a nationally important sanctuary area. Sediment intrusion and its impact on the beds of the seagrass Zostera capensis in the estuary were monitored from 1996 to 1999. Fine sediment did enter the estuary from the marine environment and was deposited mainly in its lower reaches, where its settling on the leaves of Zostera resulted in a major die-back. However, monitoring indicated that the Zostera recovered from this impact in under two years, following the washing out of sediment from the estuary. The bulk of the recovery emanated from plant material already in the system, but there were clear indications that recolonisation also took place.

Concentrations of Zn, Pb and Cu in surface soil samples declined with increasing distance down the slope away from the waste disposal site. Surface soil samples contained higher concentrations of Cu, Pb and Zn than soil samples collected at a depth of 15cm, suggesting that there may have been surface movement of trace metals away from the disposal site.

The hierarchical structure of the classifications provides scope for finer resolution, by the addition of further levels, for application at a sub-regional or municipal scale. The proposed classifications include 74 river and 16 wetland types. River typing incorporating a classification based on intra-annual flow patterns from 40 gauging weirs could not be accurately represented spatially.

Because of its potential as an aquaculture species it has been widely used in aquaculture ventures in South Africa, specifically a stock known as Dutch catfish, a domesticated strain developed in the Netherlands. Mitochondrial DNA markers indicate that this stock is genetically distinct from the natural populations of C. gariepinus in South Africa. It could potentially pose a threat to South Africa's natural biodiversity if these fish were to escape from aquaculture farms, or was deliberately introduced into inland waters.

    "abstract": "The history of South African estuarine ichthyology from 1910–2010 is reviewed. The first survey of fishes in a South African estuary was undertaken by Gilchrist in the early 1900s, followed by an extended period between the two world wars when little or no work was conducted in South African estuaries. In the 1940s and 1950s a series of surveys initiated by Day documented the fishes in a range of estuaries in KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape, but little detailed biological information was collected. The estuarine surveys of the 1950s and 1960s were superseded by autecological and synecological studies in the 1970s and 1980s which yielded descriptive and process-orientated information on a wide variety of fish species, including the larval stages of many taxa. This approach continued during the 1990s with publications dealing increasingly with the response of fish assemblages to declining freshwater inflows, the consequences of growing angling pressures on fish populations, and the increasing anthropogenic perturbations that necessitated the development of fish and estuarine health indices. In the late 1990s the impact of climate change on estuary-associated fishes became increasingly apparent and much research is currently focused around this topic. A number of projects have been activated at the subtropical/warm temperate and warm temperate/cool temperate transition zones in South Africa. However, baseline studies are urgently required to document changes in the tropical/subtropical transition zone in Mozambique and in the warm temperate/subtropical and subtropical/tropical zones in Angola so as to improve our understanding of the impact of climate change on estuary-associated fish species in Africa. Innovative methods, incorporating the use of biomarkers, otolith microchemistry, population genetics, acoustic telemetry, underwater videography and high-resolution sonic recordings, are opening up opportunities to test new hypotheses relating to estuarine fish ecology on the subcontinent.",

The body size class distributions of a mayfly, Cloeon (Ephemeroptera: Baetidae), and the damselfly family, Coenagrionidae, were also assessed with respect to variation in vegetation density. Macroinvertebrates were sampled from low-, moderate- and high-density beds of L. ilicifolius. There were no significant differences in individual taxon and total macroinvertebrate abundances, macroinvertebrate richness and diversity with respect to vegetation density. In all three density categories the functional feeding group (FFG) composition was dominated by collector-gatherers and collector-filterers. The abundance of the two FFGs did not change significantly within each, as well as among, the three vegetation-density categories (ANOVA, p > 0.05). The largest size class of Cloeon occurred only in high-density beds, whereas the largest coenagrionid individuals were obtained from low- and moderate-density beds and were absent from high-density beds. The results suggest that variation in the density of Lagarosiphon does not affect epiphytic macroinvertebrate community structure, but does affect body-size distributions of macroinvertebrate taxa, probably by affecting predator-prey interactions.",

The water in all wetlands was well mixed with no thermal stratification at the time of sampling. Soluble reactive phosphorus levels corresponded to the eutrophic to hypertrophic category. Only Voëlvlei showed very high microalgal chlorophyll a levels (>400 μg l–1) due to the dominance of cyanobacteria. In the other wetlands, flagellates, chlorophytes and diatoms were the main microalgal groups. A high rainfall event in July–August 2007 considerably altered the phytoplankton community structure in Voëlvlei when cyanobacteria were completely replaced by chlorophytes. During August and November 2007 phytoplankton biomass was low in all the wetlands, and eutrophication signs were observed only in Voëlvlei. However, dense stands of both submerged and emergent macrophytes were present in two of the wetlands, the decomposition of which could lead to water quality changes. Voëlvlei had only large stands of emergent macrophytes (Phragmites and Schoenoplectus). Keywords:: biomasscommunitycyanobacteriadiatomsmicroalgae",

A total of 188 birds of 13 species were recorded, of which six were wading piscivores, four aerial divers and three were pursuit swimmers. The Reed Cormorant (Phalacrocorax africanus) was the numerically dominant species, with a mean of 8.25 (SD ± 7.90) individuals per count. Mean numbers of the Pied Kingfisher (Ceryle rudis) and Giant Kingfisher (Megaceryle maximus) were 3.42 (SD ± 1.20) and 1.17 (SD ± 0.60) individuals per count, respectively. The remaining 10 species revealed mean values <0.5 individuals per count. Breaching events were associated with a change in feeding groups from waders to pursuit feeders, and a decrease in total bird numbers, most likely due to loss of potential littoral zone foraging habitat for waders resulting from reduced water levels. The highest bird numbers were recorded in winter reflecting the migration of large numbers of Reed Cormorant into the system. Monthly food consumption by all piscivorous birds showed large temporal variability, ranging from 26.35 to 140.58 kg per month.",

Sarscypridopsis aculeata and Sarscypridopsis glabrata were the dominant ostracod species in coastal ponds and lakes.

This note examines the issue further, pointing out that both lack the host-specificity requirement to be a successful biological control agent. The catfish Clarias gariepinus is an omnivore and snails form only a small proportion of its diet; there is no evidence to suggest that it controls snail populations anywhere in Africa. The same applies to other species that have been proposed as biological control agents. Simple laboratory experiments are not an adequate guide to the efficiency of an animal as a biological control agent and detailed ecological investigations would usually demonstrate that few African fish species have this capability.",

Thus, effective conservation management is required urgently. The aim of this study was to investigate the spatio-temporal distribution and size structure of O. niloticus populations in Lake Tana in order to evaluation conditions to promote sustainable exploitation. Data were collected monthly at three sites on the lake from April 2016 to March 2017. The size at first maturity was computed using logistic regression. The catch per unit effort (CPUE) of O. niloticus in Lake Tana has sharply declined from 75 kg trip−1 in 2001 to 24 kg trip−1 in 2016/2017. The mean CPUE values between sites and seasons were significantly different. The size at first maturity for O. niloticus was 21 cm in 2016/2017. Of the catches taken, more than 24% of those were motorised and reed boat fisheries and 46% of the chase-and-trap fishery catches were below the size at first maturity in 2016/2017. Additionally, large size specimens were rarely recorded. Widening the mesh size of the gillnets would give a chance for immature fish to spawn at least once. Considering the fish size distribution and social context of the fishers, limiting mesh size could be a more feasible management option than a closed season.",

Seven indicator PCBs were identified in sediments, and five were identified in water. The PCBs loading ranged from lower than the limit of detection (LOD) to 10.28 µg kg−1 DW and 0.95 to 2.24 µg l−1 in sediments and water, respectively. PCBs, CB 138 and CB 153 dominated the load, because of their chemical stability and high degree of chlorination. In addition, ten OCPs were identified in sediments, and seven OCPs were identified in water. The levels of organochlorine compounds in sediments were higher than in water samples, implying that sediments may serve as a sink for these compounds. The presence of these compounds is probably as a result of either historical use, long-range environmental transport or environmental persistence. The levels of organochlorine compounds in the lake water and sediments are below the maximum residue limit set by EU and FAO, except for aldrin and dieldrin. Based on the Threshold Effect Concentration (TEC) for freshwater ecosystems, aldrin and dieldrin are the only OCPs that seem to be a threat to the lake environment.",

Cyanophytes were abundant and were the major diet component of fish in both habitats. Chlorophytes were selected by pond fish.

Astrionella sp., Aulacoseira nyassensis, Navicula sp. and Rhopalodia vermicularis (bacillariophytes) were the species most selected by lake fish, whereas Ankistrodesmus falcatus (chlorophyte), Lyngbya circumcreta (cyanophyte) and Nitzschia acicularis (bacillariophyte) were the species most selected by pond fish. These results suggest that Nile tilapia is a selective feeder.

Herbivores were largely absent in summer, when submerged macrophyte cover was zero. There was a significant difference in activity patterns between summer and winter for all feeding guilds except aerial diving piscivores. Most birds probably overnighted elsewhere. Pursuit-swimming piscivore numbers increased and wading and aerial-diving piscivores decreased with rising water levels. This study showed that intermittently-open estuaries are primarily utilised by resident piscivorous birds and are an important habitat, not only for feeding, but also for resting purposes.

Five dosage levels, 0, 100, 200, 300 and 400 mg l–1, of M. oleifera seed powder were applied to aquadams® (high-density polyethylene plastic fishponds) fertilised with chicken manure in a completely randomised design and replicated twice. Bicarbonate alkalinity and potassium increased with increasing M. oleifera dosages, whilst turbidity decreased. Dissolved oxygen was significantly higher in all M. oleifera treatments than in the control. Hepatic cord disarray, nuclei pleomorphism and cellular swelling were evident in the liver as the M. oleifera dosage increased. The testis histology showed degenerating sperm cells and atrophied seminiferous tubules in the 300 and 400 mg l–1 treatments. The degree of histological alterations of the gills increased at dosages of 300 and 400 mg l–1. There were significant differences in the white and red blood cell counts, haemoglobin and haematocrit, and in the mean corpuscular concentration, haemoglobin and volume, between the different treatments. Fish growth decreased with increasing dosage. The histological and haematological parameters indicated that fish health was compromised at the highest dosage, leading to slow fish growth at the higher dosages.",

The aim of this study was to determine the current status of an artificial fish community in a small reservoir that does not normally overflow and to assess how the fish have adapted to this environment. Eight species belonging to five families were collected from the reservoir. The cichlids Oreochromis mossambicus, O. macrochir, O. placidus and Tilapia rendalli made up 46% by number of the sample, the cyprinid Labeo altivelis made up 40% of the sample, and T. rendalli, the least numerous species, made up 0.2% of the sample. The population of T. rendalli seemed to be depleted, whereas largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, which were formerly numerous, appeared to be absent. Oreochromis placidus bred throughout the study period, whereas Clarias gariepinus, Hydrocynus vittatus, L. altivelis, O. macrochir and O. mossambicus showed an apparent lack of recruitment between July and August 2011. The growth performances of C. gariepinus, O. mossambicus, O. macrochir and O. placidus were assessed by means of the growth performance index (φ′) with values ranging from 3.10 to 3.41. The rates of total mortality (Z) were estimated for four species; the highest rate was 5.64 for O. placidus and the lowest was 1.17 for C. gariepinus.",

The analytical data were treated using multivariate principal component analysis. In neutral and polar lipids palmitic acid (16:0) and stearic acid (18:0) were the dominant saturated fatty acids. The polyunsaturated fatty acids in the polar lipid fraction ranged from 33% to 56% and in the neutral lipid fraction from 23% to 30%, dominated by arachidonic acid (20:4n6) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n3). The amount of cholesterol in the neutral fraction was 57–89 mg g−1 lipid. The amount of plasmalogen was 12–27 mg g−1 and 14–37 mg g−1 lipid in the polar fraction and total lipid, respectively. In the principal component plots, the fish species from the two lakes were distinguished by fatty acid profiles in neutral, polar and total lipid from the heart tissue. However, polar lipid fractions were better markers of fish species and populations than the neutral fraction and total lipids. Heart tissues have low lipid levels dominated by polar lipids (phospholipids), with polyunsaturated fatty acids as the principal components. The dominance of genetically controlled phospholipids in the heart tissue makes heart tissue most suitable for differentiating between species and populations.",

Species found in the upstream sections of the river included indicators of good water quality, but the quality deteriorated downstream with peaks in algal abundance being ascribed to peaks in nutrient concentrations. Cyanobacteria and euglenoids were present in the upper and middle reaches of the river, but were absent downstream. Dinoflagellates became more important downstream, especially in the estuary. Dominant species, reaching high concentrations along the river, included Nitzschia frustulum, Nitzschia capitellata, Carteria klebsii, Chlorella vulgaris and Anabaena species. The presence of the diatom Eolimna comperei is a first record of its occurrence in South Africa. The Sundays River can be described as a brackish, hard water system with high nutrient concentrations in certain sections. The most important contributors to high nutrient concentrations were point sources in the vicinity of towns along the river banks, as well as diffuse sources contributing to high nitrogen concentrations in the fertile Sundays River valley. Increasing salinities were due to pollution, evaporation and agricultural activities in the valley.",

    "abstract": "Pertinent questions remain on whether small, artificial wetlands, such as abandoned quarries play any ecological or socio-economic role in the environment. To increase information on roles played by small-sized artificial wetlands in the environment, an assessment study was carried out in the Lily Wetland, an abandoned flooded quarry in Karura forest in Nairobi City, Kenya. This study was guided by the idea that artificial wetlands can develop over time to acquire ecological characteristics similar to those of natural wetlands. Ecological information was collected on water physico-chemical characteristics, vegetation, birds and macroinvertebrates, whereas questionnaires were administered to assess recreational and educational values of the Lily Wetland. Inspection of Google Earth maps showed that the pond has not dried in the past fifteen years, with its area remaining relatively constant between dry (0.29 ± 0.03 ha) and wet (0.36 ± 0.06 ha) seasons. Water quality of the wetland was good: pH of 7.5–7.8; dissolved oxygen = 8.73 ± 0.43 mg l−1; and clarity (Secchi disk reading) = 24.00 ± 0.43 cm. The biological component included 12 wetland plant species, 11 aquatic macroinvertebrate taxa, four species of wetland birds, and viable populations of fish and frogs. An assessment of the recreational and educational importance of the Lily Wetland, based on 34 respondents showed that 24 of the respondents visited Karura forest for recreational purposes, whereas 10 were there for educational purposes. Further analyses between the different benefits showed that the value of the forest, walking trails and wetland were significantly ranked important, when compared with the value placed on playing in fields and visiting the restaurants. Specifically, the Lily Wetland was regarded as important, because of its scenery, nature and recreational attributes. This study concluded that the Lily Wetland and other small wetlands in the urban environments have potential for recreational and educational use as in situ laboratories and demonstration centers, where benefits of conserving urban biodiversity can be communicated.",

For the first time since 1969, the Gamtoos Estuary mouth closed in June 2018, because of extensive drought conditions and freshwater abstraction. Accordingly, physico-chemical gradients, microalgal biomass and species composition were sampled during low (closed mouth), normal (open mouth) and high (breaching event) flow conditions. The closed phase was characterised by polyhaline and homogenous salinity structures and a rapid shift towards eutrophic conditions, as evidenced by bottom water hypoxia (<2 mg l−1), elevated phytoplankton (>20 μg l−1) and microphytobenthos (>100 mg m−2) biomass, and proliferation of a harmful algal bloom (HAB) species (Prorocentrum cordatum, Dinophyceae). An artificial breaching event in September 2018 restored connectivity with the marine environment and within a month re-established the usual physico-chemical gradients that characterise the open phase. Although the current study demonstrates ecosystem recovery from stochastic events, it also highlights the potential impact (e.g. HABs, hypoxia) of shifting an estuary into a new stable state. This is a concern given that mouth closure events in South African estuaries are likely to increase in the future in response to global change pressures.",

The contrasting land covers generated different runoff volumes, nutrient concentrations and associated loads. The indigenous forest demonstrated the lowest runoff volumes, the highest TN concentrations, but the lowest cumulative TN loads over the study period. Agriculture and alien Acacia mearnsii trees had the greatest impact on nutrient loads. The highest nutrient loads were recorded from the pastures (TN: 84.8 g m−2; NH4+-N: 38.3 g m−2) and the alien invaded degraded riparian zone (TN: 100.7 g m−2; NH4+-N: 55.6 g m−2). The nutrient loading was dependent on land cover, land use, rainfall amount and intensity and the associated surface runoff and a decreasing trend in nutrient concentrations was observed from the pastures to the riparian zones and to the river at all sites.",

While cyanobacteria were the dominant group at all sites (50−70%), relative abundances of Bacillariophyceae and Chlorophyceae was considerable. The most abundant phytoplankton species were Microcystis aeruginosa and Aulacoseira granulata, whose abundances ranged from 3 200−28 800 ind. l−1 and 1 640−3 146 ind. l−1, respectively. Phytoplankton species richness in the reservoir ranged from 9 to 20, with the highest species richness in the north-eastern region of the reservoir. Zooplankton density was <1 ind. l−1 and after seven months since impoundment, the zooplankton community had not fully established. Twenty zooplankton species comprising of Rotifera, Copepoda and Cladocera were recorded. Cladocera, mainly Diaphanosoma excisum and Ceriodaphnia cornuta, were the most abundant followed by copepods, mainly Thermoclops sp. and Eodiaptomus japonicas. The dominance of Microcystis aeruginosa presents potential future challenges to water quality management, because increased nutrient loading can favour it, resulting in similar challenges being experienced in Lake Chivero. The establishment of an Integrated Lake Basin Management is strongly recommended to avert this.",

SOC content, density and storage potential were determined under three different dominant vegetation communities: Cyperus papyrus L., Typha latifolia L. and Phragmites mauritianus Kunth. SOC content (123.7 ± 2.6 SE g C kg−1 dry soil) in C. papyrus was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in both T. latifolia and P. mauritianus, whereas SOC density (kg C m−2) insignificantly varied (p > 0.05) among the three vegetation communities (C. papyrus = 7.2 ± 0.1, T. latifolia = 6.7 ± 0.1 and P. mauritianus = 6.2 ± 0.1). Similarly, for the entire sampled soil depth (0–50 cm), SOC storage potential was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in C. papyrus (36 118.08 ± 552.52 t C km−2), and was in the order of decreasing magnitude: C. papyrus > T. latifolia > P. mauritianus. Plant biomass density, and soil physico-chemical characteristics, bulk density, salinity, pH and temperature were significantly correlated (p < 0.05) with SOC. In conclusion, where climate change mitigation is considered as a wetland ecosystem service, restoration priorities for degraded/lost tropical freshwater wetlands need to consider C. papyrus plants. In addition, comparing SOC storage by ecosystems, Uganda’s wetlands contain three times more SOC than is contained in the country’s forests.",

Twenty-seven macrophyte species were recorded from the six wetlands. Macrophyte diversity and density were significantly higher at the least impaired sites. The densities of Floscopa glomerata, Ceratophylum muricatum, Hygrophila asteracanthoides, Hydrocotyle ranunculoides and Echinochloa species were positively associated with ammonium and biological oxygen demand, whereas those of Salix subserrata, Persicaria attenuata, P. strigosa, P. glabra, Cyperus papyrus, C. fischerianus, C. macrostachyos, Ipomoea aquatica and Ludwigia abyssinica were positively associated with depth and salinity, and negatively correlated with nitrate, phosphate, total dissolved solids and electrical conductivity.

The naturalising population near Wolseley, Western Cape, was discovered in May 2009 and is confined to a mountain seep. Given that the Wolseley infestation is restricted to only 0.28 ha, extirpation seemed feasible, and a monitoring system was devised to record population characteristics and response to control measures. Suppression of seedling recruitment and reduction in the number of coppicing stems over a six-year period (2009-2014) suggest that it will be possible to extirpate M. quinquenervia from the Wolseley site.

Schistosoma parasites are transmitted between the snail intermediate hosts and mammalian definitive hosts in an aquatic environment. This host-environment link determines the parasite transmission dynamics and is a route through which control of transmission can be achieved. Transmission control methods based on manipulating the host-environment link were reviewed, the limitations of each method were highlighted and conditions in which they may be used in small-scale control programmes in sub-Saharan Africa were suggested. Chemical control may be ideal in poor rural communities, where health education strategies have little impact and where fishing is not an important livelihood strategy, because human contact with contaminated water is necessary for parasite survival. In aquaculture and other water development project areas, biocontrol may yield positive results due to reduced predation on snail predators and competitors as a result of restricted access. Environmental modification may be ideal in man-made systems, where the planning phase includes appropriate engineering works. Control strategies must be based as much on the ecology of host snails as on social aspects of the affected community, and be implemented on a case-by-case basis.",

The rivers have similar climate and land-use characteristics but differ in the frequency and intensity of human and animal disturbance of their sediment surfaces. Benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled during both low discharge, when the disturbances were high, and high discharge, when the disturbances were low. Macroinvertebrate abundance and diversity were higher in the Ellegirini than in the Njoro River. Sites characterised by high disturbance had low macroinvertebrate abundance and diversity, and were dominated by one taxon that tolerated disturbance irrespective of flow regimes. A consistent decline in macroinvertebrate abundance and diversity in the Njoro River as a result of increased disturbance was evident in 2001–2002 and 2012. Macroinvertebrates are most probably redistributed via migration and dispersal, due to these physical disturbances.",

While dose-response relationships have been developed for fish, there are limited comparative data available on aquatic insects that respire either with tracheal gills or with a plastron – a thin layer of air trapped by hairs on the exterior of the body. This study assesses the temperature-dependent toxicity of rotenone to gill-respiring aquatic insects, family Coenagrionidae, and plastron-respiring aquatic insects, family Corixidae, at concentrations that are lethal to Mozambique tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus. Both groups of insects were found to be differentially susceptible to rotenone, with survival decreasing as functions of both increased concentration and temperature. The dose-response relationship of Mozambique tilapia was found to be similar to that of other fishes, with 100% mortality achieved at 0.025 mg l-1 at both 20 °C and 28 °C. At this concentration, mortality in gill-respiring insects after 48 h was 10% at 20 °C and 28% at 28 °C, which was higher than that of plastron-respiring insects, being 2% and 7% at the same temperatures. At higher concentrations (0.05–0.10 mg l-1), however, mortality of both gill- (>50%) and plastron-respiring (>10%) insects became substantial.Keywords: dose-response curvesinvasive fishOreochromis mossambicuspiscicide",

The catchment area is characterised by agricultural, mining and industrial activities, which potentially contribute to the river's deteriorating water quality and poor in-stream habitat conditions. Agricultural activities comprise the predominant land use, causing major nutrient input into the Wilge River, resulting in eutrophic conditions. Thus it was expected that the functional feeding group (FFG) scraper/grazer populations would be the most abundant as they consume algae, but this was not the case. The primary FFGs present were predators and gathering collector populations, whilst shredders were the least abundant. The primary drivers responsible for separating the monitoring sites and their aquatic macroinvertebrate communities were differing in situ water quality, season and habitat availability. Therefore, land use was not a driving variable, probably owing to limited organic and inorganic water quality data.",

Twenty-four radio telemetry monitoring surveys produced 2 304 diel tracks. At night, yellowfish displayed a preference for slow shallow (<0.3 m s−1, <0.5 m) and fast shallow habitats (>0.3 m s−1, <0.3 m), whereas by day they avoided these habitats, preferring fast deep areas (>0.3 m s−1, >0.3 m). The average total distance of 272 m moved per 24-hour period was three times greater than the diel range, and the average maximum displacement per minute was significantly higher in daytime (4 m) than at night (1.5 m). These findings suggest that L. aeneus is active primarily during the day in fast-flowing, deeper waters, and relatively inactive at night, when it occupies shallower habitats. This behaviour should be further explored to identify causal mechanisms underlying the diel habitat shifts in this species such as water temperature, foraging tactics and/or predator avoidance.",

High levels of nitrates, as well as the organochlorine pesticides aldrin, dieldrin, chlordane and methoxychlor, were found in the water. Fish muscle tissue contained pesticides, including methoxychlor. A semi-quantitative histological assessment on Clarias gariepinus, Coptodon rendalli and Oreochromis mossambicus showed diverse histopathology in selected target organs, with the gills being most affected. Notably, the testis tissue of one C. rendalli was filled with eosinophilic liquid, characteristic of necrosis. Microscopic intersex was found in two of the nine O. mossambicus sampled. This is the second time that intersex as microscopic testicular oocytes has been reported in O. mossambicus in South Africa. This finding perhaps indicates that reproduction may be compromised and this will be investigated further. The presence of intersex and other histopathology in organs could be early warning signs of the declining water quality in this dam.",

The ability of this population to persist in a dam with low algal biomass (median annual suspended chlorophyll a = 0.08 µg l−1), and limited access to rivers considered large enough for successful spawning, has implications for their invasive potential in other systems. Stomach content and stable isotope analysis were used to assess the trophic ecology of H. molitrix, which was then compared with indigenous Mozambique tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus, on a seasonal basis during 2011. Hypophthalmichthys molitrix are generalist filter feeders, with a diet consisting primarily of sediment, vegetative detritus, dinoflagellates and diatoms. The dominance of sediments in their stomachs suggests occasional benthic scavenging. However, H. molitrix occupied a higher trophic level (TL = 2.8) than expected, suggesting that this population subsidised their diet with an unidentified dietary constituent, characterised by enriched nitrogen values. Although the stomach contents indicated dietary overlap between H. molitrix and O. mossambicus, stable isotopes revealed fine-scale resource partitioning, despite both species occupying the same trophic level. Nonetheless, the persistence of this feral H. molitrix population in an oligotrophic impoundment highlights their phenotypic plasticity.",

However, there is a lack of less sophisticated methods, such as biotic scoring, to assess the health of rivers in West Africa. To bridge this gap, we have developed a macroinvertebrate-based scoring system for monitoring the health of rivers in the Sahelian regions. We adopted a multi-habitat sampling approach to collect macroinvertebrates using hand nets, and these specimens were identified mostly to family taxonomic level using keys. We recorded more than 75 taxa of macroinvertebrates, each assigned relative sensitivity scores to human disturbances ranging from 1 (very tolerant) to 10 (highly sensitive). The Burkina Biotic Score System (BBIOSS) and the Average Score Per Taxa (ASPT) demonstrated a strong and significant correlation with environmental variables, including anthropogenic pressures types (r = 0.6; p < 0.01) making it a robust tool for monitoring rivers. Here, our findings revealed that all taxa scored are expected to be those reported in Western African freshwater. This study has produced an effective tool that can be used or adapted to monitor other riverine ecosystems in West Africa, potentially contributing to the preservation of water and biological resources.Keywords: biotic indicesbioassessmentecological integrityriversWest Africa",

They have played a significant role in the growth of African human civilisations and cultural development, and today contribute billions of US dollars' worth of ecosystem services to the people of Ethiopia. Ethiopia exhibits both natural and man-made wetland types that cover up to 2% of its land surface. They are, however, under threat from excessive pressures that are both ecologically and socially driven. The objective of this study was to analyse the state of ecosystem services provision of the Ethiopian wetlands, with a novel application of Ostrom's Socio-ecological Systems Framework (SESF), taking Boyo Wetland as a case study. Household surveys, focus group discussions and stakeholder analysis methods were applied to satisfy the data needs of SESF. Insufficient knowledge of actors on wetland ecosystem services, weak governance and limited self-organisation among actors are highlighted as the major reasons contributing to the unsustainable use of wetlands. When the use of Boyo Wetland's ecosystem services was evaluated using the SESF, it was evident that unsustainable resource use practices are widespread. These findings could be used to inform national policy on wetlands and local strategies for the sustainable use of wetland resources by direct or indirect users at different levels.Keywords: actorecosystemgovernance systemresource systemresource units",

In this study, an appraisement of the quality status of groundwater from some areas within Enugu was conducted. Physicochemical characteristics of groundwater sampled from 15 boreholes that supply domestic water to Aninri, Awgu, Ezeagu, Udi and Oji River Areas of Enugu, Nigeria, were determined. A total of 45 water samples were obtained across both rainy and dry seasons. Standard methods were used to determine the physicochemical parameters and trace metals. The physicochemical results showed values within the WHO safe limits, except sulphate (1670 ± 21.5 mg L−1) in Mpu water samples, and high chloride levels in Ndeaboh and Mpu (18088 ± 29.4 and 1095 ± 23.9 mg L−1 for dry and rainy seasons, respectively). The pH values were predominantly slightly acidic, ranging from 5 to 8.2. Groundwater within Ukaete, Ndeaboh, Oduma and Amankpunato had very high levels of electrical conductivity (2897.80 ± 173.38, 31000 ± 45.9, 1672 ± 9.3 and 1222 ± 8.1) in the dry season, respectively; and 1665.06 ± 326.6, 5410 ± 2.4, 4860 ± 9.4, 1872 ± 19.3 in the rainy season, respectively. The higher chloride values observed, possibly due to a geogenic origin, could also be responsible for the higher values of the electrical conductivity. There were traces of copper and lead in the samples during the dry season; however, lead was not detected in most borehole water samples during the wet season. Fe was the only metal that recorded values above the WHO standard. Traces of copper in the samples may have resulted from corrosion in the copper pipelines, reservoirs or other metallic fittings used in the construction of the boreholes. The water quality index (WQI) of the borehole water examined was above 100 in all except Ogugu Awgu samples, indicating that borehole water was generally not potable and therefore unsuitable for domestic application or drinking. The observed results revealed that the groundwaters from the study area were contaminated with chloride and lead, causing the water parameters to be above standard limits. Lead at any concentration is deemed toxic according to USEPA. There is a need to treat borehole water supplies in the area before its application for domestic use.Keywords: borehole waterschloride contentelectrical conductivitypotable watertrace metal",

    "abstract": "Water column profiles, surface macronutrient concentrations, size fractionated primary production and grazing by protozooplankton were investigated at 8 stations in the Kariega and Great Fish River estuaries in autumn (May) 1999. As a result of the low freshwater influx, the Kariega estuary was characterised by a well-mixed water column, low macronutrient concentrations and low turbidity (NTU <35). In contrast, the water column in the Great Fish River estuary was stratified largely as a result of sustained freshwater influx. Associated with the high freshwater input, its macronutrient concentrations and turbidity values (NTU >240) were elevated. Size fractionated chlorophyll-a and primary production in the Kariega estuary ranged from 1.50 to 3.39mg.Chl-a.m−2 and between 171.10 and 234.45mg.C.m−2d−1 respectively. Throughout the survey picophytoplankton (<2.0μm) dominated chlorophyll-a biomass and production, which can be related to low macronutrient concentrations. In the Great Fish River estuary total integrated biomass and production were higher, varying between 3.42 and 4.79mg.Chl-a.m−2 and between 222.87 and 284.63mg.C.m−2d−1. The elevated production recorded in the Great Fish River estuary appears to be related to increased macronutrient concentrations associated with the freshwater input. Despite high nutrient availability, total integrated biomass and production were dominated by nanophytoplankton (2–20μm). The predominance of small cells appears to be related to the unfavorable light environment conferred by the high turbidity. Protozooplankton densities in the Kariega estuary ranged from 2 570 to 3 150 cells.I−1 and between 7 250 and 7 830 cells.I−1 in the Great Fish River estuary. Protozooplankton grazing on phytoplankton in the two systems was similar, corresponding to <10% of the initial standing stock or <55% of the daily phytoplankton production. The high grazing impact in the contrasting estuaries can be related to size structure of the phytoplankton assemblages.",

These issues are discussed in relation to information and decision-making requirements for ecosystem management. Probable causes of change in the distribution of wetland plants in the Wilderness Lakes include the natural tendency of plants to colonise new areas, as well as anthropogenic manipulation of physical, chemical and biological processes, including the cessation of disturbance by large herbivores, water-level stabilisation, changes in soil salinity and the accumulation of plant litter within wetland areas.

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine the effect of sublethal copper and zinc concentrations at a neutral and an acidic pH, on selected haematological parameters as well as on the total osmolality and electrolyte concentrations of Oreochromis mossambicus. In general, at neutral pH copper and zinc caused blood acidosis, increases in circulating white blood cell numbers, causing stimulation of the immune system, and a rapid release of red blood cells from haemopoietic tissue, as reflected in the decreases in mean corpuscular volume. Increases in red blood cells are attributed to an increase in the oxygen-carrying haemoglobin as an adaptation to altered respiratory homeostasis caused by copper and zinc. These increases are therefore a secondary reaction to the metals and not the result of direct stimulation of the haemopoietic tissue. In contrast, at an acidic pH copper and zinc concentrations usually caused blood alkalosis and decreases in white blood cell numbers, due to the bioconcentration of metals which blocks and suppresses the leucopoietic tissue. Decreases were also recorded in red blood cell counts, haemoglobin, haematocrit and mean corpuscular volume, which can be ascribed to anaemic and hypoxic conditions, gill damage and impaired osmoregulation.",

    "abstract": "A number of studies have used stable carbon isotopes to analyse aspects of the food web structure in South African estuaries but none has compared mangrove and non-mangrove estuarine food webs. This study compares the primary carbon sources utilised by the ichthyofauna in the Mngazana (with extensive mangroves) and Mngazi (without mangroves) estuaries. In contrast to the Kariega Estuary, where past research identified two basic carbon pathways, there were no clear carbon pathways within the Mngazi and Mngazana fish assemblages. Instead, the carbon isotopic values of fishes in both estuaries displayed a continuum rather than a tight clustering around particular energy sources. Most detritus feeders of the family Mugilidae from both estuaries were relatively more enriched (with carbon isotopic values ranging from −16.9% to −12.3%) than other fish taxa. The isotopic values of the mullet species suggest a diet derived from relatively enriched carbon sources such as benthic microalgae, the eelgrass Zostera and associated epiphytes. Based on the isotopic values, piscivorous fishes from both estuaries could not be linked to specific prey fish taxa, but clearly the mullet species were not their main food source. The invertebrate feeders that were common to both estuaries showed greater isotopic variations in the Mngazana Estuary (−24.7% to −19.3%) than in the Mngazi Estuary (−21.9% to −18.4%), probably reflecting the higher diversity of habitats and invertebrate prey items in the Mngazana system. Generally, the isotopic signatures of fishes from the Mngazi Estuary were more enriched than those from the Mngazana Estuary, thus indicating the possible effect of δ13C-depleted mangrove-derived carbon in the latter system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The macrobenthic invertebrates of a canal, created from a tributary of the Warri River in the mangrove swamp of the Niger Delta, Nigeria, were studied before and after dredging. In the canal dredging resulted in at least a 93% decrease in the benthic population while the Margalef's diversity index reduced from 3.8 to 1.4. Of the 15 species identified during the pre-dredging studies, only Nereis operta and Baetis sp. were recovered after dredging. The site 500m downstream of the canal was also slightly impacted, showing a 31% decrease in population. We conclude that the drastic reduction of benthic species is due to the direct destruction of benthic species, larvae and habitat, as well as settling turbidity plumes, reduction of sediment nutrients, physical disturbance and, physiological and toxic stress. To conserve biodiversity it is recommended that mitigation measures should be put in place by stakeholders involved in dredging and that long-term monitoring of dredged canals is carried out to ensure that these measures are effectively implemented.

Four reference wetlands and three dairy-effluent impacted wetlands were sampled. Six macroinvertebrate samples were collected with a SASS net from each wetland. For each sample, the macroinvertebrates were identified and assigned a predetermined SASS5 tolerance score. Data for selected physico-chemical variables, macrohabitat condition, biotope suitability and organism detectability were collected to assist in interpretation of results. Thirty-eight taxa, identified to family level, were collected during sampling. Total SASS5 scores ranged from 15 to 82. Five of the wetlands had mean SASS5 scores of between 46 and 59. Five of the wetlands had an intra-wetland SASS5 score range of greater than 30. Average score per taxa (ASPT) values ranged from 3.3 to 5.5, and few high scoring (≥ 8) taxa were collected. There was no significant difference in SASS5 scores between samples collected above, at, and downstream of, an effluent discharge point within the same impacted wetland. SASS5 scores for reference wetlands were also not significantly higher than those recorded for impacted wetlands. Comparison of ranked SASS5 scores and environmental data did suggest a relationship between the variables, but this was not significant. Based on the SASS5 score water quality guidelines, all sampled wetlands were considered to have impacted water quality. However, this was not supported by the macrohabitat and physico-chemical results. There are a number of possible reasons for the low SASS5 scores: the lack of biotopes present in wetlands compared to rivers (most notably the absence of the stones-in-current biotope), lower levels of dissolved oxygen present compared to rivers, limited habitat availability due to low rainfall during the sampling season, and the limited detectability of organisms due to large amounts of substrate in the samples. Without modification, SASS5 appears unsuitable for assessing wetlands. However, variation in taxon composition — within impacted wetlands and between reference and impacted wetlands, revealed through multivariate analysis — suggests that macroinvertebrates are responsive to changes in wetland condition, and thus show potential as indicators of wetland water quality. It is recommended that a habitat or biotope index be further developed and used in conjunction with any future wetland macroinvertebrate bioassessment protocols.",

In order of importance, the diet of catfish in Kat River Reservoir consisted of fish, insects, zooplankton, plant material and other items, while the diet of catfish in Laing Reservoir consisted of fish, plant material, zooplankton, other vertebrates and insects. The diets of catfish in the two reservoirs had a similarity index of 68.1% and there was no significant difference in their nutritional value. Fish prey was the most important dietary component in both reservoirs. Temperature regime and zooplankton and zoobenthos density were similar in both systems. However, fish prey density was significantly higher in the eutrophic Laing Reservoir and catfish grew significantly faster in that system. The slower growth rate in Kat River Reservoir was attributed to the higher energy costs associated with the capture of fish prey, which was less abundant than in Laing Reservoir. Trophic status therefore had an indirect effect on catfish growth by influencing the availability of fish prey.

During the autumn, zooplankton in Small Bitter Lake were more abundant and different in composition, when compared with zooplankton populations in Great Bitter Lake. The high abundance of copepods in Small Bitter Lake occurred under conditions of elevated salinity, whereas lower salinity allowed rotifers and other freshwater forms to flourish near the outlet of a canal carrying urban waste.

Samples were collected during March, after the rainy season when the estuary mouth was open, and during August, after the low-rainfall winter months when the mouth was closed. The estuarine calanoid copepods Pseudodiaptomus stuhlmanni and Acartia natalensis were numerically dominant, making up 75% of the total number of mesozooplankton recorded. Relatively high abundances were recorded for these copepods, with P. stuhlmanni reaching peak densities of 79 000 individuals m−3. In the low-salinity regions of the estuaries, especially the upper regions of the Msunduzi, the cladoceran Moina sp. also attained high densities, reaching 50 000 individuals m−3. During sampling sessions when the mouth of the estuaries was closed the systems became relatively fresh, in contrast to open-mouth conditions when seawater dominated the lower reaches. Peak densities of estuarine copepods occurred during times of mouth closure. When the mouth was open these copepods generally declined in number, and an influx of coastal marine species such as paracalanids, Corycaeidae and chaetognaths was evident. Although higher zooplankton densities were mostly recorded in the Msunduzi Estuary, the species compositions in the two systems were relatively similar, with no significant differences between them. The Mfolozi Estuary is normally classified as a river mouth type, but during the present study this estuary effectively functioned as a temporarily open/ closed type estuary. The low-flow conditions did not adversely affect the estuarine mesozooplankton, largely because the mouth never remained closed for any extended period.",

The eelgrass bed fish abundance was more affected by the macroalgal bloom than the bare substratum fish abundance, with the Ulva impacting negatively on the relative abundance of Mugilidae in the former habitat.

In several East African lakes local managerial institutions (beach management units) have been created to devolve key responsibilities from government level to community level; however, a major challenge has been quantifying the territorial jurisdiction (spatial pattern of use within the lake) of the resource (fish) and resource users (fishers). This study introduces an interdisciplinary method combining anthropology and ecology in Lake Nabugabo, Uganda to: (1) create a map outlining social landmarks and ecological characteristics of the lake, (2) assess the distribution of important fished species, (3) quantify the spatial distribution of fishing effort of local fishers, and (4) quantify the composition of the fish catch. Results demonstrate spatial structure at all levels (social and ecological) of the fishery in Lake Nabugabo. We argue that the interdisciplinary method applied to Lake Nabugabo is practical and achievable in its application, and may be used more broadly to evaluate territorial jurisdiction of fishers and their resource.",

Wound healing, hepatosomatic index, gonadosomatic index and viscerosomatic index did not differ between treatment and control groups. However, fish with implanted dummy transmitters lost weight more rapidly than control fish.

Fish displaced by up to 3.5 km remained within 3–4 km of their release site, but fish displaced 4.3 km immediately returned to their capture locations. Seven weeks after the initiation of the experiment, with the onset of winter, fish that had been holding in the vicinity of their release site near the Kubusi River inlet moved into the deeper basin of the impoundment.

Crabs emerged from their burrows only after the tide receded, and it was light. Time to emergence therefore varied from about 30 minutes to three hours after exposure, depending on the time of low water in the early morning vs at midday. General activity of the crab population was longer on a spring tide (about five hours) than on a neap tide (about three hours). Maximum densities of active crabs were 140 m–2 and 41 m–2 on spring and neap tides, respectively. After emergence, crabs spent 60% to 80% of their time feeding. In the Kowie Estuary, D. fenestrata produced between 7 and 12 pseudofaecal pellets, average weight 0.0358 g per pellet, per minute. These pellets had a significantly lower organic and chlorophyll a content than the substratum, and it was estimated that crabs removed about 25% of the organic content from the sediment.

The maximum values of Fe, Mn, Sb, Zn, Cu and Pb were all below the national and international standard, except for Fe in Hammam Ben Abbes thermal spring and Sb in Wadi Tinja, indicating that the surface water of the Ichkeul basin was largely acceptable. Diatom community composition and specific descriptors, including quantification of morphological alterations and mortality, were used to diagnose environmental stress. High abundances of Achnanthidium minutissimum (Kützing) Czarnecki were observed at the Fe-rich site, which could reflect a response to metal contamination. Diatoms were stressed mostly by the influence of temperature and salinity, which drove species composition and increased mortality. Further research is required on the ecology of diatoms in Ichkeul thermal springs. The use of diatoms as indicators of ecosystem health in the Ichkeul area requires additional knowledge of diatom diversity in the ecoregion.",

Diatom-based indices are routinely used for this purpose elsewhere in the world, but have not yet been produced for the flora of African freshwater lakes. Here we tested the applicability of the European diatom indices on the biomonitoring system of Lake Hawassa, Ethiopia. Physico-chemical and benthic diatom sampling was done at nine sites with different degrees of human disturbance along the lakeshore area from February to November 2015 and 2016. A percentage disturbance score (PDS) was calculated at each site and categorised from no evident disturbance (0–25%) to high disturbance (75–100%). Based on this criterion and selected physico-chemical parameters, the sampling sites categorized into minimal, moderate and high disturbance. Seventeen diatom indices were calculated using Omnidia software version 5.3. Out of a total of 17 indices that were calculated using the Omnidia software, six were selected as potential metrics. The diatom indices had a high discrimination efficiency and were significantly correlated with most the environmental parameters (r > 0.6; p < 0.05). Among these, the trophic diatom index (TDI) and generic diatom index (IDG) showed the best potential to discriminate the three clustered sites, based on their ecological classification. Accordingly, although robust locally based indices are needed, the TDI and IDG diatom indices could be used in monitoring of water quality in tropical African rift lakes.",

The aims of the current study were to compare the biomass allocation of Salicornia tegetaria in six estuaries and relate findings to their environmental conditions. The current study measured the physico-chemical variables of the sediment (moisture content, organic matter content, electrical conductivity, pH) and pore water (temperature, salinity, pH, depth) at Olifants, Berg, Langebaan, Heuningnes, Nahoon and Kwelerha estuaries. Above and below ground biomass and stem height measurements were also collected. The below ground biomass (1.51 ± 0.24 kg m−2) and root/shoot ratio (1.36 ± 0.17) was the lowest at Heuningnes Estuary with no significant difference at the remaining estuaries, suggesting that factors, such as geomorphology and sedimentological processes, could have a stronger effect on the biomass allocation in this species. Important drivers of biomass allocation were sediment pH, redox potential and pore water depth. The current study provides baseline information for S. tegetaria, an endemic salt marsh species, for which there is a paucity of data. This species plays a major role in the ecology of the lower intertidal zone, which will be vulnerable to sea-level rise.",

Over the years a number of projects have been implemented aimed at countering the adverse effects that resulted from isolation of the St Lucia mouth. The most recent (2016/2017) project is the Global Environment Facility (GEF) funded initiative to restore the common St Lucia-uMfolozi River mouth. During, but especially after completion of the rehabilitation project, distinct changes in the sediment grain size composition of the estuarine substratum were observed, resulting primarily from deposition of uMfolozi River sediment in the area. Before commencement of the project (i.e. prior to June 2016) coarse and medium sediment (<1 mm >500 µm and <500 µm >250 µm, respectively) dominated. After project completion (July 2017 onwards) the substrate became muddy as a shift from coarse and medium grains to silt (<63 µm) occurred. Preliminary analyses show a corresponding shift in zooplankton and macrofauna composition. Impacts on other animals, including hippopotami and crocodiles, as well as on various flora have also been observed.",

Sampling was undertaken six times during a one-year cycle from 2005 to 2006, with 228 macroinvertebrates samples collected from different aquatic habitats in 22 sites in four study areas. Sixty-four taxa, mainly families, and >30 000 individuals were recorded. Multivariate analysis of aquatic macroinvertebrates revealed that the distribution of macroinvertebrate fauna is relatively homogenous among study regions, with some variation in number of taxa. Differences were observed in the macroinvertebrate assemblages associated with different aquatic habitats, with fauna from deltaic habitats (floating vegetation, inundated floodplain and marginal vegetation) different from non-deltaic habitats (isolated, seasonally flooded pools and isolated, temporary, rain-filled pools). Within the deltaic habitats, there were no significant differences among the habitats in terms of number of taxa and abundance, although assemblages and frequency of occurrence of taxa differed among habitats, providing evidence of habitat preferences for certain taxa. Future development of a macroinvertebrate-based bioassessment tool should account for aquatic habitat, although the tool does not need to be region specific. Temporal variability of macroinvertebrate assemblages should be examined to evaluate potential hydrological effects on the tool.",

Fifteen sampling sites representing five sectors were selected to cover the lake whole area. The results revealed a highly significant difference (p ≤ 0.016) in the density of all identified zooplankton groups among different flood seasons and lake locations. The zooplankton standing crop during the flood was higher, by a factor of approximately 3.7, than that recorded in post-flood and pre-flood periods. Zooplankton was dominated by medium-sized Copepoda, two cyclopoids (Thermocyclops neglectus and Mesocyclops ogunnus) and one calanoid (Thermodiaptomus galebi). The euplanktonic rotifer Keratella cochlearis dominated, during post-flood and pre-flood periods, constituting approximately 83% and 77% of total rotifer densities, respectively. Keratella tropica occurred in greatest density during flood made up 52.6% of total rotifers. Diaphanosoma mongolianum was the main cladoceran during flood and post-flood periods, whereas Ceriodaphnia dubia densities were highest for pre-flood periods.

Four species, Simulium adersi Pomeroy, Baetis harrisoni Barnard, Pseudocloeon sp. and Tricorythus sp., occurred at all site sampling units. Specimen counts increased from the rainy months of January to April/May, and higher numbers of individuals occurred at Langeni. Species occurrences per site were directly or indirectly affected by season, substrate and habitat heterogeneity. Canonical correspondence analysis results showed that conductivity, pH, flow, substrate and marginal vegetation were important in determining species distribution patterns. Both rare/habitat-restricted and common/widespread benthic macroinvertebrates identified in this study can be used as indicators for assessing the ecological integrity of the Mthatha River. Habitat management along the river should aim at preserving indigenous vegetation, especially during the summer season when habitat requirements are optimal for growth stages of most benthic macroinvertebrate fauna. The practicality of using species-level surveys on a routine basis can be challenging, given the lack of taxonomic expertise and time constraints. It might be advisable to select a few indicator species and to monitor them as surrogates for the whole community.",

In April 2012, during a cyanobacterial bloom event in Theewaterskloof Dam, Western Cape province, the plankton was sampled on 10 occasions. The dominant algae belonged to the genus Anabaena, a family of filamentous cyanobacteria known to produce cyanotoxins such as anatoxin-a, harmful to humans and the aquatic foodweb. The specimens isolated lacked the characteristic akinetes and/or heterocysts associated with this genus. Therefore the 16S rRNA gene was Sanger sequenced and a maximum parsimony tree was constructed, confirming its identity as Anabaena ucrainica (Schkorbatow) M. Watanabe. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) confirmed the presence of microcystin-LR in the isolated A. ucrainica field sample, while PCR analysis and sequencing further confirmed the presence of mcy genes in this species. It was speculated from the data that prevailing low water-column temperatures and strong gusty winds may have resulted in the lack of akinete or heterocyst production. The Anabaena strain isolated from Theewaterskloof Dam is the first report of a strain containing microcystin-LR belonging to this genus in a freshwater body in Africa.",

During a nine-month study in 2006, marine influence persisted for a near-continuous period of three months. This provided an opportunity to explore potential changes in the structure and pattern of the subtidal estuarine macrozoobenthic community. Salinity changes were minimal after mouth opening, decreasing by c. 4 and 8 in the lower and upper estuary, respectively. Salinity decrease was due to river dominance over tidal influence. Two biotic assemblages, structured by sediment characteristics, typified the community throughout the study: a sand-associated group near the mouth and a mud-associated group upstream. Amphipods were proportionally the most abundant group within each assemblage and on each sampling occasion. At the species level, high variability typified the community, with no trends or patterns observed. However, species richness declined from 27–30 to 23 after mouth opening. The number of species returned to former levels at the time of the final survey and just before final mouth closure. An analysis of the subtidal macrozoobenthos in the East Kleinemonde and other temporarily open/closed estuaries (TOCEs) of similar size in the bioregion indicated that communities were typically composed of relatively few, broadly tolerant euryhaline species with no species unique to TOCEs.",

Water quality in the delta was generally good, despite high evapotranspiration rates which would normally produce very saline waters. Electrical conductivity and water temperature increased with distance from Mohembo to Lake Ngami, the former most likely due to evapoconcentration. In contrast, pH, DO, turbidity and TSS decreased with distance from Mohembo to Boro at the lower end of the seasonal floodplain, before increasing again to Lake Ngami. Dissolved oxygen and TSS most likely declined due to biological uptake and particle sedimentation, respectively. Strong and significant relationships were observed between TSS and turbidity and between DOC and EC, indicating that turbidity and EC could be useful proxies for routine estimations of TSS and DOC, respectively, in the delta.",

    "abstract": "Despite their remoteness from sources of atmospheric pollutant emissions, the Afromontane tarns in the Maloti-Drakensberg region are perfect candidates to study the negative effects of acidifying atmospheric pollution, because mountain lakes are widely recognised as sentinel ecosystems, unimpacted by direct human disturbance within their catchments. Thirty-four tarns were sampled in the Maloti-Drakensberg region and most were found to be extremely sensitive to acidic deposition, as indicated by their low acid neutralising capacity. There are very few studies of freshwater critical loads for any region within South Africa. The steady-state water chemistry model (SSWC) was adapted and used to determine critical loads, whereas exceedance was estimated relative to modelled regional deposition data, in order to understand the risk of harmful effects to aquatic ecosystems. Seventy-six percent of sampled sites across the Maloti-Drakensberg would exceed critical loads even at the lowest modelled deposition levels, but there are no current measured deposition data for the region. The sensitivity of the Maloti-Drakensberg tarns needs to be considered in future policy formulation regarding acceptable levels of acidifying atmospheric pollution from South Africa's energy sector and indicates the need for assessing aquatic ecosystem impacts in other regions of South Africa.",

The lakes are fed by separate underground water sources with slightly varying mineral contents resulting in colour variation and supporting different kinds of prokaryotic and eukaryotic species. In this study, the diversity of Actinobacteria in surface water and sediments of five Lakes were investigated using culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular techniques. A total of 34 out of 112, and 13 out of 85, representatives of Actinobacteria isolates and clones, respectively, were selected for gene sequencing using the CD-HIT program. Analysis of their 16S rRNA gene sequences displayed the presence of species affiliated to 15 different genera, namely Mycobacterium, Rhodococcus, Microbacterium, Isoptericola, Dietzia, Leucobacter, Jonesia, Nesterenkonia, Micrococcus, Streptomyces, Hoyosella, Norcadiopsis, Cellulomonas, Bogoriella, and Agromyces. The results showed 5 and 12 putative new Actinobacteria isolates and clones, respectively. This is the first report of isolation of bacteria from the genus Mycobacterium from a soda lake globally, as well as the genera Hoyosella, Isoptericola, Jonesia, Micrococcus, Leucobacter and Agromyces from a soda lake in East Africa. Because Actinobacteria are known as a source of biotechnologically important compounds, the species revealed set a platform to search for novel bioactive compounds.",

Using network analysis, we examined the interlinkages (synergies and trade-offs) between indicator 6.6.1 (water-related ecosystems) and other Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicators related to freshwater ecosystems to support coherent policies and strategies for freshwater management. Research into scientific literature and reports on freshwater ecosystems and SDG indicator interlinkages was carried out in 2019 and 2020. Sustainable Development Goal custodians were also interviewed about indicator interlinkages and challenges, and the data analysed using thematic analysis. The results showed that water-related ecosystems had the highest positive interlinkages (synergies) with environmental goals, while more trade-offs were found between water-related ecosystems and social goals. Thematic analysis showed that Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) should focus on partnerships, governance, and challenges regarding water-related ecosystems and SDG implementation.

It was originally developed in the 1990s and has subsequently evolved and been applied in over 50 studies in Africa, South America, Asia and Europe. Early versions provided predicted ecological responses over time to specific flow changes, while the latest version provides responses to flow and non-flow drivers as seasonal time series. Here, an ecosystem or eco-social network is built for the river, with links between driver and responder indicators, and relationships created for each link. The network and relationships are developed and entered into the software by specialists based on available data and their knowledge. A range of scenarios is explored through the predicted indicator time series, discipline and site level ecological integrity, and social well-being. While DRIFT models vary in complexity, they are all based on relatively simple fundamental principles and arithmetic. Sequential averaging and summation through the system network is used to calculate an indicator's response to different drivers for successive seasons over time, while the discipline and site level summaries are found using weighted summation of indicator results and individual discipline results, respectively. Information from different specialist areas is therefore processed in the same way, thereby enabling coherent integration across disciplines.",

This study aimed to assess the biological water quality of an Afrotropical river in southwestern Nigeria whose riparian corridor is threatened by numerous environmental stressors. Water and macroinvertebrate samples from the Ojutu River, Osun State, were collected from March to November in 2019. The river's extent of degradation was determined based on criteria such as riparian vegetation removal, grazing, farming, solid waste dumping, water abstraction and in-channel structures. Macroinvertebrate samples were scored using the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) system, which uses the presence of macroinvertebrate groups as a bioindicator of water quality in a river. The values obtained indicate that the water quality of the Ojutu River varied from an altered system (36 ≤ WQ ≤ 60) to a much-altered system (16 ≤ WQ ≤ 35) in the wet season, with evidence of mild pollution (61 ≤ WQ ≤ 100) in the dry season. The main drivers of biological water quality were in-channel structures, water abstraction, riparian vegetation removal and solid waste dumping. This study underscores the need to initiate resource management measures and enforce laws that could improve the ecological integrity of degraded riparian corridors in the Afrotropical realm.",

Despite its many advantages, the use of eDNA in South Africa as an assessment tool for fish biodiversity is largely underutilised. This study was performed as an initial screening to assess the efficiency of the eDNA method for characterising fish communities in South African waters using the metabarcoding approach. Water samples were collected from eight estuaries and vacuum filtered using 0.45 μm nylon membrane filters. DNA was extracted from the filters, and sample extracts underwent PCR assaying using MiFish primers for the 12S rRNA gene, prior to being sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform. The resulting sequence data produced 1 574 092 raw reads, which resulted in 119 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) after filtering and clustering. Taxonomic assignment of the OTUs produced four different taxonomic groups and one group representing unidentified sequences. The group with the highest number of OTUs (54%) was assigned to fish taxa consisting of 12 families and 22 genera identified across all estuaries, with only 16 taxa identified to species level. As this was a preliminary study, few samples were collected, and therefore several recommendations for a more comprehensive study design are provided. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that the eDNA metabarcoding approach can efficiently detect fish species in South African estuarine environments.Keywords: biodiversitybioinformaticsDNA metabarcodingeThekwini MunicipalityKwaZulu-Natal",

Water, sediment, fish and algae collected from the lake and its feeder rivers during the dry and rainy seasons were analysed for heavy metals and organochlorine pesticide residues to identify possible sources of contaminants. Atomic absorption spectrophotometry and gas chromatography showed that more contaminants were added to the lake during the rainy season than the dry season. Heavy metals and pesticide residues were found in higher concentrations in the sediments than in the water. Contamination by most of the pollutants has increased over the past 25 years. DDD is more prevalent in the sediments and particulates in the water, but DDE is predominant in fish, suggesting two different mechanisms of DDT degradation in the biotic and abiotic environments. Whereas heavy metals tend to be distributed almost uniformly within the lake, pesticide residues are found predominantly in its northern and southern river inlets. Some contaminants occur in slightly higher concentration upstream, perhaps due to contamination from point sources, followed by dilution.",

Daily rations were estimated using the gut fullness index approach. Variations in zooplankton biomass demonstrated a seasonal pattern with maximum values (generally >40mg dwt m−3) recorded in summer and minimum values during winter (generally <25mg dwt m−3). Total biomass of G. aestuaria during the study ranged between 0.04g dwt m−2 and 0.2g dwt m−2 and between 0.01g dwt m−2 and 0.04g dwt m−2 for A. breviceps. There were no seasonal patterns in biomass for either species. Results of the gut content analysis indicated that both species consume mainly copepods, amphipods and mysids. There were no seasonal patterns in the dominant prey in the guts of the juveniles. Peaks in feeding activity for G. aestuaria were recorded during daylight hours while maximum feeding activity of A. breviceps occurred at night. Gut evacuation rates (k, h−1) of G. aestuaria and A. breviceps during summer were estimated at 0.41h−1 and 0.68h−1 respectively. During winter, evacuation rates were lower and were estimated at 0.37h−1 for A. breviceps and 0.28h−1 for G. aestuaria. Daily rations of A. breviceps during summer and winter were equivalent to 8.3% and 4% body dwt d−1, while for G. aestuaria daily ration was estimated at 7.9% body dwt during summer and 4.3% body dwt d−1 during winter. Results indicate that the predation impact of G. aestuaria ranged between 2.5% and 33.6% of the zooplankton secondary production while A. breviceps impact was equivalent to between 3.3% and 11.1% of the zooplankton secondary production.",

Sampling was conducted seasonally at 14 sites between 1996 and 1998. The macroinvertebrate community composition was strikingly similar (±70%) across sites. Faunal diversity was low (104 taxa in total), but many taxa found were sensitive to water quality change (ASPT 5.0 to 9.6), indicating good water quality, which is attributed to the currently undeveloped nature of the catchment. Concentrations of water quality variables fell within a narrow range, except for total suspended solids, which at times was very high (up to 8 532mg l–1). The highly variable concentration of the total suspended solids and its potential effects on biodiversity need to be investigated further. It is likely that bilharzia will spread and that pest blackflies may become a problem to livestock if the water resources become developed as is proposed. We suggest that more flow gauging weirs are needed to measure flows better for future management and also that the implications of the proposed developments on the estuary need to be investigated.",

In addition, the theory that LC5s (concentration causing 5% lethality) are indicative of No Observed Effect Concentrations (NOECs) was tested. NaCl and Na2SO4 were used as toxicants as they are indicative of natural and industrial salinization, respectively. NOEC values of 1.9 g l–1 were calculated for both salts. Within the chronic toxicity tests, LC5s that were calculated using regression methods approximated the calculated NOEC values for both salts. Chronic NOECs calculated here are lower, by a factor of 3, than the acute LC50s calculated for the same species and salts. Although evidence exists to suggest that C. nilotica is generally sensitive to toxicants, it was found to be not particularly sensitive to salinity. However, the species was found to be a good chronic toxicity test organism for partial life-cycle toxicity tests where growth was measured as the test endpoint, and may yield valuable chronic toxicity data for other toxicants.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The community structure, diversity and seasonal variation of the benthic macroinvertebrates in Ologe Lagoon were studied at four sites during the dry and wet seasons of 2003 to provide environmental baseline data for the lagoon. The community comprised 29 taxa from the phyla Insecta, Annelida, Mollusca, and Crustacea, with more taxa recorded during the dry, than in the wet season. An average of 254 individuals m–2 were found in the samples, of which 57.5% (146 individuals m–2) were recorded during the dry season and 42.5% (108 individuals m–2) during the wet season. No significant differences (p > 0.05) in abundance were found among seasons. The most abundant benthic fauna were insect larvae, which were dominated by Ephemeroptera and Diptera, accounting for 44.1% of the population sampled. Crustaceans, annelids and molluscs were the next most abundant and represented 33.1%, 13.4% and 9.4% of the total population, respectively. Taxon diversity was highest at Elete Creek. However, no significant difference (p > 0.05) in the number of taxa was found across the four stations with season.

    "abstract": "Abstract Sakumo Lagoon, situated near Accra, is a Ramsar-listed coastal wetland threatened by urban and agricultural waste, being located in an urban area where access to domestic and waste disposal facilities is a major problem. The aim of this study was to assess the pollution status as well as trends, in terms of pollution laoding, in the lagoon. Nutrients, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, suspended solids, temperature, pH and faecal coliforms were monitored on a quaterly basis from 1997–1998 and 2001–2002, covering both wet and dry seasons. Significant increases in the mean concentrations of suspended solids, ammonia-nitrogen, phosphate-phosphorus and biochemical oxygen demand indicated an increase in the level of pollution in the lagoon. Faecal coliform counts were fairly high, exceeding 130 counts 100 ml–1, which is the maximum acceptable count in Ghana for water used for recreation. Results from the study suggested rapid deterioration of the lagoon water quality between 1997 and 2002. Domestic and agricultural discharges into feeder streams were the main sources of pollution, as well as decaying plant material in the lagoon.

Samples were collected monthly between April 2006 and March 2007 and were examined using routine macroscopic and histological techniques. Five macroscopic stages of gonad maturation were identified in the ovaries and testes and described histologically. Oocyte development was subdivided into five stages, based on the presence of chromatin nucleolus oocytes, perinucleolus oocytes, yolk vesicle oocytes, vitellogenic oocytes and mature oocytes. Four stages of spermatogenesis (spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids and spermatozoa) were observed. Comparisons of macroscopic and histological observations revealed that the temporal patterns of maturation activity obtained from visual examination closely reflected the seasonal histological trend in gonad development. Histological characteristics of spent ovaries and testes were similar to those of immature fish, indicating that L. parvus were synchronous iteroparous spawners.

As part of a research and development programme to optimise husbandry techniques for a new mariculture species, the dusky kob, Argyrosomus japonicus, this study tested the effect of four feeding strategies on growth, food conversion ratio (FCR), condition factor, and size frequency distribution in this commercially important species. Treatments included a restricted ration distributed over three daily feedings, and feeding to apparent satiation either once, twice or three times per day, respectively. Fish fed to satiation once daily grew slowest at a daily feed intake similar to that of the restricted ration treatment. Fish fed the restricted ration of 3.4% body mass day–1 (BM d–1) had the best FCR-values. FCR was reduced at feeding intensities above 3.85% BM d–1. Thus, growth of juvenile A. japonicus was a function of both daily food intake and food deprivation time. While feeding strategy did not influence size variability expressed as coefficient of variation for length and weight, size frequency distributions tended to become more left-skewed as feeding frequency increased. Juvenile A. japonicus within the size range of 7.5–35.0 g fish–1 should be fed more than once daily at a feeding intensity of no more than 3.85% BM d–1.

Oogonial cells (9.8 ± 3.0 μm) developed through six distinct stages: chromatin nucleolar oocyte (16.2 ± 3.3 μm), perinucleolar oocyte (33.8 ± 12.1 μm), late perinucleolar oocyte (74.8 ± 16.5 μm), cortical alveolar oocyte (122.6 ± 38.8 μm), secondary oocyte (260.9 ± 61.2 μm) and tertiary oocyte (475.5 ± 70.7 μm). L. niloticus was found to be an asynchronous spawner. The collection of female brood fish for induced spawning should aim at fish with an oocyte size of 475.5 ± 70.7 μm.

Censuses of fishers and fishing gears were conducted through direct observation and counts. The population of fishers was 950 and the majority (74%) of the sampled respondents fell within the ages of 24–41 years. Gillnet, cast net, trap and hook and line were the four main gears utilised. Illegal methods of fishing observed included the use of mosquito nets (nets with mesh <1.0 cm) and the use of brewer's waste (pito mash) as bait. Brycinus nurse, Synodontis spp., Parailia spiniserrata and Chrysichthys spp. were perceived to have disappeared from the reservoir. The fishers were unaware of the existence of any fisheries regulations, hence there was no adherence to management practices. Their daily income was derived mainly from fishing. The incidence of poverty among fishers was low (8%).

The water level in the estuary following mouth opening decreased by 1.65 m within 24 h, resulting in an almost complete draining of the littoral zone where large beds of the aquatic macrophyte Ruppia cirrhosa and mats of the associated filamentous algae were present. As the water depth within the plant beds decreased, the macrophytes, together with the algal filaments, created an increasingly dense mat, trapping fish that were resident, foraging or passing through the littoral zone. By 16 November 2017 large numbers of fishes belonging to at least 20 species were trapped in pools and depressions within the littoral, as well as within the R. cirrhosa beds and filamentous algal mats in the lower reaches of this system. Other affected taxa included crustaceans, especially isopods, and large numbers of small bivalves attached to macrophyte vegetation. Beneficiaries of the fish kill, in terms of unexpected food availability, included a variety of piscivorous bird species and the Cape clawless otter Aonyx capensis.

Key to the conflict is the demarcation of boundaries to areas in which brown trout Salmo trutta and rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss currently occur, or are likely to establish following stocking for angling. To provide a longer-term perspective on these areas, we developed models to link salmonid biological thermal thresholds to elevation. These, when applied spatially using a digital elevation model with a probability of occurrence model, provided the basis for estimating potentially available thermal habitat for these two cold water species. Here, we acknowledge that other variables (stocking history; river connectivity) also play a role in understanding trout distributions. Using a simple scenario of an increase in mean daily water temperatures of 2 °C, we demonstrated that both brown and rainbow trout are likely to exhibit considerable range reductions in the future. Because it is possible that these range restrictions will result in an increasing desire to introduce trout into areas above their current distribution limits for the maintenance of angling opportunities, conservation managers should prioritise these areas, with management interventions seeking to understand what will help to limit introductions.",

The purpose of this study is to understand why this change occurred, and how the understanding thus gained can provide ecological information that will help understand the dynamics of similar estuaries in the region. The approach was to accumulate evidence gathered from historical records, published literature and scientific investigations. In the past 6 000 years, the Mlalazi Estuary evolved from an open bay to a permanently open estuary and then to its current state of a temporarily closed estuary. There is evidence that the mangroves that occurred in the system were lost when the estuary mouth started closing for extended periods. Since 1896, Mlalazi has been artificially breached whenever closure resulted in the backing up of water. This mouth-breaching regime resulted in physical conditions suitable for mangrove growth. Mangrove propagules would have dispersed from adjacent estuaries; taking more than 30 years for Avicennia marina and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza to colonise, and approximately 100 years for Rhizophora mucronata. Once established the mangrove population expanded and there is evidence that available habitat is becoming limiting. Any alteration to the current mouth management strategy is likely to affect the mangroves and must not be implemented without a full understanding of its consequences. The Mlalazi Estuary is a unique estuary in South Africa in that mouth manipulation has led to the colonization of mangroves not previously current in the system.",

    "abstract": "Biological control is an effective ways of controlling aquatic plants, especially in South Africa. Release of biological control agents has been limited to Mozambique, where water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms-Laubach (Pontederiaceae)), water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes L. (Araceae)), red water ferns (Azolla spp. (Azollaceae)) and salvinia (Salvinia molesta DS Mitch. (Salviniaceae)) are significant weeds in the south of the country. In 2009, we assessed the status of these weeds in seven rivers across southern Mozambique and recorded whether any biocontrol agents were present. The weevils Neochetina eichhorniae Warner (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) and N. bruchi Hustache (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) were on water hyacinth, along with the pathogen Acremonium zonatum (Sawada) W. Gams (Hypocreales) and the mite Orthogalumna terebrantis Wallwork (Acarina: Sarcoptiformes: Galumnidae). Pistia stratiotes supported small numbers of the weevil Neohydronomus affinis Hustache (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). The red water fern in the rivers was A. cristata Kaulfuss (Azollaceae) not the more widely recorded A. filiculoides Lam. (Azollaceae), and it supported small numbers of the weevil Stenopelmus rufinasus Gyllenhal (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). No agents were present on S. molesta. Most of these agents are likely to have dispersed from South Africa, and the rivers of southern Mozambique are likely to be benefitting from the transnational dispersal of these agents.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed at assessing the ecological status of the Kinyankonge River using a zooplankton-based Biotic Integrity Index (BII-zooplankton). This was achieved through monthly collections of zooplankton from four stations along the river over 18 months (from July 2015 to June 2016, then from January 2017 to June 2017). Chemical parameters of the water were also measured using the AFNOR and APHA methods. Organic loads of water samples were assessed using Leclercq's Organic Pollution Index. Zooplankton levels of disturbance were evaluated by Karr's Biological Integrity Index. From this study, it was calculated that the Organic Pollution Index had two levels of pollution: strong organic pollution and very high organic pollution for upstream and downstream stations, respectively. Zooplankton populations were more disturbed during dry season than rainy season. The calculated Biotic Integrity Index highlighted a degradation of the ecological quality, especially in the upstream stations along the Kinyankonge River. Based on the zooplankton species diversity as an indicator of the ecological status of the river, the Biotic Integrity Index revealed a spatio-temporal variation highlighting four states of ecological quality of the Kinyankonge River: bad, moderate, good and very good, where Microcyclops sp. indicates bad ecological status, Brachionus angularis and Tropocyclops sp. indicate moderate ecological status, whereas Rotaria sp. indicates very good ecological status. No species was identified as indicator of good ecological status. Therefore, the BII-zooplankton can be used as an indicator of the ecological health of the Kinyankonge River, and extended to other aquatic ecosystems in Burundi.",

High quality micrographs, illustrating the general cell structure and most features used for accurate identification, are provided. Intensive literature searches allowed mapping of the worldwide geographical distribution of the species, which revealed that it was sparsely distributed throughout Africa, because it was reported from only seven countries.

Analyses of mitochondrial DNA (cyt b) and nuclear DNA (S7) sequence data demonstrated that two unique lineages occur in the west-flowing Orange River and south-flowing drainages, respectively. The southern lineage was further divided into three sublineages: one restricted to the Gouritz River, the second largely confined to the Gamtoos River and the last distributed across catchments to the east (the Sundays, Bushmans, Great Fish, Keiskamma, Buffalo and Nahoon rivers). The Great Escarpment and deep incisions along the south coast were identified as potentially influencing the geographic genetic structure of this species. For conservation purposes and pending future taxonomic assessment, the two major lineages were identified as Evolutionarily Significant Units, and Management Units were identified within the southern lineage.",

Highest tissue concentrations of Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn were recorded at Bhizolo. High Biota Sediment Accumulation Factor (BSAF) values for Cd, Cu, Mn, Ni and Zn at all sites confirmed that crabs bioaccumulated these metals. The high Cr concentration in sediment (Bhizolo: 104 ± 18.2 µg g−1; Richards Bay Coal Terminal (RBCT): 104 ± 29.2 µg g−1; Mzingazi: 94.1 ± 38.7 µg g−1) was not reflected in the biota-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF) value, suggesting low bioavailability of Cr. High BSAF values for Cd, Cu, Mn, Ni and Zn suggest that the threshold of regulation in P. blephariskios was exceeded, resulting in net bioaccumulation.",

One-time extensive sampling was carried out during the post-rainy season (November–December) of 2016. Macroinvertebrates were collected using a Surber sampler and a D-frame net at twenty sites. Based on the measured physico-chemical variables, sampling sites were clustered into references (n = 8) and test sites (n = 4). Approximately thirty potential candidate metrics were tested, and five metrics were selected as core metrics: number of Ephemeroptera Plecoptera Trichoptera taxa, percentage of Ephemeroptera individuals, percentage of EPT individuals, percentage that were shredders, and the percentage that were filter-feeders. These metrics were scored on a continuous scale from 0 to 10. To develop Lake Tana subbasin multimetric index (LTSBMI), scores were added and scaled to produce a score from 0 to 100. The final index was divided into five water quality classes: 'very good', 'good', 'fair', 'poor' and 'very poor'. The LTSBMI was effective in discriminating sites with different levels of impacts, but should be checked to other localities. The current LTSBMI could be used for ecosystem health assessment and monitoring in different Aftropical river systems with similar agroecology.",

This desktop study provides a broad comparative analysis of the suites of DS numerical modelling tools developed and utilised by five intergovernmental transboundary RBOs that advise their member states in the management of their shared water resources: the Permanent Okavango River Basin Water Commission; the Orange-Senqu River Commission; the Nile Basin Initiative; the Zambezi Watercourse Commission; and the Mekong River Commission. These DS tools were reviewed against the information required to enable the kinds of comprehensive assessments of proposed basin management and development plans defined in their respective agreements, which include not only hydrological parameters, but also environmental and social considerations. A review of the model development timelines showed that prior to 2000, little capacity existed in modelling of hydrological, ecosystem, and social components of the river, but that these gaps have been addressed in recent years.",

    "abstract": "Access to long-term biodiversity datasets is vital for monitoring, managing and protecting freshwater ecosystems. Detecting critical ecosystem changes, such as losing unique biodiversity and ecosystem services, is dependent on access to data. A wealth of biodiversity data exists for river ecosystems in South Africa, but an operational information system to access these data is currently not available. This gap is the result of limited capacity for managing freshwater biodiversity data, with existing systems isolated, difficult to access and not well maintained. To address this knowledge gap, the Freshwater Biodiversity Information System (FBIS) has been developed. The FBIS is a powerful, visual, data-rich information system for hosting and serving freshwater biodiversity data. It serves as a platform for the inventory and maintenance of data, thereby facilitating the evaluation of long-term change in river biodiversity and ecosystem condition, and guiding future monitoring strategies and management decisions. System design and functionality was strongly informed by data and reporting needs of key end-user groups, including water resource managers, biodiversity and conservation managers and planners, scientific researchers, and environmental consultants. Future expansion aims to increase the diversity of data accessed, data flow, geographic coverage and strategically embed FBIS into South Africa's main freshwater decision-making pipelines.",

Whilst water quality is often measured in terms of bacterial contamination and general physico-chemical characteristics, this study extends water quality assessment to include steroid hormone presence and potential physiological toxicity. This is the first study to determine these parameters in dams in Namibia at various stages of the seasons. Seven bioassays were used to determine oestradiol (E2), oestrone (E1) and testosterone (T) concentrations, as well as neurotoxicity, cytotoxicity and immunotoxicity, in water sampled during 2010 and 2011. Oestradiol and E1 concentrations of up to 7.2 pg ml–1 and 7.6 pg ml–1, respectively, were recorded. Testosterone concentrations measured up to 19 pg ml–1. No cytotoxic effects were detected, while acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition assays indicated low neurotoxic effects in Goreangab Dam (18% AChE inhibition) and no neurotoxic effects in other samples. The immune system biomarker interleukin-6 was high in all samples (457 pg ml–1; SD 54), with interleukin-10 being high only at Avis (46 pg ml–1), Goreangab (74 pg ml–1) and Swakoppoort (81 pg ml–1) dams. The results suggest that water from Goreangab and Swakoppoort dams may have the potential to modulate endocrine systems, and shows physiological toxicity.",

In the present study, because of the larger surface-area-tovolume ratio of small-bodied chironomid species compared with large-bodied species, it was hypothesised that the relative abundance of the small-bodied species would decrease at the impacted sites by elevated concentrations of total dissolved solids compared with that at the less-impacted control site. The aim of this study was to analyse and compare patterns of chironomid final instar body-size classes at impacted sites with those at the control site. Chironomid larvae were sampled seasonally from August 2009 to September 2012 from one control site and three impacted sites (Sites 2, 3 and 4) in the Swartkops River, Eastern Cape. Site 2 was impacted by diffuse pollution sources, whereas Sites 3 and 4 were impacted by wastewater effluent discharges in addition to diffuse pollution sources. Small-bodied species dominated the assemblage at the control site and declined significantly at the impacted sites, suggesting that chironomid body size responds predictably to deteriorating water quality in the Swartkops River.Keywords: aquatic pollutionbiomonitoringbiological traitsChironominaehabitat templateOrthocladiinaeSwartkops RiverTanypodinae",

Here, the prawn community of the Mfolozi–Msunduzi estuarine system is described and the system's potential as an alternative nursery for prawns during prolonged closure of the adjacent St Lucia estuarine system is examined. Sampling was conducted at five localities in summer and winter in 2007–2012. The Mfolozi–Msunduzi Estuary is a river-dominated system with mouth condition, sediment grain size and turbidity being the most important factors affecting the structure of its prawn community. Twelve prawn species were recorded, including five marine penaeid and five freshwater palaemonid species. The prawn community was numerically dominated by freshwater Macrobrachium equidens and two penaeids, Fenneropenaeus indicus and Metapenaeus monoceros. Significant differences were recorded between summer and winter samples, with freshwater species dominating the catch in summer, while penaeid species were dominant in winter. The marked seasonal change in the prawn community was related to strong river flows during summer creating low-salinity conditions, unsuitable for penaeid postlarval development, throughout most of the system. Compared to St Lucia, the Mfolozi–Msunduzi Estuary can be regarded as a poor alternative nursery area for penaeids during the summer peak postlarval recruitment period.",

In 1989 the Mojo River was temporarily diverted to flow into the lake. The lake subsequently changed markedly, first from being a small polymictic system to being a large monomictic system with a maximum depth of 29 m in 1990/1991, and then by 2007/2008 to again being a small continuously polymictic system less than 8 m deep. Secchi depth averaged 0.35 m and varied from 0.15 to 0.78 m, indicating a marked decline in water transparency from the levels recorded in 1990/1991. Nitrate levels, rarely detectable in the 1960s, subsequently became high, whereas phosphorus levels have declined since the 1960s. The phytoplankton community was dominated by cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates, in contrast to the dominance by cyanobacteria before 1989, and by dinoflagellates and chlorophytes shortly thereafter. Total phytoplankton Chl a averaged 83.5 mg m−3 and ranged from ∼36 to 148 mg m−3, peaking in October 2007 and February 2008. The impacts of river diversion and shoreline modification on the lake were reflected in changes in the physico-chemical conditions, including low light penetration and high nitrate, and changed phytoplankton community structure. The development of algal blooms in future is anticipated.",

Biomonitoring over time provides insights into trajectories of ecosystem change. The responses of two instream animal taxa to two contrasting disturbance events, a major flood event and the long-term cumulative effects of land-use changes, were assessed in 1999–2012 by quantifying variation and change in abundance of functional groups based on flow rate sensitivity, water quality and metrics of ecological condition. All metrics recovered to pre-flood conditions within seven months after the flood event. Similarly, cumulative impacts of land use effected significant decreases in some but not all metrics. Indices that did not change, including SASS total score and ASPT, were the result of insufficient consideration of the decrease in the abundance of sensitive taxa specifically, and the abundance of all taxa in general. The decrease in abundance of sensitive taxa could signal imminent collapse in certain metrics. Evidence is also provided for a shift in the structure of fish assemblages linked to the decrease and loss of taxa sensitive to ecosystem degradation caused by the longer-term impacts of land-use change.",

    "abstract": "Rapid biomonitoring protocols, using biotic indices based on macroinvertebrate diversity to assess river ecosystem health, are widely used globally. Such quick assessment techniques are lauded for the rapid results obtained and the relatively easy protocol used to achieve an answer. However, do such quick assessments of water quality give enough information about ecosystems? Are important details being overlooked? When should a full faunal survey be used in preference? Important research programmes, including environmental impact studies, often misuse biomonitoring techniques, making influential management decisions using superficial, low-level data obtained using biomonitoring tools, inappropriate to address those management objectives. The value of using biomonitoring as a quick tool, versus a more detailed faunal assessment, is considered here. The assessment of teloganodid mayfly fauna occurring in South African rivers provides an example of the value of detailed studies versus superficial family level investigations, showing that a rapid biomonitoring approach should not be used as a shortcut when a more detailed survey is needed. Each situation should be assessed for its own merit in a given set of project circumstances. A checklist of criteria is presented, giving guidance on when rapid biomonitoring alone is valuable and when more detailed assessments would give a more relevant result.",

    "abstract": "The fishery for the African tigerfish Hydrocynus vittatus in northern Namibia makes a substantial contribution to surrounding food security and stimulates the local economy through subsistence and recreational fishing. However, local fishers suggest that catch rates of H. vittatus have declined and the fish are now smaller. The Namibian Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources conducted annual gill net surveys in the Kavango River from 1994 to 2018. These standardised surveys were used to compare catch per unit effort data and length frequencies of H. vittatus between intensively fished areas and a freshwater protected area (FPA). The catch per unit effort (by numbers and mass) and proportion (56% vs 10–20%) of mature fish (males >180 mm fork length and females >280 mm fork length) were higher inside the FPA, compared with those outside. The H. vittatus populations, both outside and inside the FPA, are subject to overfishing and management actions should be taken to secure this important fishery resource for subsistence and recreational fishers.",

    "abstract": "Freshwater is one of the Earth's most crucial resources for social-economic development and prosperity. Biomonitoring contributes to water resource protection by integrating a holistic picture of ecosystem health through an analysis of resident biota. The taxonomy-based approach, in which taxa assemblages are analysed and compared between sites, is common in freshwater biomonitoring. However, this approach is mainly descriptive and has no predictive or effect diagnostic potential. The trait-based approach (TBA) has been hailed as capable of transforming biomonitoring into a predictive science with the potential for effect diagnosis. This paper presents a framework for the potential use of traits in riverine water resource monitoring and management. It provided ways to integrate the TBA into the Resource Quality Objectives (RQOs), current biomonitoring protocols, and developing predictive models. Their effect diagnostic potential, assemblage response predictive value and links to crucial ecosystem functions should guide the selection and integration of traits into RQOs. Examples of trait-based RQOs statements are provided.",

While the Phongolo River is regulated, the Usuthu River is unregulated and subjected to fewer anthropogenic activities that influence the downstream environmental quality of this Ramsar system. The present study evaluates the environmental quality of floodplain systems in the NGR. Water and sediment were sampled and analysed from both rivers and associated floodplain lakes during different hydrological periods (flow). Using multivariate statistical techniques, ionic compositions, as well as water and sediment quality indices of the ecosystems were evaluated. Key findings suggest spatial and flow-related differences, which highlight the human-driven impacts from the upper catchments and the rivers influence on their respective floodplain lakes. The environmental quality (water and sediments) could be classified as 'good' and predominantly unimpacted. Notably, ionic composition of river water showed the importance of the unregulated Usuthu River and its contribution to aquatic ecosystems within the NGR and their continued functioning. The quality indices further indicated that metals do not currently pose any ecological risks to these systems.",

    "abstract": "There has been considerable debate as to the contribution that fishing activities can make to food security and income generation in rural areas of South Africa where fishing has not traditionally been practised. The rural areas in the eastern half of the Eastern Cape Province which are inhabited primarily by Xhosa people have generally been considered as areas where fishing activities have not formed a part of history. There have been no studies reporting on successful small-scale fisheries implementation from this province, which has added weight to the perception that Xhosa cultural belief and preferences are sufficiently strong to render the capture and consumption of fish an unattractive alternative. Investigation of perceptions among rural Xhosa people indicated that cultural avoidance of freshwater fish was not universal and where these customary beliefs did exist, they were often not strong enough to negatively effect a process of fisheries development. This paper presents evidence from a case study in the Fish River Valley which clearly shows that people are willing to catch, eat and sell fish from dams and rivers in the area. In addition, analysis of cash flows within this newly established fishery indicates that fishing activities bring significant income into the study area. People see small-scale fisheries as a viable alternative to more common forms of food procurement and natural resource use. The results from this study emphasise the role that under-utilised freshwater fish resources can play in the development of South Africa's marginalised rural areas.",

The estuary mouth closed in late 1991, due to the drought and to water abstraction from the system, and reopened only at the end of the drought in late 1995. The fish community underwent considerable changes in composition and abundance, from marine-dominated during 1992 to freshwater/estuarine-dominated in 1995. The adverse effect of extended mouth closure on the fish fauna and the lack of contact with the marine environment was clearly illustrated. Due to mouth closure, recruitment of estuarine-dependent marine species almost stopped, although some recruitment by means of wave-overtopping was found to continue, even though the estuary mouth remained closed. Recruitment of twelve estuarine-dependent marine fish species was found to occur in this way, suggesting that recruitment through wave-overtopping is an important aspect of estuarine functioning during drought conditions.",

    "abstract": "The Namibian Department of Water Affairs has in the past faced considerable pressure to relieve the water shortages caused by recent droughts. One of the options considered in 1996, following poor runoff during the 1994/95 and 1995/96 seasons, was a proposal to abstract some 17Mm3 of water per year from the Okavango River at Rundu, and transfer this via a 260km long pipeline to the head of the Eastern National Water Carrier at the town of Grootfontein. Part of the overall evaluation of this scheme included an assessment of the potential environmental impacts that could arise. An initial environmental evaluation was conducted from a point approximately 40 kilometres upstream of Rundu in Namibia, to the distal end of the Okavango Delta at Maun in Botswana. Hydrological studies showed that the proposed abstraction represented a reduction of approximately 0.32% in the mean annual flow of the Okavango River at Rundu. The abstraction represents 0.17% of the mean annual flow at Mukwe, downstream of the Cuito River confluence. The adverse effects of the proposed water abstraction scheme would be extremely small along the Okavango River in Namibia, whilst outflows from the lower end of the Okavango Delta to the Thamalakane River would be reduced by some 1.44Mm3/year (11%). Additional studies showed that these effects could be reduced by some 10–13% if abstraction was confined to the falling limb of the hydrograph. Hydrological simulations have shown that the maximum likely loss of inundated area in the Okavango Delta would total approximately 7km2 out of some 8 000km2. This potential loss in inundated area would be concentrated in the lower reaches of the seasonal swamps and seasonally inundated grasslands, specifically in the lower reaches of the Boro, Gomoti, Santantadibe and Thaoge channels. However, these effects would most likely be expressed as a shoreline effect, with the loss in area spread out over the shoreline and periphery of islands and would not be restricted to a single specific area. This anticipated loss in inundated area is unlikely to have measurable impacts on environmental components. Overall, the study found no 'fatal flaws' which would prevent the water abstraction scheme from proceeding and the anticipated effects on the Okavango system are more likely to be seen in the Okavango Delta, rather than along the Okavango River. The anticipated ecological implications of the scheme were small in spatial extent and are unlikely to be perceptible against the natural year-to-year variability in inundation of the Okavango Delta or outflows to the Thamalakane River. However, the public perceptions of the proposed water transfer project were strongly negative and appeared to be at least in part due to the very low water levels in the Okavango River and Okavango Delta during the past three years and during the study period. These low water levels were amongst the lowest on record and it is likely that the public would attribute any adverse effect recorded in the future to the abstraction scheme, whether this were true or not. These negative perceptions of the desirability and acceptability of the proposed scheme were strongly linked to potential adverse affects on the tourism industry along the Okavango River and in the Okavango Delta, with possible adverse economic effects on local residents.",

Fishing gear was recorded in 70% of the households, but only in 36% was that gear used during that same year. Most fishers were older school-going boys using hook and line as the main fishing gear, but small gill nets, a variety of traps and small-mesh seine nets were also used. Eighteen of the 27 fish species known from the Mutshindudi River were recognised by the fishers and had their own vernacular names. Catches of fishers were dominated by small tilapias, small barb species and catfish. The average catch per fishing trip of just under three hours was 162g and the fish were small (mean 26g), which was however quite acceptable to the fishers. A few older fishers sold their catches but most were taken home to be enjoyed with the main meal. Length distribution data of fishers' catches indicated fish populations with normal size distributions, but experimental gill net catches in two pools revealed populations of fish species not normally caught by fishers, including Marcusenius macrolepidotus, Barbus marequensis and Labeo molybdinus/cylindricus. This, and a low catch per unit effort, may indicate a degree of overharvesting of angling species. Measures proposed to prevent further overexploitation include a ban on draw netting as well as restocking the river with tilapia.",

For hard and soft water with a pH above 7.51 no change in the resting specific oxygen consumption rate (MO2) was found when the fish were exposed to nominal concentrations of 1, 5, 10, or 20mg Pb l–1 normoxic water. In soft, acidic normoxic water (pH 6.28) containing 10mg l–1 Pb-acetate, MO2 increased significantly (P < 0.05) above normal values from 4.38 to 6.36 ± 0.9mmol O2 kg–1 fish h–1. In progressive anoxic water (PO2 from 130mm Hg to 15mm Hg) resting MO2 decreased by nearly 85% compared with normoxic conditions. This decrease seemed not to be influenced by acute Pb-acetate exposure but to be due to acute oxygen deprivation. Handling (transport from maintenance tanks to respirometers) increased the MO2 by 35%, but this decreased to normal levels (4.38 ± 0.41mmol O2 kg–1 fish h–1) for a standardised (30 gram) fish four to six hours after handling. The percentage of Pb in solution 96 hours after application, decreased linearly in a range of soft to hard water types to less than 1%. Contrary to that in hard water, in soft water, with a pH of 6.28 a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in plasma chlorides (from 144.5mmol Cl to 111.9mmol Cl) was measured in 10mg Pb I–1 water while a significant increase in soluble blood plasma solids (from 5.68g 100ml–1 to 7.14g 100ml–1) was found. No change in bile solids was found for fish exposed to lead ranging from 1–20mg Pb l–1 in soft or hard alkaline water or soft acidic water. It is concluded that resting MO2 and blood chloride values are not influenced by acute Pb concentrations (10 and 20mg l–1) in hard water or soft alkaline water, but that this changes significantly in acidic soft water and may be used as a biomarker in short term (96h) exposure experiments. Progressive anoxia combined with lead exposure further reduces the ability of the gill epithelium to take up oxygen. Precipitated lead in water bodies may potentially be a health hazard for aquatic organisms if it dissolves from the sediment at low pH.",

More recent man-made events included the construction of temporary sand walls, mid-way along the estuary, to allow crossing of a mining dredger during 1993. These walls remained in place until 1996, coinciding with a local drought period between 1991 and late 1995, during which time the estuary mouth remained closed. The present study investigates changes in the zooplankton community of Nhlabane estuary between February 1992 and October 1996. Due to continuous freshwater inputs from groundwater seepage, the then closed estuary soon became fresh. This led to significant changes in the zooplankton community, including the appearance of freshwater taxa such as rotifers, cyclopoids (Mesocyclops sp. and Thermocyclops sp.), freshwater cladocerans and insect larvae, reflecting the freshwater conditions. Most estuarine species became less abundant or were absent two years after mouth closure. The estuarine copepod Pseudodiaptomus hessei was least affected and remained dominant. The copepod Acartia natalensis was absent after the first two sampling sessions and only reappeared after the mouth was breached in August 1995. Other taxa that were adversely affected included the mysid Mesopodopsis africana, and larval stages of polychaetes, decapods and fish. Some meroplankton taxa recovered after the mouth reopened.",

    "abstract": "Abstract As part of the evaluation of new aquaculture species, the effect of environmental factors on growth, food conversion ratio and survival should be tested. In this study silver kob, Argyrosomus inodorus, were reared for 98 days at three salinities, of 15, 25, and 35, at an average water temperature of 18 °C. Fish were fed to satiation twice daily. There were no differences between treatments in mass gain, feed conversion ratio, feeding intensity (% body mass d−1), blood osmolality, or survival. During the first 84 days there was also no difference in length gain (mm d−1) between treatments although the last 14 days of the study suggested a small but significantly higher average length in fish from the 25-salinity treatment. Silver kob grew at a rate of 0.31 to 0.37 mm d−1 and food conversion ratio averaged 2.33 kg food per kg gain at a feeding intensity of 1.6% body mass d−1. Blood osmolality did not differ between fish reared at different salinities. We conclude that silver kob perform at least as well at reduced salinities as in full strength seawater. This could lead to significant cost savings when rearing fish inland using artificial seawater. Keywords: FISH PHYSIOLOGYMARICULTUREMULLOWAYOSMOLALITYSALINITY TOLERANCE",

Biomphalaria glabrata and Bulinus globosus snails were exposed to varying concentrations of aqueous extracts of crushed J. curcas seeds from unripe, ripe and overripe fruits collected from two geographically different sites, (Bindura and Kariba, Zimbabwe). Snail mortalities were compared between different developmental stages of J. curcas and between seed collection areas, and LC50 and LC90 values for the different extracts tested were computed. Biomphalaria glabrata was most susceptible to unripe fruit seed extract (with LC50 values of 282 and 389 mg l−1 being recorded for Kariba-origin and Bindura-origin plants, respectively) and least susceptible to ripe fruit seed extracts (with LC50 values of 605 and 708 mg l−1 being recorded for Kariba-origin and Bindura-origin plants, respectively). Bulinus globosus was most susceptible to overripe fruit seed extract (Kariba-origin plants: LC50, 389 mg l−1) and least susceptible to unripe fruit seed extract (Kariba-origin plants: LC50, 687 mg l−1). The area from which fruits were collected did not influence the potency of J. curcas. The potency of J. curcas depends on both the developmental stage of the fruit and the species of the target snail. In view of its many other uses, besides as a molluscicide, we recommend further studies on J. curcas.",

Fifteen major constraints were found to affect aquaculture production negatively in the study area — the three most severe being the inadequate supply of fish fingerlings, the high cost of fish pond establishment and the lack of awareness of available innovations. Statistically, 11 of the 15 major constraints (the majority of which were production-related) proved significant as deterrent factors to aquaculture production. Qualitative (participatory) analysis also revealed production, marketing and technological groups of constraints as effectively deterring aquaculture production.

The results are compared with the data obtained in 1995 before the dam was constructed. Primary production and nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations from sites upstream and downstream of the dam as well as in the reservoir were compared. Phosphorus fractions were determined in the reservoir's sediment. Electrical conductivity and pH values were higher in 2005 than in 1995, whereas oxygen concentrations were lower. Primary production, nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were lower at stations downstream of the dam than at upstream stations. High fractions of iron- and manganese-bound phosphorus in the reservoir sediment suggest a potential for phosphorus retention. Concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus along the Kihansi River were higher during the dry season than in the wet season. These results contribute to the documented baseline data on environmental changes in tropical river systems after flow diversion and reservoir development.

This preliminary study used physical and biological indicators to determine the quality of the water that ultimately flows into Nylsvley. Significant seasonal differences were found. The observed differences relate to habitat structural differences and human activities in the catchment. Key findings included higher water temperatures during the high-flow period than during the low-flow period. The higher temperatures were accompanied by lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen at all sites. In total, 13 fish species were recorded, with most being found in the pool biotopes. The Nantes site, located nearest to the Nylsvley wetland, had the highest number of fish species, possibly indicating a linkage between these two systems. The most common macroinvertebrate families were the Baetidae, Aeshnidae and Coenagrionidae. It can be assumed that this river acts as an important refuge area for fish and macroinvertebrates from the Nyl River, and therefore it is important to conserve the Olifantspruit.

In the Kariega Estuary, where freshwater inflow was persistently low with little variation in flow, salinity values exceeded 28–30 for long periods (years) throughout the estuary. In the Keiskamma and Great Fish estuaries intermittent floods, coupled to strong and variable baseflows, ensured spatial and temporal variability in salinity distribution. Copepods numerically dominated the zooplankton (95–97%) in all three estuaries. Species richness in the freshwater-starved Kariega Estuary exceeded 35, coupled with reduced variance in abundance and low species dominance at most sites along the estuary. By contrast, the Keiskamma and Great Fish estuaries had relatively few species (21 and 20, respectively), high population variance and high species dominance at most sites. Two mesozooplankton species emerged as possible indicators of freshwater-rich and freshwater-starved estuaries. The copepod Pseudodiaptomus hessei was particularly abundant in the Keiskamma and Great Fish, following the pattern recorded for other estuaries with strong horizontal salinity gradients (>28). By contrast, population density of P. hessei was orders of magnitude lower in the marine-dominated Kariega. The copepod Tortanus capensis was present only in the Kariega Estuary. Characteristically, T. capensis favours upper estuarine reaches or sheltered marine embayments where salinity values consistently remain above c. 33–34 for long periods (months to years). The zooplankton of freshwater-rich estuaries is essentially a subset of the community found in freshwater-starved estuaries, and a reducing supply of fresh water to estuaries leads to estuarine mesozooplankton communities moving along a trajectory of increasing species richness, but decreasing variance and dominance within assemblages.

Ten sites were sampled on three occasions between May and July 2005. A total of 56 macroinvertebrate taxa was collected, 48 from Lagarosiphon and 45 from Vallisneria. Generally, the two plant species were associated with similar macroinvertebrate communities, but the average abundances of most taxa, and thus the overall macroinvertebrate abundances, were significantly greater on Lagarosiphon. The main macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups found on both plant species were collector-gatherers, grazers and predators, all of which were significantly more abundant on Lagarosiphon. Although the macroinvertebrate assemblages associated with Vallisneria and Lagarosiphon generally consisted of the same taxa, there were distinct and significant differences between them, probably due to the architectural differences between the two submerged macrophytes.",

Their intraspecific classification, currently based on geographical distribution and morphological variation, is of limited application due to the overlapping nature of the water systems. Patterns of genetic variation in the Albertine and Victoria drainage basins in Uganda were assessed using mitochondrial sequences of the control region (470 basepairs) and the cytochrome b gene (627 basepairs). At the control region 36 distinct haplotypes were observed in a total of 177 individuals. Relatively low overall nucleotide diversity (π = 0.010) was observed. Hierarchical analysis of the molecular variance revealed significant differentiation between populations in the total sample (F ST = 0.172, p < 0.001), among populations within each basin (F SC = 0.047, p < 0.001), but no significant subdivision among basins (F CT = 0.131, p > 0.05). Phylogenetic analysis of the control region haplotypes resulted in a star-shaped phylogeny, with no clusters that reflect current taxonomic designation, morphotypes or basins. Phylogenetic analysis of cytochrome b gene sequences resulted in a tree topology similar to that observed for the control region. Thus the morphological characteristics separating the two species are intraspecific variation and the whole sample probably belongs to the same species.",

Absolute fecundity ranged from 1 006 to 83 980 (22 421 ± 16 083) oocytes, and mean relative fecundity was 201 ± 162 oocytes g−1 of total body mass. Frequency distributions of oocyte diameter suggested synchronous development, with total spawning. Spawning lasted from June to November, coinciding with peaks in rainfall and flooding. Larger females began spawning about two months before smaller ones.",

Callianassa kraussi was able to survive in salinities of 5–55 over 96 h, whilst C. eulimene survived in 0–55 over the same time period. The 96-hour cadmium LC50 for both species decreased progressively at salinities above and below their respective isosmotic conditions, with the decrease being slightly more pronounced below compared to above isosmotic salinity. A hypo-iso-osmoregulatory strategy was followed by C. kraussi as it hyper-osmoregulated at salinities between 5 and 25 and osmoconformed at salinities greater than 25. Chiromantes eulimene followed a hyper-hypo-osmoregulatory strategy; it hyper-regulated in salinities from 0 up to isosmotic conditions at about 28 (c. 780 mOsm kg−1), followed by hypo-regulation up to 55. The effect of cadmium exposure on the osmoregulatory capacity of C. kraussi was more pronounced at hyper-regulating salinities (5–25) whilst on C. eulimene the influence was more pronounced at salinities above the isosmotic point (28). The influence of salinity and cadmium on both survival and osmoregulation of the two crustaceans are discussed by outlining the chemical and physiological mechanisms involved.

Whereas monitoring these rivers is required to detect biodiversity losses, record pollution events and devise mitigation strategies, current monitoring programmes are inadequate. In 2009, the South African Earth Observation Network initiated an intensive long-term research programme on the Lowveld reaches of the Olifants River. Physico-chemical parameters, aquatic macroinvertebrates and fish abundances were recorded at four Lowveld sites in the Olifants River. We review six years of this programme. The results suggest deterioration in the ecological condition of the Olifants River with no discernible improvement through protected areas. Trends could not be detected. The parameters measured, sampling methods and/or sampling frequency might be responsible for the limited trends observed, or alternatively the results simply reflect stable conditions despite on-going pollution. Real time monitoring and an expansion in the parameters monitored would add value to the monitoring programme.",

Water, sediment and fish samples were collected for six months and heavy metals were determined using an Atomic Absorption Spectrometer. Fe ranked highest in water and sediment, with concentrations of 2.74 mg l−1 and 61.60 mg kg−1, respectively.

The mean values measured for Secchi depth, nitrate, total phosphorus and Chlorophyll a showed significant seasonal variation (p < 0.05). Based on the Carlson trophic state index, the results show that Lake Baringo is eutrophic. However, the lake is also experiencing phosphorus limitation and poor light penetration, because of high turbidity, which is more pronounced during the wet season.",

Each site was characterised in terms of water quality (pH, conductivity and turbidity) and general characteristics, including impacts such as density of non-native riparian trees. At the family level, aquatic macroinvertebrate communities showed variation between sites and seasons. Differences were more pronounced on the basis of natural land cover type (fynbos versus indigenous forest) than densities of non-native invasive riparian vegetation. Conservation of these river systems will depend on maintaining a mosaic of natural vegetation types.",

Seventy-one (71) catfish and 81 tilapia were caught using gill nets, and samples of their gills, liver, kidney and stomach tissue were collected and assessed microscopically for manifestations of disease. Pathologies observed in the gills of tilapia and catfish from both lakes included lamellar fusion, hyperplasia of primary lamellar epithelium and disintegration of secondary lamellar epithelium. Liver histopathology revealed vacuolation, presence of melanomacrophage centres and inflammatory cell infiltration in catfish and vacuolation in tilapia from both lakes. There were no significant differences (Chi-squared-test, p > 0.05) in the frequency of occurrence of some histological lesions in tissues assessed for the unrelated catfish and tilapia in the two lakes. Lamellar fusion in the gills conjoined neighbouring lamellae suggests the presence of parasites. Melanomacrophage centres observed in catfish may reflect metal pollution. Observed lesions in populations from both lakes suggest exposure to similar stressors and high tolerances and adaptation to eutrophic conditions.",

Many of these microsystems (i.e. micro-outlets and micro-estuaries) share some characteristics with temporarily open/closed estuaries, but differ in that they are supplied by localised catchments with limited supply of freshwater and less connectivity to the marine environment. Between 2015 and 2016 we investigated whether micro-outlets and micro-estuaries can be differentiated from each other and other estuaries based on physico-chemical properties, microalgal dynamics, as well as species diversity and composition of invertebrate communities. The micro-outlets were dominated by oligohaline or freshwater conditions, whereas micro-estuaries were mostly mesohaline. Microalgal biomass in both system types was influenced by temperature, nutrient concentration and light availability. The micro-estuaries had a higher microalgal biomass than the micro-outlets. Chironomidae and Ephemeroptera numerically dominated benthic macroinvertebrate micro-outlet communities, whereas Amphipoda and Mysida were most dominant in micro-estuaries. Calanoid copepods dominated zooplankton assemblages in micro-estuaries and macroinvertebrate larvae in micro-outlets. In addition, the zooplankton densities were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in micro-estuaries compared with micro-outlets. Study results confirm that there are major differences between the biota in the two microsystem types, accordingly making biotic assemblages, together with physico-chemical parameters, a viable tool for differentiating between micro-estuaries and micro-outlets.Keywords: benthic macroinvertebratesEastern Capemicroalgaezooplankton",

Clinical and post-mortem examinations were performed in situ on fish samples collected monthly from the Abo-Saleh, Ehnasia fish farm and Nile River.

Cadmium concentrations in water and musculatures of Oreochromis niloticus obtained from the Ehnasia fish farm was significantly higher than the permissible limit, whereas cadmium concentrations in the Abo-Saleh fish farm and Nile River were within the permissible limit. There were increased levels of cadmium in human blood and creatinine and uric acid in human serum, but decreased levels in calcium in serum of human consumers of fish from the Ehnasia fish farm.

Multi-response permutation procedures (MRPP) analysis was used to compare vegetation communities under low and high floods. Soil pH, Na, Mg, K, Ca and P content were analysed. The influence of environmental variables on species distribution was investigated using non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMS) ordination. Total plant species richness decreased from 88 during low flood to 53 during high flood, and community co-dominant species changed during high flood. Mean percentage cover decreased for some species, but increased for others. Hydroperiod increased in all zones. During the high flood period the content of Na and K was highest in Zone 8 (tertiary floodplain); Ca, Mg and pH content was highest in Zones 6 and 8 (secondary and tertiary floodplains, respectively), while P was highest in Zone 5. Hydroperiod, Na and pH were found to be correlated with, and are therefore thought to influence, community composition and distribution.",

    "abstract": "Direct and indirect effects of climate change on amphibians include range shifts and changes in community structure. The Natal cascade frog Hadromophryne natalensis has an altitudinal range of some 2 400 m in KwaZulu-Natal, and presents an opportunity to assess how increased water temperatures may impact on widely distributed amphibians. We sampled populations of tadpoles at three sites near the upper and lower altitudinal extremes of their range, measuring total length, mass and habitat water temperatures. Except for the spring survey, frequency–size class data showed bimodal curves at the two high-altitude sites and unimodal curves at the low-altitude site, suggesting a two-year aquatic life cycle in the cooler, higher rivers and a one-year life cycle at the warmer site. These data were consistent with cumulative degree days, which doubled from the higher- to the lower-altitude sites. Tadpoles at the warmer, lower-altitude site were in worse condition than those at the cooler, higher-altitude sites. We hypothesise that, while thermal changes may not result in rapid, large range shifts for this species, there are a number of unknown variables that may result from potential reductions in life-cycle length, including changes in competitive behaviour and community structure linked to asynchronies between species.",

Mussels were found in the rocky intertidal at the mouth of the estuary and on all man-made hard substrata as far as 12 km from the mouth in 2013. However, mussel beds were found only in the lower reach of the estuary, where mussel densities were as high as 120 per 0.01 m2. When compared to mussels from the embayment regions of the estuary, those at the estuary mouth, where wave action was high, were generally smaller, had significantly lower condition and gonad indices, and greater attachment strength. This suggests that mussels within the sheltered regions of the estuary invest more energy in growth and reproduction, and that this is one reason for their success as an invasive species in the Knysna estuarine embayment.",

Sixty-three species and varieties of diatoms belonging to 32 genera were identified, of which twelve are reported for the first time in Senegambia. The genera most represented were Nitzschia (10 species), Eunotia (9 species) and Pinnularia (6 species). The microflora was characterised by a dominance of epipelic, epiphytic and aerophilic species. Diatom assemblage analyses, combined with lithological core data, showed that the pond has remained very shallow throughout its evolution. The disappearance of acidophilic species and the development of mesosaprobes and mesoeutrophic alkaliphilic species in the upper part of the core can be attributed to organic pollution caused by human activities, which resulted in eutrophication of the pond waters since the beginning of the 20th century.",

    "abstract": "South African estuarine systems are becoming increasingly altered by anthropogenic and environmental factors, but the consequences of such changes for these systems are still not fully understood. The most common approach for evaluating the ecological status of aquatic systems is studying their associated foodwebs. Due to their high abundance and important ecological role, the larvae of estuarine round herring Gilchristella aestuaria (Gilchrist, 1913) are key candidates for examining the foodweb structure and function of southern African estuaries. The foodwebs and trophic interactions of G. aestuaria larvae in six estuaries in South Africa were compared using larvae sampled in November 2013 and analysed using δ13C and δ15N and Bayesian isotopic mixing models. The main prey type for G. aestuaria larvae in all estuaries was zooplankton. We found a high similarity among the Kariega, Gamtoos, Great Fish and Sundays estuaries in terms of consumers and potential sources for both δ13C and δ15N signatures. Significant differences were found in δ13C values among marine-dominated estuaries, such as the Kromme Estuary, and the more freshwater-dominated systems. In addition, in the Kromme Estuary particulate organic matter was very important in the diet of G. aestuaria larvae. Our results suggest that both food availability and physical environmental parameters strongly affect the diet and condition of G. aestuaria and, consequently, the entire foodweb in the system.",

    "abstract": "The geological structure and longitudinal nature of river systems provide a possible barrier to the dispersal of lotic organisms. This has the potential to drive evolutionary processes such as genetic differentiation and subsequent allopatric speciation. In the conservation of lotic ecosystems population and evolutionary processes have largely been ignored. The traditional approach to river conservation has been focussed toward maintaining the physical habitat that provides the template for the biota. With a shift toward recognising the catchment as the primary operational unit for the conservation and management of lotic systems an examination of the biological relevance of these catchment units is required. This paper examines the structural influence of catchment units over population structure in lotic organisms and the extent to which catchments reflect populations and represent evolutionarily significant units. These being unique assemblages representing segments of biological diversity that share a common evolutionary lineage and contain the potential for a unique evolutionary future. This is of particular importance given the increased use of inter-basin water transfers to move water between historically isolated catchments and recognition of the catchment as the primary unit for the conservation and management of river ecosystems.",

These factors have severely impacted on the fauna of the aquatic systems in the area, particularly the fish but also the macrocrustacea and benthos. Preliminary results show that the structure of the interlinked marine-estuarine-river-coastal lakes ecosystem has been disrupted due to a cessation of migratory movements by the fauna which cannot cross the barriers. It is concluded that the construction of fishways will substantially contribute to reducing the current impacts and that the possibility exists that most will be in place within the next two to three years",

Snail species included numerically dominant Bulinus globosus (ca 85%) as well as B. tropicus, Biomphalaria pfeifferi, Lymnaea natalensis and Melanoides tuberculata. Six fish species were present in the ponds prior to the start of the experiment; these were Tilapia rendalli, Oreochromis mossambicus, O. macrochir, Clarias gariepinus, Kneria auriculata and an unidentified Labeo species. At the beginning of the experiment 85 Sargochromis codringtonii were introduced into the pond. All fish species were periodically monitored by seine netting and the stomach contents of a sample of these was analysed. For the first five months of the experiment Bulinus globosus numbers were low, both inside the fish exclosures and in the adjacent control areas but, from April 2001 onwards, snail numbers inside the exclosures were consistently higher than those in the control areas. At the end of the experiment the density of B. globosus was 150.5snails m−2 in the exclosures and 4.7snails m−2 in the control areas. The other snail species showed the same trend, but the differences were less pronounced. Sargochromis codringtonii was the only fish species that was found to feed on snails and since this species became successfully established in the pond it was assumed to be responsible for the snail mortality outside the exclosures. Whilst this experimental design did not separate the effects of S. codringtonii from those of the other fish species, it does provide strong evidence that fish are important in the control of B. globosus, an intermediate host for schistosomiasis.",

Human activities such as mining, industry, agriculture, rural and urban settlements are currently responsible for the deterioration of the ecological integrity of this river system. Habitat degradation was especially evident in the upper reaches of the Waterval River, as indicated by the South African Scoring System, version 4, Average Score Per Taxon and Biotic Integrity scores. In general, the ratings achieved were lower than those expected for the available habitat, which suggests that human activities have influenced the biotic community.

    "abstract": "Seasonal and diurnal stratification patterns were studied in two small Zimbabwe reservoirs. The water level of the upper reservoir fluctuated more than that of the lower one and theoretical water retention times were 9 days and 3.6 days, respectively. Rainfall is seasonal but water demand for irrigation and potable water persist throughout the year. There was a distinct cycle of seasonal thermal stratification with associated deoxygenation, but this was not as stable or pronounced as in some larger Zimbabwean reservoirs. Weaker thermal stratification was established during the winter. Seasonal trends were related to changes in incoming solar radiation and the corresponding changes in air temperatures. Diurnal cycles of thermal stratification and oxygen occurred in both reservoirs throughout the year, but were less established during the winter months. The frequent mixing recorded is a significant finding because, if there is mature sediment in such reservoirs, there may be a rapid exchange of nutrients between sediments and the water, leading to high overall productivity. The shallow nature of small reservoirs and the considerable fluctuations in their water levels makes them more vulnerable to external fluxes such as daily changes in incoming short-wave solar radiation and wind runs, and hence the prevalence of diel stratification regimes. Consequently, small reservoirs are characterised by low thermal stability as compared to larger, deeper reservoirs. Diurnal heat fluxes were observed in both reservoirs accounting for their weak thermal stability. Birgean energy budgets for these reservoirs were small (11.6 and 54.3 MJ m−2 yr−1 for the upper and lower reservoirs, respectively). Reasons for this are that their small size severely limits their capacity to capture and retain heat energy and, although not quantified in this study, high evaporation rates contribute to low energy budgets in tropical waterbodies as compared to temperate ones.",

National interests have historically been promoted at the expense of regional interests. This is largely due to differences in development history and contemporary socio-economic priorities.

Cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling ordination also demonstrated little spatial variation in the community composition of the two streams. In contrast, the clearfelling index indicated that taxonomic richness and Ephemeroptera/Plecoptera/Trichoptera (EPT) taxa richness were negatively affected by forest conversion. Taxonomic richness and EPT richness were negatively correlated with embeddedness, the single tangible evidence of forestry impact. Development of a multimetric index may enhance detection of subtle changes in macroinvertebrate communities resulting from modest alteration of the riparian vegetation.",

Samples were collected from fifteen sites representing different lake sectors along the main channel of the lake during 2016−2017. Approximately 103 species were recorded, belonging to six different classes, dominated by Cyanobacteria, Bacillariophyceae, Chlorophyceae, whereas Euglenophyceae, Dinophyceae and Chrysophyceae were rare. Based on the abundance of phytoplankton species, the pre-flood and post-flood seasons were very well discriminated. A major blooming of Cyanobacteria in the Tushka sector was detected during the pre-flood season, whereas this phenomenon diminished in the post-flood period when Bacillariophyceae and Chlorophyceae appeared. The results of this study indicated that the most important factors affecting phytoplankton species distribution during pre-flood and post-flood seasons are temperature, nutrients and total dissolved solids. The study confirms that flood regime substantially affects the phytoplankton abundance and distribution in Lake Nasser.",

    "abstract": "Irrigation ponds are increasingly abundant globally, particularly in water-stressed countries with limited natural surface waters, yet knowledge of their ecology is limited. Here, we assessed zooplankton, macroinvertebrate, and littoral fish communities from irrigation ponds located in the Sundays River Valley in South Africa. This study assessed the seasonal community patterns in response to physico-chemical and biotic components. Water temperature, water depth, Secchi depth, and ammonium concentrations differed significantly across seasons. Similarly, Chlorophyll-a concentrations differed seasonally, with water transparency identified as the main driver. Zooplankton was dominated by Rotifera, Copepoda and Cladocera. Seasonal changes in temperature and subsequent fluctuations in water levels resulted in changes in zooplankton community. Macroinvertebrates were dominated by insects, notably the families Corixidae and Naucoridae. The littoral fish community comprised of Glossogobius callidus, Oreochromis mossambicus and Gambusia affinis. Zooplankton, macroinvertebrates and littoral fish abundances, species richness, diversity and assemblage composition differed significantly across seasons with temperature identified as the main driver of these differences. This study demonstrates that bottom-up processes are the dominant drivers of the irrigation pond communities in the Sundays River Valley and highlights the relevance of seasonal abiotic drivers in structuring these communities, particularly G. callidus and G. affinis.",

They are important for navigation, water supplies, agriculture, recreation, and industrial development and help to regulate changes in climate and support social, spiritual, educational, and ecosystem health services. These ecosystems are, however, facing both natural and anthropogenic threats. Anthropogenic threats are driven by population increase, economic development, and catchment degradation. They are now the most threatened resources worldwide, and in Africa in particular. To design proper management strategies, the causes and impacts of the threats must be properly diagnosed. Monitoring and assessment approaches that show degradation and integrate it over time are essential to generate data and information required by water managers for decision making. Biomonitoring using macroinvertebrates is an effective tool in this regard, because it integrates causes of degradation and aquatic biotic responses to the impacts thereof. This review summarises the needs, challenges, and legal implications of biomonitoring in Africa using lessons from countries with successful biomonitoring as benchmarks.",

As a bloom developed in May 2004, a shift to dominance by Microcystis aeruginosa, similar to competitive exclusion, was observed. The period of M. aeruginosa dominance was characterised by the lowest Secchi depth and euphotic zone depth readings, and a decline of non-buoyant species because of competitive exclusion by M. aeruginosa, which reduced light availability in the water column. After the bloom collapsed, the euphotic zone depth increased, followed by the establishment of a Cryptomonas–Cyclotella phytoplankton assemblage. Cyanobacterial dominance within the phytoplankton assemblage was favoured by an extended stratification and was limited by nitrogen (mainly ammonium) availability. Other taxa were limited by light availability, as shown by their decline when M. aeruginosa dominated. The period of extended stratification, an increase in ammonium concentration and a decrease in nitrate concentration promoted dominance by M. aeruginosa.",

The proximity of the pond to the Atlantic Ocean had a dual effect on the diatom assemblage. Marine to brackish-water diatoms were transferred by wind and birds, and salinity increased over time, due to the rising level of saline groundwater. The alkalinity of the pond increased over time, due to the progressive destruction of the natural vegetation of the pond as a consequence of cultivation.",

Previous studies revealed substantial morphological and molecular variation among populations, suggesting they constitute a species complex. The present study utilised phylogenetic and population structure analyses of molecular sequence data from mitochondrial (cytochrome b) and nuclear (S7 intron 1) DNA markers to evaluate the genetic structure of the species. Two reproductively isolated lineages, 8.7% and 1.1% divergent, respectively, were identified. Lineage 1 represented the true G. callidus distributed mainly among estuarine systems including the type locality (Bushmans River, Eastern Cape, South Africa). Lineage 2 probably represents a cryptic species that is likely to be widespread in tropical and subtropical regions. Pairwise comparisons of both genetic markers within lineages detected high genetic diversity and numbers of private haplotypes. Mozambican haplotypes were divergent (2.7%, cyt b) and restricted to Lineage 2. Both datasets identified a shallow but consistent phylogeographic break between warm-temperate/subtropical and tropical regions. Analysis of Lineage 1 recovered three geographic groups in the warm-temperate region that could be associated with isolation of upper reaches resulting from past river capture and sea level changes. These results are indicative of a complex history of isolation and reconnection in river drainages and/or multiple colonisation events.Keywords: cryptic species cytochrome b genetic structurephylogeography S7 intron 1",

In aquatic environments, it can disrupt the endocrine system and adversely affect the reproductive function of aquatic animals. This study investigated sublethal impacts of carbaryl on embryos and gonads of zebrafish Danio rerio in order to assess the pesticide's impact on its reproduction. Fertilised embryos were exposed to 1.7 mg l–1 carbaryl until hatching, while larvae aged 10 days post hatching were exposed to 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.7 mg l–1 carbaryl concentrations until 50 days post hatching (dph). Treatments were applied in a static renewal system and all experiments involved water only and a solvent control. At the end of 50 dph, all surviving fish were sacrificed and processed for light microscopy. Results indicated a mean hatching success rate of 92.5% for control groups, while embryos exposed to carbaryl recorded an 81.0% success rate. Sex reversal was delayed in the experimental groups, with a sex ratio of 13 females to 0 males, but the control group recorded 6 females to 8 males. These results suggest that sublethal doses of carbaryl in the environment, similar to those used in the current study, may have an adverse effect on the reproductive success of zebrafish.",

Total biomass fluctuated seasonally, generally declining from spring to winter through the annual cycle, but also appeared to decline progressively through the study. On overall average, total biomass was high (0.51 mg l–1 or 2.39 g m–2 DW), with Daphnia accounting for ∼40%. Total volumetric biomass was invariably higher in shallow nearshore than offshore locations (average time-paired ratio = 8.1), with comparably large-bodied Daphnia (geometric mean ∼1.2 mm, largest individuals ∼1.75 mm) in both habitats, contra-indicating substantive opportunistic zooplanktivory by juvenile fish. Zooplankton was dominated numerically (ind. l–1, overall average values) by cyclopoid copepods, mostly Thermocyclops (47.1 nauplii and 86.5 copepodites), plausibly favoured by their selective raptorial feeding mode. Cladoceran densities were lower — Daphnia (25.0), Bosmina (7.1), Ceriodaphnia (2.9) and sporadically occurring Moina and Chydorus (<0.5). Seasonal replacement of Daphnia by small-bodied cladocerans during late summer and into autumn was evident in near-monthly samples between July 2009 and June 2010. The findings reflect negligible zooplanktivory in Rietvlei, ruling out top-down biomanipulation prospects for its remedial management.

Gravel was preferred by caenid mayflies and chironomids, plastic by odonates, and brick by potamonautid crabs. Colonisation rates were rapid, with half the substrate-specific asymptotic diversity and richness being attained within a week. Overall, taxon richness on the substrates was similar to that in samples collected with a sweep net, but diversity was almost half. Taxon richness was found to be highest on the gravel and brick substrates, and lowest on plastic. By contrast, macroinvertebrate communities on the plastic and mixed substrates were the most diverse and the most even. All substrates, with the exception of gravel, showed that the number of odonates was significantly positively correlated with the number of potential prey that included chironomid midges, caenid mayflies and caddisfly larvae. It is recommended that plastic be used to construct artificial substrates if a high macroinvertebrate diversity is required for monitoring purposes within lentic environments.",

Physicochemical water parameters, plankton and fish growth were monitored on a daily and/or bi-weekly basis.

Phytoplankton biomass, based on Chl a concentration, and daily primary productivity increased with increasing rabbit densities. Optimum density was in the range of 800 to 1 200 rabbits ha−1 of pond. A density of 1 200 rabbits ha−1 of pond gave the highest fish yield, 3.3 t ha−1 y−1 and the lowest ammonia level, and 800 gave the best environment for fish and plankton in terms of concentrations of Chl a and dissolved oxygen.

Fish and aquatic macroinvertebrate data from previous studies and recent river surveys were used in analyses of species richness and turnover. Fish proved to be not useful for mapping biodiversity patterns, as measured by turnover, whereas aquatic macroinvertebrate species patterns exhibited predictable patterns of turnover with downstream distance. Average turnover rates could be decomposed into turnover of common ('core') species, which were accelerated by presence of rare and narrow-range species. Disruptions to the river continuum impacted on the rate of turnover. Consistent with other research on South African rivers, aquatic macroinvertebrate communities could be grouped into upland versus lowland assemblages, and also be defined by longitudinal zones.

    "abstract": "The water quality and phytoplankton community assemblage of the Khami River, a tropical river sub catchment in semi-arid southwest Zimbabwe impacted by agriculture and urban land use, were examined in March 2015. Conductivity, sulphates, total dissolved solids and salinity were higher at urban sampling points than at agricultural sampling points. In contrast, agricultural sampling points were more turbid, and had a greater content of nitrates than urban sampling points. The phytoplankton community was dominated by Cyanobacteria, mainly Microcystis aeruginosa, with densities of up to 20 times higher at urban than at agricultural sampling points. There was an increasing dominance of Cyanobacteria (M. aerugionosa and Merismopedia glauca) and Chlorophyta (Eudorina elegans, Spirogyra sp. and Pediastrum duplex) and a decreasing importance of Bacillariophyta along the agriculture-to-urban gradient. Given the increasing scarcity of water in southern Africa, not only do our findings confirm the importance of land use types as drivers of water quality and phytoplankton community composition and structure. However, they also show that Cyanobacteria, Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta can be indicators of changes in water quality, factors that will prove pertinent to management for effective water quality management using phytoplankton composition as bioindicators.",

The lake zooplankton community was species poor. Mesocyclops bosumtwii was numerically superior seasonally and interannually and was endemic to the lake. Minor constituents included Moina micrura, six rotifer species (except for Hexarthra intermedia) and Chaoborus ceratopogones larvae. Low variance of cyanobacteria-dominated phytoplankton biomass underlined stable zooplankton community structure. Emergence of rare species of rotifers occurred seasonally. The climatic signature on the lake's stratification and mixing regime was strongly influenced by atmospheric temperature, but weakly by wind strength, because of sheltering of the lake by high crater walls. Increasing mixing depth entrained high TP concentrations from below the thermocline seasonally, but reflected poorly in the phytoplankton biomass behaviour. Total zooplankton abundance did not differ seasonally, but varied markedly from year to year in its timing and magnitude. Herbivores were squeezed between food limitation and high predation pressure from Chaoborus all year round. The low fish planktivory (high fishing pressure) on Chaoborus may create a trophic bottleneck restricting energy transfer efficiency from zooplankton to fish.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe Seteni Estuary is a small temporarily open/closed estuary (TOCE) in South Africa under the influence of agricultural practices. While the general significance of microalgae to estuarine production is widely recognised, the factors regulating microalgal biomass in these heterogeneous systems are less well understood, particularly when man-induced pressures are superimposed on natural variability. This study investigated microalgal responses to physico-chemical variability in the nutrient-enriched Seteni Estuary in 2008–2009. Microphytobenthic biomass ranged from 1.1 to 91.7 mg Chl a m-2, while phytoplankton biomass varied between 0.22 and 18 mg Chl a m-3. Despite the high dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations recorded, salinity and rainfall were identified as the main environmental drivers, highlighting the importance of allochthonous inputs. While this system appears to function as a typical TOCE, the relatively low microalgal biomass recorded may be an artifact of several factors such as phosphorus limitation, herbicide treatment, etc., acting singly or together to depress biomass levels. However, should the balance be upset, the most probable result would be a dramatic increase in microalgal biomass, to the point where harmful algal blooms may ensue. The system therefore needs to be closely monitored to prevent further degradation.Keywords: euphotic depthmacronutrient availabilitymicrophytobenthosphytoplanktonseasonality",

Although the South American moth Niphograpta albiguttalis was released in South Africa in 1990 as a biological control agent against water hyacinth, no post-release evaluations have yet been conducted here. The impact of N. albiguttalis on water hyacinth growth was quantified under low-, medium- and high-nutrient concentrations in a greenhouse experiment. Niphograpta albiguttalis was damaging to water hyacinth in all three nutrient treatments, but significant damage in most plant parameters was found only under high-nutrient treatments. However, E. crassipes plants grown in high-nutrient water were healthier, and presumably had higher fitness, than plants not exposed to herbivory at lower-nutrient levels. Niphograpta albiguttalis is likely to be most damaging to water hyacinth in eutrophic water systems, but the damage will not result in acceptable levels of control because of the plant's high productivity under these conditions. Niphograpta albiguttalis is a suitable agent for controlling water hyacinth infestations in eutrophic water systems, but should be used in combination with other biological control agents and included in an integrated management plan also involving herbicidal control and water quality management.",

The system is one of the most important coastal wetlands in North Africa, especially as an over-wintering area for migratory birds, particularly Palaearctic waterfowl. The present study was aimed at diagnosing the status of fish species in Lake Ichkeul and documenting their annual and seasonal occurrence within the system. Fish samples were collected monthly at 22 sites from March 2011 to April 2012 using a variety of gears, including a dragnet, gillnet, trammelnet, frynet and beach-seine. Temperature and salinity measurements were taken at each site, while fishes were obtained from only 11 sites, representing mainly lacustrine stations. A total of 18 fish species belonging to 14 genera and 12 families were identified, with Mugilidae dominating with four species, followed by Syngnathidae with three species. This study represents a relative recovery in terms of fish species richness, since only 13 species were recorded here between 2003 and 2007. However, the numbers of fish caught, especially of the commercial taxa, seem to have declined in recent years, and the number of species currently present is much lower than that of several decades ago. Increasing human pressures, particularly reductions in catchment freshwater inputs, a breakdown in ecosystem connectivity, pollution and over-fishing appear to be the principal causes for the decline in fish abundance and diversity.",

The decline from 2004 to 2007 in both species recorded and densities of freshwater, estuarine and marine species during the initial closed period was linked to increased salinity, lack of recruitment and reduced estuarine surface area. Increased wave action and high seas following Cyclone Gamede opened the mouth in March 2007 after a 57-month closed period, resulting in recruitment of marine species, predominantly P. indicus, followed by a decline in densities after reclosure in August 2007. Increases in marine and freshwater species were evident after Mfolozi flood connections during 2008, 2009 and 2010. Highest densities were recorded after breaching in 2007 and after flood connections, highlighting the importance of a marine link to maintain the recruitment of penaeid species.",

A full parasitological assessment was conducted on 86 fish, representing 14 species in six families sampled in August 2011. Parasite diversity was low and dominated by species with complex life cycles involving intermediate hosts. Most prevalent were larval nematodes (Contracaecum sp.) infecting 12 and Trypanasoma sp. infecting nine of the 14 host species. The intra-erythrocytic parasite Babesiosoma mariae was found in the blood of Coptodon rendalli and Oreochromis andersonii with prevalence of 50% and 60%, respectively. The host-specific monogenean Annulotrema hepseti was recorded only from H. cuvieri with a prevalence of 100%. Notable absences were the copepod and branchiuran parasites that have direct lifecycles and usually occur in high prevalence and abundance in the region. Because parasites with direct life cycles can only be transported into the lake on the host fish, their absence suggests limited immigration of infected fishes into the lake. This suggests that internal recruitment dominates over immigration in the fish population dynamics in Lake Liambezi.",

As part of the support for that application and to help guide the resulting management plan, the eco-social holistic environmental flow assessment model DRIFT was set up for the Marsh. The aim was to predict the response of the Marsh to scenarios of changing water and sediment inflows, and to different levels of harvesting of its natural resources, in order to identify threats to and viable options for sustaining its biodiversity. The results of the DRIFT assessment provided three main points of guidance for the RAMSAR application and the subsequent development of a management plan. First, it was shown the Marsh has been fairly resilient to short-term changes in the inflows of water and sediments, having endured significant fluctuations in both in its history, and was able to recover in terms of biodiversity from extreme dry periods. Second, it was revealed that conservation efforts to protect biodiversity should concentrate on the central, eastern and southern areas, as they were less vulnerable to decreases in water flows than the other areas of the Marsh. Third, restricting access to some parts of the Marsh, in particular the core eastern, central and southern areas, could markedly improve its overall condition, increase many of its resources and improve its resilience to Climate Change. Of the access restrictions assessed, the greatest benefit to the ecological integrity of the Marsh would be achieved if all access to the central area was stopped, and if access to the eastern and southern areas was reduced to 50% of the 2014 baseline levels.",

The desertion of a saltpan at the Swartkops Estuary, South Africa has left behind a large area of desiccated hypersaline sediment and a sharp decrease in waterbird abundance and diversity. Here, we explore the potential for restoring this saltpan’s wetland function using stormwater inflow to support multiple ecosystem services and improve estuary health. Stormwater will be able to flow into the saltpan as a passive restoration approach that can maintain the site as a wetland habitat. This will contribute to improving the health of a nationally important, yet highly degraded, estuary by retaining 758 ML of stormwater to achieve full capacity, containing an estimated 2908 kg of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and 68 kg of dissolved inorganic nitrogen. Additional ecosystem services such as biodiversity maintenance, carbon storage and societal values can be expected. However, this would create a novel hypersaline stormwater wetland and a strategic adaptive management approach will be required. Management must be guided by monitoring, which should comprise collection of basic environmental data to establish a baseline condition, and against which, long term changes and responses resulting from stochastic events can be assessed and mitigated through the use of achievable ecological restoration targets.",

    "abstract": "The artificial propagation of commercially important fish species in Ethiopia is constrained by high mortality rate at the early stage of larval rearing and a subsequent poor growth performance during later stages. This is mainly due to absence of live feeds suited to the requirements of the larvae of the species. Although not organized, several studies have indicated that microalgae, copepods, cladocerans and rotifers are the dominant inhabitants in several water bodies that are the precursors in the larviculture of commercially important finfishes in the world. However, apart from studying the abundance and diversity of these important planktonic organisms, efforts made to culture any of them for use in the larviculture of commercially important fish species in Ethiopia is minimal. This may be due to the lack of comprehensive and organized information on the distribution and abundance of these important species in the context of their potential in aquaculture of live feeds in Ethiopia. The objective of this review is therefore to compile the available information on the abundance and distribution of the major potential live feed organisms in the Ethiopian water bodies with a special emphasis on freshwater live feed organisms currently used in larviculture of commercially important freshwater finfishes. In line with this, four potential live feeds (i.e. microalgae, rotifers, copepods and cladocerans) were included in the review. It is hoped that the review will provide baseline information for future research in the culture of economically important larval live feeds.",

In this study, water sampling was done at eight upstream sites in the Kuja River catchment, Kenya, between October 2016 and April 2017, specifically to test for residue levels of the organochlorine pesticide, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p′-DDT), and its degradation products, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p′-DDE) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (p,p′-DDD). The analysis was performed with gas chromatography coupled with electron-capture detection in an autosampler. Concentrations of these residues in the surface water samples ranged from below detection limit (BDL) to 1.1113 μg l-1 in the wet season, and from BDL to 2.007 μg l-1 in the dry season. Overall, the highest mean residue concentration was for p,p′-DDT (0.9669 ± 0.2994 μg l-1). The lowest mean concentration in the dry season was that of p,p′-DDE (0.1824 ± 0.0964 μg l-1), and in the wet season it was p,p′-DDD (0.0610 ± 0.0038 μg l-1). From our results it is evident that DDT is still in use and detectable in the study area, though the mean levels detected were below the acceptable thresholds for natural water as suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO). Except for a slightly higher mean spatial distribution of the metabolite p,p′-DDT, the resides were recorded as below the maximum admissible concentrations of pesticide residues in drinking water, as set out in WHO guidelines and by Kenya's National Environment Management Authority (NEMA). Monitoring organochlorine pesticide contamination levels in Kenya's water resources should be scaled up to leverage potential for a sustainable blue economy and in safeguarding human and environmental health.Keywords: electroo-capture detectioogas chromatographyglobal standardsKuja Rivernatural surface waterorganochlorinesseasooal differences",

    "abstract": "AbstractDuring 2012, aerial photographs of the Vaal River, South Africa, showed differences in water colour on either side of the Lethabo Weir. Water upstream of the weir was muddy brown, while water downstream was olive-green. Physical and chemical analyses indicated water quality differences upstream and downstream from the weir; furthermore, microscopic examination of water samples revealed that the colour difference were the result of different types of phytoplankton blooms. The upstream section was dominated by cryptophytes and green algae, while the downstream section experienced a cyanobacterial bloom dominated by Microcystis aeruginosa. The same phenomenon was again observed regularly between 2012 and 2022, and routine monitoring of the phytoplankton assemblage likewise indicated differences in the phytoplankton community composition upstream and downstream of the weir. The upstream section was characterised by various eukaryotic algae; in contrast, frequent and intensive cyanobacteria blooms occurred in the downstream section. Multivariate analyses showed a correlation between the different phytoplankton assemblages and physico-chemical properties of the river water. Many freshwater cyanobacteria and algae taxa are problematic: Microcystis and Dolichospermum produce potent cyanotoxins; flagellated green algae, cryptomonads and dinoflagellates produce substances that cause bad tastes and odours, plus the cells can cause floc disruption during drinking water treatment processes; and certain filamentous green algae and diatoms are known for clogging filters.Keywords: algaecyanobacteriadrinking water treatmentphysico-chemical propertiestoxinswater-quality management",

    "abstract": "This paper attempts to address some of the problems that are faced in the endeavour to minimise the time and financial costs of environmental monitoring. At the same time, it aims to assess the usefulness to freshwater studies of some of the advances being made in the marine sciences. The paper examines the results obtained and the conclusions drawn using several recognised techniques for measuring aquatic macroinvertebrate communities. The physical, chemical and macroinvertebrate data used were collected upstream and downstream of a land-based trout farm situated on a tributary of the Elands River in the Molenaars River catchment, south-western Cape, South Africa. Five measures of community stress were examined to determine the extent to which they summarised community changes in response to the trout farm effluent. They ranged from those requiring quantitative sampling and species-level identification to those requiring only qualitative sampling and an ability to distinguish between taxa. The results obtained suggest that: the incorporation of an abundance measurement can greatly enhance the sensitivity of an index; combining the results from different microhabitats can artificially inflate the scores obtained at a site; change in community structure following a perturbation may be more marked at higher taxonomic levels, because the community response is more evident above the natural environmental noise; identification to resolution lower than family (e.g. order) may result in important information being missed, and increase the chances of the effects of a perturbation going unnoticed. It is concluded that quantitative or semi-quantitative family-level data probably represent the best compromise between the costs of collecting and processing the samples, and the information content of the resultant data, but that the use of several different techniques would enhance the reliability of the conclusions drawn. In addition, it is recommended that some of the advances being made in the marine sciences, such as the 'marine' ranked Abundance Biomass Curves (ABCs) should be developed and implemented, since they can provide a much needed functional underpinning for results obtained.",

Bronkhorstspruit Dam was an amictic, mesotrophic impoundment, while Hartbeespoort and Roodeplaat Dams were both monomictic, eutrophic impoundments. Bronkhorstspruit Dam had the best water quality and the smallest algal population, comprising mainly diatom species. Hartbeespoort Dam had the most saline water (TDS 96–400 mg/l; NH4 <0.004–0.218mg/l; NO2+NO3 0.109–2.776mg/l; PO4 <0.04–0.06mg/l), while Roodeplaat Dam had the highest nutrient concentrations (TDS 200–373mg/l; NH4 <0.04–0.933mg/l; NO2+NO3 <0.04–2.310mg/l; PO4 0.041–0.472 mg/l). Both Hartbeespoort and Roodeplaat Dams had large algal populations that resulted in very alkaline water during summer. Microsystis dominated the phytoplankton population in these two impoundments during summer and autumn, while green algae and diatoms were dominant during winter and spring. Ecological health was determined using two different biotic indices. Two modifications of the Belgian Biotic Index and a modification of SASS4 (SASSD) were tested. Three health classes were suggested for SASSD scores and ASPT values. It is concluded that artificial substrates with SASSD (and ASPT) as a biotic index can be used to determine the biological health of impoundments, but that further refinement of the index is needed.",

However, metals can become toxic if background concentrations are exceeded in the environment. This study investigated the sublethal effects of zinc on the haematology of Oreochromis mossambicus at different water temperatures. Fish were exposed to sublethal zinc (Zn) concentrations of 40μg/l (mean Zn concentration measured from the Mhlathuze River) for a period of 96h at different water temperatures representing the seasonal temperatures in the Mhlathuze River (18°C, 24°C, 28°C and 32°C). Exposure to zinc at 28°C and 32°C resulted in the most pronounced haematological changes in O. mossambicus. The erythrocytotic conditions found following exposure to Zn could be attributed to damage to the gill surface. The ensuing hypoxic conditions are alleviated through the release of large amounts of immature RBC into the circulatory system. The leucocytotic conditions support the findings of damage to the gill surface. The increased glucose concentrations were attributed to a general adaptation response whereby metabolites are mobilised to meet increased energy demands during periods of stress. The changes in Na+ and K+ levels in the plasma of O. mossambicus can be attributed to a combination of stimulation of Na-K ATPase activity, reduced membrane permeability in the gill tissue and leakage from cells into the blood, respectively.

The samples had low to medium Langmuir adsorption maxima (Γm), ranging from 107 to 201μg g−1. Langmuir binding energy co-efficient (K) ranged from 60 to 181μg l−1 and the equilibrium P concentration at zero sorption (EPC0) from 0.1 to 2.75μg g−1. By using Langmuir co-efficients derived from P sorption experiments and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations measured in rivers as well as the in-shore waters of Lake Victoria, it was possible to determine the potential release of SRP into the lake by sediment from the two catchments. For the 2000 water-year, it was estimated that about 28.65 ± 0.89 (mean ± SD) and 66 ± 6.76 tons of SRP were released into Lake Victoria by sediment deposited by the Simiyu and Kagera rivers, respectively. The implications of these results to future management of cultural eutrophication in Lake Victoria are also discussed.",

In the Knysna estuarine system, it is the numerically dominant member of a guild of six small microphytophagous gastropods; it is absent from lower level and more exposed Zostera meadows, where its place is taken by Rissoa pinna. H. knysnaensis is also here recorded from the nearby Swartvlei Estuary, in the same habitat type. This unusual habitat for a Hydrobia may in part account for the failure of earlier surveys to detect its presence, notwithstanding that it may well locally be the most numerous gastropod in each of these systems. Generally, however, it (and probably other small gastropods) seem to have been confused in estuarine fauna lists with Assiminea. Experiments show that the rate of feeding in H. knysnaensis is curtailed at population densities exceeding 2000–4000m−2 and in salinities below some 10psu. The proportion of non-feeding snails also increases at high population densities and in low salinities. The bearing of these results on whether H. knysnaensis is likely to be the 'Hydrobia sp.' recorded from some other South African localities and on the causes of its rarity are discussed.",

A suite of statistical models for simulating daily maximum water temperatures, of differing complexity and using inputs of air temperature, flow rates, rainfall and relative humidity, were developed and verified. Whilst all models performed well, the most suitable was a site-specific multiple linear regression model using inputs of mean daily air temperature, minimum daily air temperature and relative humidity. The inclusion of a flow rate term would greatly enhance the utility value of such models, but insufficient flow rate data is often a limiting factor. For pragmatic purposes, a simple non-linear regression model using mean daily air temperatures is probably adequate for many areas of South Africa. A generic statistical water temperature model at a daily time step is difficult to achieve, whereas catchment- or site-specific, models, were found to be more appropriate.

Its introduction, development and current fishery status in the lake are documented. Annual catch data were obtained from the District Fisheries Office, while catch and effort data of the long line fishery were recorded at one active fish-landing site between February and October 2001. Lungfish comprise a significant component of commercial landings, sometimes exceeding catches of the Baringo tilapia Oreochromis niloticus baringoensis as the most landed species by weight. Daily catch rates and effort varied considerably, ranging from 5.51–15.18kg day−1 and from 50–590 baited hooks day−1, respectively. Daily catch per fisher ranged from 0–35.72kg, while the overall mean catch per unit effort (CPUE) was only 0.003kg per hook-hour. This study provides the only baseline CPUE data for a lungfish long line fishery that the authors are aware of, for comparison with future studies in this or other lakes where lungfish are similarly exploited.

The map prepared for Glossogobius callidus (Smith 1937) showed a record for the Lower Shire River in Malawi, a tributary of the Lower Zambezi. As this species had not, to my knowledge, previously been recorded from Malawi, and since the record does not appear in the current regional fish atlas (Scott et al. 2006), the specimen in the SAIAB collection (SAIAB 42108) was checked. It was caught on rod and line at Sucoma Sugar Estate (16°17’S, 34°55’E, Nchalo, in 1992) (Figure 1) and was sent to me for identification by the Angling Society of Malawi. Not realising that the distribution of G. callidus extended much further north, and also further inland, than is shown in Skelton’s (1993) map, a fact not known until Greenwood (1994) drew attention to the existence of the species in the Limpopo system, I identified the specimen as G. giuris (HamiltonBuchanan 1822), a widespread species in south-eastern African freshwaters. It was deposited in the SAIAB collection under that name, but was subsequently re-identified as G. callidus and re-labelled. I have not been able to ascertain who re-examined the specimen and corrected the identification, as there is no comment on the label or in the database. Glossogobius giuris also occurs in the Lower Shire and in Lake Chiuta (Figure 1), at the headwaters of the LugendaRovuma system on the Malawi-Mozambique border. The relative abundance of the two species in the Lower Shire River is unknown. Distinguishing features between the two species were discussed and illustrated by Greenwood (1994). A third species, Glossogobius tenuiformis Fowler 1934, was described from Lake St Lucia in South Africa. Currently a synonym of G. giuris, this species is now recognised as valid (H Larson, Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory, Darwin, Australia, unpublished data, which includes a key to the Western Indian Ocean Glossogobius species). It is known only from the Zotsha River mouth, south of Port Shepstone, to Richards Bay.",

Foregut contents were dominated by invertebrate remains (frequency of occurrence (FO) = 75%), but also contained filamentous algae (FO = 54%), sand (FO = 53%) and detritus (FO = 45%). The number of invertebrate prey found in the foregut ranged from 0.3 ± 0.6 (mean ± standard deviation) in May 1998 to 33 ± 21.5 in October 1998. The invertebrate prey was predominantly aquatic and the family Chironomidae was most important, contributing >80% to the index of relative importance in most months. The significance of these results is discussed with regard to the conservation of this species.",

The main objectives of the study were as follows: to determine the distribution and area of J. kraussii stands; to describe the characteristics of available J. kraussii culms; to carry out socio-economic assessments of harvesters' lifestyles; to evaluate the factors influencing harvesting and use of J. kraussii and possible alternatives; to estimate the direct income for the harvesters and, finally, to consider whether harvesting is sustainable and whether the current management practices are effective and appropriate. Juncus kraussii stands are managed by Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife (EKZNW). Ninety-seven percent of the rush harvesters were women, most were poorly educated and had limited employment. In total, twenty different items were made, more than has been recorded in previous literature, indicating a dynamism in craftwork that is poorly appreciated. All weavers produced sleeping and sitting mats, and 96% of them produced bridal sleeping mats. The latter are culturally important in Zulu households, no alternative wetland plant species being acceptable in their production. Juncus kraussii was traded, with 97% of the income generated being through the sale of craft products and 3% through raw materials sales. The majority of J. kraussii stands occur within Protected Areas and it is critical that harvester accessibility is maintained so that the cultural practices associated with the rush may continue. Analysis of harvest per unit effort suggests that J. kraussii is resilient to past harvesting levels. However, caution is required as the plant's restricted geographic distribution and moderate habitat specificity, as well as the high demand for culms in craftwork production, indicate that harvesting requires careful monitoring to ensure future supplies. The current biennial cutting regime should be maintained. However, the long-term impacts of annual cutting on above-ground and below-ground plant parts should be investigated to determine whether such a regime is sustainable.

Royle (Hydrocharitaceae) was initiated in South Africa following the discovery of extensive mats in Jozini Dam in northern KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) in 2006. However, in mid-2008, high densities of a phytophagous insect, Parapoynx diminutalis Snellen (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) were discovered on the H. verticillata infestation, causing high levels of defoliation and dieback of the weed. In order to quantify the impact of the moth and to assess the long-term threat of H. verticillata to South African water bodies, a monitoring programme was initiated in 2013. Although P. diminutalis did not demonstrate a preference for H. verticillata over a native aquatic plant, Potamogeton schweinfurthii A. Bennett (Potamogetonaceae), moth populations followed a cyclical pattern of abundance, with rapid population increases coinciding with increases in the abundance of H. verticillata. High damage levels to H. verticillata were associated with high densities of immature P. diminutalis, which consistently led to population crashes of H. verticillata. Parapoynx diminutalis appears to have great potential to contribute to the management of H. verticillata in South Africa. However, the moth's oligophagous habits will probably preclude its intentional introduction into water bodies with H. verticillata where it does not already occur.Keywords: biological controlcyclical pattern of abundanceinsect herbivoryplant-herbivore interactions",

The local communities use the stored water for various purposes, such as irrigation, domestic use, watering of livestock and cage fish farming. Such intense use is commonly accompanied by eutrophication, including fast growth of cyanobacteria, which at times produce cyanotoxins threatening human and animal life. We studied the pelagic community, analysed abiotic variables and identified microcystins by means of high performance liquid chromatography and ELISA kits at monthly intervals over a period of one year. Mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was used to identify structural variants of microcystins by their protonated masses (M + H). Three dams contained microcystins, with the highly toxic Microcystin-LR being identified as the most prominent substance. Cell content of the toxin varied from 7.2 to 686.7 fg cell−1. Basic limnological variables that indicate the probability of toxin presence were also recorded. Non-parametric Mann–Whitney U-test revealed significant differences in soluble reactive phosphorous, nitrate-N, water depth, total hardness and post-Nauplii stages sampled between toxin-producing and non-toxin-producing dams. Although most of the samples did not contain high amounts of cyanobacteria, the cyanotoxin-problem was evident, suggesting the need for regular cyanotoxin monitoring programs.",

Significant increase in white blood cells throughout the duration of exposure and decrease in lymphocytes were observed. The lipid peroxide levels were increased in test concentrations when compared with controls of liver and gill. The fish group was subjected to oxidative stress, because of lipid peroxidation in response to reactive oxygen species generation. Gill and liver tissues showed concentration and time dependent significant increase (p < 0.05) in values of malondialdehyde, catalase and superoxide dismutase, whereas there was reduced glutathione. Similarly, potassium dichromate enhanced levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase as both concentration and time dependent when compared with control. Micronuclei induction was highest (7.55) on day 14 in all concentrations in the peripheral blood cells. There were alterations in values of glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase during exposure and recovery periods.",

There was no significant difference in shell width of mussels for any given length among sites.

Growth rate of mussels at two embayment sites (Thesen's Wharf and Thesen Islands Marina) was greatest in autumn and summer whereas at The Heads and Leisure Isle there was little seasonal difference in growth rate. Growth rate of mussels at Thesen's Wharf and Thesen Islands Marina was mainly greater in all seasons when compared with mussels at The Heads and Leisure Isle. The more rapid growth rate of mussels at the sheltered embayment sites might in part explain why M. galloprovincialis now dominates the mid- to lower intertidal on hard substrata in this region of the Knysna estuary.",

Consequently, concerns regarding the human health impact of long-term consumption of fish from the Olifants River have been raised in recent studies. Nevertheless, Lake Flag Boshielo situated on the main stem of the Olifants River has been proposed as a site for an inland fishery. Planktivorous silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Valenciennes, 1844) is among the potential target species for such a fishery. Therefore, a desk-top human health risk assessment was conducted for silver carp from Lake Flag Boshielo. From January to November 2013, muscle samples from 50 specimens were collected and analysed for metals and metalloids. The hazard quotient based on a weekly meal of 150 g exceeded the acceptable level for As, Cd, Cr, Co, Pb, Hg, Se, V and Zn. Compared with previous studies from Lake Flag Boshielo, muscle tissue concentrations of As, Cr, Pb, Hg, Se, V and Zn for H. molitrix were higher. Based on the metal and metalloid concentrations reported in this study, long-term consumption of silver carp from Lake Flag Boshielo might pose a health risk to impoverished rural communities.",

The ethanol extract of P. biglobosa pods was found to be more acutely toxic with a 96 h LC50 value of 13.96 mg l−1 than the aqueous extracts, with a 96 h LC50 value of 19.95 mg l−1 against C. gariepinus.

The results showed that PNX exposure caused significant concentration-dependent increases in serum alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, creatinine, malondialdehyde and nitric oxide and significant decreases in serum total protein, albumin, reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and lysozyme activity. Furthermore, PNX significantly upregulated the expression of immune-related genes in the head kidney in a concentration-dependent manner when compared with the control group. However, Vit E supplementation in the diet alleviated PNX-induced toxic effects. These results concluded that Vit E could be effective in the protection of fish against PNX toxicity.",

    "abstract": "The parasite Chonopeltis australis Boxshall, 1976 has been recorded from tributaries of the Orange-Vaal River System. It is host-specific, preferring the cyprinids Labeo capensis (Smith, 1841) and Labeo umbratus (Smith, 1841). Sampling was conducted between spring 2016 and autumn 2019 at various sites on the main stream of the Vaal River. The current study considers current ecological data and compares these to historic data. The species produces a single cohort, with overwintering eggs and adults. The infection of L. capensis peaks in autumn. Parasites aggregate on larger hosts that occur in riverine habitats, but can succeed in shallow impoundments with suitable hard surfaces for egg deposition. This parasite exploits changes in ecological conditions and host biology in order to survive, but will only choose between these two host species where they aggregate on larger hosts. The increased pollution in the Vaal River Barrage and downstream has had an impact on the occurrence of C. australis and it is possibly extirpated in polluted parts of the river.",

    "abstract": "The Vaal River is of considerable economic and environmental importance. It flows through five provinces within South Africa and it is subject to numerous recreational and industrial activities, which often prove detrimental to the health of the system. To determine the extent of the impact that these anthropogenic stressors have on the river system, physiological effects in Clarias gariepinus were assessed during a 2016/2017 sample survey using a suite of biomarkers (exposure and effect). Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and increased metallothionein concentrations were recorded in response to the increase in organic pollutants and metals. Oxidative stress biomarkers, such as superoxide dismutase, showed significant increases in response to possible recent pesticide exposures, whereas lipid peroxidation and protein damage were evident with increased malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl concentrations respectively. The data provide a novel account of the use of biomarkers to assess negative anthropogenic effects observed along the entire length of the Vaal River system.",

    "abstract": "The phytoplanktonic composition with a focus on cyanobacteria, intra- and extracellular microcystins (MCs) concentrations and MCs concentrations in fish tissues were investigated in Lake Hora-Arsedi (Ethiopia). The phytoplankton community comprised of 40 species in the first phase of the study and was dominated by cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates. Considerable concentrations of both intra- and extracellular MCs were detected. Total extracellular MCs concentrations in water of up to 2.99 µg l−1 were detected, with the highest level almost three times the WHO tolerable daily intake (TDI) limit for MC-LR in drinking water. The MCs concentration in algal seston measured in April 2015, 1.138 µg g−1 dry weight (DW), was higher than that recorded in March 2015 (0.825 µg g−1 DW). Among the three MCs congeners for which we had standards, MC-LR and MC-YR accounted for 71.5 and 28.5%, respectively, of the total MCs measured in the water samples, whereas MC-RR was below the detection limit of the method of analysis used. The total MC concentration in the liver of Oreochromis niloticus was 14.42 µg g−1 DW in March although the MC concentration in April was not measurable in the liver sample of the same species, O. niloticus. Conversely, the total MC concentrations in the liver samples of Tilapia zillii collected in March and April were 15.21 and 17.8 µg g−1 DW, respectively. The results suggest that there is considerable potential for knock-on effects of toxic algae blooms on humans through consuming water and fish from Lake Hora-Arsedi.",

    "abstract": "The El-Ibrahimia Canal is one of the main irrigation sources in Egypt, that it supplies perennial irrigation to approximately 600 000 ha (one-fourth of the Egyptian cultivated land). An annual study on species composition of microalgae attached to the submerged hydrophyte Myriophyllum spicatum L. was carried out from midautumn 2016 to midsummer 2017. Epiphytic microalgae were represented by 109 species related to 66 genera. Diatoms were the most abundant group (66–95%) followed by green algae (3.3–25%). Aulacoseira granulata, Cyclotella ocellata, Cymbella affinis, Gomphonema parvulum, Navicula cuspidata, Navicula muralis, Nitzschia dissipata, Nitzschia hungerica, Staurosirella leptostauron, and Ulnaria ulna were the most dominant species. Regarding morphology-based functional groups (MBFGs) taxonomic approach, the epiphytic microalgae species were represented by six MBFGs (I, III, IV, V, VI and VII). The MBFG VI (mainly diatoms) was the leading group with a minimum average percentage of 59.9% during the summer season and a maximum of 95.06% during the winter season. The mean annual values of cell density fluctuated greatly between 8.6 × 106 (during the spring season) and 4.7 × 107 cells g−1 plant wet weight (during winter season). The changes in microalgae biovolumes have the same trend as cell density, with mean seasonal values of 3.89 × 109, 2.56 × 1010, 1.16 × 109, and 3.21 × 109 µm3 g−1 plant wet weight during autumn, winter, spring and summer seasons, respectively. Diversity index values ranged between 2.0 and 3.0, revealing a light pollution status of the canal. In general, the species composition and diversity of epiphytic algae along the El-Ibrahimia Canal are highly dependent on site and the physico-chemical properties of canal water affected by agricultural practice around it.",

Water column characteristics of the Nahoon Estuary were examined in 2014–2015 to identify factors that influenced phytoplankton dynamics. The estuary was found to be saline (∼33) and remained well-oxygenated (∼6 mg l−1) throughout the current study. During this period, freshwater inflow into the estuary was minimal and chlorophyll a biomass was low (3.6 ± 0.3 µg l−1). Nutrient concentration at Nahoon Estuary showed a linear relationship with salinity, indicative of a conservative behaviour. Phytoplankton dynamics were altered by fluctuations in nutrient levels, not necessarily in response to freshwater inflow. The impact of Nahoon Dam and destructive land-use alongside the Nahoon River decreases freshwater inflow and increases nutrient loading into the estuary. In terms of nutrient loading, the current study showed the importance of microalgae as indicators of the nutrient status of an estuary. The presence of cyanobacteria and high phytoplankton biomass in the upper reaches of the estuary confirms the input of excessive nutrients. The results of the current study clearly show that better management of both the Nahoon River and its catchment is vital to ensure the health of the system.",

Although Aulacoseira granulata (Ehrenberg) Simonsen is frequently found and at it times dominates algal assemblages in the Barrage, Aulacoseira ambigua (F.Meister) Tuji & D.M.Williams has never before been recorded at this locality. During a countrywide proficiency-testing scheme for algae counting, coordinated by Rand Water, spiral-shaped diatom colonies with distinctly curved cells were detected during May 2015. Upon investigation, it was found that the spiral colonies were Aulacoseira ambigua f. japonica, its presence in the fresh waters of South Africa being recorded for the first time. Since their first appearance during May 2015, colonies of Aulacoseira ambigua f. japonica have been constantly present in the surface waters of the Barrage. Their presence at this site can be linked to increasing eutrophication in the Vaal River, because the spiral form is known to prefer eutrophic conditions. Centric diatoms rarely form spiral colonies and there is some confusion in the literature as to the identity of this particular form, therefore in this paper we discuss this taxon, its nomenclature and ecological significance.",

    "abstract": "The 1 mg/l phosphate effluent standard legislated in South Africa in 1980 in seven sensitive catchments, and ad hoc eutrophication-related requests, necessitated the monitoring of 53 impoundments throughout the country. Variables that were monitored, and are still being monitored in some cases, included nutrients, chlorophyll a, algal identification, suspended solids and other major inorganic constituents. The measurement of temperature and oxygen profiles was conducted on an ad hoc basis when the sites were visited. The results, as determined from data collected between 1989 and 1998, indicated a range of trophic states from oligotrophic to hyper-eutrophic in the sensitive catchments. The catchments that were covered in the survey are: the Vaal River, Crocodile River (North West Province), Pienaars River, Olifants River (Mpumalanga Province), Letaba River, Buffalo River, Berg River, White Mfolozi River, Mgeni River, Mlazi River and the Molopo River catchments. The objective of this paper is to discuss the methods, variables and presentation for determining the trophic status of an impoundment for management purposes by using findings in the Bon Accord Dam, a small reservoir near Pretoria. The trophic status of selected impoundments was determined by using the mean total phosphorus (TP) concentrations, the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio, the mean chlorophyll a concentration, the presence of cyanobacteria and the turbidity (measured by means of Secchi disc readings) of the system. The mean annual phosphorus concentrations dropped from more than 800μg/l to less than 100μg/l in three years, and have remained at that level since 1987. The authors suggest that further reductions in phosphorus input are necessary to prevent eutrophication in the reservoir.",

Botshabelo is a city, which has developed in the catchment area of the river, and its sewage outflows are discharged into the Klein Modder, a tributary of the Modder River. This study was conducted in order to determine the influence of Botshabelo's sewage outflow on the water quality of the river. It was determined that the Modder and Klein Modder Rivers do not generally follow distinctive seasonal patterns in terms of chemical parameters, although NO3-N and PO4-P concentrations usually increase with increasing flow and conductivity decreases with increasing flow. Physical parameters such as turbidity, flow and temperature did however follow distinctive seasonal patterns from February 1996 to December 1997, as did phytoplankton growth. Low chlorophyll-a concentrations were exhibited in the winter and higher concentrations during spring. In the Klein Modder River, algal blooms occurred more frequently, and the algal biomass was higher than in the Modder River. This could be ascribed to the higher nutrient concentrations and lower flow velocities in the former. The inflow of the Klein Modder River into the Modder River caused on average, 112% increase in PO4-P, 171% increase in NO3-N, 50% increase in chlorophyll-a concentration, and 230% increase in E. coli counts.",

However, a few species, including the characid Brycinus sadleri, have shown remarkable resilience. This study examined how the distribution and foraging behaviour of B. sadleri in Lake Nabugabo may facilitate their persistence with Nile perch. Both B. sadleri and Nile perch were most abundant in exposed areas offshore (20m) as opposed to wetland areas. However, we found evidence for a strong diel shift in activity and modest changes in the habitat use of B. sadleri that may contribute to persistence with Nile perch. In general, B. sadleri actively foraged during the daylight hours and remained quiet during the night. Nile perch began foraging during the early evening and were more active during the night than during the day. By early morning the proportion of full stomachs in Nile perch was low, though there was evidence of a low level of feeding activity during the day. Stomach contents of Brycinus sadleri indicated a shift from surface to benthic feeding as light levels increased, which appears to decrease their susceptibility to predation by Nile perch during the daylight hours.",

Local effects of effluent from a drain coming from the city of Ismailia were evident, although the effect of tourist hotels at Palma Beach was not detectable. The discharge of heated water from a thermal power plant raised the water temperature in the impacted area by 13°C in autumn and 22°C in summer and also caused decreases in chlorophyll and phytoplankton abundance. Dissolved nutrient levels were high and, especially at the offshore station, had a rather constant ratio of dissolved inorganic nitrogen to phosphate.

    "abstract": "Abstract The population demographics of the caridean shrimp Palaemon peringueyi was investigated monthly at four sites over a period of one year in the small, intermittently-open Grants River Estuary situated on the south-east coastline of southern Africa. Mean total abundance and biomass of P. peringueyi ranged between 0 and 23.2 ind m−2 and 0 and 2.3mg wwt m−2, respectively. A peak in its abundance coincided with a breaching event that occurred in December 2004, and could be attributed to the mass recruitment of juveniles (carapace length <9mm) into the estuary. Minor peaks in abundance were also associated with marine waters overtopping the sandbar that separates the estuary from the marine environment. The highest biomass values were recorded when the estuary was separated from the sea. Maximum abundance and biomass values of P. peringueyi were generally recorded in the middle reaches of the estuary where extensive beds of submerged vegetation, mainly Potamogeton pectinatus, predominated. Pearson correlation analysis indicated that the total abundance of P. peringueyi was significantly correlated (r = 0.49; p < 0.05) to percentage cover of submerged vegetation. The spatial pattern in abundance and biomass values of the shrimp is thought to reflect the availability of refuge areas against predation. A distinct spatial pattern in the community structure of the shrimp was evident, with juveniles numerically dominating the samples in the lower reaches of the estuary, while mature females predominated in the upper reaches of the system. In the middle reaches, the community comprised both juveniles and adults. Keywords: ESTUARIESBIOMASSPOPULATION ABUNDANCESHRIMPSUBMERGED VEGETATION",

Fecundity averaged 1249.86 ± 991.96 eggs, ranging from 100 to 5000 eggs, increasing in accordance with female size. A very low variation in number of eggs was observed within the same size class, probably indicating synchronous spawning within the same reproductive season. Gonad analysis suggested that females and males become mature at carapace widths of 13.4 and 13.6mm, respectively. The potential effects of variations in fecundity in this species, and in the Ocypodidae family, were compared and discussed.",

The present study therefore evaluated larval response to salinity and temperature in combination. Larvae were reared individually in factorial combinations of salinity (14, 21, 28, 42 and 49 ppt) and temperature (12, 16, 20, 24, 28 and 32°C). Both parameters influenced the probability of survival for any individual larva. Highest survival occurred at salinities of between 21–35ppt for the Zoea 1 and 2 and of between 28–35ppt for the Zoea 3, with optimum temperature ranges narrowing substantially from Zoea 1 through Zoea 2 to Zoea 3. Temperature exerted a similar influence on development rate at all rearing salinities within each zoeal stage. However, elevated salinity (42 ppt) delayed development. H. orbiculare larvae appear to be well adapted to tolerate salinities typical of the estuarine environment, but the range of salinities tolerated is narrower than expected, considering that the larvae have been recorded at salinities as low as 1ppt in the estuarine environment, and in freshwater in Lake Sibaya, a relict estuarine lake.",

The most abundant individual fatty acids were palmitic acid (16:0), stearic acid (18:0), oleic acid (18:1n9), vaccenic acid (18:1n7), arachidonic acid (20:4n6) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n3). Due to high levels of both n6 and n3 fatty acids, the ratios of n3 to n6 were between 1 and 2, typical for freshwater fish species. Two Lake Victoria and one Lake Kioga populations of Nile tilapia and Nile perch were distinguished by the fatty acid profiles in their heart and muscle tissue. The heart tissue showed better separation than muscle tissue, due to dominance of polar phospholipids. It is rationalised that genetics are more important than diet in determining the fatty acid composition of the tissues.

The conductivity of the lakes varied from 207μS cm−1 to 70 000μS cm−1. Chlorophyll a concentration ranged from <5mg m−3 to >50mg m−3, while bacterial numbers were between 2.9 × 106 and 2.55 × 108 bacteria ml−1. Principal components analysis based on environmental variables revealed a single strong environmental gradient across the lakes related to conductivity, alkalinity, bacterial abundance, chlorophyll a, and (negatively) to Secchi depth. Oligotrichs (e.g. Strombidium, Strobilidium, Halteria) and scuticociliates (e.g. Cyclidium, Pleuronema, Cristigera) dominated the ciliate communities numerically. The species-environment correlations, as revealed by canonical correspondence analysis, indicate a strong relationship between ciliate genera and the environmental gradient. Herbivorous oligotrichs were characteristic of oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes, which were also freshwater to moderately saline lakes. On the other hand, scuticociliates, primarily bacterivores, were most abundant in alkaline and saline lakes with high chlorophyll a concentrations. Biomass of ciliates was related to chlorophyll, as has been observed in temperate and subtropical lakes, but was more strongly related to bacterial concentration.",

They are seasonally or periodi-cally inundated when the river overflows its banks in a flood event, and their substrate is dominated by alluvial or hydric soils (Cowan 1995). Floodplain pans play an important role as refugia and breeding habitats for freshwater fish (Coke and Pott 1971). In southern Africa, extensive floodplains are found on large rivers such as the Zambezi, Kafue, Limpopo and Pongolo (Davies and Day 1998), and, in Zimbabwe, floodplain pans occur in the middle Zambezi (Mana Pools) (Goudie and Thomas 1985) and in the Save–Runde system (Dallas 1998).The hydrological regimes of floodplain pans follow a seasonal pattern of filling up in the wet season and then drying out after the rains end. During the dry season and in periods of extreme drought these pans are totally dry but, as soon as they receive some water, explosive biological activity begins. Early colonisers include insects and birds, which are highly mobile, followed by groups such as gastro-pods, crustaceans, and some amphibians and fish, which all have resting stages that allow them to survive without water (Davies and Day 1998). Most fish species can only colonise the pans once the river has risen sufficiently to connect with them. This study investigated changes in the fish communi-ties in relation to drought and flooding in four floodplain pans in the Save Valley Conservancy, south-eastern Zimbabwe. The pans are situated in the alluvial floodplain of the Save River, which covers approximately 40 km",

Total length and fish and gonad weight were measured monthly for both species. Length maxima for female and male B. paludinosus were 130 mm and 113 mm respectively, and for female and male B. trimaculatus 120 mm and 85 mm respectively. Lengths-at-first-maturity for female and male B. paludinosus were 69 mm and 64 mm respectively, and for B. trimaculatus 61 mm and 59 mm respectively.

Barbus breed throughout the year, with a minor peak in April-March and a major breeding peak in October-January. Before the rainy season, Barbus migrate to the marshes, marginal swamps and the Mnembo River mouth to breed. Fishery management recommendations to ensure successful breeding and recruitment of Barbus into the fishery include: (1) a closed season for active fishing gears targeting Barbus spp. and juvenile tilapias from October to February for the lake and riverine fishing, (2) the increase of the permitted stretch mesh size for matemba seine-nets to 10.53 mm and (3) protection of the marshes, swamps and river habitats which act as breeding grounds for the Barbus spp. Keywords: breeding groundsclosed seasonconservationmarsh areas",

In good rainfall years, the area becomes populated by fish communities dominated by five species migrating southward towards the endorheic Etosha Pan, the basin's terminal sump. When water dries up, fish subsequently die-off and their sudden appearance in rainy years has captivated scientists for decades. The current study was prompted by hitherto untapped indigenous knowledge through narratives of opportunistic fish harvesting of migrating fish at temporary connections between the Kunene River and the Cuvelai- Etosha Basin. A reconnaissance fish survey in 2017 was complemented by digital satellite images and elevation data analyses. Results support the presence of at least three major ephemeral fish migration routes. The dominant fish genera migrating upstream in Kunene tributaries comprise Enteromius, Oreochromis and Clarias, all eurytopic and known to undertake upstream, lateral and downstream migrations on floodplains. Although other notable fish refugia in the Cuvelai–Etosha Basin are yet to be identified, there is a necessity for the protection and management of these migration routes in tandem with studies on the nature and extent of this inter-basin fish migration under climate change and variability.",

The rate of establishment for introduced fish into South African rivers is high (79%) and the vector responsible for the highest establishment rate is interbasin transfer schemes with 80%. Introductions of non-native fish into river systems can negatively affect native fish species through hybridisation, competition for food sources and predation, and the introduction of associated parasites and diseases. The aims of the current study were to provide evidence of the introduction of Labeo capensis into the Crocodile River (West) system, using morphological and molecular techniques, and to record the fish health and gonadosomatic index to determine the invasive status of L. capensis. From the fish health assessment index and gonadosomatic index of L. capensis collected from Olifantsnek Dam, it can be concluded that L. capensis is a healthy reproducing population. Because this fish species can survive and reproduce in newly colonised river systems, it has the potential to compete with the native fish species for food and habitat, but can also hybridise with native Labeo species.",

    "abstract": "Size at maturity, sex ratio and maturity stages are key population parameters in fisheries management of exploited stocks because they influence survival of fish populations. The decline in Hydrocynus vittatus catches during the tigerfish competition and along the shoreline of Lake Kariba, Zimbabwe prompted this study. This study investigated population parameters of H. vittatus in the Sanyati Basin, Lake Kariba. A gonadal reproductive stage determination index was used to determine sexual maturity and the logistic growth curve was used to estimate size at 50% sexual maturity (L50). The study revealed that the L50 value had decreased from 30 cm to 22.1 cm for males and 35 cm to 27.8 cm for females since 1961. Males and females had an L50 of 22.1 cm and 27.8 cm, respectively. The male to female ratio was 1:0.8, which is typical of stressed populations. Increased fishing pressure in the Sanyati Basin, Lake Kariba is a potential threat to the H. vittatus population. More research and monitoring of the population parameters of tigerfish is required, in order to predict long term effects of overexploitation and to enable responsible authorities to protect the fish stock from collapsing.",

The Chania River is an important source of water for humans and animals and provides habitat for a variety of flora and fauna. This study used a Water Quality Index (WQI) to assess the suitability of the water for human use based on selected physico-chemical parameters (nitrates, Total Dissolved solids (TDS), potassium, sulphates, chlorides, copper, manganese, pH and phosphates). Sample collection was done between October 2018 and February 2019 over the dry and the wet seasons. Generally, the WQI indicated that water quality was fair to good in the dry season (19.67 to 30.10) but fair to poor in the wet season (23.17 to 89.15). It is recommended that the riparian zone of the Chania River be protected from anthropogenic disturbances in the County Kiambu.",

The clogging of streambeds sediment is caused by the infiltration of fine particles at depth, reducing hydraulic conductivity (K) and hyporheic flow. Grain-size distribution and streambed vertical K were estimated using hyporheic sediment samples collected from ten stations in the Tafna River catchment during two hydrological periods of high and low water in order to investigate spatiotemporal variations and the variables influencing hydraulic conductivity. During the wet season, the upstream part of the catchment had significantly higher coarse sand content, with K measured to be three times greater than downstream. During low flow periods, there were significantly more fine particles (clay and silt) downstream, which were negatively correlated with K. Increases in clay and silt were the main cause of sediment clogging in the downstream part of catchment. However, within-group PCA showed that geomorphology had no significant influence on hyporheic sediment clogging. This study demonstrated that the process of streambed sediment clogging was influenced by the accumulation of fine particles and organic matter, which significantly contributed to the clogging of the downstream hyporheic zone, thus decreasing hydraulic conductivity despite prevailing geomorphology.",

Macroinvertebrate responses in the Witrandspruit, a tributary of the Boesmanspruit, showed slow recovery in the lower reaches and slight recovery in the upstream areas, demonstrating the intensity of the pollution event at the downstream sites and indicating continued toxicity. Overall, macroinvertebrate assemblage indices were modified and poor, representing recent and historical events within each river catchment. Despite a 15-month period of improved water quality after January 2012, the macroinvertebrate communities had recovered only slightly.

The SRSi concentrations increased towards offshore sites, while the opposite was true for diatom abundance. The water directly above the sediment had higher concentrations of SRSi (1.17 ± 0.68 mg l−1) than surface waters (0.79 ± 0.29 mg l−1). The SRSi concentrations in the lake were low compared to those in the period preceding the 1980s. Increased uptake, decreased dissolution and increased accumulation in the sediments are the major contributing factors. The high bottom and low surface concentrations of SRSi are accounted for by increased SRSi uptake by the highly abundant surface diatom communities and their increased sinking rate. The change in diatom species composition and abundance, leading to the dominance of robust and opportunistic species, is probably accelerated by the increased eutrophication and pollution of the lake water.Keywords: abundancedepth stratadissolutionecological zoneseutrophication",

In this study the efficacy of two incubation methods – isolation and non-isolation – was tested using samples taken in 2013 from five endorheic pans in the Free State province, South Africa. The non-isolation incubation method made use of distilled water in the hatching experiments, whereas the Onbé–Marcus isolation incubation method, using 1:5 v/v ADAM medium/water, was adapted and applied to samples to isolate the diapausing eggs. The isolation method provided hatchlings at a higher rate than that of the non-isolation method, but subsequent removal and identification of the hatchlings was challenging. In particular, the success of the isolation method was putatively related to sediment grain size composition. Some difficulties were also noted in using the non-isolation method in the hatching and growing of anostracans.Keywords: AnostracaCladoceraisolation incubationnon-isolation incubationPodocopidaspecies composition",

The ranges of salinity and temperature at which G. lignorum can be used for toxicity testing were investigated under laboratory conditions, in order to avoid potential confounding effects induced by these non-contaminant factors on test data interpretation. The data are discussed in the context of the known ecology of this amphipod. Amphipods were exposed to salinities of 0–56 for 96 h. Salinities were prepared using natural seawater and synthetic sea salt. Grandidierella lignorum tolerated all salinities, but showed highest survival at salinities of 7–42. Salinity tolerance was modified by temperature, with highest survival occurring between 10 and 25 °C. These represent the range of conditions at which toxicity testing can be performed. Salinity tolerances to natural and synthetic seawater did not differ significantly. Synthetic sea salt can thus be used to manipulate the salinity of media for toxicity testing without it acting as a confounding variable. The tests performed also highlight the importance of resting laboratory-cultured G. lignorum for up to six weeks between the harvesting of individuals for use in experiments.",

The sampling stations had temperature, pH and salinity ranges of 28 to 33 °C, 8.2 to 8.1 and 14.6 to 20.1, respectively. The high microbial load of the sampling stations was evident, the mean most probable number being between 400 and 1 100 per 100 ml. The bacteria encountered were Pseudomonas sp., Citrobacter sp., Vibrio sp., Micrococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., Bacillus sp. and Aeromonas sp. Resistance to the tested antibiotics was widespread; the incidences of isolates resistant to ampicillin (55.3%) and amoxicillin (52.6%) were the most common, while all tested isolates were susceptible to the fluoroquinolones, with the exception of sparfloxacin which was resisted by 26.3% of the isolates. The frequency of resistant isolates for aminogylcosides, macrolides, phenicols and sulfonamides ranged between 2.6% and 18.4%. The most resistant strain had a multiple antibiotic resistance value of 0.57. Although susceptibility to some drugs was noted, resistance to the beta-lactam antibiotics suggests that bacteria in Lagos Lagoon harbour genes for resistance.",

The mean number of 30.3 seeds fruit–1 in the Selinda Canal is the highest ever recorded. An artificial earthen barrier or dyke was constructed on the Selinda Canal to allow manipulation of water levels downstream. By drying and subsequently reflooding a region of the stream, seed germination was stimulated, followed by the manual removal of water lettuce seedlings before their seeds reached maturity, which resulted in a decline in seed germination in surface sediment samples from 63.5% in 2002 to 31.7% in 2003. Manipulation of flooding, followed by the physical removal of P. stratiotes at regular intervals prior to anthesis and seed maturity, is considered the most viable strategy for arresting further additions to the seed bank, and could lead to its eradication in seasonally flooded areas where the biocontrol weevil Neohydronomus affinis has become locally extinct since its introduction in 1987.",

The EPS enhances access by cells to nutrients and the removal of toxic materials from the environment through binding, degradation, or by transformation to non-toxic substances. As a food resource, streambed biofilms are intensively grazed by protozoans and macrobenthos, their quality as a food source for grazing organisms affecting the diversity, abundance and distribution of macrobenthic invertebrates. Biofilms are indicators of environmental quality and are active sites for species evolution. Laser scanning microscopy and microelectrode techniques are the most suitable techniques for studying intact biofilms in various environments.

Little information is available on the influence of anthropogenic activities on the water quality along the Kihansi River, which is the only known habitat for this species. This study focused on assessing water quality and associated changes along the Kihansi River gradient where toads are being reintroduced following their recent extinction in the wild. Water samples for testing the pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, total dissolved solids (TDS), and conductivity were collected from the upper, middle, and lower zones. In addition, socio-economic data were collected from three villages, namely Udagaji, Mgugwe and Ukami, which cover the river zone. The population trend of KSTs in captivity was obtained from the Kihansi Captive Facility (KCF). Cultivation of crops, such as rice and maize is the dominant socio-economic activity. Temperature, pH, and DO showed significant variation among the three sampled zones (p < 0.05). Crop cultivation and agroforestry practices near the river significantly increased the pH and TDS, while reducing the DO in the water. The toads in captivity increased in number significantly by 12.77% (n = 1 410). Anthropogenic activities, such as agriculture, agroforestry and grazing affect water quality, and proper management of the Kihansi River requires the involvement of local communities to ensure the survival of the reintroduced KST.",

    "abstract": "The Alibori River, which flows through Benin's cotton crop regions, receives surface water from much of the cultivated land that is situated along its banks. Chemical pollution in surface runoff from this land use threatens the ecological quality of the river. This study aimed to characterise the ecological status of the Alibori River under such agricultural pressures using biological indices and macroinvertebrate metrics. Water and macroinvertebrate samples were taken monthly from fifteen sites along the river between June 2015 and May 2016. The measured physico-chemical parameters and biological indices were subjected to descriptive statistics, bivariate correlations and partial least squares regression (PLSR). Taxonomic richness decreased from the upstream to the downstream reaches of the river. Sampling sites with high mineral content and organic load were home to more pollution-tolerant taxa, such as Chironomidae and Oligochaeta, with a high abundance of Thiaridae. Diversity indices reveal an unbalanced community and macroinvertebrate distribution characterised by the development of opportunistic taxa such as the gastropod Melanoides tuberculata. Decreases in taxonomic composition and community organisation between the upstream and downstream reaches of the river appear to be linked to less stable environmental conditions at the downstream sampling sites, and were compounded with a gradual increase in stress for organisms from the upper to lower reaches of the river. The composition, distribution and diversity characteristics of taxa collected is an indication that the ecological status of the Alibori River is under pressure, as a result of the agricultural activities along its banks.",

    "abstract": "The Elephant Marsh lies on the floodplain of the lower Shire River, in southern Malawi. It is both a cultivated, seasonal floodplain and a wetland, characterised by a complex mosaic of meandering channels, marshland and shallow lakes. In 2016, the Marsh was granted RAMSAR status based on a series of supporting studies, including the modelling of eco-social options for managing its ecological condition. This paper describes two-dimensional (2-D) hydrodynamic modelling using RMA2, in support of this eco-social assessment. The hydraulic model was parameterised using mostly existing data but augmented with bathymetric channel and lake surveys. Calibration and verification used water level data from the hydrometric network for the period 1999 to 2009. Generally, observed water level time-series are well replicated in the model, but there are large discrepancies prior to this period. These are due to temporal changes in hydraulic controls, mainly sedimentation, but also breaching of an embankment at the downstream end of the Marsh. Selected hydraulic-habitat variables (based on daily hydrological time-series 1976 to 2009) provide the indictors of hydrological and hydraulic change used to inform a DRIFT eco-social assessment. The Marsh displays moderate flood attenuation characteristics, but the importance of this will likely increase under continued sedimentation and predicted climate futures, which include more severe storms. The 2-D modelling contributes to an improved understanding of the Marsh’s hydraulic behaviour, particularly regarding anthropogenic influences since the early 1900s.",

    "abstract": "Stable isotope analysis is ubiquitous as a method to investigate food-web dynamics at various scales in aquatic ecology. Most studies make use of dorsal muscle tissue, which involves lethal sampling of the fish. The sampling of muscle tissue is often followed by chemical lipid extraction pre-treatment before stable isotope analysis. In this study we tested whether stable light isotope results obtained from fin tissue were comparable to those from muscle, and we investigated whether lipid correction could be used as a substitute for lipid extraction. Various lipid correction equations were evaluated. Based on our results, we propose ethical and efficient methods of sample collection and preparation for stable isotope analysis of freshwater fish. We found that dorsal muscle and fin tissue samples could yield similar interpretations of freshwater food-web dynamics in South Africa, demonstrating that fin clippings might be more widely applied as a nonlethal sampling method for stable isotope studies. Existing lipid correction equations either over- or underestimated true lipid extracted δ13C values, therefore an amended lipid correction equation is proposed as it was successfully tested against a population of wild fish. The errors arising from existing lipid correction equations suggest that site-specific calibration should be employed.",

This is due to the dynamism of the source-stressor-response relationships and multiple factors including lack of data, complex impact pathways and risks, and uncertainties that are difficult to parameterise. We present a risk-based probability modelling approach using a Bayesian network (BN), to manage multiple water quality stressors at multiple spatial scales. We illustrate the use of this approach, by evaluating the probable ecological effects of altered water quality associated with multiple sources in three case study rivers in South Africa. Water quality and land use activity were used to describe conceptual risk pathways, parameterise the BNs and model the probable consequences of multiple water quality stressors. The BN model demonstrated that the endpoints that were selected for the study reflected the risks associated with the levels of the input water quality variables. The model further demonstrated that the electrical conductivity BN was just as sensitive as the more complex salt model. The BN model was further able to accurately represent risks to all systems irrespective the water quality data base size. This approach can contribute towards more sustainable water resource management.",

Physico-chemical parameters within acceptable limits recommended by WHO for drinking water included pH (7.2–10.8), temperature (13.7–30.4 °C), conductivity (137–281 μS cm−1), total dissolved solids (75–141 mg l−1), total residue (5–3194 mg l−1), alkalinity (93–176 mg CaCO3 l−1), dissolved oxygen (3.5–10.9 mg l−1), nitrite–nitrogen (<detection limit (DL)−43 µg l−1), ammonium–nitrogen (<DL−940 µg l−1), nitrate– nitrogen (<DL−1468 µg l−1), phosphate–phosphorus (<DL−63 µg l−1), silica (4.0–23.6 mg l−1), iron (<DL−250 µg l−1) sodium (3.2–15.7 mg l−1), potassium (0.7–5.6 mg l−1), calcium (6.2–30.3 mg l−1), and magnesium (1.5–11.5 mg l−1). Total residue and pH were amongst the measured variables that were outside of the WHO recommendations. This study revealed that the Blue Nile remains generally unpolluted, and has not been significantly negatively affected by runoff from urbanisation or sewage contamination. This study presents further evidence that industrial wastes discharged upstream of Khartoum have not accumulated downstream as they are carried into the Main Nile by the annual floodwater pulses. The water is therefore currently suitable for drinking and all other uses. However, accumulation of pollutants in the Blue Nile may be problematic once filling of the GERD is complete as the discharge during flooding events necessary to flush the river will be reduced.",

Although South African estuary restoration is in its infancy, important lessons have been learnt through past efforts undertaken in some of the most impacted systems. This review presents case studies focused on hydrological and physical restoration actions, while recognizing the need to implement urgent remedial measures to restore the populations of targeted estuary-associated marine fish species. Common interventions designed to arrest declining estuary health include artificial management of estuary mouths and the use of artificial structures to restore tidal action and remediate erosion damage. Limited natural habitat restoration actions have been conducted on the subcontinent. Fortunately, estuaries are resilient ecosystems and can recover fairly rapidly if appropriate restoration interventions are successfully applied. Restoration needs to be co-ordinated through a national strategy which is currently not in place. It is particularly important to address the root cause of deterioration through active restoration and/or rehabilitation measures rather than only managing symptoms. The implementation of existing and future conservation legislation regarding the exploitation of natural resources within estuaries needs to be prioritised, so that over-exploited angling and subsistence fish species populations can recover.",

Within the ichthyofauna of the Cape Fold Ecoregion of South Africa, many undescribed lineages exist and for most of these, information is limited regarding their ecology, distribution and threats. The Tradouw redfin Pseudobarbus sp. 'burchelli Tradouw' is a novel and range-restricted lineage within the Breede River redfin Pseudobarbus burchelli. Annual monitoring conducted between 2012 and 2016 investigated spatial and temporal trends in the distribution and population dynamics of this taxon. Results indicated that it is highly fragmented within its distribution range, likely a result of the combined pressures of invasive fish and poor land use practices. Short-term monitoring results indicated that invasive fish are established in most of the catchment and that the relative abundance of redfins remained constant only in the limited section of river where alien fish were absent. Poor land use practices such as water over-abstraction and surface water pollution, are pervasive threats, but the extent to which these affect the redfins requires further investigation. The long-term survival of this taxon remains uncertain, and short-term and long-term conservation and management options are explored.Keywords: alien invasive fishCape Fold Ecoregionconservationfreshwater fishPseudobarbus burchelliwater over-abstraction",

A combined hydro-geochemical and multivariate statistical methodology has been applied to evaluate the surface water quality of Wadi El Hatab catchment (Central Tunisia). More than half of the 28 samples collected in March 2021 exceeded WHO standards for sodium, chloride and sulphate contents. Most polluted sites are directly influenced by domestic and industrial effluents that contaminate the river for kilometers. Principal Component Analysis and Hierarchical Ascendant Classification distinguished four contamination sources: water-rock interaction, domestic wastewater, untreated industrial effluents mainly from paper mills and irrigation return. A Water Quality Index model indicated that 75% of the surface water was unsuitable for drinking purposes; while according to chemical indices such as saturation index, sodium absorption coefficient (SAR), magnesium ratio (MR) and percent sodium (%Na), 25 to 49% of samples were unsuitable for irrigation. Considering that water of Wadi El Hatab is used for vegetable irrigation, serious public health issues may arise. The investigation demonstrated that a single representative sampling campaign could be a useful way to identify contamination sources when interpreted with both statistical and geochemical tools.Keywords: anthropogenic activitiesenvironmental monitoringhydrogeochemistrymultivariate statistical analysiswater quality index",

Water hyacinth is a dangerous invasive species that has harmed Ethiopia's wetland ecology and economy. This research aims to evaluate the current distribution of water hyacinth and the impact of environmental variables on its spread, while also mapping future habitat suitability under climate change scenarios and assessing how these changes may influence the species' potential expansion. To estimate the risks of climate change to the species, a predictive model was developed from six modeling methodologies to investigate the climatic suitability of target species for the years 2050 and 2070 under two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP 8.5). Under the current climatic scenario, only 69.78% (789 503.8 km2) and 16.02% (181 262.8 km2) of the country is moderately and highly suitable for species dispersion and invasion respectively. The remaining 14.2% (160 620.9 km2) is unsuitable for the distribution and invasion of the species. In 2050, under the RCP4.5 and RCP 8.5, the 'highly suitable' range of water hyacinth is anticipated to expand by 16.35% and 15.39%, whereas the 'moderately suitable' area is predicted to increase by 70.81% and 71.52%, respectively. Under the RCP8.5 scenarios, compared to the current climatic conditions, in 2070 the 'highly suitable' region for the species is expected to increase by 11.48%. Its continuing growth would exacerbate the issue of ecological and economic crisis, cause significant economic and environmental harm and endanger the community's way of life. In order to avert or reduce these effects, a thorough examination of water hyacinth along the two RCPs by water resource scientists and mamangers, that takes into account how climate change is affecting water hyacinth growing locations in Ethiopia, and provides a proper solution, is mandatory.Keywords: Water hyacinthhabitat suitabilityspecies distribution modelshared socioeconomic pathwayinvasiveEthiopia",

Random samples of salvinia were collected from each site at monthly intervals in 1998 to extract weevils and to demonstrate the effect of weevil on the weed. The rate at which the weed was controlled at different sites varied with mat and weevil density. The biological control at Paradise Pools was moderate without much increase in the weed biomass per m2, while fluctuations in both weevil and plant populations were noticed in the Khwai streams. Weevil numbers remained low at Dombo for the first nine months of the year, during which time the mat density increased. With the onset of higher temperatures, weevil numbers increased to 155 and 457/kg fresh weight of salvinia at the margin and centre respectively in Dombo Pool in early summer. A significant control in MGR 6 HATAB pool between mat biomass and the weevil number resulted in the disappearance of the weed in three months.

In the Cuvelai systems 24 fish species have OshiWambo/OshiNdonga names, in the Kavango systems 60 have RuKwangali and RuGciriku names and in the Caprivi systems 68 have SiLosi and SiSubia names. Twenty types of fishing gear are recorded to have indigenous names in the Cuvelai, 25 in Kavango and 22 in Caprivi. Fifteen commonly available indigenous types of gear are exclusively used by women, who therefore play a crucial role in the exploitation and conservation of freshwater fish in Namibia.

    "abstract": "Nakivubo wetland, which has performed tertiary water treatment for Kampala city for the past 40 years, is ecologically stressed by agricultural and infrastructural developments. Field studies were carried out to assess the hydraulic loading, pollution profile, stability and water quality of this wetland. The upper and lower Nakivubo wetland receive 4.13−7.66 × 104 and 3.50−10.32 × 104m3/day of water respectively, of which 48.3–57.9% of total hydraulic loading to the upper wetland was carried by sampling station S1. The influent water to the upper wetland had a total BOD5 and NH4-N loading ranging from 2.6−4.4 × 103kg BOD/day and 0.79−1.68 × 103kg NH4-N/day respectively. The National Water and Sewerage Corporation's effluent constituted a large proportion of BOD and NH4-N loading into Nakivubo wetland. Zinc, copper and chromium were detected in trace amounts at most sampling stations. However, lead was occasionally detected at Kibira channel (station S5) at a concentration of 0.4mg/l, which is higher than the permitted Ugandan discharge limit of 0.1mg/l (NEMA 1999). The wetland showed a very high removal efficiency for BOD, ranging from 77.4%–86.3%, compared to ammonium-N which ranged from −66.1% to 33.1% indicating limitations with the nitrification process. A low self-purification for zinc, copper and chromium was also observed in the upper Nakivubo wetland, possibly due to poor plant-wastewater interaction resulting from wetland drainage. In the lower Nakivubo wetland conductivity and dissolved oxygen were generally higher in papyrus- than in Miscanthidium-vegetated zones. However, the BOD and ammonium-N loadings did not vary significantly (P = 0.217 and P = 0.359 respectively) between the two vegetated zones.",

Common features are a lack of prey specificity but clear prey-size specificity. Attention is drawn to the ability of invasive snail species (Physidae and Lymnaeidae) to avoid predation by several of these taxa.

    "abstract": "Abstract Blackfly larvae typically occur in fast-flowing riffle sections of rivers, with different blackfly species showing preferences for different hydraulic conditions. Very little quantitative data exist on hydraulic conditions linked to the blackfly species occurring in South African streams. Stones-in-current biotopes (i.e. fast riffle flows over cobbles) were sampled from four sites in three small clear streams in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces of South Africa. Mean water column velocities at each sampled stone were measured using a mini current meter, while flow velocities closer to the boundary layer where blackfly larvae occurred were estimated using indirect techniques (standard hemispheres and aerating tablets). Standard hemispheres were also used to calculate more complex hydraulic parameters such as Froude and Reynolds numbers. Four species of Simuliid were sampled in sufficient numbers to show trends in flow velocity preferences. Simulium impukane and S. rutherfoordi both occurred at their highest densities at velocities of 0.3m s−1, while S. merops preferred velocities of 0.7m s−1. Simulium nigritarse SL attained the highest densities of all the blackfly species sampled, and its relative abundances were greatest at velocities of 0.8–0.9m s−1. Within the streams surveyed, all blackfly species occurred in subcritical-turbulent flows — based on a classification using Froude and Reynolds numbers — although two of the species were also found in high densities in supercritical flows where these existed at the sites. Local hydraulics within the stones-in-current biotope are complex, but in the absence of fine-scale equipment for measuring micro-velocities, standard hemispheres are a useful, cost-effective technique for the initial quantification of hydraulic parameters in small, clear streams. Such an approach facilitates further understanding of links between hydraulics and aquatic invertebrates in South African streams.

This snail species is experimentally susceptible to Schistosoma haematobium and is incriminated in the natural transmission of S. margrebowiei, S. bovis and Calicophoron microbothrium elsewhere in Africa. The 78 different loci (1/16 degree squares) on record reflect a geographical distribution that is largely limited to the KwaZulu-Natal Province. Details of each habitat as described by collectors during surveys, as well as altitude and mean annual air temperature and rainfall for each locality, were processed and chi-squared and effect size values calculated. A decision tree constructed from all the available data indicated that temperature and altitude, followed by the type of water body, seemed to be the more important factors that significantly influenced the distribution of this species in South Africa. The possible role of this species as intermediate host of economically important helminth species is briefly examined. The need to clarify its relationships with B. tropicus and B. depressus, and to update the geographical distribution in South Africa, is also emphasised.",

Here we examine how herbivory by the introduced Louisiana crayfish might change macrophyte abundance and species composition relative to herbivory by a prevalent native beetle Cybister tripunctatus. Our observations are thought to be the first on the consumption of live macrophytes by adult dytiscid beetles, which are commonly known as predaceous diving beetles. In a laboratory experiment, we compare herbivory rates and macrophyte species-selectivity between the beetle and the crayfish. Combining the herbivory rates with population estimates of crayfish and beetles in a local pond, we estimate that herbivory in the natural environment is of the same order of magnitude. Preferences among macrophyte species are also similar between herbivores, except that crayfish are likely to have a larger impact than beetles on cultivated rice (Oryza sativa). Results from a laboratory toxicity experiment suggest that the crayfish is not currently a rice pest in Kenya because it is killed by Furadan® 5G, the commonly applied pesticide.",

    "abstract": "A study was undertaken in November 2003 to derive a suitable sampling technique for collecting a representative sample of aquatic macroinvertebrates from a selected emergent vegetation biotope in a palustrine wetland, Melmoth Vlei, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The aim was to undertake a preliminary investigation on the development and testing of a macroinvertebrate sampling technique for use in emergent sedge-dominated palustrine wetlands (sensu Cowardin et al. 1979), which could contribute to the development of a South African wetland health biomonitoring programme. Sweep nets and activity traps were evaluated for their effectiveness in terms of macroinvertebrate collection. Sweep net sampling was tested over a range of sweep intensities to determine the minimum number of sweeps required to collect a representative sample. Sampling efficiency of activity traps placed at four depths was tested, and taxon diversity and composition of sweep net and activity trap samples were compared to determine whether activity traps are required to supplement sweep net data. A total of 32 taxa (identified mainly to family level) were identified in the samples collected. Taxon diversity and composition did not differ in the activity traps placed at the four depth locations. Taxon diversity did not differ significantly between different sweep intensities. This may be a result of high variability of macroinvertebrate distribution within a wetland. There is evidence, however, to suggest that this result is due to an inadequate sample size. There was a significant difference in taxon composition between the different sweep intensities (P < 0.05) and between activity trap and sweep net samples (P < 0.05). Sixty-eight percent of taxa appeared more frequently in sweep net sampling than in activity trap sampling. Two taxa were found exclusively in activity traps, although the numbers of these taxa collected were not significant, and they do not represent any unique trophic group. Based on these findings, it was concluded that activity traps are not required to supplement sweep net data, and a technique using a sweep net with a sweep intensity of five would be suitable for collecting a representative sample of macroinvertebrates from a palustrine wetland.",

During winter the phytoplankton community was dominated by microphytoplankton (20–200 μm) and during summer by nano- and picophytoplankton. Among the heterotrophic components of the plankton, the nanoflagellates were identified as the most important consumers of bacteria and small <20 μm phytoplankton cells. During both winter and summer the larger heterotrophic organisms, particularly mesozooplankton, resulted in a reduced impact of the nanoflagellates on both the bacteria and phytoplankton, indicating that the larger heterotrophs were preying upon the nanoflagellates. This resulted in a decrease in the predation impact of these organisms on the bacteria during both winter and summer, and on the phytoplankton in summer. This result is consistent with expectations of predator-prey cascades. The presence of the larger heterotrophs therefore mediates interactions between primary bacterivores, nanoflagellates, and bacteria in this estuary.",

This paper has integrated available knowledge from literature on the limnology of the Okavango Delta, Botswana. The current near-natural solute concentrations in the inflow waters can be attributed to low chemical weathering of the quartz basin substrate and nearly absent anthropogenic nutrient sources within the Okavango Delta. The concentration of solutes in endorheic ecosystems is a natural phenomenon. In the Okavango Delta, this concentration is offset by the accumulation of solutes in groundwater beneath numerous treed-islands, due to evapotranspiration by evergreen trees. The freshwater environment has fostered high abundance and diversity of flora and fauna in a semi-arid environment. However, there are several aspects of the Okavango Delta that need more rigorous researched for management purposes. Some of the important knowledge gaps include the role of atmospheric deposition and animal excretion as sources of nutrients and trace elements into the system, and the influence of hydro-period on the distribution of trace elements especially in floodplain sediments, flora and fauna across the Okavango Delta. The issue of bioaccumulation of trace elements is also an important knowledge gap for the Okavango Delta particularly for wildlife and human health.",

In total, 35 species of fish representing 22 genera and 14 families were captured. By biotope, fish populations per 20 m averaged 528 ± 318.5 fish (8.0 ± 3.02 species) in runs, 86 ± 60.9 fish (2.4 ± 1.06 species) in riffles and 819 ± 480.0 fish (7.8 ± 3.15 species) in pools. Riffles contained significantly fewer individuals and species than either runs or pools. Shannon's index was similar for runs and pools, averaging 1.646 ± 0.429 and 1.548 ± 0.345, respectively, but differed significantly for riffles, averaging 0.652 ± 0.473. There were no significant differences in number of individual fish, number of species or Shannon's index among stream order or season, reflecting the stability of these ecosystems throughout the year. Regression of number of fish per 20 linear m of stream, number of species and Shannon's index against a subjective scale related to stream degradation was significant. In particular, the polluted Limbe River sites had significantly fewer individual fish, fewer species and a lower Shannon index across all biotopes than other sites. Fishing efficiency of local gears was estimated at 27% for easily captured species and 14% for the more difficult ones, and could be used to make relative estimates of fish abundance as a means of monitoring changes in fish abundance. Although species diversity in south-western Cameroon was high, typical of tropical streams globally, total abundance was low, and therefore it is unlikely that a profitable ornamental fish trade could be sustained on the basis of fish captured exclusively from the wild.

After very brief training, all field work, including site selection and sample collection, was carried out by the members of the Conservancy. All samples collected by the members of the Conservancy were of an adequate quality for analysis and yielded meaningful results. This study demonstrates that there is great potential for the use of diatoms in community monitoring programmes, mainly due to the ease and rapidity with which samples can be collected. The participation of communities is also vital in gaining a more complete overview of the diatom species occurring in South Africa.

Across seasons, the fish occupied the entire water column and fish schools were rarely observed.

The influence of climate variables on papyrus stomatal conductance in dry and wet seasons of the year was investigated in a wetland in Kampala, Uganda, in June–December, 2012. In situ measurements were made of local climate conditions in a papyrus canopy and of bracteole stomatal conductance. Stomatal conductance was highest early in the day and declined as the day progressed, but stomata were more consistently open in the wet season than in the dry season. The daily cycle of stomatal conductance was influenced by temperature, incident radiation and vapour pressure deficit. Stomata were more sensitive to vapour pressure deficit changes during the wet season than in the dry season, closing sharply as vapour pressure deficit increased. This would seem to be a useful strategy for regulating transpiration, as it reduces water loss when the vapour pressure deficit gradient between the leaf intercellular spaces and the atmosphere is greatest.Keywords: acclimatisationphotosynthetically active radiationrelative humiditytemperaturevapour pressure deficit",

    "abstract": "The Shire River drains from Lake Malawi to the Lower Zambezi River. Annual flow is dependent mainly on lake level, partially controlled by the operation of a barrage at Liwonde to regulate flows for hydroelectricity generation in the escarpment reaches of the river. Downstream of the escarpment, the floodplains of the Lower Shire River support important subsistence fisheries that yielded on average 5 100 t y−1 between 1977 and 1993. Catches from the major fishery area, the Elephant Marsh, were positively correlated with mean annual flow for the same year. Since the target fish species (mainly clariid catfishes) were mostly caught in their second and third year, improved recruitment through higher breeding success at higher flow levels is less likely to explain interannual variation in catches than is greater upstream migration of fish from the Lower Zambezi River in high-flow years. In 1978 a sudden closure of Liwonde Barrage resulted in rapid drainage of stagnant water from the Elephant Marsh floodplain vegetation into the river, causing a mass fish mortality and thus a marked decline in catches from 1979, followed by gradual recovery by 1981. The delay in recovery contrasts with the annual direct catch/flow relationship, and raises questions about the most important influences on Lower Shire catch rates.",

The objective of this study was to determine whether results from the South African Scoring System version 5 (SASS5) are affected by season. The standard SASS5 protocol was used to sample three sites on the Skeerpoort River, South Africa, in autumn, winter and spring 2013, and summer 2014. At each site, stream morphology was characterised and physico-chemical variables were measured. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare SASS indices in relation to site and season, and a one-way ANOVA was used to test the effect of season using both current and historical data. Macroinvertebrate assemblage similarity of sites was determined using non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination, followed by analysis of similarity. Whilst macroinvertebrate assemblages differed between seasons and sites, there was no seasonal variation in the values of SASS indices, but they did differ between sites. SASS5 appears to be robust to seasonal variation in macroinvertebrate assemblage and seems suitable for use throughout the year in a perennial river draining the South African highveld region.Keywords: aquatic macroinvertebratesbioassessmentseasonal variationwater quality",

Increased CPUE during declining water levels was most likely a result of feeding migrations and aggregation behaviour. The observed increase in K during low floods in October and November preceded the increase in PRR, which increased mainly with increasing temperature but appeared less dependent on flow. This study provided quantitative evidence that the biology of fish in the Okavango Delta is mainly dependent on the annual flood regime and, therefore, that conservation efforts should be focused on maintaining natural flow patterns in the face of climate change and potential water extraction schemes upstream.",

Therefore, monitoring methods are required to identify stressors and assist with the management of these valuable and often understudied ecosystems. A synthetic indicator of water ecological quality would be desirable for regular monitoring of these ecosystems under pressure. In 2008 an optical procedure was developed and applied in Ghar El Melh, a Tunisian lagoon which has been increasingly impacted by pollutant loading, especially from agriculture. In situ hyperspectral irradiance was measured at several stations, from which the apparent optical properties (AOPs), namely the irradiance attenuation coefficient K(λ) and the reflectance ratio R(λ), were obtained in order to relate them to water composition, in terms of light-attenuating substances (LASs). The significant relationships observed between R and LAS values enabled the application of a hyperspectral optical classification, which effectively highlighted threatened sectors of the lagoon. The pattern of differing water quality across the lagoon system that was derived from the hyperspectral classification agreed well with that obtained from a conventional optical classification that included AOPs and LASs. We suggest that hyperspectral analysis and classification is a useful monitoring tool for the assessment of change in coastal lagoons, and perhaps also in other shallow-water ecosystems.",

The Great Fish River has modified flow due to an inter-basin water transfer (IBWT). The present study evaluated the current state of invasions and probable mechanisms facilitating establishment of non-native fishes within this river. We used historical literature on the non-native fishes and associated this information with the recent distribution records of these fishes within this system. We hypothesised that non-native fishes would reflect life-history traits and environmental associations that were consistent with adaptability to flow-modified disturbance. Of the 11 non-native fish species recorded within this system, seven have established, three have failed to establish and one is uncertain. The Orange–Fish IBWT and angling were the main vectors of invasions, accounting for 36% and 46% of the non-native species, respectively. Life-history traits, such as large size, greater longevity and wide habitat tolerance, appear to have facilitated establishment of most species. Our findings indicate that both intrinsic and extrinsic factors may explain the invasions of non-native fishes within the Great Fish River and possibly other similarly disturbed systems.",

Phytoplankton samples and physicochemical information were collected at six sites along the river over 1 year (December 2017 to November 2018). Phytoplankton was collected using a 15-μm mesh net. A total of 56 species belonging to three algal phyla were identified; the most diverse phylum was Bacillariophyta (35 species), followed by Chlorophyta (13 species) and Euglenophyta (eight species). Bacillariophyta had the highest abundance and contributed 80.08% of the total phytoplankton abundance. Site 6 in the downstream portion had the highest abundance and greatest diversity of phytoplankton species. The algal phyla present showed significant differences in species diversity and abundance both spatially and temporally. Redundancy analysis results revealed that the spatial distribution of phytoplankton in the river positively correlated with pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen and nitrate-nitrogen, while water temperature and total suspended solids correlated negatively. Some indicators of organic pollution suggest that the water quality of the river is progressively declining, meriting close monitoring.Keywords: algae abundancediatomsmacrophyte coverredundancy analysisriver ecosystemspecies diversitywater quality",

We hypothesised that the decrease in reservoir volumes in dams with desert climates will favour the growth of phytoplankton biomass, measured as chlorophyll a (Chl a), under drought conditions. Using the threshold levels method of Q50, ten drought years were recorded in the Von Bach Dam (VB) in comparison to seven in the Swakoppoort Dam (SWP). Both dams had significant reduction in percentage volume (vol %). The Chl a in SWP was 81 µg l−1 in drought and 48 µg l−1 in AAR years, compared to VB with 21 µg l−1 in drought and 24 µg l−1 in AAR years. Cyanobacterial cell counts in drought and AAR years in SWP were 129 704 and 77 838 cells ml−1, respectively, while cell counts in drought and AAR years in VB were 5 925 cells ml−1 and 20 070 cells ml−1, respectively. Decreases in phytoplankton biomass and total cyanobacteria were observed in SWP but not in VB. The pattern and magnitude of the statistically significant responses (t-test, p < 0.05) between physico-chemical and biological water quality variables varied among drought and AAR years. We conclude that that there is no clear correlation between drought and phytoplankton biomass from this study and that other anthropogenic–environmental drivers, such as land use impacts, will be needed to further elucidate the response of water quality to droughts.",

Specimens were collected between June 2018 and June 2020. Females of both species were smaller at first sexual maturity than males (O. niloticus: 204 vs. 255 mm, O. aureus: 147 vs. 158 mm). The age of maturity for each species was estimated from seasonal otolith growth marks, based on the von Bertalanffy growth function. The asymptotic length was higher in O. niloticus (males 296 mm and females 339 mm) than in O. aureus (males 171 mm and females 169 mm). Based on a literature survey and the results of this study, the type of ecosystem (reservoir vs. river) influenced growth performance indices (φ and φ′) in both species, with reservoirs leading to a higher asymptotic length in both O. niloticus and O. aureus than rivers. Moroccan populations presented the lowest growth index in the populations assessed. These observations suggest that while both invasive species were able to colonise and adapt to their new environments, this was at the expense of limiting their growth and reducing their size at first sexual maturity.",

    "abstract": "The unprecedented pollution of Athi River has negatively impacted the downstream communities who depend on the river's waters. Moreover, the Upper Athi River Catchment has recently experienced an increase in human population coupled with rapid industrialisation, which has led to encroachment of wetlands, riparian areas and forests. The objective of the present study was to investigate the impact of land use/land cover changes (LULCC) on the spatial-temporal distribution of water quality (WQ) in the Upper Athi River Catchment. The research stations were each allocated a GPS position, overlaid onto a 2018 LULCC map of the area. WQ data were analysed using PCA and further subjected to Kruskai-Wallls tests that resulted in six significant WQ parameters at (p < 0.05). The multiple regression model output showed that EC, DO, Zn and Pb, with R2 values of 0.983, 0.918, 0.938 and 0.961 respectively, were significantly associated with urban area land use (p < 0.009, p < 0.042, p < 0.031 and p < 0.02 respectively). The results of our study suggest that significant land cover degradation is expected to occur in the Upper Athi River Catchment in future if mitigation activities are not undertaken, posing a great threat to biodiversity conservation, and the survival of local communities and urban dwellers in Athi River town.",

Ten sites in total were selected from the upstream, midstream and downstream areas. Sampling of sediments and macroinvertebrates was carried out twice a month from March 2018 to March 2019. Sediment was characterised as polymodal and extremely poorly sorted at the upstream; trimodal and extremely poorly sorted in the midstream; and polymodal and extremely poorly sorted towards the downstream of the river. Upstream sediments were fine gravelly mud and very coarse gravelly mud, while downstream sediments were very coarse gravelly muddy very fine sand and very fine gravelly, clayey very fine sand, indicating sediments became finer downstream. The study identified 993 individual macroinvertebrates from 21 families. Highest mean abundance (100 ± 9.2) was recorded at Kimangeti (upstream) while least was at Mutono (11 ± 0.7) (downstream). A regression model of the relationship between mean sediment grain size and mean macroinvertebrate abundance indicated that sediment grain size accounted for 28.7% of the spatial variability of macroinvertebrate abundance. The connection between sediment size and macroinvertebrate abundance and diversity in the Isiukhu River highlights that control of soil erosion in this catchment is important for the ecology of this river.",

This is the first study in South Africa which catalogued and analysed diatom deformities in detail. We assessed diatom deformities in response to a large water chemistry dataset, including pH, electrical conductivity, alkalinity, hardness, nutrients, heavy metals and radioactive elements. The freshwaters of the Karoo exhibited wide ranges in many of their environmental variables. Diatom deformities were categorised into four types (outline, raphe, striation and mixed/other), and each cell measured and photographed. Correlations and multivariate analyses between environmental variables and deformity type, as well as diatom species, were performed. A cumulative criterion unit (CCU) ratio, using South African aquatic ecosystem limits, was calculated for Al, Cd, Cu, Mn, Pb, Se and Zn to determine if the combined effect of these metals exerted any influence on the cause of deformities. No single stressor could be linked to the deformities. Instead, variables showing to be most probable to exert an influence are electrical conductivity, oxidised nitrogen, sulphate and lithium, with selenium and strontium having a lesser influence. The CCU application did not yield expected results. This could be due to the naturally highly mineralised water found in the Karoo.Keywords: biomonitoringEastern Capelithiumnitrogen sulphate",

    "abstract": "AbstractIn a world grappling with the dire consequences of poor sanitation and inadequate water conditions, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive solution. The staggering statistics of over 400 million affected cases and 15–25 million lives lost worldwide underscore the gravity of the situation. This paper addresses this critical issue by introducing a novel approach to water quality monitoring that leverages wireless sensor networks. Traditional monitoring techniques have proven inefficient in combating the proactive contamination of water sources. These methods often involve the cumbersome grouping of various points within the distribution network, resulting in delayed outcomes, labour-intensive processes and a lack of real-time data. To overcome these limitations, this study presents a paradigm shift by employing wireless sensor networks as a viable alternative. Our proposed system boosts capability to measure a range of physicochemical parameters linked to water quality, including reductions in potential, conductivity, pH level, temperature and flow rate. By scrutinising these parameters, our sensors effectively detect water contaminants, enabling a proactive response to potential threats. To achieve this, we have meticulously designed and implemented sensors equipped with signal conditioning circuits. These sensors are seamlessly integrated into a network, with each node connected to a microcontroller responsible for data analysis and processing. This integration ensures real-time monitoring, the rapid detection of water quality deviations and swift response mechanisms.Keywords: Water quality monitoringflow sensorpH sensorconductivity sensortemperature sensorreal timeremotewireless sensor networks",

This study aimed to investigate the impact of this flood on the coral communities in Xai-Xai lagoon. Benthic cover was assessed in January 2000 (before the floods) and September 2000 (after the floods) using the line intercept transect technique. A decrease in hard coral cover of the order of 58.5% was observed. The soft coral community was significantly affected, with a decrease in percentage cover of 90.4%. Coralline algae also decreased by 85.1%. All other categories increased in percentage cover: turf algae (164.4%), other invertebrates (e.g. sponges, sea urchins — 111.1%), fleshy algae (80.4%), rubble (34.4%) and dead coral (379.0%). The main causes of this degradation were the reduced water salinity and the large amount of sediment discharged by the Limpopo River. Some massive (e.g. Porites, Favia, Favites and Goniopora) and encrusting (e.g. Echinopora) hard coral genera seemed less affected, suggesting an elevated capacity to cope with this kind of stress through mucus-sheet formation. The extent of the flood effect on other reefs on the southern Mozambique coast is discussed and a monitoring programme is proposed.",

A capsule, composed of dense, regularly-arranged collagen and elastic fibres mixed with a few smooth muscle cells, enclosed the ovaries and gave off connective tissue septa, forming the ovigerous lamellae, which contained germ and follicle cells. Eight discrete stages of recrudescence were identified: oogonia, chromatin nucleolar oocytes, perinucleolar oocytes, primary yolk vesicle oocytes, secondary yolk vesicle oocytes, tertiary yolk vesicle oocytes, post-ovulatory follicles and atretic oocytes. Ovulation seemed to be synchronised with the onset of rainfall, with some deviations in the Sio River population. Gonadosomatic index variation followed a bimodal pattern, with maxima between January–February and between September–October for both populations. The same pattern was exhibited for both rainfall and water levels at the two study sites. Successful ovulation was followed by the formation of post-ovulatory follicles and Type I atresia, while failed spawning was characterised by Type II atresia. Clearance of post-ovulatory follicles was by phagocytosis and formation of melanomacrophage centres. There were variations in post-ovulatory changes between the two populations. Reproductive patterns in the Kagera River population conformed to the 'norm' in African labeines of the synchronisation of spawning with rainfall. Slight deviations from this pattern were, however, observed in the Sio River population where spawning occurred prior to the onset of rainfall.",

There are opportunities to control these outbreaks through flow manipulation by using an upstream impoundment that has an annual shutdown period for maintenance. In this study, the stones-in-current biotope was surveyed at five sites prior to, and immediately succeeding, a flow shutdown. Changes in aquatic macroinvertebrate community composition and densities of larval and pupal blackfly were assessed and related to changes in hydraulic habitat due to the flow reductions. Although flows at those sites where blackfly densities were highest did not decrease to the levels desired for effective pest control, results from two sites indicated that flow reduction can lead to reductions in densities of larval blackfly without detrimental impacts on non-target macroinvertebrates. Simulations using a blackfly outbreak model indicate that flow reduction from an average of over 7 m3 s−1 to below 2 m3 s−1 for three to four weeks would effectively control blackfly outbreaks. Such an approach could be achieved through negotiations among affected Farmers' Associations, Irrigation Boards and the regional Department of Water Affairs and Forestry.

Macroinvertebrate taxonomic richness did not differ significantly between sampling dates, indicating that fish removal had no effect on the zoobenthos taxa richness but led instead to large increases in the densities of certain macroinvertebrates. There was a progressive increase in the body size of Odonata in fishless pools 34 and 55 days after treatment and, by 78 days post-treatment, the proportion of large-sized odonates was significantly higher in fishless than in control pools. Peak densities of predaceous invertebrates coincided with a sharp decline in macroinvertebrate densities in the fishless pools about three months after fish removal. The values for Strauss's food selection index were low (range –0.220 to 0.180) for all macroinvertebrates, indicating random feeding by fish. Results indicate that, although fish may be important predators, they are not keystone predators because the macroinvertebrate community structure in this temporary habitat was found to be influenced by the assemblages of both vertebrate and invertebrate predators, rather than by a single keystone predator.",

Species responded differently to AMD after 96 hours and 240 hours of exposure in static experimental test designs. Burnupia stenochorias was more sensitive to AMD after 96 and 240 hours of exposure, whereas O. mossambicus was tolerant during short-term exposure, but became more sensitive after 240 hours of exposure than the other species tested. The availability of metals in AMD was directly associated with dilution rate. Scenario-specific water quality guidelines for AMD have been derived as 0.122% for short-term and 0.014% for long-term exposure. These may form important indicative dilutions for other AMDs that do not match the scenarios of this study.

To this effect, two sea expeditions (in November 2014 and February 2015) were carried out to collect in situ lake surface temperature (LST), chlorophyll a (Chl) and Secchi disk depth (SDD) to compare with the corresponding satellite derived variables. Comparisons were made based on the following error matrices: coefficient of correlation (r), mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute deviation (MAD) and mean absolute percent error (MAPE). In general the results showed that satellite derived LST gives a good estimate of in situ LST. Conversely, the error matrices indicated that satellite derived Chl yielded more uncertainty when compared with in situ Chl. This could be because of the fact that the MODIS Chl product algorithm was designed for oceans and may not be appropriate for inland lakes. Satellite derived SDD compared fairly well with in situ SDD. From these results it is evident that with more in situ observations and improved algorithms, MODIS can be useful to improve how water quality is monitored on Lake Victoria.Keywords: chlorophyll ainland lakeMODISmonitoringSecchi depthtemperature",

Spatial distribution of systematic groups was also analysed. The high morphospecies richness, characterised by the number of families and Shannon's and Simpson's Diversity Indices, recorded at some sites was probably owing to the diversity of substratum and undisturbed environmental conditions observed in these forested rivers. Conversely, some sites presented lower species richness, possibly because of unfavourable natural conditions.",

Highly popular with anglers, it is one of the most introduced and invasive fish globally, with strong potential to alter ecosystem structure and functioning. A better understanding of the trophic dynamics of M. salmoides populations is critical for effective management of its ecological impacts in their invasive range. This study investigated the diets and dietary ontogenetic shifts of M. salmoides in two South African dams along with its trophic positioning relative to other fish community members, through stomach content and stable isotope analyses. Micropterus salmoides was a top predator in both dams. In the Mankazana Dam, it depended predominately on insect prey, demonstrating a generalised feeding strategy, with shifts to include increasing proportions of fish prey with increasing size. Contrastingly, in the Wriggleswade Dam, M. salmoides displayed no ontogenetic shifts and preferred Gilchristella aestuaria, likely indicating a shift to a predominantly fish-based diet at smaller sizes, in the presence of small pelagic fish prey. Overall, M. salmoides diet was opportunistic, likely associated with prey morphology and behaviour (associated with refuge availability) and therefore directly linked to prey abundance and availability, which consequently dictated feeding strategy.",

Average K2P intraspecies distances between this fish DNA barcoding study ranged from zero (Thoracochromis albolaris) to 10% for the outgroup. There are approximately 17 Thoracochromis (Greenwood 1979) species in Africa, with only two in southern Africa (Skelton 2001). Both occur in the Cunene River System (at the border of Angola and Namibia). Thoracochromis albolaris (Trewavas and Thys van den Audenaerde 1969) – abbreviated as Tha – prefers rocky areas, whereas Thoracochromis buysi (Penrith 1970) – Thb – prefers sandy habitats. Pseudocrenilabrus philander (Weber 1897) – Pp – is a widely distributed species in Africa (Skelton 2001). Tilapia guinasana Trewavas 1936 – Tg – is endemic to Namibia, endangered and confined to Lake Guinas. These are very colourful fish (e.g. Tg varies in colour combinations from white to blue, yellow, black, olive green and some even have red fins).Keywords: cytochrome oxidase1 genedivergenceold world cichlidsgeneticsmitochondrial data",

A total of 571 fish grouped into two size classes (TL, range ± SD: juveniles of 20–60 ± 45 mm; adults of 61–140 ± 85 mm) were sampled by seine netting; prey items were removed from the guts and identified and sorted to obtain dietary information for each prey group. Of the examined guts, 97% contained prey comprising 17 taxa within 10 taxonomic groups. Teleosts were identified to species level, whereas most dietary components were identified to a broad taxonomic group. Aquatic invertebrates were the most important component of the diet of G. callidus, but the index of relative importance (%IRI) of dominant invertebrate taxa varied according to ontogenetic stage of G. callidus and season. Prey taxa included: Diptera, Hemiptera, Trichoptera, Odonata, Cladocera, Copepoda, Hydracarina, Amphipoda, Mollusca and Teleostei. Dipteran prey taxa were consistently encountered in both size classes and across all seasons. G. callidus can therefore be regarded as a generalist invertivore.",

The construction of a 500 m causeway across the lagoon connecting the residential townships of Paradise Beach and Aston Bay followed. Freshwater abstraction in the catchment has escalated, whereas increasing sedimentation, duration and frequency of mouth closure and hypersaline events contributed to the deteriorating health status of the estuary. Pedestrian and vehicle numbers crossing the causeway are high, particularly among Paradise Beach residents who need to access schools, medical services, work premises, business and shopping facilities. Causeway maintenance is ongoing, whereas winter storm surges deposit large volumes of sand and seawater in the estuary. The causeway becomes submerged, exacerbating threats to human safety. The mouth is then artificially breached, sometimes illegally. Although causeway removal was a key objective in the management plan, upgrading or construction of alternate roads was a first requirement. Other management objectives included guidelines for artificial mouth breaching and restoration of freshwater runoff. Without freshwater inflow the health of the estuary will continue to deteriorate; the system cannot be managed by only focussing on mouth management or other non-natural structures.",

The monitoring data used in the study included physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. The spatial and temporal characteristics of these parameters was evaluated by collecting water samples fortnightly from May 2011 to December 2012 in three stations chosen to represent different parts of the reservoir. Ten parameters considered as indicators of water properties were analysed: temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, electric conductivity, transparency, orthophosphorus, ammonium, nitrites, nitrates, and chlorophyll a. The results show that nutrient concentrations were among the highest (mean concentrations: PO 3− = 0.64 mg l−1, NH4+ = 1.08 mg l−1) recorded for Moroccan freshwater reservoirs. Our data indicated that the Sidi Abderrahmane is a destratified reservoir that it is relatively warm (mean temperature: 22.42 ± 4.88 °C); a polymictic reservoir in a semi-arid climate. Fertilisers applied in the surrounding orchards affect significantly affect nutrient levels in the waterbody, particularly PO 3− and NH4+ in autumn. The water column is seasonally homogeneous, as a result of wind-induced mixing, and our tests showed no anoxia throughout the study period. With suitable hydraulic conditions (short residence time, short outflow/inflow ratio, good oxygenation, and homogeneity), the Sidi Abderrahmane water body could reduce the stratification time and improve water quality.",

This indicated that the distribution, behaviour and fate of OCPs the the reservoir have close links with meteorological properties beyond their chemical composition.",

Trace element and metal levels were highest in sediment and lowest in water. No significant correlation was found between water quality and trace elements on infection variables. Trace elements did not have an effect on the occurrence of the parasite, therefore it was concluded that the changes observed during the study were not brought on by changes in water quality as a result of pollution, but rather that these changes relate to seasonal variation in infection biology of C. philander.",

Priority physicochemical parameters (total suspended solid, dissolved oxygen and biochemical oxygen demand) indicated high organic enrichment, chiefly due to inputs of bloody effluent. The burning of animal skin with discarded car tyres to produce kpomo, a common local soup component, contributes to the creek's quality alterations. Ironically, diversity of zoobenthos was highest at the area receiving the abattoir effluents compared to areas upstream and downstream from that point. Possible explanations are provided for the inverted diversity trend using the Hutcheson Index, which indicated significant diversities in invertebrate species amongst the three sample sites.

Increments were counted using a compound light microscope under transmitted light at 100–400 magnification. Linear regression models were fitted to the known age post-fertilisation and the age estimated using increment counts to test the correspondence between the two for each species. Regression models explained 89–99% of the variability in estimated age from increment counts, depending on the upper age cut-off applied to the data. The slopes of the regression models were significantly lower than 1.0, which indicated that increment counts were consistently lower than actual ages and this disparity increased for older individuals. It was, therefore, confirmed that larvae and juveniles of both largemouth and smallmouth yellowfish deposited increments on a near-daily basis, and that counts are a reliable estimate of age up to c. 100 d.",

The stomach content dry weight for large fish of 20–30 cm SL peaked in the morning, whereas for small 10–20 cm SL fish it peaked at dusk. Small O. niloticus and O. macrochir fed for 14 h and 12 h, respectively, whereas big fish fed on average for 8 h and 6 h, respectively. Oreochromis macrochir ingested more food than O. niloticus.

Big O. macrochir also ingested 2.7 g d−1, which was 4% more than that of O. niloticus of comparable size. The mean digestive coefficient of proteins ingested by O. niloticus, 62.5% (SD 8.6), was higher than that of O. macrochir, 39.4% (SD 9.1).

The LHS method has not previously been applied to tropical lakes but could potentially be a useful tool. The LHS approach was applied on a tropical African reservoir, Malilangwe reservoir, in 2011. The application of this methodology included the calculation of summary metrics Lake Habitat Metric Survey (LHMS) and Lake Habitat Quality Assessment (LHQA). Results show that although Malilangwe reservoir is experiencing increasing human pressure, it does not appear to suffer from a major invasion of alien plants. Its LHQA score, 76 out of 112, and LHMS score, 16 out of 42, are indicative of relatively few human pressures such as water pumping structures and residential areas. We conclude that the use of LHS can directly enhance the quality and reliability of hydromorphological assessments and can lead to better lake conservation and rehabilitation.

This study compared damage by herbivores on leaves of four mangrove species at sites under different levels of human physical disturbance, and provides further evidence of the indirect effects of man on these valuable habitats. From 2001 to 2003 leaves collected fortnightly using litter traps were examined for evidence of herbivore damage, e.g. holes, margin damage, and a mix of both holes and margin damage on the leaf, and compared using ANOVA. Of 10 600 leaves examined, 3 604 had evidence of herbivore attack, with margin damage being most prevalent (60%). On Rhizophora mucronata, holes and mixed damage occurred on over 30% of damaged leaves, while margin damage was common to all other species examined. Leaf attack intensity was 14% lower at undisturbed sites, with margin damage being most common. Comparison between corresponding mangrove forest sites in Kenya showed significant increase in margin damage and concurrent decline in holes and mixed damage at disturbed sites. Variation in leaf damage occurrence was attributed to changes in forest structural and biological complexity owing to selective harvesting of flora and fauna that influenced the competitive ability and prevalence of aerial herbivorous guild.

During the last three years, the process has been further developed by linking the IFRs (using the IFR model) to an historical time series and a natural flow trigger. It has become imperative that the liaison between IFR specialists and developers of the methodology should not end here, as some of the most important requirements for supplying the IFR include the determination of the yield of a system as well as the design and ultimate operation of storage structures. On the basis of some case studies this paper considers how the liaison should take place after the specialist workshop and summarises the areas where further development is required.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the current ecological status of the Groot Letaba River and to compare this information with historical data. The objective was to determine the effects of various impacts on the fish populations of the river. This was done by analysing the water quality and by considering the effect of weirs and dams, as well as various illegal angling activities, on the fish community. The Groot Letaba River is not highly polluted and the decline in its flow seems to be the greatest threat to the system. During a preliminary study to develop the river's resource potential, it was stated that the annual water allocation from Tzaneen Dam was 103.9 million m3/annum for irrigation, 8.4 million m3/annum for domestic and industrial use and 14.7 million m3/annum for environmental purposes. However, the yield from Tzaneen Dam was only 98 million m3/annum, suggesting that more water had been allocated than was available. As a result only 20% of the simulated natural flow is observed at Letaba Ranch Weir at the lower end of the river. Over the past few years many weirs and dams, none of which have fishways, have been constructed in the Groot Letaba River, impacting on the flow regime and on the migration potential of many fish species. Tiger fish (Hydrocynus vittatus) and the largescale yellowfish (Barbus marequensis) are two of the more prominent species influenced negatively by these barriers. This problem is aggravated by the illegal netting of fish stranded below these barriers during their spawning migrations.",

Only the latter species serves as intermediate host for Schistosoma haematobium in Zimbabwe. Growth, egg laying and survival were followed for various densities of the two species in either single-species or mixed-species aquaria, i.e. 2, 4, 6 or 8 snails in single-species aquaria and 2/6, 4/4 and 6/2 B. tropicus / B. globosus in mixed-species aquaria. A separate experiment was done for mixed-species aquaria where the two species were physically separated by a mesh. The results indicated a significant reduction in reproduction by Bulinus globosus in direct competition (unpartitioned aquaria) with B. tropicus. The presence of damaged egg masses (partly consumed) in these aquaria suggests that B. tropicus preyed on B. globosus egg masses. Furthermore, B. tropicus was found to start laying eggs at an earlier age than B. globosus, and its eggs had a shorter hatching time than those of B. globosus. Quasi-field experiments showed that B. globosus populations were slightly less prolific in the presence of Bulinus tropicus although the effect was not statistically significant due to a great variability between ponds and possibly the observation period was too short. Further studies using enclosure experiments are suggested.",

    "abstract": "In an attempt to meet the requirement of the new South African Water law a number of initiatives are under way to determine the flow requirements for our rivers. An essential component of this initiative is the determination of the influence of changing flows on instream habitat. Two components need to be assessed: change in the aerial extent of habitat and change in habitat diversity. This paper presents a technique that aims to address qualitative and quantitative changes in instream habitat in response to changing flow discharge. A hydraulic biotope classification based on a matrix of substrate and flow type has been developed by the authors in collaboration with stream ecologists. Hydraulic biotope diversity was studied in the Buffalo River, Eastern Cape province, and results show how the composition of hydraulic biotopes depends on both the channel morphology and the discharge. These findings complement parallel studies carried out by Padmore and Newson in the United Kingdom. The classification system promises to provide a useful way to describe discharge-related changes in habitat. Early research by Wadeson and Rowntree was based on point surveys and ignored the spatial distribution and aerial extent of hydraulic biotopes. King and Schael have developed a mapping technique to describe the distribution of hydraulic biotopes, but its application is limited by time and manpower requirements. This paper demonstrates a relatively simple field technique, which is under development, based on overhead photography. The technique allows a quantitative assessment of the changes in the aerial distribution of hydraulic biotopes in response to changes in discharge. The potential application of this technique to both IFR assessments and the River Health Programme is discussed.",

Fish and frogs were exposed to various concentrations of latex to determine the concentration lethal only to the fish. The same concentrations were then used to determine the stability of the latex, by exposing fish in tanks with and without biological filtration. The breakdown period varied, with it breaking down quicker with biological filtration than without it. Once the stability of the latex within a system was determined, crabs, aquatic snails, frogs and fish were all simultaneously tested in a tank at the same concentration as before. Within 12 hours all the fish and half the frogs died, whereas the crabs and snails appeared not to suffer any detrimental effects. The poison degraded and became harmless to fish within 48 hours. Thus, the latex of Euphorbia ingens is a temporarily effective ichthyocide when applied in the correct concentrations.",

Catch, catch composition and fishing effort were determined for the most important gear types. The different gears exploited different stocks of fish. Copadichromis spp. were caught mostly in deep-water seine (chirimila) nets and accounted for >50% of the total catch. Oreochromis spp. were the major catch in the beach seine fishery. Labeo mesops and Opsaridium microcephalus were the most important catches in gill nets. The catfishes Bathyclarias spp. and Bagrus meridionalis dominated the long line fishery. Since 1983 there has been a considerable increase in fishing effort. The number of beach seines, chirimila nets and long lines increased 2.8 times, 2.9 times and 2.5 times, respectively, and there was a fourfold increase in the number of gear owners and fishing assistants. Comparison with data for Chembe Village in Malawi indicates that the fish populations at Metangula are not yet as impacted as they are on the populous and accessible Malawi coast. Some constraints on the fishery include the lack of management and financial support, poor gear and infrastructure, and the lack of access to markets.

Catch and effort data from four representative landing sites were collected daily from June 2016 to May 2017 and used to estimate the total mortality coefficient (Z) using catch curve analysis, natural mortality (M) using Pauly's empirical formula, and fishing mortality (F) as F = Z − M.

In total, 5 077 tons of O. niloticus were produced, which exceeds the MSY of 4 904 tons per year that could be obtained from the fishery at an F0.1. Consequently, the recommendation is to reduce the fishing effort by 15%. Collection of catch-and- effort data from more landing sites, over an extended period, could improve the yield estimates and this should be considered in conjunction with a bioeconomic analysis in future.",

The results showed that mean water temperature (30.32 ± 3.34 °C), conductivity (199.11 ± 118.70 μS cm−1) and total dissolved solids (102.60 ± 58.5 mg l−1) were highest in the dry season, while mean flow rate (0.7 ± 0.1 ms−1) and dissolved oxygen (6.15 ± 1.88 mg l−1) were highest in the wet season.

A multivariate analysis, Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA), was used to examine the macroinvertebrate community structure. Based on the selected physico-chemical variables and metal concentrations assessed, the water quality and sediment quality are deteriorating mainly in the downstream areas. The number of taxa and the Average Score per Taxon (ASPT) were significantly different between sites and seasons, with more taxa recorded in the upstream section of the river and in winter. A higher proportion of sensitive and high-scoring taxa (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera) were recorded in upstream and midstream sites and in winter. The CCA analysis showed an association of heavy metal concentration in the sediment with the distribution of macroinvertebrate taxa tolerant to poor water quality in the downstream section of the river. Because of the potential impacts of rapid economic development in the catchment, regular monitoring of the river is recommended, to detect potential river health problems early.Keywords: bioindicatorsheavy metalsland usesediment qualitywater pollution",

A fish survey was undertaken between September 2017 and October 2018 from 11 sites in the Blyde and Treur Rivers using electrofishing and fyke nets. Differences in species composition, relative abundance, and community structure among sites were tested using multivariate analysis. A total of ten fish species were captured. There were significant differences in composition and abundance between fish communities that could be attributed to O. mykiss invasion and variation in habitats. Populations of native species that historically occurred throughout the upper catchment, such as Enteromius treurensis, were greatly reduced and fragmented in the presence of O. mykiss. However, instream migration barriers such as waterfalls have prevented upstream migration of O. mykiss, and these invasion-free areas have remnant populations of native fishes that appear to be largely intact. This finding is consistent with other studies that have shown that introduced alien predatory fish can have a significant effect on fish communities and highlighted the need to prevent human-facilitated introductions in biodiversity sensitive areas, such as mountain headwater streams, that are inhabited by endemic and range-restricted minnows.",

    "abstract": "The Cheleleka Wetland is located in the Ethiopian Rift Valley on the upper shore of Lake Hawassa, after which the regional capital is named. This study investigated the relationship between water quality and the occurrence and diversity of macrophyte species of the wetland. Spatio-temporal variability in terms of water quality and macrophytes were studied in the wet and dry seasons at purposely-selected sites selected based on human disturbance levels. Six sites were selected, two from each of 'severely', 'moderately' and 'least disturbed', and data collected on water quality parameters, macrophytes richness and abundance. The results showed 25 macrophyte species dominated by Cyperaceae (24%), Poaceae (20%) and Nymphaeaceae (12%). Species diversity and abundance were significantly different between seasons and among the sampling sites (p < 0.05), with the richest taxa recorded at the least disturbed sites. A redundancy analysis of the species–environment relationships identified nutrient loads as significant drivers of macrophyte diversity and abundance in the wetland. Generally, the results showed the spatial and temporal variation of macrophyte diversity and abundance are affected by water quality, and poor water quality has resulted in poor ecological conditions of the Cheleleka Wetland.",

In total, 1 146 specimens were collected, with 35 species from 19 families represented. The most abundant species encountered were Liza spp. (Mugilidae; 36%), Sarotherodon melanotheron (Cichlidae; 16%), Elops lacerta (Elopidae; 6%) and Sardinella aurita (Clupeidae; 5%), which exhibited pronounced spatial distribution. Sarotherodon melanotheron showed preference for ponds with minimal water flow and depth, Sardinella aurita occurred only in deeper sections of the mangrove channel with significant flow velocity, and Elops lacerta in the pond and all channel stations. Mugilids were found exclusively in the channel, whereas Palaemonidae (Macrobrachium macrobrachion and M. vollenhoveni) occurred in specific locations in the channel, with species- specific preferences for tidal stages. Most species encountered were identified to be predominantly marine migrants with bentophagous feeding habit. Site selection and tidal stages were found to affect the occurrence and distribution of fishes over a tidal cycle and interactively influence species diversity.",

This was relevant as the species in which metals are stored within specific sediment components is important in determining their impact on the environment. For both coastal and inland sediments, a higher percentage of cadmium was associated with the more available exchangeable and carbonate fractions, while iron, zinc and manganese were mainly associated with the reducible and organic fractions. Lead and copper were found to have the greatest ability to form different species in the samples examined and were more evenly associated with all the fractions. The metals generally showed more ability to form different species in inland freshwaters than in coastal relatively saline waters. However, differences between inland and coastal waters were based more on whether the environments were oxidising or reducing than on whether they were fresh or saline. The metals may be divided into three groups of high mobility consisting of lead and copper; moderate mobility made up of cadmium, manganese and zinc; and low mobility, represented by iron.

Microcystis aeruginosa showed higher growth rates and chlorophyll a concentrations than O. simplicissima for most treatments, except the N-deficient treatments. It seems that M. aeruginosa can maintain growth under a range of different conditions and can keep forming mass occurrences, but has high light requirements for photosynthesis and maintenance and can tolerate a much higher light intensity without experiencing photo-inhibition. Oscillatoria simplicissima, on the other hand, is able to harvest available light more efficiently at 25 °C and 15 μmol m2 s-1, experiences less damage or loss at antenna level and retains more of its electron transport capabilities than Microcystis, giving it a competitive edge over M. aeruginosa under these environmental conditions.",

Tsimanampesotse, a 'conservation hotspot' soda lake in southwestern Madagascar, was integrated into the Ramsar wetland network in 1998.

Water quality and aquatic invertebrates were investigated in April and August 2013 to provide baseline data in order to measure possible changes of the area in the future. Changes in water temperature (19.5–25.9 °C) and in dissolved oxygen (9.3–11.3 mg l−1) were detected. The water was highly mineralised (EC > 41 000 µS cm−1) and moderately alkaline (pH ∼ 8.0). The maximum concentrations of ammonia and phosphate were relatively high (39.1 and 57.6 mg l−1, respectively). Freshwater runoff from the plateau makes the water quality in the eastern part of the lake better than that in the west. Of the 15 taxa of macroinvertebrate assessed, the crustaceans Grandidierella mahafalensis and Apseudes thaumastocheles were dominant. Decreased water salinity in April increased the abundance and diversity of macroinvertebrates. Despite its incorporation to the protected area, Lake Tsimanampesotse is still impacted by human activities and needs supplementary preservation.",

We used molecular and morphological data to address the challenge of species delimitation within the genus Schilbe.

Distinctive geographic patterns in genetic variation within southern, eastern, and western African populations were revealed. Particularly, the South African population is distinct from those of Namibia, Botswana and Nigeria. No individuals with rudimentary adipose fins were found at any locality, but specimens from three localities either had or did not have adipose fins. These mixed occurrences are suspected to be a result of human interventions, and that the presence of rudimentary adipose fins in the east African species could be an adaptive feature that serves to stabilise these fish in faster currents. In addition, the genetic divergence observed among African silver catfish from geographically isolated river systems is conceivably the result of micro-evolutionary adaptive responses to different environmental conditions. Collectively, these results distinguish S. depressirostris from S. intermedius.",

We hypothesised that the phytoplankton chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl a) and invasive alien aquatic plant (IAAP) abundance would be highest during the low-flow season and that shifts in community structure would be driven by salinity and nutrient gradients. The augmented freshwater inflow limited phytoplankton Chl a (<5 µg Chl a l−1) due to low freshwater residency, while isolated instances of increased Chl a (≥10 but ≤20 µg Chl a l−1) were recorded following a brief period of mouth closure. Cyanophyceae proliferated for 67% of the study period with maximum abundance (>10 000 cells ml−1) recorded in spring owing to increased water retention. A community consisting of co-dominant Cryptophyceae, Euglenophyceae and IAAPs was recorded during winter, indicating a shared preference for slow-flowing, low-salinity (<5) eutrophic habitats. Dinophyceae was the only phytoplankton class that showed niche differentiation by favouring the mesohaline lower reaches. The homogenisation of dynamic estuarine gradients and the prevalence of nutrient-tolerant primary producers is indicative of the degraded state of this estuary as a result of consistent nutrient-enriched freshwater baseflows. The application of a multidisciplinary restoration approach is required to improve the ecosystem health.",

Three case histories illustrating the growth and development of conservation of freshwater fishes in southern Africa are presented. The Maloti minnow, discovered and described in 1938, was considered possibly extinct in the 1960s. Its re-discovery in high altitude streams in Lesotho and subsequent research on its biology and ecology established it as an icon of conservation for a nation whose development and well-being depends largely on its freshwater resources. The Clanwilliam yellowfish population has declined markedly over the past fifty years. Efforts to conserve the species illustrate the changing directions, frustrations and problems of riverine conservation in recent times. The illusions and problems of alien fish introductions provide a third dramatic example to illustrate the state of fish conservation at the end of the 20 th Century. \nKeywords: indigenous fishes; alien sportfishes; conservation ethics; maloti minnow; clanwilliam yellowfish; largemouth bass \n(Afr J Aqua Sci: 2000 25: 37-42)",

Bulinus tropicus of all sizes were vulnerable to predation by fish, but both Melanoides tuberculata and Bulinus globosus with shell heights greater than 10mm seemed to be less so. Surprisingly, the density of B. globosus was lower in ponds without fish than in ponds with fish, while the density of B. tropicus was very high in ponds without fish. It was not possible to conclude whether B. globosus benefited by the presence of fish, or was less palatable to the fish than B. tropicus, or whether the high density of B. tropicus in ponds without fish exerted competitive effects on B. globosus.

Evidence suggested that L. umbratus spawns in the reservoirs.

However, the factors causing seasonal migrations are poorly understood and most scientific references to them are anecdotal, lacking rigorous description. Fish migrations in two dambos in Zimbabwe were investigated during the 1999/2000 rainy season, by electrofishing and using traps. The fish fell into two categories: those that used the dambo, and those that remained in the main river. At the beginning of the rainy season Barbus paludinosus, B. lineomaculatus, Clarias gariepinus and Tilapia sparrmanii moved from the perennial river into the small dambo streams and spawned there, then moved back to the perennial river, leaving their young in the dambo, which acted as a nursery area. Barbus spp. were the most numerous migrants and they moved mainly during daylight hours. Other fish species present in the system included Opsaridium zambezense, Leptoglanis rotundiceps, Chiloglanis neumanni, Labeobarbus marequensis, Labeo cylindricus, Oreochromis mossambicus, Tilapia rendalli, Marcusenius macrolepidotus and Micropterus salmoides. These did not enter the dambo streams but remained in the perennial river. Later in the season, larger juveniles of all the migratory species that had entered the dambo moved downstream into the perennial river, but the smaller juveniles remained in the dambo until the next rainy season, demonstrating that downstream movement is ontogenetically cued.",

Internationally the most commonly applied fish index is the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI), whilst in South Africa the most commonly applied index is the Fish Assemblage Integrity Index (FAII). The Sensitivity-weighted Index of Biotic Integrity (SIBI) was developed as an alternative multimetric fish index, incorporating important principles from both the IBI and FAII. This study indicated that the SIBI was a valuable index which used fish as indicators of biotic integrity in the Klip River. The SIBI was also suited to the analysis of site-specific data and the investigation of specific impacts. It is envisaged that the SIBI concept could be applied to other aquatic systems and could possibly be used as an alternative fish index for South African rivers, especially when investigations necessitate site-specific evaluations. The application of the SIBI and IBI in this study also emphasised the FAII's potential underestimation of biotic integrity. The results obtained from the use of the SIBI indicated that the biotic integrity of the Klip River System is currently moderately to critically modified from its natural condition.",

It was planned to reduce lead levels in petrol, regarded as the major source of lead in the Nigerian environment, to 0.15g l−1 by the end of 2002 and to zero by 2004, while 2005 was to be the phase-out year for lead additives in petrol throughout the sub-Saharan region. The WHO-recommended limit for lead levels in surface water is 0.01mg l−1. Despite the now-reduced lead content in petrol, lead levels in surface waters ranged between 0.5–2.35mg l−1 (mean 0.76mg l−1) and 1.15–2.20mg l−1 (mean 1.34mg l−1) during the dry and rainy seasons, respectively. Lead levels in river sediments ranged between 0.9–4mg kg−1 (mean 1.86mg kg−1) and 1.15–2.2mg kg−1 (mean 1.49mg kgl−1) during the dry and rainy seasons, respectively. Lead levels in fish ponds were even higher, at 1.09–2.9mg l−1 (mean 1.88mg l−1). The present situation therefore indicates severe lead contamination of aquatic systems in Ibadan City, which portends a serious public health risk to humans. A detailed assessment of other sources of lead pollution in the Nigerian environment — besides vehicle emissions — is required if lead pollution is to be reduced effectively.",

Eighteen bacterial species were encountered, identified and categorised as LAS-sensitive bacteria, LAS-tolerant bacteria and LAS-degrading bacteria. Thirteen species were tolerant of LAS (0.1% w/v), of which eight showed the potential to degrade LAS, and five were sensitive to LAS (0.1% w/v). The responses of the bacteria can be relied upon in assessing water for the presence of LAS. The potential of some of the resident bacteria to degrade LAS can be explored with the aim of deveoping methods for the amelioration of detergent effluent pollution through the bio-treatment of effluent before discharge.",

The zooplankton community structures of the lakes reflected the salinity gradient of the system, with some coastal marine taxa recorded in the lakes closer to the mouth and only freshwater taxa recorded in Lake Amanzamnyama. Mesozooplankton diversity and abundance were relatively low compared to other estuarine systems along the eastern coast of South Africa. The dominant taxa were calanoid copepods Acartiella natalensis and Pseudodiaptomus stuhlmanni and the mysid Mesopodopsis africana in the lower lakes, whereas cyclopoids Mesocyclops sp. and Thermocyclops sp. dominated the freshwater lake Amanzamnyama.",

The feeding characteristics of the giraffe catfish did not differ significantly between the lakes, as revealed by a Wilcoxon rank-sum test (p > 0.05). Insect larvae and algae dominated stomach content, with proportionate contributions of 43.8% and 14.2% in Lake Bontanga and 49.3% and 10.6% in Lake Tono, respectively. In the larger Lake Tono, the growth coefficient (K = 0.34 year) and asymptotic length (L∞ = 38.3 cm) were higher than in Lake Bontanga and the exploitation rate was comparatively low (E = 0.24). This lower exploitation level in Lake Tono agrees with a higher mean catch size of 27.6 cm and a high spawning stock biomass >0.4 of the unfished biomass, as well as a higher spawning stock biomass of 3.12 tonnes km−2, suggesting that there is scope for an intensification of the fishery. In the smaller Lake Bontanga, the species growth was lower (K = 0.31 yr−1 and L∞ = 28.9 cm) and the stock is fully exploited (E = 0.48). The mean catch size and spawning stock biomass were critically low; 17.2 cm and <0.4 of the unfished biomass, respectively.

Using scale increments as a proxy for growth, we found that O. niloticus had a high growth rate relative to O. jipe, with the highest growth rates for O. niloticus being observed in the Nyumba ya Mungu reservoir. These results help to explain why O. niloticus could be a superior competitor to native species in some circumstances. However, more introductions of this non-native species should be undertaken with caution given potential for negative ecological impacts on threatened indigenous tilapia species.",

Water temperature, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, transparency, nitrates, total nitrogen, orthophosphates, total phosphorus and metals (K, Na, Ca, Mg, Cu, Cd, Cr, Ni, Hg, Mn, Zn, Pb, Fe and As) were measured at five sites distributed across the Tugwi-Mukosi reservoir in July 2017. The reservoir was turbid after impoundment and had low water clarity. The trophic state of the reservoir ranged from eutrophic to marginally hypertrophic with high total phosphorus and total nitrogen concentrations. All measured physico-chemical water variables did not differ significantly between the lake sites with the exception of conductivity, ammonia and total phosphorus. Potassium, Na, Ca and Mg were high in the reservoir, whereas other heavy metals recorded low concentrations. Iron was relatively high with an average concentration of 0.24 mg l−1. The average Ca:K, Ca:Na and Ca:Mg ratios in the reservoir were 3.8, 1.1 and 3.2, respectively. The high Ca:Mg of 3.2 might favour the establishment of snails. Eutrophication of the Tugwi-Mukosi Reservoir should be abated through coordinated management of the reservoir and the terrestrial environment in the catchment to ensure that the water quality is able to support lake biodiversity and confer ecosystem services to human livelihoods around the reservoir.",

A major group of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that could be responsible for reproductive defects are those that mimic natural oestrogens, known as xenoestrogens. A number of in vivo and in vitro screening strategies are being developed to identify and classify xenoestrogens, in order to determine whether they pose a health risk to humans and animals. Oestrogens and androgens mediate their activity via intracellular receptors, directly in muscular tissue, as well as indirectly via stimulation of growth hormones from the pituitary glands and other growth factors from liver plus several other organs.

We examined alterations to nutrient dynamics from the biocontrol process of Salvinia molesta by the weevil Cyrtobagous salviniae in the Lake Xini of Okavango, Botswana. The abundance of weevils steadily increased from March to December 2009 in the range of 15 to 62 ind. kg−1 fresh biomass with 93% bud damage at the time of mat sinking. Dissolved oxygen was 1.2 mg l−1 with >90% salvinia coverage in March 2009 and increased to 4.56 mg l−1 after 12 months of biocontrol, when salvinia cover was reduced to <10% cover. The study was conducted by placing plastic containers in the lake containing 1 kg weevil infested salvinia and water from the lake. The declines in weevil-damaged 'floating salvinia' were inversely proportional to the increases in 'salvinia detritus' in the study containers. Leaching of nutrients (N and P) and major ions (Ca, Mg, Na and K) in floating salvinia and salvinia detritus, as a result of weevil damage, showed P and K consistently leached at higher rates. Nutrients in the lake were high during biocontrol process, compared with after control. Biocontrol resulted in an increase in dissolved oxygen and re-emergence of native vegetation.",

There were no significant differences between sites and therefore mean values for the impoundment as a whole were used to compare data with those from the literature. Comparative analysis showed elevated levels of manganese, iron, zinc, copper and cadmium from fish in this study. Due to the absence of human influence in the catchment area, these elevated levels are attributed to the unique geological characteristics of the catchment, compounded by the impoundment conditions.

On the basis of the computed 96 h LC50, the effluent showed a significant dose-dependent relationship in its toxicity between 24 and 96 h of exposure. The 96 h LC50 was 4.6 times more toxic than the 24 h LC50, indicating that the toxicity of the effluent increased over the study period. Besides crude oil and refined petroleum products, which are often the major concern for regulators, there is a need for the proper enforcement of standards and safe limits for effluents prior to discharge so as to protect sensitive marine species.Keywords: acute toxicityNiger Deltaoil pollutionshrimps",

    "abstract": "Temporal changes in fatty acid composition and δ15N, δ13C stable isotope values of the phytobenthos growing on artificial clay substrates under natural conditions over a 28-day period at an upstream and a downstream site in the Kowie River near Grahamstown were investigated in 2012. High concentrations of diatom markers 16:1ω7 and 20:5ω3 fatty acids were recorded, especially at the downstream site, reflecting the importance of diatoms in contributing to the phytobenthos communities at that station. After day 7 at the downstream site the average δ15N value of the phytobenthos was lighter, gradually increasing by ∼2‰ and ∼5‰ overall to heavier values on day 28. At the upstream site there were no significant changes (<1‰ increase) in δ15N values of the phytobenthos over time. Stable nitrogen (δ15N) and carbon (δ13C) signatures in the phytobenthos communities were significantly different between sites (one-way ANOVA; p < 0.001). The stable isotope values and fatty acid concentrations of phytobenthos at the downstream site were different to those of the phytobenthos at the upstream site, and they changed concurrently with changes in the phytobenthos community structure. At the downstream site there was a strong correlation of the δ15N of phytobenthos with nitrates (R = 0.56) and time (weeks; R = 0.81). However, the fatty acids were not specific enough to characterise the composition of phytobenthos communities. Other biomarker methods, such as stable isotopes and microscopic examination of the communities, were found to be useful. The results from this relatively small-scale tile experiment indicate the complexity of changes in fatty acid composition and δ15N, δ13C stable isotope values of a phytobenthos community. Stable isotope and fatty acid composition can be successfully used to map changes in phytobenthos composition and carbon and nitrogen flow patterns along a river continuum.",

Dried methanol extracts of Pterocarpus angolensis, Sclerocarya birrea, Pappea capensis and Commiphora africana were screened for molluscicidal activity against Lymnaea natalensis and Helisoma duryi. The freshwater snail L. natalensis is the intermediate host of fascioliasis in Zimbabwe, whereas H. duryi is a related non-vector snail. Of the four plant extracts studied, P. angolensis was the most effective with a 48 h LC50 of 34 mg l−1, whilst C. africana was the least effective with a 48 h LC50 of 53 mg l−1 for L. natalensis. The extract of P. angolensis was selectively toxic to L. natalensis, its LC50 being three times higher for H. duryi than for L. natalensis. These plant extracts are a potential source of lead compounds in the development of highly selective and environmentally friendly molluscicides. Further studies to isolate the active principles in these extracts are recommended.",

Flood extent depends on the height of the Niger River flood peak at Diré. Satellite imagery analysis indicated that a phase shift may have occurred in the year 2000, probably as a delayed consequence of the Sahelian drought of the 1970s compounded by the collapse of societal controls on water use during recent civil conflict. An economic evaluation of the system in 2011 showed US$100 000 per year of net income per flooded km² in Lake Faguibine, allowing vulnerable people to practise recession agriculture, to fish and to graze livestock. An intensive investment phase, combined with an approach of rebuilding local governance systems and environmental management capacity, could yield net benefits to the user communities of the order of ten times the maintenance costs, contributing to human well-being. The system is currently threatened by the building of the Fomi Dam in Guinea and by the planned expansion of irrigation upstream. There is also a risk of the return of a prolonged drought linked to the Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation index.",

High flows during the wet period reduced the densities of most of the dominant estuarine mesozooplankton taxa in the Mfolozi Estuary, such as estuarine calanoids Pseudodiaptomus stuhlmanni (Poppe & Mrázek, 1895) and Acartiella natalensis (Connell & Grindley, 1974). The Msunduzi Estuary functioned as a reservoir from which recolonisation by estuarine taxa would quickly take place after the Mfolozi was scoured by floodwaters. Densities of dominant meroplankton taxa, such as zoeae of the crab Paratylodiplax blephariskios and Macrobrachium spp., were not noticeably different in the Mfolozi–Msunduzi system between the low- and high-flow periods.",

The ability of seeds to germinate after ingestion by seed-eating fish is important for the population dynamics of some plant species, and significant in the evolution of plant–fish interactions. Certain fish in the Okavango Delta, Botswana, are fruit- and seed-eaters and could act as seed dispersers. We sampled 14 fish species in 2013, finding Nymphaea nouchali var. caerulea seeds in the digestive tracts of eight, most commonly in the striped robber Brycinus lateralis. Seeds extracted from the gut of this species had an overall mean germination success of 11.7%. This fish species might well be a legitimate seed disperser, having a positive effect on seed dispersal from parent plants in the Okavango Delta. The current study represents one of the first investigations of the likelihood of seed dispersal by fish on the African continent.",

    "abstract": "The proposed abstraction of water from the Okavango River in Namibia could potentially result in significant changes in the vegetation of floodplains downstream of the abstraction point. Direct gradient analysis was used to determine the distribution of the most common floodplain plant species in relation to elevation above the water surface and distance from the channel, and therefore to the depth and duration of flooding. Species could be ranked and scored according to their distribution in relation to both elevation and distance from the channel, reflecting a gradient from species intolerant of flooding to those that withstand prolonged flooding. In general, as distance from the channel increased, the elevation at which each of the species occurred decreased, but there was a great deal of variation in the range of elevations over which each species occurred, primarily as a consequence of the irregular topography of these floodplains. Furthermore, several ruderal species were restricted to elevated sites in close proximity to the channel, occurring on recently formed point bars which are the product of fluvial processes. Disturbance in the form of sediment deposition on point bars is thus an important determinant of species distribution on floodplains of the Okavango River. Given these patterns of species distributions it is difficult to predict with accuracy the effect of abstraction on vegetation distribution. A preliminary analysis of possible changes in the hydrological regime after abstraction has also been attempted as part of this study. This was achieved by comparing mean stage heights before and after abstraction assuming a constant rate of abstraction of 3 cumecs, and based on historical daily records from Rundu and Mukwe. Uniform abstraction would have a greater impact at low flows than at medium and high flows. Should abstraction proceed, it would therefore be more appropriate to remove water during periods of high discharge. However, since the Okavango River in Namibia recharges local and possibly regional groundwater, its discharge declines downstream. Rates of water loss from the river thus need to be determined prior to any decision being made about whether or not abstraction should take place, or where to locate the point of abstraction.",

Mean SFI values for male and female shrimp during summer ranged from 0.85% to 2.36% and from 0.56% and 2.61% body dry weight, respectively. During winter, SFI values for males and females were lower, and varied between 0.23% and 1.56% and 0.36% and 1.84% body dry weight, respectively. There were no significant differences in the SFI values between males and females during the two seasons. A peak in the feeding activity for both sexes was observed during the daytime during both summer and winter. For both males and females, non-linear regression analysis best explained the change in SFI over time. The gut evacuation rate constants (k) of males and females during summer were estimated at 0.43 h−1 and 0.30 h−1, respectively. These values correspond to a daily food intake equivalent to 16.2% body dwt for males and 11.1% body dwt for females. During winter, the gut evacuation rates of the shrimp were estimated at 0.35 h−1 for males and 0.28 h−1 for females. The daily ration for adult male and female shrimp during winter was estimated at 6.1% and 6.8% body dwt, respectively. The lower estimates obtained during winter appear largely to reflect the influence of the reduced water temperatures on the metabolic activities of the shrimp.",

We present here the current status of toxicity testing in South Africa and propose a future prognosis for such tests. We propose a path forward for the development of ecotoxicology in South Africa and also globally. Toxicity testing issues dealt with are the use of surrogate species as opposed to indigenous species, their comparative tolerances, and the selection of relevant endpoints as measures of toxicity. Ecotoxicological considerations need to address the following key ecological realities: tolerance (both physiological acclimation and genetic adaptation), trophic redundancies, resilience, compensation (e.g. density dependence), evolution, and recovery. We believe that predictive ecotoxicology will play a major role in the future management of ecosystems that are constantly changing. We also believe that such management must be proactive to the point of intervention to create desired change, specifically the maintenance of ecosystem services.

Apart from its occurrence in the Mngazana estuary, the range of P. blephariskios does not overlap with its congenerics, P. algoensis and P. edwardsii. While P. blephariskios is restricted to subtidal habitats, P. edwardsii and P. algoensis are intertidal. P. blephariskios is likely to compete with P. algoensis, which occurs in muddy substrata at the spring tide low water mark, and the anomuran Upogebia africana, which is abundant in soft substrata in warm-temperate estuaries. Whilst there are no data indicating the occurrence of P. blephariskios in the tropics, the crab should occur in estuaries containing suitably muddy substrata at least as far south as the Swartkops. However, it would appear that insufficient areas of suitably muddy habitat have prevented P. blephariskios from establishing viable populations in estuaries south of the Mngazana.",

    "abstract": "Fourteen mostly small, isolated, and relatively deep coastal inundation lakes were surveyed during the cool season (August) of 1996. No thermal or chemical stratification existed, but near-bottom hypoxia was evident in several systems. Ionic conductivity varied quite widely, but was highest in isolated systems, suggesting evaporative dominance. Low water transparency, attributable to biogenic turbidity, was reflected in high chlorophyll levels (mean = 28.3μg l −1) in most lakes. However, maximal penetration of red light in six lakes implies the influence of mineral turbidity — dystrophy being excluded by the alkaline character (pH > 8) of all 14 lakes. Unusually high standing stocks of zooplankton (mean = 604mg m−2DW), mostly small-bodied freshwater species (rotifers, cyclopoids, cladocerans) as well as larger calanoid and cyclopoid copepods were present, consistent with algal indications of eutrophy. Characteristically relict estuarine/marine fauna (a calanoid copepod, crown crab, amphipod and fish) were present in two oligotrophic lakes, including the largest — putatively a drowned-valley lake. Significant contrasts between these Chidenguele lakes and other southern African coastal lakes are evaluated and discussed. Artisanal fisheries, targetting two indigenous freshwater cichlids and a clariid, as well as an estuarine ambassid and gobiid, were active. Survey findings were used to assess the suitability of these lakes as prospective habitats for exotic grass and silver carp. As these lakes support artisanal fisheries based on indigenous taxa the need for and wisdom of alien introductions is challenged, and we call for parallel summer surveys to precede any such decision. Evidence at hand indicates the potential suitability of more lakes for silver than for grass carp, but four lakes were identified as meriting special conservation status, in view of certain unique attributes and/or values.",

At the two stations, fewer fish were caught each month in the second year than in the same months in the first year. Nets of between 10 and 15mm stretch mesh were the most efficient. Above 15mm, gill-net fishing became less effective. Large fish were often taken with gill-nets of 20–30mm stretch mesh. Beyond these mesh sizes, the gill-net yield and catch decreased.",

Peak settlement occurred in summer (December) and early autumn (February or March), but number of settlers varied between years possibly owing to differences in larval supply and/or environmental factors. During peak settlement, most M. galloprovincialis collected on the pads were primary settlers (<0.5 mm long). Settlement was greatest at the site closest to the entrance of the embayment (Thesen Island Wharf) and lowest at the site farthest away from the entrance of the embayment (Railway Bridge). Variation in settlement among sites and years could be a response to hydrographical conditions and/or environmental conditions and detailed studies on the planktonic phase are now required.",

Macroinvertebrates were sampled using a modified Hess sampler and the Ephemeropterans were later identified and sorted in the laboratory. Thirteen Ephemeroptera genera belonging to six families were obtained. Mean larvae abundance was 1 238 ind. m−2. Acanthiops (70.4%) and Afronurus (13.3%) dominated the community at all sites.

Sources of the PAHs at The Gate and Damija were petrogenic. The consensus-based quality guideline for freshwater sediments using threshold effect concentration and probable effect concentration was the basis employed for evaluating the ecological risks, which were highest at The Gate, because of the presence of fluorene and phenanthrene. Toxicity equivalency (TEQ) at Damija and The Gate did not indicate health risks; however, those at Waterfall were high (1.39 mg kg−1), indicating potential health risks.

The herbicide atrazine, an endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC), frequently contaminates potable water supplies and aquatic ecosystems. Studies suggest atrazine induced alterations in the neuroendocrine system along the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. This study investigated the effects of atrazine (0, 2.5, 25, 250 and 500 μg l−1 for 28 days of exposure) on testosterone (TST) and prolactin (PRL) levels, testes histology and seminiferous tubular morphometry of Clarias gariepinus juveniles. TST and PRL significantly decreased in all the 28 days atrazine exposed groups. Histologically, the testes showed vacuolated and sloughing of basal germinal epithelium in the treated groups. A high correlation between testicular biopsy score counts and results of seminiferous tubular morphometry was also observed. Findings from this study confirm that atrazine is an EDC in fish that alters reproductive dysfunction by targeting the HPG axis, as evidenced by its effects on the investigated reproductive hormones. Furthermore, atrazine disrupted the histoarchitectural components of the testes, which may interfere with spermatogenesis and therefore impair the reproductive functions of the fish.",

Six study wetlands from the GAR catchment were selected in a targeted manner based on the surrounding land use, exposure to anthropogenic disturbances and accessibility to conduct a quantitative study. The relationships between biological and environmental variables were evaluated by using multivariate analyses. Altogether, 36 families of macroinvertebrates were identified. Macroinvertebrate diversity indices were significantly higher at less impaired sites, compared with more impaired sites. Several families of Ephemeroptera, Odonata and Trichoptera taxa, including Corduliidae, Calopterygidae, Baetidae, Aeshnidae, Polymitarcyidae, Hydropsychidae, Heptageniidae, Polycentrapodidae, Hydroptilidae and Philopotamidae were negatively correlated with organic and inorganic pollutants and human disturbances and might be considered as potential indicators of less impaired sites. Conversely, the families Chironomidae, Hirudinidae and Libellulidae were positively correlated with biological oxygen demand, ammonium and human disturbance score and negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen. Generally, results of macroinvertebrate diversity and composition in this study indicate poor ecological condition of the wetlands, particularly those adjacent to agricultural and urban areas.",

Data were collected in 154 plots at five different sites. The prevalence index method was used to categorise the species into wetland and non-wetland indicators. Log series and Hill number models were applied to quantify community assemblages, whereas the CCA technique was used to examine the relationship between anthropogenic activities and species presence or absence. In all, 2 185 individuals, belonging to 32 families and 68 species were recorded. Paspalum orbiculare and Persicaria lanigera were the most abundant, indicating their wide distribution. Mean number of individuals were highest at Atafua and lowest at Owabi. An abundance of terrestrial species (41.2%; i.e. plant species not listed as obligate wetland plants) and facultative species (30.9%), compared with obligate wetland species (27.9%), suggests a dominance of species from dryland habitats into the wetland. Farming activities, increased levels of NH4+, PO43+ and NO3–N, were the predictors that explained 72.01% of the overall variability in community assemblages. The results revealed the impact of the anthropogenic activities on the ecological integrity of the Owabi Ramsar Wetland and the need to institute conservation measures outlined in this study.",

    "abstract": "Wetland vegetation plays an important role in the environmental functioning of wetlands through the provision of ecosystem services, such as food and critical habitat for organisms that live in or near water resources. The ecosystem services provided by wetland vegetation are facing several pressures due to the impacts of drought. Drought can induce significant declines in overall plant productivity and even lead to high rates of plant mortality. Therefore, assessing vegetation response to a drought is important for wetland assessment. In this study, the subtle changes in vegetation distribution were used as a proxy to examine and quantify the extent of drought impacts on the Soetendalsvlei wetland within the Heuningnes Catchment, South Africa. First, the vegetation health information was extracted by calculating the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) during the wet and dry seasons for the period between 2014 and 2018. The derived NDVI results were further statistically linked to the corresponding rainfall and evapotranspiration observed during the study period. An analysis of NDVI results revealed that gradual vegetation health change occurred across the study area. The highest derived NDVI (0.5) for wetland vegetation was observed during 2014, but progressively declined over the years. Change in vegetation health indicated a significant (r = 0.8-0.92) and positive correlation to the amount of rainfall received over the same period, whereas with evapotranspiration the relationships showed an opposite trend (r = −0.7 to −0.5). The results of this study highlight the importance of integrating remotely sensed data and climate variability information in assessing wetland vegetation seasonal and long-term variations. Such information can help in decision-making on the conservation of wetlands and effective monitoring of wetland ecosystems.",

The fishing depth range was 350–750 m, with an average of 455 m. As in other fisheries in the western Mediterranean, the Algerian fishery shows seasonal variation in yields, with maxima during summer and autumn. Its average daily yields have been higher than those of other Mediterranean fisheries, which is attributed to the development of deepwater trawling that enabled the exploitation of stocks that were previously beyond reach. Since 2003 the annual landings have remained stable at around 25 tonnes and the CPUE at around 4 tonnes per boat per annum. It is possible that further exploratory trawling will result in an increase in the size of the fishery. Adaptive and precautionary management of this resource is advocated.",

Its reproductive traits (sex ratio, size at sexual maturity, oocyte diameter and fecundity) were studied at four stations located along the Pendjari River, northern Benin, in April 2013. Histological techniques were implemented to identify sex and gonad development stages. Oocyte sizes were measured based on the histological images and mean oocyte diameter was 38 µm. Fecundity, estimated by counting the developing eggs, averaged 106 724 eggs and increased significantly with shell size. The average sex ratio was approximately 1:1. Hermaphrodites were rare. Males reached sexual maturity at 57.6 mm dorsoventral height, earlier than females at 64.7 mm. The majority of the oyster specimens were in ripe-spawning stages, indicating that reproductive activities partly took place towards the end of the dry season. Both mature and immature individuals were subjected to harvesting at all the investigated fishing sites. The mean size of exploited oysters was 60.6 mm, lower than the size of females at maturity. Management strategies must enforce the minimum size of 65 mm required for harvesting, particularly in open access sites where juveniles are mostly harvested.",

Primary productivity was controlled primarily by soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), ammonia (NH3), temperature and euphotic depth (Zeu). The light-saturated rate of photosynthesis (Amax) varied from 370 to 3 843 mg O2 m−3 h−1 with the maximum value corresponding to the seasonal maximum of phytoplankton biomass. Compared to the period before the diversion of the river, Amax was reduced by more than ninety-fold in early 1990s and by less than five-fold in 2007 and 2008. Similarly, average phytoplankton chlorophyll a was reduced by more than 2.5 × in the early 1990s and to less than 50% in 2007 and 2008. This highlights the importance of the diversion river water on the physico-chemical and biological environment of the lake.",

In this 2010 study, the diets of three coexisting freshwater fishes (Cape galaxias Galaxias zebratus, n = 27; Cape kurper Sandelia capensis, n = 60; Breede River redfin Pseudobarbus burchelli, n = 77) were characterised and compared in three headwater streams in South Africa's Cape Fold Ecoregion using gut contents and stable isotope analyses. These data were analysed to ascertain whether the three species exploit distinct trophic niches. Both approaches provided evidence that these species occupy different trophic niches, though with some overlap. However, dietary differences among sites were not consistent and were probably influenced by site-specific factors like resource availability. Pseudobarbus burchelli had a broader niche breadth at Tierkloof Stream than the other two species, but not at Waaihoek or Tierstel Streams. Our results also suggest that P. burchelli consumed a more omnivorous diet than do the other two species, whereas S. capensis occupied a higher trophic position than the other two species and consumed vertebrates. Our findings suggest that these species occupy non-equivalent feeding niches in Cape Fold Ecoregion headwater streams, and that diet partitioning might facilitate their coexistence in these systems.",

Intraspecific morphological divergence had been demonstrated for many fish groups inhabiting environments with varying abiotic or biotic selective pressures. Such intraspecific phenotypic variation can have a strong influence on the ecologies of species. In the current study, we examined patterns of intraspecific morphological divergence between two populations of Sarotherodon melanotheron and Coptodon guineensis in Lake Ahémé and Porto-Novo lagoon, Benin. Using multiple morphological traits, we demonstrated intraspecific morphological divergence between Lake Ahémé and Porto-Novo lagoon for these species. However, evidence for parallel divergence was found for these two species, implying a similar response to selective pressures might have been acting on labile traits. In addition, species specific morphological changes observed in the current study might be because of differing responses to similar selective forces or taxon-specific selective forces acting on labile traits. The intraspecific trait divergence demonstrated in the current study suggests several possible selective pressures acting on these populations, yet the cause of this divergence remains unknown and additional studies are required to test these inferences.",

The products of 29 loci were analysed, with 17 loci being monomorphic in all populations. The genetic variability estimates compared well with values reported in the literature. The percentage of polymorphic loci (0.95 criterion) ranged from 0–20.69% and average expected heterozygosity from 0.004–0.069. Headstream populations generally revealed lower genetic variability than populations in low lying areas, which emphasizes the importance of conserving headstream populations. Fixed allele mobility differences were observed at the MPI-1 protein coding locus between the Selons River population and the other populations. The measures of genetic differentiation as assessed by F-statistics, the effective number of migrants per generation and Nei's unbiased genetic distance consistently separated the Selons River population from the rest. Nevertheless, these estimates all fell within the range considered for conspecific populations. There was also a clear genetic division between populations from north and south of the Olifants River. The three populations from the Dorps, Spekboom and Blyde Rivers (Limpopo River system) and the population from the Crocodile River (Incomati River system) showed negligible genetic differentiation. Human-assisted transfer of populations may be responsible for this close similarity.",

    "abstract": "The ocypodid crab, Paratylodiplax blephariskios, is endemic to the southeast coast of southern Africa where it forms an important component of the estuarine benthic fauna in muddy substrata. The St. Lucia and Mhlathuze estuaries are two of the largest estuaries in which P. blephariskios occurs, and probably support the largest populations of the crab. While there is relatively little information from the Mhlathuze estuary, the maintenance of an open mouth through dredging at St. Lucia between 1970 and 1992 prevented excessive salinities from occurring in the tidal portion of this system, called the Narrows. However, the mouth was allowed to close in December 1992, after which salinities rose to 51ppt before the mouth was breached in September 1993. This period constitutes the only record of hypersaline conditions in the Narrows and coincides with a marked decline in the P. blephariskios population. Given that there are no published data on the salinity tolerance limits of species in the genus, it was decided to investigate the salinity tolerance of the crab from the St. Lucia and Mhlathuze estuaries. Multiple regression of salinity and temperature on crab counts at St. Lucia showed significant differences between crab abundance and temperature in both hypersaline and fresh conditions, and between crab abundance and salinity in fresh conditions. Ninety-six-hour LC50 testing on adult crabs determined that they could tolerate salinities up to approximately 55ppt. Significant decreases in LC50 values were recorded at temperatures between 30 and 35°C, and between 20 and 17.5°C compared with the control at 25°C. However, the near collapse of the St. Lucia crab population could not be explained simply by their acute upper salinity tolerance limit being exceeded. It was found that the onset of torpor occurred at approximately 5ppt lower than the upper acute limit and it was suggested that cessation of feeding may occur before the onset of torpor. If this was the case, it could reduce the effective lethal concentration as much as 15ppt lower than the acute LC50 and would account for the general decline in the crab population. There was a difference of approximately 5ppt between the salinity tolerance limits of the two populations, with the Mhlathuze population having an upper limit of approximately 60ppt compared with 55ppt in the St. Lucia population. This difference was ascribed to the exposure of the Mhlathuze population to wider salinity fluctuations arising from greater tidal exchange volumes and freshwater input compared with St. Lucia, which has no major rivers entering it.",

There were significant differences (p < 0.05) in toxicities of kerosene and diesel against Poecilia reticulata between both bioassays, by a factor of 7–8. Pila ovata was more susceptible to kerosene and diesel by the same factor as Poecilia reticulata was in the static bioassay.

Fish samples were collected monthly between April 2014 and March 2015, and specimens measured 3.9–13.8 cm SL with a mode in the 7.0–7.9 cm length class. Analysis of the length-frequency data of 861 specimens using the ELEFAN method indicated a growth constant (K) of 0.93 yr−1, and asymptotic length (L∞) of 14.3 cm SL for the population. The short lifespan (tmax = 3.2 years) determined for the species and estimated growth parameters suggest stunting in the population, as in other brackish water populations in Ghana. The total mortality (Z), natural mortality (M), and fishing mortality (F) coefficients: 5.09 yr−1, 2.15 yr–1 and 2.95 yr−1, respectively, indicate fishing as a major contributor to total mortality. The calculated exploitation rate (E = 0.58) of the population suggests overexploitation of the stock, however, the all-year- round recruitment in the population probably ensures production at levels that compensate for its relatively high exploitation rate.",

Habitat occupancy was observed in five pool microhabitats (inflow, woody debris, deep open, fern-root wads, and outflow) using action cameras. Changes in habitat occupancy were assessed following the introduction of an artificial habitat in the form of PVC pipes. Pseudobarbus afer preferred deeper open habitats, whereas Sandelia capensis preferred more structured woody debris habitat. Habitat occupancies differed significantly across all microhabitats for both species; excluding those between the inflow and outflow, and the open deep and fern-root wads for Sandelia capensis. Pseudobarbus afer and S. capensis occupancies in the natural microhabitats reduced significantly following the introduction of the artificial habitat. For species restricted to degraded habitats that require habitat restoration, the use of artificial habitat may be beneficial in accelerating the recovery of such species.",

The study of the gut contents of fish species, as well as the analysis of the stable isotopes of 13C and 15N in the environment, were carried out on samples collected during spring 2010 in two reservoirs: Ghrib and Harreza of the upper Cheliff plain (Algeria) within a semi-arid climate zone. In each of the reservoirs, 13C and 15N were measured in sediments, particulate organic matter (POM), macrophytes, zooplankton, zoobenthos and fish. The isotopic analysis shows that the carbon values that supply both reservoirs, Ghrib and Harreza, were −31.16 ± 0.05 < 13C < −18.01 ± 0.21‰ and −30.82 ± 0.07 < 13C < −17.24 ± 3.50‰, respectively. The carnivorous fish Sander lucioperca, and Abramis brama, an omnivorous fish, were allocated to the top of the food web in Ghrib and Harreza reservoirs, respectively. In the latter, a reservoir with low hydrodynamism and depth, the food web is simpler with a single fish species, which benefits from both benthic and pelagic sources. In Ghrib, a deeper dam with stronger hydrodynamics, only the riverine crab Potamon algeriense exploits the benthic sources, whereas fish mainly feed on zooplankton.",

    "abstract": "Early life stages of fish were monitored in a breach channel during an opening event of the temporarily open/closed East Kleinemonde Estuary. For comparison, early life stages were also collected in the surf zone and estuary mouth region before, during and after the breaching event on a weekly basis. The breach channel was sampled day and night at each midtide state for five consecutive days using a larval fish seine net (mesh 500 µm). Catch per unit effort (CPUE) of mostly postflexion stage larvae increased in the surf zone during opening events with a concomitant peak in abundance in the breach channel. Catch composition included many estuarine associated species typically found in temporarily open/closed estuaries. Predominantly postflexion stage larvae and newly settled juveniles were caught. No overall patterns of diel and tidal use across species were found in the breach channel suggesting some degree of plasticity in recruitment that could be opportunistically driven for most species. However, for the abundant Rhabdosargus holubi (Sparidae), nocturnal flood tides were favoured for movement into the estuary. Natural estuary opening events, especially during peak rainfall in the recruitment season are critical to the early life history strategy of estuary-associated marine fish species.",

Information on the biological diversity of the Nata River is scarce and, to our knowledge, no data is available on its invertebrate fauna. The aim of the study was to provide the first record of the aquatic microinvertebrates of the lower Nata River and examine likely influences of water quality parameters on its species diversity. Physical water quality parameters were measured and zooplankton sampled along the lowermost reaches of the Nata River in August 2012. Salinity, TDS and electrical conductivity ranged widely between sites. Remarkable differences were evident in the zooplankton species composition between the four study sites, evidently related to prevailing levels of salinity.",

The objectives of the paper were to investigate the utility of a delta-normalised difference vegetation index (dNDVI) in evaluating the status, pattern and process of invasion, and to evaluate the implications of the invasion for riverscape morphodynamics and physical habitat structure and function. The spectral classification developed had an overall accuracy of 59.89%, omission error of 28.25%, and commission error of 11.86%. The classification of vegetation was used to quantify the aerial extent and pattern of invasion (currently at least 65.50% of the valley floor vegetation cover). Field observations and existing knowledge of seed dispersal mechanisms and germination constraints of the invasive tree were compared with those of the indigenous sweet thorn Vachellia karroo, to provide insight into invasion patterns and processes within the reach. The linear channel-flanking distribution of the invasion has the potential to alter reach hydrology and morphodynamics, which are key building blocks of physical habitat structure and function. The spectral classification approach demonstrated is relatively simple, has a strong biophysical basis in that it exploits a known, predictable and observable seasonal vegetation response that produces a clear spectral signature, and can be applied to long reaches of rivers impacted by alien vegetation invasions.",

International research suggests that periphyton is particularly responsive to flow and nutrient alterations and therefore ideally suited to aiding the prediction and monitoring of the effects of altered flow regimes. Given that one of South Africa's key focus areas for river management has been the provision of flows to sustain aquatic ecosystems, this study aimed to quantify the relative importance of potential environmental drivers of periphyton, particularly flow, under different nutrient conditions in rivers of the south-western Cape. The study focused on two perennial rivers, the Berg and Molenaars Rivers. Quantitative monthly samples of periphyton biomass were collected from four sites, representative of different flow and nutrient regimes, over a 21-month sampling period between September 2007 and May 2009. The frequency of flood disturbance over the wet season was found to be the single most important driver of periphyton communities. It accounted for almost 75% of the total variation in periphyton biomass under natural flow and nutrient-poor conditions and it was therefore identified as the primary driver of periphyton communities. Its role was smaller under moderately enriched conditions and accounted for 45% of the total variation. These findings suggest that periphyton in south-western Cape rivers has great potential as a tool for predicting and monitoring the effects of altered flow regimes under different nutrient enrichment regimes. Together with some insight into community structure, the next step is to develop periphyton indicators that reflect different aspects of ecosystem integrity, for use in scenario modelling and other management aspects.",

This study assessed the use of oxidative stress biomarkers in Oreochromis mossambicus (Peters, 1852) (Perciformes: Cichlidae) to distinguish between minimally and highly disturbed aquatic environments. A water quality index (WQI) and overall index of pollution (OIP) were used to characterize the target sites, namely the Mananda Dam (control, reference site) and Lower Mguza Dam (disturbed site). Forty male O. mossambicus samples were collected from each dam between April and August 2013. Values for the WQI and OIP indices were significantly higher for the Lower Mguza Dam than for the Mananda Dam (p < 0.05). Oxidative stress biomarker evaluation results showed that the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) as well as the malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration in the liver of O. mossambicus were significantly higher in fish collected from Lower Mguza Dam than those collected from Mananda Dam (p < 0.05). The activities of DT-diaphorase (DTD) and catalase (CAT) were significantly inhibited in fish from the Lower Mguza Dam, when compared to those collected from the Mananda Dam (p < 0.05). From these findings, it is evident that oxidative stress biomarkers, such as antioxidant enzyme activity and MDA accumulation, can be used to differentiate minimally and highly disturbed aquatic environments.",

Florida bass Micropterus floridanus (Lesueur, 1822) were introduced to enhance existing largemouth bass fisheries in 1980. While largemouth bass and Florida bass readily hybridise and produce offspring that are difficult to identify morphologically, confirmation of hybridisation requires genetic analysis. This study sought to understand: (1) the extent to which Florida bass spread within a catchment once introduced; and (2) whether a subset of samples taken from within a catchment accurately characterises hybridisation throughout the catchment. Samples were collected from the Breede River and Kowie River catchments and screened using 38 species-diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms to assess hybridisation. Collections from the mainstem of both rivers represented hybrid swarms, and neither pure largemouth bass nor Florida bass were observed. The absence of genetic differentiation among sampling sites suggests that hybridisation will occur throughout systems where both species are present. Hybridisation levels in dams located off the mainstem rivers were significantly variable and represented potential sources for Florida bass alleles observed within rivers. This finding, in conjunction with our limited knowledge of the distributions of the two species, suggests that applying independent management strategies to control and monitor the spread of both species may prove difficult.",

The research evaluated the molluscicidal effect of P. senegalensis on the freshwater snail Radix natalensis, and its echinostome-shed cercariae. Various compounds from Persicaria senegalensis were extracted and qualitatively analysed. Radix natalensis and the cercariae were exposed to different extract concentrations of P. senegalensis and tested for a period of 24 and 3.5 hours, respectively. Glycosides, saponins, tannins and phenols were found to be present in the leaf, flower and stem extracts. The roots only contained saponins, with traces of tannins and phenols. Terpenoids were absent in the plant. The LC50 values of P. senegalensis extracts against R. natalensis were determined at 18.20 ± 14.78, 30.90 ± 31.25, 42.66 ± 55.67 and 77.62 ± 132.31 for leaves, flowers, stems, and roots respectively.

The mortality rate of tested organisms increased with increased concentrations. It is concluded that extracts of P. senegalensis have molluscicidal and cercaricidal properties; and, therefore, has potential as an alternative biological control agent for freshwater snails, their cercariae and, subsequently, other snail-transmitted parasitic diseases.",

Atherina breviceps, however, displayed multiple modal peaks in its combined population distribution, suggesting a greater influence of mouth condition on its population structure. Retrospective analyses of the various cohorts for A. breviceps identified peaks in recruitment/abundance during summer, coinciding with open-mouth conditions and, to a lesser extent, with overwash events.

Four sites were sampled in 2005 and assessed along the standard sediment quality triad lines of evidence: sediment chemistry, benthic diversity and sediment toxicity, as well as for bioaccumulation, in order to determine if this approach can be used to assess sediment quality in an estuarine environment. Benthic species composition showed a strong relationship with salinity gradient. Toxicity did not exhibit acute effects (>50% mortality) and total metal concentrations in the sediment were below available probable effects levels. Changes in the benthic community could not be directly correlated with contaminant levels due to the naturally stressed benthic environment which exists in estuaries. The study showed that, when applying the weight of evidence approach in an estuary, it is necessary to include bioaccumulation data with benthic community structure results. Without this integration, there is increased uncertainty when determining the potential for effects using the metal concentrations. The inclusion of the bioaccumulation data ensures that the information gathered during sediment quality assessments is interpreted correctly, by taking potential and current ecological effects into account.Keywords: benthosbioaccumulationinvertebratessediment quality triadsediment toxicity",

Therefore, clove oil was an effective anaesthetic and sedative for the handling of Nile perch within a mass range of 0.4–12 kg fish−1.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe shore of Lake St Lucia in the vicinity of Catalina Bay, in the southern part of the lake, receives freshwater input as surface and groundwater seepage from the adjacent elevated coastal plain. Vegetation, water quality and landform were recorded on the lakeshore and on the dry lakebed near one of these seepage zones. This was done along a gradient perpendicular to the lakeshore and along the lakeshore away from the fluvial source of freshwater input. A number of plant communities were found along a gradient of water salinity from the shoreline (fresh water) towards the centre of the lake, and also away from the fluvial input of water (increasingly saline). Species richness decreased with increasing salinity. The first study was conducted in 2006 after a prolonged drought associated with low lake levels and closure of the mouth, and repeated again in 2010 three years after breaching of the estuarine mouth by a tropical cyclone at sea, which caused inundation of the partly dry lakebed with sea water. The vegetation of the lakeshore after these major disturbances was remarkably similar in the two time periods, suggesting rapid recovery near freshwater seepage zones, following an influx of sea water.Keywords: disturbanceenvironmental gradientsestuarine lakehydrogeochemistryvegetation dynamics",

An in vitro cytotoxicity test using a mammalian cell line was employed to determine the toxicity of multiple pollutants in the water and Tilapia zillii fish sampled from the lake. The concentrations of seven polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and ten polychlorinated dibenzofurans were investigated in water and muscle of the fish in 2014. Cytotoxicity testing showed that the percentage inhibition of cell viability in the studied sites ranged between 56.16% and 83.22%. Dioxin analysis indicated that the average concentrations of 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9-octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, 1,2,3,4,7,8-hexachlorodibenzofuran, 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptachlorodibenzofuran and 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9-octachlorodibenzofuran were higher than the toxic equivalence quotients (TEQs) set by the World Health Organization (WHO) in all water and fish muscle samples; however, the average concentration of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran was higher only in fish muscle samples. The bioaccumulation factor (BAF) ranged dramatically between 2 and 58.5 for the detected dioxins. Adverse human health effects through the consumption of fish are not expected, because dioxin levels in fish muscle are deemed safe for human consumption. Implementation of a strategic multidisciplinary action plan is strongly recommended to sustain this delta wetland ecosystem.",

Duckweed (Lemnaceae) is a ubiquitous family of floating macrophytes. A total of 41 macroinvertebrate families were collected monthly over a six-month period from February to July 2014. Duckweed biomass in both rivers was highly variable both temporally and spatially. The majority of identified macroinvertebrate taxa were predators and detritivores, with a small percentage of herbivores. An average of approximately 26% of the macroinvertebrate taxa found were from families that include species from more than one functional feeding group. Although overall measures of diversity and ecosystem health (Fisher's α and Simpson's index) remained constant over time in the New Years River, significant differences in macroinvertebrate community structure were seen between sites and months on both rivers, with dissimilarity being driven by a larger number of species in the New Years River. This high variability within macroinvertebrate assemblages probably reflects a combination of heterogeneous duckweed distribution, variation in physico-chemistry, opportunistic behaviours of macroinvertebrate predators and/or successional colonisation of duckweed mats.",

The data was used to assess the health of the system for supporting local communities. Compared to national and international standards, the stream was found to be acidic, but pH levels (5.87 ± 0.40) were similar to other systems in the New Calabar River catchment. Analysis of variance showed that there was no significant variation (p < 0.05) in water quality between the stations, with the exception of PO4 (0.82 ± 0.40 mg l-1), which was significantly higher than other local systems. A total of 26 species of plankton were recorded during the study. These species belonged to the Bacillariophyceae (n = 10), Chlorophyceae (n = 6), Cyanophyceae (n = 5), Euglenoidea (n = 3), and Chrysophyceae (n = 2), but phytoplankton density was low. The most frequently occurring phytoplankton species were indicators of organic pollution, such as Cyclotella comta, while Melosira varians was recorded at all sampling occasions. Relatively high diversity indices indicated a stable environment. We conclude that the Okamini Stream is not yet degraded, but that the water quality should be monitored, and anthropogenic activities managed to avoid potential future deterioration.",

Fish samples were identified morphologically as Nile perch Lates niloticus, Nile labeo Labeo vulgaris, North African catfish Clarias gariepinus, Cornish jack Mormyrops anguilloides and bebe mormyrid Hyperopisus bebe. Following DNA extraction, universal primers were used for amplification of the CO1 barcode region. The PCR products were sequenced and used for molecular identification. Each sequence was matched to corresponding GenBank sequences using the BLAST technique. Sequences of all specimens were aligned along with the GenBank published sequences and polymorphic sites were identified. The analysed sequences were uploaded to GenBank under the accession numbers OL804282– OL804286. The analysed partial CO1 barcode gene showed a readable length of ∼548–669 base pairs. Sequence comparison of CO1 gene sequences with sequences published in GenBank revealed 99.27–100% identities at the species level. Therefore, the CO1 barcodes accurately identified all the studied freshwater fishes. This is the first molecular DNA barcode characterisation of freshwater fish species found in Sudan. The fish CO1 gene sequences revealed in this study will serve as barcode references for future characterisations of Nile River fishes.",

This work was carried out to assess the effect of temperature on embryonic development and offspring quality of this species. In the phase one experiment, females at stage V of gonadal development incubated their eggs at three experimental temperatures and their embryonic development was evaluated. Seven embryonic developmental stages were observed: fertilisation, mitosis, morula, blastula, gastrula, nauplius and larvae. The incubation periods were 19, 14 and 13 days at 26 °C, 28 °C and 30 °C, respectively. A temperature of 30 °C resulted in higher broodstock mortality (33.33%). In phase two, larvae were reared at the respective temperatures for 30 days at a stocking density of 30 larvae per litre of water. Offspring quality was significantly different between treatments from day five onwards, with the fastest development at 30 °C followed by 28 °C. However, larval survival rate was significantly higher at 26 °C (31.7%) followed by 28 °C (27.6%). A temperature of 28 °C could therefore be recommended as the most favourable for embryonic development and larviculture of M. vollenhovenii. These findings will help bridge the knowledge gap with respect to captive breeding and hatchery technology for M. vollenhovenii.Keywords: embryonic developmentincubation temperaturelarval developmentMacrobrachium vollenhoveniisurvival",

The aim of this study was to assess the surface water and surrounding soil of the Anwai River for the effects of abattoir activities during the wet and dry seasons of 2020. The quality of soil and water samples was analysed using standard procedures as set by the American Public Health Association. Results of water analyses showed that pH, total dissolved solids and total suspended solids varied from 6.45 to 6.67, 13.50 mg L−1 to 24.42 mg L−1, and 2.19 ± 0.04 mg L−1 to 10.79 mg L−1, respectively. Soil pH, total organic content, Pd and Cr had a range of 5.83 to 7.65 pH units, 0.15 to 2.74%, 1.88 ± 0.03 to 22.8 ± 0.28 mg kg−1, and 0.86 ± 0.03 to 4.87 ± 0.04 mg kg−1, respectively. There were significant differences between Upstream, Midstream (by the abattoir) and Downstream samples; however, there were no significant differences between dry and wet season results for most of the parameters. Midstream values for the water quality index were 104.89 and 119.34 in the dry and wet seasons, respectively, which showed that the Midstream water samples were poor. The findings of this study showed that the abattoir activities were negatively impacting river water and soil quality.Keywords: animal slaughterhousessoil qualitywaste waterwater qualitywater quality index",

None was possible without the involvement of enthusiastic investigators who, over some 70 years, stimulated the growth of freshwater research in these arid lands. The contributions to the nascent limnology of the subcontinent are described, beginning first with river studies from which arose a hydrobiological template. This was widely used and modified as understanding increased. Subsequently, wetlands, as well as man-made and natural lake systems, were added. Together, each of the components of this endeavour contributed to the structure of the new National Water Act, in which the intrinsic requirements of the aquatic ecosystem are stressed. This stimulated the development of management protocols for the assessment of river flows and lake levels in order to sustain the vital ecological processes within the respective ecosystems. In doing so, the old paradigm of 'Nature in Balance' was replaced by the acceptance of not one natural state, but a series of dynamic states, particularly so in rivers.",

The sublethal concentrations were determined from the LC50 value of manganese (1.723mg/l), which included a 10% (172.3mg/l), 15% (259.8mg/l) and 20% (345.6mg/l) concentration of the LC50 value. Haematological and osmoregulation variables were investigated after acute sublethal manganese exposure and the differences in the values of haematological and osmoregulation values of exposed fish were compared statistically against control values to determine significant differences. After the exposures it was evident that sublethal manganese concentrations had a disruptive influence on the different variables measured. Most of the haematological variables (white blood cells, red blood cells, haemoglobin content and haematocrit percentages) except the mean corpuscle volume decreased significantly after the 20% sublethal exposure. The osmoregulation variables also fluctuated but started to do so at lower sublethal concentration exposures (10% and 15%). Information concerning the sublethal effects of pollutants, such as metals, forms an integral part of ecosystem health assessment programmes and of procedures followed to develop water quality guidelines for environmetal protection. The data from this study were incorporated into a water quality index (RAUWaterz) compiled for the Olifants River, Mpumalanga. This can aid water quality managers, engineers and consultants in assessing the impact of pollutants on the aquatic environment.",

The arrangements at the Tunweni Sorghum Brewery, Tsumeb, Namibia are such that wastewater is utilised in the polyculture of locally available riverine fish species in large (3 000m2; 120m long × 25m wide), deep (3m) earthen ponds. Before reaching the fishponds the wastewater passes through a series of bio-system processes such as mushroom and earthworm beds, a pig sty, anaerobic and aerobic digesters and algae ponds. A pH of about 8.0 is desirable for maximum fish production in the large (9 000m3) fishponds. The old Chinese technique is followed whereby wastewater is utilised for growing fish without adding any feed supplement; various plankton and invertebrates produced naturally serve as feeds for various kinds of fish feeding at different trophic levels. A variety of locally-available riverine fish species, of different trophic levels, are useful for sustainable stocking in the ponds where no feed-supplement is necessary. Various plankton and invertebrates are produced naturally as feeds for the various kinds of fish feeding at different trophic levels, obviating the purchase of costly artificial feeds which can make fish culture uneconomical. Fish wastes are naturally mineralised into nutrients in the ponds and the nutrient-rich water supports phytoplankton, zooplankton and invertebrates, all of which comprise a varied food chain supporting the fish growth.",

Species numbers in Lakes Mzingazi and Cubhu are similar historically and both lakes served as secondary nursery habitats for estuarine associated fishes. This role has been impacted by the construction of weirs at their outlets which prevent successful recruitment of estuarine species, especially during drought years when lake water levels are low. The fish faunas of Lakes Nsezi and Mangeza are depauperate and lack marine or estuarine components. In order that these systems fulfil their potential function as secondary nursery habitats to many estuarine fish species, minimum lake water levels must be set to ensure sufficient outflows at proposed fish ladders during critical spawning and migration times.",

The translocated population was derived from individuals from the upper Blyde River. We used starch gel-electrophoresis to compare the genetic structure of these two populations. Polymorphism was detected at 34% of the loci and the average heterozygosities were 0.048 for the translocated population and 0.062 for the founder population. Deviations of observed genotype frequencies from expected proportions occurred at seven loci and were the result of a deficit of heterozygotes in all instances. Estimates of population differentiation and gene flow between populations suggest that the two populations are experiencing genetic drift. This is reflected by a number of possibly unique alleles in each population, as well as alteration of common alleles at the EST-1 locus. The results indicate that the translocation affected the genetic structure of the translocated population and we recommend continued genetic monitoring of the populations as part of an effective conservation management plan.",

We conducted a study in 2001 to test whether this could be linked to copper (Cu) and cobalt (Co) loading of Lake George, resulting from previous mining activities just north of the lake. Snail and/or sediment samples collected along a transect from north of the mining site, through the runoff area from the stockpiles, Lake George, the Kazinga Channel to the northern part of Lake Edward were examined for Cu and Co content. Copper concentrations in sediment samples ranged from 3 to 855 ppm and Co from 6 to 481 ppm, being highest in the area closest to the mining activities and where the Nyamwamba River enters Lake George. About 54% of the total Cu was extractable in 20 mM EDTA, suggesting a large pool of bioavailable copper. The snail fauna was more diverse than expected, totalling 10 species, and was associated primarily with shore sampling sites, where sediment was firmer than in deeper water. Except for two species in one location, no snails were found where sediment levels of Cu were above 23 ppm and Co levels above 21 ppm, suggesting the existence of a threshold level limiting gastropod occurrence. Although the occurrence of snails was negatively related to Co level, there was no correlation between concentrations of Cu and Co in snail tissue and those in the sediment.",

Caenis has a univoltine life cycle, whilst Cloeon, Coenagrionidae, Chironominae and Orthocladiinae have multivoltine life cycles. Growth and reproduction of Micronecta occurred all year round. The Coenagrionidae had the highest mean biomass, which was significantly greater than those of the other taxa. Caenis and Orthocladiinae were sensitive to variations in water temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, their highest biomasses occurring when temperatures were low and DO concentrations high. The biomasses of Chironominae and Orthocladiinae increased with rising water levels, but that of Caenis decreased. Total insect biomass was minimally affected by variations in water physico-chemical variables. The study suggests that water temperature, water level and DO concentration do have an effect on the biomasses of some insect taxa associated with Lagarosiphon in Lake Kariba. Mixing processes during de-stratification also affect the abundance and biomass of the insect taxa. Keywords: aquatic plantsepiphytic invertebratesmultivoltinetemporal variation",

Counts of both faecal coliforms and V. cholerae were higher at night than by day. The reduction in the counts of faecal coliform bacteria in three microcosms showed that reduction of faecal coliforms was not only due to the effect of UV, but was a combined effect of both UV and predation.

The total biomass followed a similar trend, reaching 2 000kg (43kg ha–1) in July and falling to 130kg (2.8kg ha–1) after one year. The mortality rate was very high (Z = 5.00) and considerably higher than in a number of other fishes, many of them considerably smaller than B. mattozi. The reasons for this decline are discussed and they include the effects of humans who removed about 17.5% of the total population, cannibalism, otters and birds. A remarkable feature of the population was the lack of small fish (<12cm FL), which was attributed to a failure of spawning during a serious drought in 1972–1973. The numbers of small fish began to increase from June 1975 and these were most likely the cohort spawned during the good rains of 1973–1974. Fluvial fishes in semi-arid parts of southern Africa are likely to experience wide variations in numbers determined by the success or failure of spawning in wet or dry years.",

In December 1974, the Mtsheleli River flooded after heavy rain and the entire adult population of B. mattozi migrated upstream to spawn during a 24h period. Spawning took place in the late morning and early afternoon with 73% of females having spent gonads by the evening. No further spawning occurred, even though the river flooded periodically over the next few months. The sex ratio of fish captured during the December spawning run was 62 males:38 females, although almost all large fish (>15cm FL) were females. Both sexes reached sexual maturity at about 13cm FL and females carried about 7 000–120 000 eggs in their ovaries (logn = −3.13 + 3.49logFL, r = 0.94, P < 0.01), depending on length. The December spawning apparently failed, as no juveniles were collected in 1975, possibly because larvae were swept into the impoundment, where they could not survive. It followed an earlier failure during the 1972–1973 drought, when the river failed to flow, and highlights the risks faced by potamodromous fish in semiarid environments.",

Environmentally-simulated short-term toxicity bioassay used open iron cages and closed plastic basins containing weevils and salvinia placed in riverine water bodies, where they were exposed to the aerial applications of deltamethrin over the Kwando–Linyanti system in 2006. Control samples were placed 40 km outside the sprayed area. Weevil mortality, determined at 12, 36 and 60 hours after the aerial application, reached a maximum of 27%. No significant difference in mortalities was observed between the closed basins and the open cages. The amount of deltamethrin deposited at ground level was between 1.2 and 6.4 μg m−2 and the insecticide toxicity was related to the weevil mortality. Simultaneous field monitoring through five spray applications showed that weevil abundance declined in late winter. Deltamethrin had a negligible impact on the weevil's ability to control salvinia under field conditions, probably due to the weevils’ protective mechanism and because vegetation could act as a barrier, preventing the insecticide from reaching the weevils. Minimum impacts of deltamethrin on the weevils in the present study and their recovery in the field are consistent with those of earlier spray applications in the Okavango Delta, Botswana.

Average heart rate increased from 100 to nearly 400 pulses per minute after five minutes of exercise on a treadmill at a run rate of 0.133 m s−1. It took less than a minute for oxygen taken up through the lung epithelium from the air inside the branchial cavity to reach the maximal oxygen consumption rate of 26.1 mmol O2 kg−1 h−1. Resting MO2 was 4.06 mmol O2 kg−1 h−1 in air, but decreased to 3.37 mmol O2 kg−1 h−1 in seawater. Radioactive CO2 from injected l-lactate is released linearly by the lung. The percent accumulated 14-CO2 in exhaled air, plotted against time, intersects zero time on the x -axis, indicating rapid gas exchange at the lung surface. The P 50 values for native haemocyanin of 4.89 mm Hg before exercise, and 8.99 mm Hg after exercise, are typical of a high-affinity haemocyanin usually associated with terrestrial crabs. The current notion that Ocypode ceratophthalmus drown when submerged in seawater was not substantiated by our experiments. MO2 in seawater increased from 3.37 mmol O2 kg−1 h−1 for resting crabs to 5.72 mmol O2 kg−1 h−1 during exercise. When submerged by wave-seawater in the natural environment and during exercise in respirometer-seawater O. ceratophthalmus do not swim but, having a specific density of 1.044, float nearly weightless with a minimum of body movements.",

The pulmonate snail species had the highest densities at depths ranging between 20 and 80 cm. After an irrigation period of 10 to 12 hours B. truncatus, A. fluviatilis and L. peregra were relatively more abundant at the bottom of the siphon boxes than in the upper sections. Aggregation at the corners of the boxes could be among the factors that enable snail species to avoid the detrimental effect of turbulent water flow during irrigation. The relevance of changes in density and micro-distribution following an irrigation cycle in the control of B. truncatus is discussed.",

    "abstract": "A pilot investigation was conducted in 2014 in the Sanyati Basin of Lake Kariba to ascertain whether long-term DDT spraying in the Kariba catchment had a negative effect on fish health. The aim was to assess the health of tigerfish, Hydrocynus vittatus, by means of histological analysis and to analyse water, sediment and tissue samples for bioaccumulated levels of chlorinated pesticides, including DDT. Eighteen tigerfish were collected by seine netting along the north-eastern shoreline of the Sanyati Basin in April 2014 and samples of their gill, liver, kidney, muscle and brain tissue were processed for histology and assessed using light microscopy. No detectable levels of DDT and/or its metabolites were found in the water or sediment samples and only a low concentration of p,p′-DDE in fish tissues. No major histological alterations were observed in the fish tissues. Consequently, there seems to be no risk of DDT exposure following the consumption of tigerfish from the Sanyati Basin of Lake Kariba. These results were unexpected, given the historical use of DDT within the current study area. It is recommended that these findings be compared with those from other regions of Lake Kariba.",

Eleven of the loci studied were polymorphic. Analysis showed that populations clustered according to their geographical origin: eastern populations close to the root represented by a population of a closely related species (C. auratus); then populations from the centre of the species' range, followed by the more western populations. Networks observed, regression of genetic distances versus geographical distances, results of the Mantel test as well as the apomorphic status of two alleles suggested that the genetic differentiation corresponds to an isolation by distance model. These results strongly suggest that the populations initially occurred in the lagoons and rivers of Ivory Coast and from here spread to the western part of the species' range by progressively colonising basins from east to west.",

There was close agreement between growth estimates made from scale rings and those from following the growth of a known-age cohort. Fish in the known-age cohort grew to 12cm (males) and 13cm fork length (females) in two years and eight months while back-calculations from scale rings suggest that after eight years males grew to 27cm and 290g and females to 33cm and 520g. These growth rates were relatively slow and may reflect a shortage of food or poor adaptation to the reservoir ecosystem. Condition varied seasonally, the decline from October to February coinciding with the rainy season when spawning takes place.",

Different biotopes, i.e. stones, gravel sand and mud, and vegetation were sampled after the March-April heavy rain in 2018. Ephemeroptera, Odonatan, and Hemipteran have shown similar trends across weeks at all sites. Plecoptera and Coleoptera started recovering at week four However, the total abundance and taxa richness had significantly recovered during the fourth week at site 2 and 3, and fifth week at site 1. Communities have shown no significant difference for each site from weeks six to eight (ANOVA, p > 0.5), which implies that climax on macroinvertebrate communities was reached at week six. Hydrologic regime change has not influenced water quality parameters across all weeks (ANOVA, p > 0.5) and this was also reflected on the average score per taxon (ASPT), which has shown no significant difference (ANOVA, p > 0.5) across weeks at all sites. These findings provide a baseline for future studies on flood effect on urban streams and supplement the understanding of the effects of sudden hydrologic regime changes on macroinvertebrate communities.",

Monitoring sites were established in varying land use types in three subcatchments of the upper uMngeni Catchment to assess water quality and ecosystem health impacts of current land uses. Conclusions about water quality were drawn using pairing of SASS5 and spot water quality data. Water quality and ecological condition were highest in commercial plantations and upstream of a high-density settlement where natural land cover and sparse settlement occurred. Although marked declines in water quality and ecological condition were observed under commercial agriculture. The most notable declines in water quality and ecological condition were observed downstream of the settlement with elevated nutrient loads. Shifts in aquatic biota were highly correlated with seasonal shifts in water quality, influenced markedly by land use. The cumulative effects of current land use activities, urban development and agriculture on Midmar Dam's water quality should be viewed with concern. Additional development in the form of additional social housing projects may exacerbate impacts.",

Shell area preferences of the sabellid were also investigated. Abalone diet (fresh kelp, Ecklonia maxima or Abfeed™) did not affect sabellid settlement success (F1,30 = 1.05; p <= 0.31). There were significant differences in settlement between shell regions, with the highest number of sabellids settling near the respiratory pores (F2,30 = 61.0; p < 0.001). Percentage occupation rate of tubes 96h after settlement did not differ between dietary treatments. There were no significant interactions between diet and shell region for sabellid settlement (F2,30 = 0.77, p = 0.69) and tube formation (F2,30 = 1.02, p = 0.67) or for the percentage occupation rate of the tubes (F9,180 = 0.11, p = 0.73). Thus, infestation intensity in relation to shell region can be estimated independent of abalone diet. For treatment purposes, total settlement after 36 days of exposure can be used to identify the shell areas on which most sabellids will be found.",

The effect of temperature on sexual reproduction and seed production of Glyceria maxima (Hartm.) Holmb. in the southern hemisphere is unknown.

Laboratory experiments showed that vernalisation had no consistent effect on seed production. Field- and laboratory-grown plants produced seeds in the 2010/2011 season, because of having sufficient time at optimum temperatures required for seed production (1 491 and 1 585 hours, respectively), compared to a shorter period (1 352 hours) of suitable temperatures during the 2009/2010 growing season. An inadequate period of optimum temperatures (15–25°C) during seed production resulted in the lack of seeds in the field in the 2009/2010 growing season. This study showed that temperature and duration of exposure thereto during the seed-production period play vital roles in G. maxima sexual reproduction.",

Adult females (n = 101, body weight of 3 183 ± 14.75 g, SE) were captured monthly over one year (2013–2014). Apart from evaluation of oocyte diameters and gonad developmental stages, gonado-, hepato-, lipososomatic indices (GSI, HSI, LSI) and plasma levels of sex steroids (testosterone-T, estradiol-17β-E2) were determined. The results suggested a synchronous development of oocytes with two annual reproductive seasons over the one-year study. Plasma T and E2 levels peaked during spawning periods likely reflecting active oogenesis. The highest values of morphosomatic indices were observed during the longest rainfall period in September, and were associated with high steroidogenic activity evidenced by increased E2 production. In addition, more vitellogenic oocytes (September and October) were observed during the latter season than during the short rainy season (in May).",

Fish were collected at the Nwanedi-Luphephe dams, Limpopo River System, South Africa using gill, cast and seine nets and electrofishing gear. Enteromius radiatus and E. trimaculatus were the most infested compared with L. marequensis. Seasonal changes had an influence on the intensity of A. polycotyleus, with infestation rates higher in spring, summer and autumn. The adults predominantly infected the medial region of the second gill arch, whereas diporpae were mainly found on the first gill. Neither sex nor water quality changes had an influence on the intensity of the parasite. The health condition of the hosts was not affected by the parasite. The different infestation rates of the parasite between the species could be attributed to host characteristics, behaviour and habitat preferences. The selection of a particular gill/region could be attributed to space for attachment organs and food supply, as well as flow and velocity of the water over the gills. The occurrence of A. polycotyleus on E. radiatus constitutes a new host record.",

The spermatozoon had a round head-shape, medio-laterally flat, no acrosome, a short midpiece located laterally to the nucleus, uniflagella with one wing. The head of the spermatozoon contained the nucleus, centriolar system, proximal part of the flagellum, and cytoplasmic channel. Centrioles were arranged at an angle of 90° to each other, forming a T-shape, parallel to the nucleus. The midpiece was cylindrical, loaded with cytoplasm, five to seven spherical mitochondria; and the flagellum’s plasma membrane extended to form one lateral wing. The spermatozoa were classified as type II spermatozoa. L. niloticus spermatozoon differed from that of its Australian congener L. calcarifer, especially in the centriole arrangement and nuclear shape, length of the midpiece and the number of mitochondria and lateral wings.",

A study of biodiversity and successional sequences was carried out monthly from November 2012 to April 2014 to determine the environmental factors controlling phytoplankton assemblages in Epe Lagoon, Lagos, Nigeria. Surface water and phytoplankton samples were collected from 12 stations within the lagoon. Physico-chemical analyses and phytoplankton biodiversity were carried out using American Public Health Association (APHA) protocols and light microscopy, respectively. A canonical correspondence analysis and the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) were used to determine the relationship between physico-chemical parameters and different phytoplankton divisions identified within the lagoon. Five phytoplankton divisions (Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta, Cyanobacteria, Euglenophyta and Pyrrophyta) were represented within the lagoon. Higher phytoplankton biomass was recorded in the dry season (November to April) than in the wet season (May to October). Centric diatoms (Aulacoseira granulata var. angustissima O. Mull and Melosira granulata (Ehr.) Ralfs) dominated the phytoplankton spectrum throughout the study period, except in June and July 2013, when Mougeotia sp. was dominant. Rainfall distribution patterns primarily determined the physico-chemical environment, whereas salinity, calcium ions, hydrocarbons (oil and grease), conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), turbidity and silicate were the major factors controlling phytoplankton dynamics during the study period.",

The two species reproduced during the same period (spring and summer) with peak reproduction occurring in January. P. knysnaensis egg production was higher than C. gilchristi and was not affected by fish size. Although C. gilchristi egg production increased with fish size, this was not significant. P. knysnaensis reached LM50 at smaller sizes than C. gilchristi. Reproductive periods were likely coupled with prey availability, as phytoplankton and zooplankton abundances are highest in warm-temperate estuaries during this period. The ability of these gobies to reproduce at small sizes (< 40 mm TL), which is an adaptive trait of many r-selected species, underpins their high abundance in South African estuaries as they are well adapted to stochastic environments.Keywords: fecunditygobylength at maturityspawning",

With the exception of sporadic overtopping events and periodic marine connectivity via the uMfolozi River, the St Lucia Estuary remained closed off from the Indian Ocean since 2007. Due to the build-up of sediment and prolonged mouth closure, the beach berm was artificially breached in January 2021, fully reconnecting St Lucia to the Indian Ocean for the first time in 13 years. This study aimed to determine the effect of this breaching event on St Lucia's zooplankton community by analysing samples from March, May and August 2021, at five representative sites throughout the lake system. The mouth remained open for only five months, and the system was still largely oligo- to meso-haline due to high freshwater input. The patterns in the zooplankton were related more to the prevailing environmental conditions than to the breaching event itself. The composition of zooplankton in the system did change; however, the presence of marine taxa was not far-reaching nor long-lasting, most likely due to the limited tidal intrusion, strong outflow and predominant salinity regime.Keywords: Estuarine lakeiSimangaliso Wetland Parkmarine connectivityzooplankton dynamics",

Several subpopulations of the seasonal cyprinodont fish genus Nothobranchius with lesions suggestive of infection with Aphanomyces invadans, were observed in ephemeral wetland habitats of the upper Congo drainage in the south-eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Molecular analyses on samples collected in 2023 revealed evidence of fish-pathogenic oomycetes Aphanomyces invadans and A. laevis, for the first time in the host of fish genus Nothobranchius spp. All Nothobranchius fishes in the upper Congo drainage are subject to a high level of threat and belong to one of the threatened Red List categories, due to habitat degradation of seasonal wetlands. These fishes complete their seasonal life cycle in ephemeral natural habitats. The latter makes them highly vulnerable, as such wetland habitats are often degraded by the cumulative effect of multiple human stressors which include: the cultivation of wetlands for agriculture, the abstraction of water, the expansion of urban areas and the pollution load. Evidence of infection by oomycete pathogens documented in this study, represents a critical additional threat to the unique seasonal aquatic biodiversity of the region.Keywords: barcodingbiodiversity threatCongo drainageepizootic ulcerative syndromephylogeny",

Cyclone Idai, which ravaged through Zimbabwe in 2019, had devastating consequences on aquatic ecosystems. However, the extent of habitat modification and consequent biodiversity shifts are unknown. This study focuses on the comparative analysis of (i) habitat structure and (ii) macroinvertebrate assemblages in headwater streams of the Odzi sub-catchment, Chimanimani District, Zimbabwe, specifically examining the conditions post-Cyclone Idai-induced flooding. Field sampling was conducted in the dry season (September−November) 2019 and wet season (January−March) 2020. Headwater streams of the Murare (first order), Umvumvumvu (first and second order) and Nyanyadzi (first and second order) rivers were sampled. Habitat assessment was done following the Benthic Macroinvertebrate Monitoring Protocol Implementation Plan. Selected water variables were measured using appropriate probes. Macroinvertebrate assemblage data were collected using the South African Scoring System (SASS 5) protocol. Spatiotemporal variations in water quality, habitat structure and macroinvertebrate metrics were assessed using two-way ANOVA, ANOSIM and SIMPER. Significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity (p < 0.05) was detected in temperature, turbidity, conductivity and total dissolved solids, velocity and depth regimes, channel flow status, sediment deposition, channel alteration and frequency of riffles for the three rivers. Habitat quality ascending hierarchical order was: Umvumvumvu > Murare > Nyanyadzi after Cyclone Idai induced flooding. The highest macroinvertebrate composition diversity was detected in Murare River, the least flood-affected stream. The largest dissimilarity (ANOSIM, 75.3%) was between the Umvumvumvu and Nyanyadzi rivers. Macroinvertebrate community structure differed significantly because of species uniqueness and heterogenous tolerance to changes in environmental conditions after flooding. Flooding intensity and duration induces dissimilar environmental tolerances and persistent macroinvertebrates communities in lotic systems across local catchment scales. Long-term assessment of water quality impairment, resilient functional feeder groups and rifflescale physical habitat structure are imperative for optimised micro-scale conservation of macroinvertebrates in headwater streams prone to flash flooding.Keywords: ecological resilienceheadwater streamsrifflessediment flushingstream foodwebs",

This study examined the growth trends of C. carpio using otolith growth zone deposition rates which were validated using a chemical mark–recapture experiment (n = 16). From a total of 140 C. carpio, length-at-age was best described using the Von Bertalanffy growth model for males and females. The average lengths-at-50% maturity were estimated at 314 mm FL (males) and 262 mm FL (females). Compared with other South African C. carpio populations, the Groenvlei population is relatively fast growing and long lived, with the oldest female aged 20 years and the oldest male aged 18 years, likely facilitated by relatively favourable environmental conditions at Groenvlei. Data from this study provide a baseline at the commencement of C. carpio management interventions at Groenvlei and an opportunity to monitor changes in population dynamics facilitated by these efforts.Keywords: agegrowthnon-nativeotolithreproductionvalidation",

The purpose of this study was to determine the greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in water from selected wetlands in the Cross River estuary. Water samples were collected from the Ikang, Anantigha and Adiabo wetlands and the major GHGs were analysed using a gas chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer. The mean concentration levels of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and sulphur oxide (SO2) were measured in the water samples for both seasons. There was a significant difference in concentrations of all the greenhouse gases in the water samples for both seasons. The exceptions were: SO2 in Adiabo, CO2 in Anantigha and N2O in Ikang, which showed insignificant differences for both seasons. The water CO2 concentrations from the Adiabo wetland recorded the largest contribution of greenhouse gas levels, ranging between 6.88 ± 2.22 ppm and 11.02 ± 2.52 ppm. These levels were in the range of those reported in the Congo basin. The variation in concentrations could be due to location, hydrological characteristics, nutrient load injection or the nitrification and denitrification processes of wetlands.Keywords: climate changeGC-MSgreenhouse gasesNiger-Deltaseasonal variations",

It enhances detection capabilities across a broader variety of stressors and offers a more complete picture of ecological conditions than single metrics or biological indicators. In this context, a diatom-based multimetric index (MMI-D) has been developed to evaluate the ecological health of Lake Hawassa. Physicochemical and benthic diatom sampling was conducted at nine sites along the lakeshore, representing varying levels of human disturbance, from February to November in2015 and 2016. The sampling sites were classified a priori into three categories: minimally disturbed (three sites), moderately disturbed (three sites) and highly disturbed (three sites). This classification, was based on a clustering analysis using the percent disturbance score (PDS). Of the 24-diatom candidate metrics, only ten were chosen as core metrics for the development of MMI-D, based on redundancy analysis, reaction to environmental conditions, percent discriminatory efficiency (%DE) and box plots. The newly established MMI-D clearly distinguished between reference and non-reference sites, and between the lake's three clusters. The MMI-D's performance was validated using independent data sets from lakes Hawassa and Ziway and it demonstrated the best capability for discrimination between different disturbance levels. MMI-D 2-stage Least Squares (2SLS) regression analysis revealed an inverse but robust connection with the PDS, indicating its responsiveness to Lake Hawassa habitat quality degradation (n = 9, R2 = 0.921, p < 0.001). The MMI-D revealed a high %DE (95.1%) and a negative but significant connection with nutrients, total suspended solids (TSS), and turbidity (R2 > 0.6; p < 0.05). Generally, it can be concluded that this index is a powerful tool that could assist endusers by providing a practical method for measuring the ecological quality of Lake Hawassa.Keywords: benthic diatomsecological qualityLake Ziwayredundancy analysisvalidation",

Significantly more fish were caught where the two major rivers, the Great Letaba and the Ramadiepa, enter the lake. The smaller gillnet sizes (30–70mm) caught the highest number of S. intermedius, while the 90mm gillnet caught the highest number of Oreochromis mossambicus. Female S. intermedius greatly outnumbered males. Significant differences were found between the monthly catch per unit of effort and the sampling site catch per unit of effort.",

The Centre for Aquatic Toxicology of the Institute for Water Research, Rhodes University, uses artificial streams and toxicological methods to contribute to the development and refinement of these guidelines. This study involved the use of 96-hour acute toxicity tests, using zinc sulphate as the toxicant, to determine the suitability of Adenophlebia auriculata as a potential indicator species of zinc pollution. As it is known that experimental environments (e.g. still versus flowing water systems) can influence the tolerance of a test species, the experimental system most suited to this species' abiotic requirements was determined. Static and recirculating systems were compared, with LC50 values calculated for the static systems being 91% lower than those calculated for the recirculating systems. The increased sensitivity to the toxicant under static conditions may be due to the animals being additionally stressed by the less favourable static environment. This suggests that recirculating systems are more suited for toxicity tests using this mayfly. Adenophlebia auriculata appears to be tolerant to zinc when compared to zinc LC50 values for other test species in the literature, and may therefore not be a suitable indicator of zinc pollution in an aquatic environment.",

From these results it is evident that all the metals generally regarded as toxic to macroinvertebrates namely aluminium, titanium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, cadmium and lead, were detected at each of the sites, but not during every survey. Significant variations in the mean metal concentrations were demonstrated across all sites and surveys, with the intersurvey coefficient of variance exceeding 80% for all metals, except for Ti, Fe, Co and Ni.

The gut contents of 178 fish with standard length (SL) ranging between 100 and 220 mm revealed strong evidence that in the Mfolozi-Msunduzi these fish rely heavily on benthic floc as a primary food source. Plant debris and small benthic organisms, including Assiminea, copepods, nematodes and ostracods also formed part of their diet. Some of these food items (e.g. Assiminea sp. nematodes) were only consumed by P. macrolepis. Differences in the occurrence of food items consumed by these two closely related species may be explained by their feeding ground preferences. Results suggest that P. macrolepis forages in substrata mostly dominated by fine-to-medium sand grain sizes (<50 to 450 µm), whereas M. cunnesius prefers substrata dominated by fine sand to muddy grain sizes (50 to 250 µm). Based on these findings, it is concluded that differences in substrate preference by these two mullet species is an important strategy by which they circumvent any possible interspecific competition for food resources within the system.",

These areas have been linked to the duration of inundation by river flow, the boundary between the two being the 1:2 year floodline. Therefore the wet bank is inundated regularly by small floods and the dry bank by larger, less frequent floods, and each may support one to a few distinct plant communities laterally up the bank. Understanding these plant distributions helps rehabilitation projects and Environmental Flow (EFlows) studies as it can inform re-vegetation strategies in the former and help understanding of the links between plants and the river’s flow regime in the latter. Systematic sampling and data analysis methods were developed for single channel rivers with relatively undisturbed natural vegetation to identify and locate the different plant communities in the riparian zone. Generic rules using distance and height from the water’s edge, rather than the presence or absence of plant species, were calculated to locate the communities. While these statistics were derived from the riparian vegetation along perennial Western Cape rivers, South Africa, the methods could be applied to other perennial single channel river anywhere.",

We found no difference in nutrient content between estuarine and freshwater habitats, and no significant correlation (Spearman’s test) between levels of each nutrient and variation in temperature, turbidity, pH, chlorophyll a, phosphates, nitrates and ammonia. Compared with other small fish species consumed in other countries, G. aestuaria has comparable iron, zinc, calcium, fat and protein, but very low levels of vitamin A.

The Hg concentration was higher in the liver (0.005 mg kg−1) and relatively lower in the gills (0.001 mg kg−1). There were temporal variations in Hg concentration among the tissues; a positive correlation between mean Hg concentration and fish sizes (total length and total weight) was documented in the gills; and a negative correlation for size versus Hg concentration was recorded in the livers, stomach contents, and the muscles of southern mullets. The Hg concentrations of all tissues were below the World Health Organisation (WHO) limit for fish (0.5 mg kg−1), which indicates that it does not pose a human health risk at the current levels. This study’s findings form a baseline for using southern mullets as biological indicators of Hg pollution in WBL.

The use of aquatic invertebrates is premised on their predictable responses to environmental stressors. Assemblage structure is not, however, only influenced by environment, but also neutral processes and temporal variation. This study quantified the relative roles of the environment (niche processes), space (neutral processes) and temporal factors in structuring mayfly and blackfly assemblages at family and species levels. Asymmetric eigenvector maps in conjunction with canonical redundancy analysis and variation partitioning were used to explore the relative roles of these three factors in structuring macroinvertebrate assemblages. At a species level, flow and water temperature were more important in explaining assemblage structure than at the family level. At the family level, space was more important than temporal and environmental factors. Unexplained variation at species and family level was more than 50%. This suggests (i) caution in using family-level rapid assessments to infer the role of the environment in structuring aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages, as neutral processes are also dominant; and (ii) that the importance of stochastic processes, such as dispersal, should not be underestimated in rapid assessments.Keywords: biomonitoring assessmenteigenvectorsredundancy analysis (RDA)spatial driversvariation partitioning analysis (VPA)",

However, few studies have used indices based on benthic invertebrates to assess the effect of these pressures on wetland ecosystems. Multi-metric indices (MMIs) have been used successfully to assess freshwater ecosystems worldwide and are an important management tool, but little is known about their applicability in the wetlands of Ethiopia. In this study, we developed MMIs for wetland invertebrates to assess wetlands in Ethiopia. The wetland invertebrate assemblages were sampled from 24 sampling stations in six wetlands in the Achefer flood plains. These sampling stations included those in least affected areas and those affected by adjacent, agricultural and urban activities. Forty-one candidate metrics were initially reviewed and screened before six core metrics were selected: Taxa richness, ET taxa richness, % EOT, % Diptera, % Collector/Filterer and % intolerant taxa. Mann–Whitney U tests, Box and Whisker plots, correlation analyses, and redundant metric tests were used to assess the ability of metrics to distinguish among reference and impaired wetlands. The MMIs were robust in discriminating reference wetlands from impaired wetlands and therefore have potential as a biomonitoring tool to assess the condition of, and to guide efforts to restore, freshwater wetlands.Keywords: anthropogenic disturbancebenthic invertebratesbioassessmentphysico-chemicalwetland condition",

Pre- and post-impoundment studies, which were undertaken on Lake Kariba by the Joint Fisheries Research Organisation of Zambia and Malawi, generated data on the limnology, fish and zooplankton. Fryer identified free-living Crustacea from the flooded backwaters of the Zambezi river. Thomasson, reporting on the algae in the lake, identified zooplankton collected during May and June 1959. This paper coordinates information on the lake basins, the rivers flowing into Lake Kariba, sampling stations and identification of the zooplankton collected in more comprehensive surveys in 1962 and 1963. At this time the zooplankton community in the lake was made up of thermophilic species adapted to survival in the water column. However, some calanoid copepod species were collected, mainly from river estuaries and in shallow areas of the lake, which are related more to their natural habitat. The zooplankton community comprised 10 rotifer species, 16 species of Cladocera, six calanoid and at least six cyclopoid copepod species, three ostracod species, the limnomedusa Limnocnida tanganjicae, a species of Chaoborus, and a few insect larvae. In less than a decade after impoundment of the Zambezi River, the large subtropical Lake Kariba was colonised successfully by a diverse zooplankton community.",

The same parameters, except nitrate and chloride, were also determined in the liver, gills, intestines and muscle of the fish Oreochromis shiranus from the same dam. Results showed that whilst the concentrations of all parameters in general were higher in September and October in the water, there were variations from month to month in the fish. Comparison of the overall concentrations in the water and fish showed that, for each parameter, there were higher concentrations (P<0.05) in the water than in the fish. Iron and magnesium were more concentrated in the liver while sulphate, calcium and sodium were more concentrated in the intestine. The concentrations of the parameters in both the water and the fish were below the hazard limits. The results suggest that the intensive farming activities taking place around the dam and the presence of the sewage pond nearby have no significant effect on the levels of chemicals in the dam water or its fish.",

Regression analyses showed no statistically significant relationship for either abundance or biomass of the shrimps with temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen (p > 0.05). The relationship between shrimp abundance and biomass and vegetation cover was positive and statistically significant (R2 = 0.109 and 0.185, respectively; p < 0.05).

Total phosphorus concentration is markedly elevated in comparison to historical offshore data, while offshore orthophosphate concentration is lower than when the lake was eutrophic. Chlorophyll a concentrations were similar to the mean value of 4 µg l−1 reported from open water, but lower than the mean of 22 µg l−1 reported from inshore waters. Current values of Secchi disc transparency are lower than the historical records. To date, cage aquaculture seems not to have changed the trophic status of Sanyati Basin, and any nutrient enrichment it caused may have been mitigated by nutrient losses, through both outflow at the dam and fish harvesting.Keywords: enrichmentfish harvestingoutflowtrophic statuswater quality",

Data were recorded during their entire life cycle. Daphnia magna, the larger species, could possibly be more successful in colonising temporary habitats than S. kingi because it allocates more energy to reproduction. Scapheloberis kingi, the smaller species, starts reproduction early, resulting in a smaller brood size and a shorter life span with fewer broods. Consequently, S. kingi produces a smaller number of neonates during its lifetime and has a lower rm. In contrast, D. magna delays reproduction but produces a larger brood size and, because it is longer-lived, produces more broods and so produces a greater number of neonates and has a higher rm over its lifetime.",

This is rooted in the human response to the undesirable consequences of development, and seeks to introduce the notion of sustainability into the modern development discourse. This has given rise to an academic discipline that is known as political ecology, which seeks to understand the political construction of environmental knowledge. As it is currently formulated, political ecology is highly Eurocentric, meaning that African scholars should become engaged in its intellectual development. This political ecology discourse is relatively new in southern African academic circles, and can be helpful in explaining dynamics that are shaping the World Water Vision, Global Water Partnership, World Commission on Dams and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, all of which are relevant in the contemporary water sector.",

    "abstract": "The study involves the analysis of groundwater around Bass Lake, part of a fragile black water lake system situated along a narrow coastal plain in the southern Cape, in order to establish the quality of the water and to identify the sources of pollution. The study was conducted in 1998 during the winter season in which water samples were taken from Bass Lake and from eight wellpoints surrounding the lake. The samples were analysed for traces of faecal pollution, nutrient concentrations, pH and conductivity. The results of these tests showed that the water is relatively uncontaminated during the winter season. Only slight contamination was found at one sampling site. However there was enough secondary evidence to suggest that the lake had being reasonably polluted at various times of the year. This evidence was in the form of medical reports, changes in the natural vegetation and incidences of algal blooms. It is expected that significant contamination only occurs during the summer time, when the visitor occupancy rate in the surrounding houses is high and consequently ther is an increase in the volume of waste water and sewage received by domestic sewage systems. The study suggests that water monitoring methodology used in this study should yield better results during the drier summer period when there is decrease in the rate of groundwater flow and a lower water table. Monitoring throughout the year is recommended.",

    "abstract": "The chief pursuit of all aquatic science is to come to know the rules that govern aquatic systems. In this pursuit many scientists move in the direction of greater diversity, where the laws that govern ecosystem relationships become increasingly confined to specific circumstances. Uncovering these types of laws can provide useful information for specific cases but it is necessary to balance this type of investigation with work that goes in the opposite direction i.e. towards the common laws. Knowledge of these laws is more widely applicable and indeed becomes increasingly so the closer they are to the 'centre of the circle'. This type of pursuit was, and still should be, the function of the University, which seeks to find the unity in diversity. This paper attempts to reveal the laws that govern water and its role in the environment. It presents what some ancient literature and scriptures call the fundamental nature of water, namely to bond and to provide a matrix in which other processes take place, and that this applies at the causal, subtle and physical levels. This paper seeks to illustrate how these laws, that make water what it is, spread throughout the natural environment, lending qualities to all systems that are dependent on water. Wide ranging reference is made to scriptural and historical literature some of which is thousands of years old. From these, a 'fresh but ancient' way of viewing the health of the environment is presented, and the consequences of disrupting and abusing the natural laws are discussed.",

Simultaneously, 5km upstream, a poly-aromatic hydrocarbon poison was simultaneously leaked into the same river from a 25 litre canister. These spills threatened the Nylsvley Nature Reserve, a newly acclaimed RAMSAR site, situated about 20km downstream of Nylstroom. The Limnological team of the Department of Zoology, University of the North, was asked to assist with the assessment of the effect of these spills, which resulted in a massive fish kill. A monitoring program was implemented in early September 1998 to assess the effect of these spills on the water quality of the receiving water body. The implications of the altered water quality on the aquatic biota are discussed. Keywords: KLEIN NYL RIVERWATER QUALITY ASSESSMENTNUTRIENTSMETALSPHENOLSEWAGE SPILL",

Furthermore, habitat complexity can mediate the strength of predator-prey interactions through the provision of prey refugia or through enhancing ambush predation. In this study, we use functional responses (FRs) to compare the effect of habitat complexity on resource utilisation between Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides and Florida Bass Micropterus floridanus predating upon Mozambique Tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus fry. Treatments for this study were zero and high habitat complexities, with the latter being artificially constructed using plastic strips. Both predator species exhibited a Type II FR in both habitat complexities, with Florida Bass exhibiting significantly higher FR magnitudes, compared with Largemouth Bass under both habitat complexities. Both species experienced dampening of FR magnitudes under high habitat complexity. Florida Bass had persistently lower handling parameters than Largemouth Bass regardless of habitat complexity. While higher habitat complexity may offer prey refugia from Florida Bass, changes in complexity had a negligible effect upon Largemouth Bass predatory efficiency. Measures to enhance natural complexity through system restoration may be a useful conservation measure for endemic fish in rivers invaded by Florida Bass, however, the same mitigation measures may not be as effective for Largemouth Bass.",

This information is of relevance to aquaculture initiatives, and fills in knowledge gaps from previous research at Algerian sites. The size of nauplii varied from 453.26 ± 0.3 µm and 478.73 ± 0.2 µm. The chorion thickness was between 13.28 µm and 10.50 µm. The highest hatching percentage and hatching efficiency were obtained after decapsulation of Bethioua cysts. The shortest hatching synchrony time was also found for the Bethioua cysts. All cyst samples from the the Bethioua population analysed in this study showed a freshwater-type fatty acid profile, rich in linolenic acid (LNA, 18:3n.3), opposed to a marine-type fatty acid profile rich in presence of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3). The Bethioua population exhibited the best hatching performance and are ideally suited for use in aquaculture.",

    "abstract": "Despite dramatic differences in calcium concentrations within aquatic systems, very few studies have explored the relationships between ambient calcium concentration and the calcium concentration of resident fish under natural conditions. This study compares calcium concentration in the water to that of the scales and vertebral column of the African cyprinid, Rastrineobola argentea from lakes Nabugabo and Victoria, East Africa. The concentration of calcium in Lake Nabugabo, which averaged 1.50 mg l−1, was much lower than the average of literature-derived values for the Ugandan portion of Lake Victoria (6.96 mg l−1). Rastrineobola argentea from Lake Victoria were characterised by higher levels of calcium in the scales than that of conspecifics from Lake Nabugabo, whereas there was no difference in vertebral column calcium concentration between the two populations. Within Lake Nabugabo, calcium concentration was lower in the scales than in the vertebral column of R. argentea, whereas no difference was detected between the scalar and vertebral calcium concentrations of conspecifics from Lake Victoria. These results suggest that ambient calcium concentration may affects tissue levels and that fish in Lake Nabugabo may remobilise calcium from their scales to maintain skeletal growth and development.",

To understand these colour differences, tigerfish were collected during 2008 to 2010 from four southern African populations in the Upper Zambezi River (ZAM), Okavango Delta (OKA), Pongolapoort Dam (POD) and Phongolo River (POR), and caudal fin colouration was classified according to pattern and sex. Muscle and liver tissue were assayed by starch electrophoresis. Caudal fin colour in OKA, ZAM and POD showed significant differences between sexes. Genetics revealed closer relationships between OKA and ZAM, substantiated by their recurrent and historical links, and between POD and POR, as expected for a dam and associated river. There is an association between the genetic and geographical distance of tigerfish populations, but variation in caudal colour in this species can most likely be attributed to their environment, territorial dominance and sexual behaviour.",

It was found that the blood coagulation system of adult O. mossambicus exposed to copper and zinc at neutral and acid pH levels was altered. Deviations from normal coagulation times are either inherent or are due to factors such as liver damage, vascular abnormalities, and mineral and vitamin deficiencies. Exposure to copper and zinc at neutral pH caused prolonged blood coagulation, whilst at acidic pH exposure to these metals caused accelerated coagulation. Haemostatic conditions induced by these metals were fibrinolysis, haemophilia, thrombocytosis (hypercoagulability) and thrombocytopaenia.

Total length and fish and gonad weight were measured monthly for both  species. Length maxima for female and male B. paludinosus were 130 mm and 113 mm respectively, and for female and male B. trimaculatus 120 mm and 85 mm respectively. Lengths-at-first-maturity for female and male B. paludinosus were 69 mm and 64 mm respectively, and for B. trimaculatus 61 mm and 59 mm respectively. Lengths-atfirst-capture were 62.4 mm for B. paludinosus and 71.8 mm for B. trimaculatus . Females predominated 3:1 over males in both species. For the Barbus fishery in  Lake Chilwa the optimal stretched mesh size for matemba seine-nets, in terms of rendering the  fishery sustainable, was 10.53 mm. Barbus breed  throughout the year, with a minor peak in April–March and a major breeding peak in October–January. Before the rainy season, Barbus migrate  to the marshes, marginal swamps and the Mnembo River mouth to breed. Fishery management recommendations to ensure successful breeding and recruitment of Barbus into the fishery include: (1) a closed season for active fishing gears targeting Barbus spp. and juvenile tilapias from October to February for the  lake and riverine fishing, (2) the increase of the  permitted stretch mesh size for matemba seine-nets to 10.53 mm and (3) protection of the  marshes, swamps and river habitats which act as breeding grounds for the Barbus spp. Keywords: breeding grounds; closed season; conservation; marsh areas African Journal of Aquatic Science 2009, 34(2): 123–130",

All fish used in the aspiration experiment recovered and survived. Livers of O. mossambicus exposed to cadmium and zinc showed excess numbers of exfoliated red blood cells, loss of cellular cohesion, regenerative hyperplasia, pale and weak cytoplasm staining, pronounced vacuolation and degeneration. Cadmium and zinc exposure induced pathological cellular changes. Exfoliative cytology is thus a safe, cost-effective and reliable bio-assessment tool.",

Ecological data, morphometrics, meristics, allozymes, and genomic fingerprints — generated with six Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) analyses, and DNA barcoding primers — were compared for both species and individuals with intermediate diagnostic characters. Serranochromis altus was the largest species, having the greatest number of anterior teeth rows, whereas S. angusticeps was the smallest with the lowest number of anterior teeth rows. The intermediate group, with overlapping characteristics, had intermediate body size and teeth row numbers. Morphometric comparisons of mass with the combined individuals' growth (standard length) showed a high positive correlation (r 2 = 0.873). Allozyme analysis of individuals revealed no fixed allele differences, minute differentiation (average F ST = 0.018) and high gene flow (NeM = 7.672) between the species. No hybrizymes were found. Allozyme data indicated that these 'species' are part of a single, panmictic population, which was confirmed by ISSR analysis and fish DNA barcoding. Genetic and interspecific divergence in allometry between S. altus and S. angusticeps were non-significant. It was initially thought that these fishes represented different life stages of S. angusticeps. However, we found fish of different sizes, yet with similar ages, representing both species. More accurate age/size and other molecular analyses are required in order to determine if these represent different life stages of S. angustiuceps.",

Mean heterozygosity was 1% in the Okavango, as compared to 1.9% in the Upper Zambezi and 5.6% in the Olifants River systems. Possible reasons for this anomaly, in terms of the Hardy-Weinberg principle, include the founder effect caused when the Okavango and Zambezi rivers became separated, and/or that the Okavango is a more stable system and therefore that a large variation might not be required in its individuals for survival. Significant differences of genotypes were found among all populations previously studied. The selection of potential candidates for artificial breeding is discussed.",

This study quantifies the effect of temperature on the standard rate of metabolism in the African lungfish, Protopterus aethiopicus. We present a Q10 value of 3.3 for individuals ranging in body mass from 42–222g across an ecologically-relevant 10°C temperature range. Protopterus aethiopicus showed a positive bilogarithmic (log-log) relationship between the rate of oxygen consumption and body mass (range = 44–222g) at three water temperatures (20, 25, 30°C). However, adjusted mean rates of oxygen consumption differed among all three temperatures. A Q10 value derived as the means of Q10 values calculated for each individual lungfish averaged 3.3 ± 0.4 (SE) for 20–30°C. A comparison of literature-derived Q10 values for both tropical and temperate fishes suggests a higher Q10 in tropical species (n = 3) than in temperate species (n = 10) across an ecologically-relevant thermal range.",

However, for Lake Malawi's cichlid species, such population genetic studies are hampered by a large amount of genetic variation being shared among populations. To circumvent this problem, it is necessary to use highly polymorphic molecular markers. In this study, Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) markers were used to assess the genetic diversity within, and among, Dimidiochromis kiwinge populations. AFLP analysis generated a total of 686 bands across all populations, of which 625 (91.1%) were polymorphic. AMOVA (Analysis of Molecular Variance) revealed significant genetic variation, the majority of which (78.7%) resided within populations. All but one of the pairwise fixation indices were significantly different from zero, suggesting limited or no gene flow among populations (overall Fst = 0.2135). Such limited gene flow among populations has vital implications for the management and conservation of this important food resource.",

ICP-MS and ICP-OES analyses of trace metals based on total concentration of unfiltered lake water samples showed the presence of trace metals. All fish species accumulated Al, Mn and Sr in the highest concentrations in their gills, with Cu, Cd, Co, Cr, Pb and U highest in the liver. Pungu maclareni accumulated Al, Cr, Co, Sr and Pb in the highest concentrations. The highest mean gill Al concentration of 140 µg g−1 dry weight was measured in P. maclareni gills, this being one of the critically endangered cichlids of the lake. Stable isotope analyses of carbon δ13C and nitrogen δ15N showed that P. maclareni had the highest mean δ13C (−30.2‰) and highest concentrations of Cr, Co, Pb and U in liver, probably linking the carbon source to the accumulation of metals. Though trace metal levels in the lake water were low, their presence in fish tissues suggest they are bioavailable, bioaccumulate and may pose a threat to the aquatic biota, and therefore should be monitored.",

The aging and growth of Oreochromis mossambicus from the Sundays River Valley irrigation pond in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa were determined using otoliths. Mark recapture of chemically-tagged wild fish was used to confirm the periodicity of growth zone creation. A total of 150 specimens of O. mossambicus were obtained using a combination of seine and fyke nets. Female total lengths (Lt) ranged from 20 to 340 mm, while male Lt ranged from 82 to 374 mm. Growth zone deposition rates of wild O. mossambicus otoliths fluorochrome-marked with oxytetracycline hydrochloride (OTC) and recaptured after one year was consistent with the deposition of one growth increment annually. According to the three-parameter von Bertalanffy model, growth was described using different coefficients for females and males, respectively. The maximum age estimate for both females and males was 12 years. Oreochromis mossambicus in this warm temperate pond had relatively long life spans compared to subtropical populations, which suggest likely long-term population persistence within cooler, novel environments.",

This study was conducted to assess the status and seasonal catch rates of fish species using gillnets over a two-year period. Four species and one introduced fish belonging to the Cichlidae family were encountered in the study. Coptodon discolor (Günther, 1903) was the most abundant species, making up 75.5% of the total fish caught (100.1 kg). Tilapia busumana (Günther, 1903) was the least abundant species, representing only 0.6% of biomass. Catch per unit effort was significantly affected by seasonality; however, species diversity, richness and evenness were not influenced by seasonal variations. The highest catch rates (975.62 g net−1 night−1) were recorded in the minor wet season (August to November). No statistical differences were detected in the diversity indices estimated for all three seasons of study. The key physico-chemical parameters (conductivity, salinity, temperature and pH) measured were within the tolerance range for tilapia survival and growth, with the exception of dissolved oxygen that decreased below 3 mg l−1 during the lake’s deep mixing events in August. Overall, physico-chemical factors explained 75% of fish catches, with salinity levels correlating significantly with catch per unit effort.",

The location of the sampling site, which is situated in a direct line halfway between the Makgadikgadi pans and Okavango Delta towards the east (Botswana) and the Etosha pans towards the west (Namibia), suggests that migrating birds are likely vectors spreading desmids from one waterbody to another.

The definitions of the different types of microsystems are reviewed and it is apparent that an estuary is not simply a coastal water body where river and seawater meet. A range of other conditions, especially regular marine-estuarine connectivity and the persistence of a relatively large waterbody, are required for a flourishing estuarine biota to become established. In contrast to many global countries, the South African coastline has a continuum of coastal microsystems that cover the full spectrum of micro-outlets of various sizes, through micro-estuaries in the process of becoming estuarine systems, to a range of fully functional estuaries such as temporarily open/closed and predominantly open estuaries, to large estuarine lakes and bays. The impact of sea-level rise and fall on the exposure or inundation of coastal waterfalls is also examined, thus providing additional insights into the transformation of a freshwater outlet into a functional estuary. Furthermore, the creation of artificial concrete canal outlets in some of the major coastal cities is documented, with some estuaries being lost in the process.Keywords: artificial outletcoastal waterfallestuarine functionalitymicro-outletmicro-estuary",

    "abstract": "Abstract In man-made Lake Ayame, a 180-day cage culture feeding trial was conducted to investigate the effects of three agricultural by-products — chicken droppings, wheat bran and corn bran — on the survival rates, mean daily weight gain and feed conversion ratio in juveniles of a landlocked population of Sarotherodon melanotheron. Results were compared to those obtained from fishes fed on a local commercial diet and a group of unfed fishes. Survival rate (SR), mean daily weight gain (MDWG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were better for fish fed on the commercial diet (SR: 95.0 ± 4.2%, MDWG: 0.26 ± 0.00 g.d−1 and FCR: 4.27 ± 0.47) than for the unfed fish (SR: 53.0 ± 0.0% and MDWG: 0.02 ± 0.00g.d−1). Of the by-products, corn bran resulted in the best mean daily weight gain (0.09 ± 0.01g.d−1). A significant positive correlation of the dietary dry matter (beta: 0.98), lipid (beta: 0.99), protein (beta: 0.85) and energy (beta: 0.98) levels with the mean daily weight gain was also observed.

    "abstract": "The reproduction of the smooth-head catfish (Clarias liocephalus), a heavily exploited wetland fish in Uganda, in a data-deficient fishery, was studied from January to December 2011. Analyses were based on a sample of 854 fish specimens obtained from a chain of wetlands that fringe the Rwizi River, a tributary of the Nile River. Samples were collected monthly from four sites. Fecundity, gonadosomatic index, size at sexual maturity, condition factor and growth patterns were used to describe the reproduction of the species. Mean female fecundity was 2 484.03 ± 1 289.90 (range 266–3 474). Females attained sexual maturity at a smaller size (12.0 cm TL) than males (13.79 cm TL), but were in better condition than males. Gonadosomatic index peaked in the wettest months of the study period, with highest proportion of mature ova occurring during July to November. Although C. liocephalus seems less fecund than other known clariids and is therefore prone to adverse effects from overexploitation, knowledge of its spawning periodicity and its size at sexual maturity could be useful in the management of the fishery in wetlands where it is still abundant.",

These parameters also influence bioavailability and toxicity of contaminants in aquatic systems, because sediment is the sink and source for most contaminants. These sediment parameters therefore potentially confound sediment toxicity results when using inappropriate toxicity test organisms and/or test conditions. Grandidierella lignorum is being developed as a sediment toxicity test organism for South African coastal waters and it is crucial that its preference for sediment grain size and organic matter is determined with the aim of defining test conditions for sediment toxicity tests. G. lignorum were offered a choice of six sediment grades and two types of organic matter of varying concentrations (0–8%) to determine their preference thereof. Very coarse sediment grade and mud were consistently the least selected particle sizes in all experiments. Sediment with low organic matter (<0.5%), was also consistently selected by G. lignorum and this was not influenced by sediment particle size. G. lignorum can therefore be used for the toxicity testing of sediment with a wide grain size variation, although results may be confounded in sediment samples largely comprised of very coarse or muddy sediment.",

Ingestion rates of the copepod were investigated on two occasions, one week after emergence and two weeks thereafter, employing the gut fluorescent technique. Results of the study indicate the absence of any diel patterns in feeding for both sexes on both sampling occasions (p > 0.05 in both cases). Moreover, there was no significant differences in gut pigment contents between adult male and females during either of the surveys (p > 0.05). Daily rations of the adult copepods during the two studies were equivalent to <2% (range 0.8 to 1.8%) body carbon per day suggesting that they are consuming alternative carbon sources to meet their daily carbon requirements. The main findings of this study suggest that L. raynerae can be considered as a generalist omnivore.",

Indices of weight and volumetric occurrences indicated that Clarias buthupogon eats aquatic insects, crustaceans, oligochaetes, molluscs, animal and plant debris. The average intestinal coefficient was 0.84, which places the species among the insectivorous-prone omnivores. The diet according to sex, season, length and height, and location inside and outside the Yoko Reserve revealed that similar prey items were consumed in similar proportions.

A study was conducted to examine helminth parasites in some catfishes from Omambala River, Anambra State, Nigeria. Two hundred and fifty randomly selected fish samples comprising of 100 Chrysichthys auratus, 62 Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus and 88 Synodontis clarias were collected between the months of January and June, 2017. They were examined for intestinal helminth parasites using standard conventional parasitological methods. The rate of infection was determined using low power (x10) binocular microscope to enumerate number of worms. Results revealed that Caryophyllaeus and Cosmoxyema were present in C. nigrodigitalus, Wenyonia, Polyonchobothriom, Paraglaridacris and Cosmoxyema were recovered from Synodontis clarias and parasite was observed in C. auratus. Small intestine was the site preference for the parasites. Parasite prevalence was lower in C. nigrodigitatus (8.1%) (p 0.05) in infection rate of parasites between C. nigrodigitatus and C. gariepinus. The males of C. nigrodigitatus had a lower prevalence (6.25%) than the females (10%). Similar trend was observed in S. clarias with the males having a prevalence of 84.9% while the females recorded a prevalence of 86.7%. This may mean that female fish had higher loads of parasite infections than their male counterpart.

Five length classes of 10 samples each for each strain was chosen thus: Class1 (7.5cm - 10.4cm), Class2 (10.5cm - 13.4cm), Class3 (13.5cm – 16.4cm) Class4 (16.5 cm - 19.4cm), and Class5 (19.5cm - 22.4cm). Data collected were subjected to statistical analysis for significance at 5% probability level using descriptive statistics. Results revealed that measurements showed linear correlation between fish length and size in both strains. When the diploid and triploid groups were compared it was observed that body characters (85.6% of total characters) were higher in triploid than diploid fishes. However, head characters were observed to be higher in diploid than triploid. For instance, in Class1, diploid fish had higher values for barbel length (diploid 3.08cm; triploid 3.0cm), pre-pectoral fin length (diploid 2.05cm; triploid 1.99cm) and pre-maxillary width (diploid 0.97cm; triploid 0.91). A similar trend was observed in all other length classes. There were no significant differences (p > 0.05) in morphometric characters relating to body measurements. This considered the triploid fish to be closely related to the diploid group which can be confirmed by the study of genetic characters.\r\nKey Words: Morphometric characters, Diploid, Triploid, Juveniles, Clarias gariepinus",

    "abstract": "The aspects of the biology of silver catfish, Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus was investigated from July to September 2017 in Uta Ewa Creek, Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria. A total of 90 fish samples were collected from artisanal fisher folks at the landing site. Fish sizes ranged from 12.20cm to 22.90cm standard length, 16.70cm to 31.90cm total length and 30.30g to 178.60g body weight. Monthly condition factor of 1.77, 1.765 and 1.68 were recorded in July, August and September respectively. The mean value of 1.74 showed a negative allometric growth pattern. This implied that fish lengths were not in proportion with weights. The length-weight linear relationship was InW ═ -3.4164 + 2.7545x with a correlation value of 0.8236. The results of stomach content analyses revealed that the fish fed on various food items consisting of phytoplankton 56 (62.22%), crustaceans 8 (8.88%), insects 10 (11.11%), molluscs 7 (7.77%), worms 4 (4.44%) and unidentified materials 5 (5.55%). The most abundant food items found at the study site throughout the period of sampling was phytoplankton (59%), insects (11%), crayfish (9%), periwinkle (7%), worms (4%), crabs (4%) and unidentified food items (6%). From the results of this study C. nigrodigitatus could be considered as being omnivorous.\r\nKey Words: Condition factor, Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus, diet, length-weight relationships, selection factor, Uta Ewa Creek",

    "abstract": "The study was conducted to determine the prevalence, mean intensity, and abundance of Trichodina heterodentata in Clarias gariepinus from two selected fish farms in Calabar.. A total of eighty (80) samples of C. gariepinus from the two farms (40 each) were necropsied for parasitological analysis. Gill, skin and fin biopsies were prepared from each specimen following standard methods. Parasitological indices including prevalence, mean intensity and abundance were calculated according to standard formulae. Results obtained showed that 18 fish samples were infested with T. heterodentata from the two farms with a total of 84 T. heterodentata parasites. In farm 1, prevalence (20.0), intensity (4.50) and abundance (0.90) of Trichodina parasite was lower than farm 2 with prevalence (25.0), intensity (4.80) and abundance (1.20). In both farms, prevalence, intensity and abundance of T. heterodentata were higher in female C. gariepinus than male but not significant (p>0.05). Clinical signs observed in the two farms were loss of appetite, necrosis and skin ulcer, sluggish movement and excessive secretion from the gills. Trichodina infestation in farmed fish may lead to poor growth rates and high mortality which will subsequently result in huge monetary loss and low profit margin by increasing production cost due to the cost of treatments. It is therefore concluded that ponds or tanks should be properly disinfected before stocking of healthy fingerlings.\r\nKeywords: Prevalence, Intensity, Abundance, Trichodina heterodentata, Clarias gariepinus",

    "abstract": "The study was aimed at investigating effects of Nigella sativa (Black cumen) seed extracts on growth parameters of Tilapia zillii. Seven hundred and twenty mixed sexes of Tilapia zillii (mean weight 0.97g) were collected and randomly distributed into four different treatment groups (0.0, 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20g/l) in three replicates. The N. sativa seeds aqueous extracts were prepared according to standard methods. Study revealed that growth parameters were better in treated compared to control fish. The result showed that fish growth increased with increase in concentration of the plant extract with significant differences (p<0.05) in each group. Results showed that the group treated with 0.2g/l (highest concentration) had the highest final weight (29.12+0.27), mean weight gain (28.15+0.27), % weight gain (2902.41+27.55), specific growth rate (5.56+0.02) and relative growth rate (48.37+0.46). While the least growth parameters were obtained in group treated with 0.10g/l concentration having final weight (13.85+0.12), mean weight gain (12.88+0.12), % weight gain (1327.49+12.08), specific growth rate (4.26+0.01) and Relative growth rate (22.12+0.20). The results revealed that temperature in all treated groups ranged from 27.67±0.20 to 28.94±0.14oC. Dissolved oxygen (DO) ranged from 3.71+0.25 to 3.89+0.16mg/l, pH ranged from 6.98+0.01 to 7.07+0.06 while total dissolved solid (TDS) range was from 157.18+0.61 to 210.42+1.62pp/m. The values for these water parameters in various treatment groups were observed to be within the optimum suitable for growth of tilapia.

The extract concentrations of 16.g/l, 3.2g/l, 6.4g/l and 12.8g/l were applied to catfish fingerlings to assess effects on some lipid profile status of the fish. Each treatment had three replicates and the exposure time was 21days. The extract reduced the levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol in all treated groups when compared with the control. While significantly (p < 0.05) higher values were observed for the HDL-cholesterol of all treated groups when compared with the control. For the atherogenic risk predictor indices a marked increase in HDL-cholesterol/total cholesterol ratio was observed, while LDL-cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol and log (TG/HDL-cholesterol) ratio decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in treated groups compared to the control group. The observed effects increased with increase concentration of the extracts.

This study investigated the effects of the interaction betweennTiO2 and lead (Pb2+) in a simple freshwater food web model consisting of zooplankton (Eucyclops sp.) and theAfrican catfish Clarias gariepinus. The growth performance and nutrient composition of Clarias gariepinus fedwith contaminated zooplankton alone and combined mixtures of nTiO2 (0.20 μM) and Pb2+ (0.01 and 0.04 μM),respectively, were evaluated after a chronic (28 days) semi-static laboratory bioassay. Our results demonstrateda decrease in the bioaccumulation of Pb2+ in fish exposed to the binary mixtures. The interaction of the mixturescaused significant (p < 0.05) retardation of growth of the fish through decreases of specific growth rate andallometric growth. Furthermore, a significant (p < 0.05) decrease of nutrient composition in fish tissues (muscles)was elicited in protein (20.66 to 16.73%), ash (5.96 to 5.69 %), moisture (16.2 to 14.8 %) and total lipid (10.04 to6.62%). The findings of this study suggest that feeding fish with copepods contaminated with Pb2+ and nTiO2mixtures could negatively affect the growth and nutrient composition (protein, ash, moisture and total lipid) offreshwater fish species, such as C. gariepinus.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge of population sizes of threatened fish species is essential for formulation and implementation of effective conservation and management policies. Visual counts (VC) from two SCUBA diving expeditions during February and May 2019 were used to estimate the population size of the subterranean blind clariid cave-catfish Clarias cavernicola Trewavas 1936 in the Aigamas Cave system in Namibia. Two additional cave pools accessed through an entrance along the same fault, were explored during the May expedition. Two divers recorded 111 and 119 individuals in February and 35 and 41 individuals in May for the Aigamas Cave pool. Although the surveys were done to a depth of 40 m, individuals were only recorded to a maximum depth of 17 m. The difference between the February and May VC was 77 fish. This suggests that the catfish may potentially move to other pools through subterranean connections. The two new pools were found approximately 87 m below ground surface. A VC from above the surface by two observers showed that the first pool had at least 62 individuals of C. cavernicola and the second had at least 14 individuals. This survey has thus marginally, but importantly extended the range of this species to include two additional pools in the Aigamas Cave system. A reassessment of the conservation status of this species following the IUCN criteria, indicates that this species qualifies to be classified as Critically Endangered under criterion D, because of its limited geographic range and multiple threats, such as from excessive underground water abstraction, pollution and illegal collection by aquarists.",

Representative sampling sites were identified using a logistic regression model to predict the probability of site pairs that were more than 50% similar as a function of up-/downstream distance. Alpha diversities peaked in the upper third of river lengths; beta diversities showed predictable exponential decay rates down river axes up to and excluding the start of estuarine conditions. Application of the model to a 370-km long river indicated that 14 sites should be selected for sampling to capture overall biodiversity patterns. Additional factors, such as confluences tributaries, which influence alpha diversity at sites, are identified and incorporated into site selection.",

In South Africa, wetlands can play an important water-regulating role. This study aims to establish the ecological condition of a historically utilised wetland on the Lions River floodplain in the uMngeni catchment, to provide a guide for the planning and implementation of rehabilitation interventions. A comprehensive assessment of the wetland’s structure was undertaken in 2014, using vegetation and soil parameters, mapped and compared with changes in landuse on the wetland from historical aerial photographs. The study concluded that the wetland’s ecological condition had declined, as a result of historical cultivation and commercial forestry. The wetland vegetation present is still generally aligned with the prevailing hydro-edaphic gradient and soil water regime; however, some areas of the wetland showed a mismatch in the soil water indicators and vegetation wetness indicators (the level of wetness based on vegetation being higher than that showed by the soil), suggesting localised drying out. A moderately high abundance of ruderal indigenous and invasive alien species in 61% of the wetland, particularly the drier areas of the wetland, contributed to the altered ecological condition.",

    "abstract": "Recent modification of the South African Water Law spells out fundamental changes for the way the country's water resources will be managed in the future. One of the most significant mandates is the establishment of Catchment Management Agencies (CMAs) and the delegation of water resource management responsibilities to these institutions. Their function will focus on the overall management of water resources on a catchment basis. Within the context of the new legal framework, there is a great need for support to CMAs, particularly in providing them with procedures for the optimal management of water resources in order to ensure a balance between sustainable use and protection of the resource. This paper describes a research project that aims to develop a protocol for the integrated management of the biophysical component of a catchment, with particular focus on river systems. This protocol will be a management tool for Catchment Management Agencies in support of more integrated and sustainable water resource management. South Africa's Sabie-Sand catchment was selected as a case study area for several reasons. This catchment has a large number of current and historic water resource related initiatives, such as the Working for Water Programme (alien plant clearing), the River Health Programme (river quality assessment) and The Kruger National Park Rivers Research Programme (a river management programme). In addition the diversity of stakeholders and land-use issues in the catchment and the extensive collection of available information relating to water use and protection for this catchment makes the Sabie-Sand a rich learning ground. This project aims to use information from the Sabie catchment to produce and implement a protocol which will combine and integrate the knowledge of water resource management from diverse but related fields in order to enhance catchment-based integrated water resource management. It also aims to extract and document lessons from current research initiatives, to assess the usefulness and relevance of their products for CMAs and to identify gaps in the research framework that need to be addressed in order to meet the water resource management needs of CMAs. This paper reports on the project development during its first phase, describes the next steps in the research process and provides a conceptual framework of how the research team envisages the practical implementation of the protocol.",

In P. indicus males, changes in proportional growth are evident at 27.5–29.3mm CL. In females two inflection points are evident, one at 28.8–31.0mm CL and another at 39.7mm CL. Similarly, in M. monoceros, males show a proportional growth change at around 22mm CL and females at 27mm and 34mm respectively. These changes in P. indicus occur at the approximate sizes at which mating maturity and ovarian maturity are attained, suggesting that they may be linked.",

    "abstract": "The chief pursuit of all aquatic science is to come to know the rules that govern aquatic systems. In this pursuit many scientists move in the direction of greater diversity, where the laws that govern ecosystem relationships become increasingly confined to specific circumstances. Uncovering these types of laws can provide useful information for specific cases but it is necessary to balance this type of investigation with work that goes in the opposite direction i.e. towards the common laws. Knowledge of these laws is more widely applicable and indeed becomes increasingly so the closer they are to the `centre of the circle'. This type of pursuit was, and still should be, the function of the University , which seeks to find the unity in diversity . \nThis paper attempts to reveal the laws that govern water and its role in the environment. It presents what some ancient literature and scriptures call the fundamental nature of water, namely to bond and to provide a matrix in which other processes take place, and that this applies at the causal, subtle and physical levels. This paper seeks to illustrate how these laws, that make water what it is, spread throughout the natural environment, lending qualities to all systems that are dependent on water. Wide ranging reference is made to scriptural and historical literature some of which is thousands of years old. From these, a `fresh but ancient' way of viewing the health of the environment is presented, and the consequences of disrupting and abusing the natural laws are discussed. \nKeywords: water; aquatic environment; philosophy; Veda; Bible; Upanishad; Koran; Gita; river; sattva; rajas; tamas; guna \n(Afr J Aqua Sci: 2000 25: 3-8)",

    "abstract": "For many years the Journal published by the Southern African Society of Aquatic Scientists has aimed to provide a forum for the publication of research results, observations, comment, theories, hypotheses and other information on natural waters in and around Africa south of the Sahara. The objective has been to promote the understanding of their functioning, conservation and wise management for the benefit of all the peoples of this subcontinent. At a time when many South African journals are assuming a title of continental relevance, as is this Journal, it is appropriate to examine its publication history from its inception in 1975 up to 1999, after which the name was changed. An analysis of authorship demographics and patterns of publication reveals that South African authors dominated our Journal and shows that there has been no significant shift in the contributions by authors from outside the borders of South Africa. Unlike international trends, there has been no significant shift toward multi-authored papers published in this Journal. Furthermore, although lentic waters research has dominated, there has been a significant decline since 1975. Whilst we support the use of the word ‘African’ in the Journal's new title, we make a number of recommendations, including the selection of a representative editorial board tasked with specific duties aimed at increasing the diversity and scope of papers, as well as a possible mentoring system for local students, the publishing of country reviews and monographs or special issues as they relate specifically to Africa's inland waters. We hope that these may help the Society improve the access, representation and contribution of the continent's aquatic scientists and other aquatic practitioners to the Journal.",
