    "abstract": "We recall why linear codes with complementary duals (LCD codes) play a role in counter-measures to passive and active side-channel analyses on embedded cryptosystems. The rate and the minimum distance of such LCD codes must be as large as possible. We recall the known primary construction of such codes with cyclic codes, and investigate other constructions, with expanded Reed-Solomon codes and generalized residue codes, for which we study the idempotents. These constructions do not allow to reach all the desired parameters. We study then those secondary constructions which preserve the LCD property, and we characterize conditions under which codes obtained by direct sum, direct product, puncturing, shortening, extending codes, or obtained by the Plotkin sum, can be LCD.",

The construction of families with small asymptoticcovering densities is a classical problem in the area ofCovering Codes. In this paper, infinite sets of families $\\mathcal A$R,q,where $R$ is fixed but $q$ ranges over an infinite set of primepowers are considered, and the dependence on $q$ of theasymptotic covering densities of $\\mathcal A$R,q isinvestigated. It turns out that for the upper limit $\\mu$q*(R,$\\mathcal A$R,q) of the covering density of$\\mathcal A$R,q, the best possibility is$\\mu$q*(R,$\\mathcal A$R,q)=$O(q)$. The main achievement of thepresent paper is the construction of optimal infinitesets of families $\\mathcal A$R,q, that is, sets of familiessuch that relation $\\mu$q*(R,$\\mathcal A$R,q)=$O(q)$holds, for any covering radius $R\\geq 2$. We first showed that for a given $R$, to obtain optimalinfinite sets of families it is enough to construct $R$infinite families $\\mathcal A$R,q(0),$\\mathcal A$R,q(1), $\\ldots$, $\\mathcal A$R,q(R-1) such that, for all $u\\geq u$0,the family $\\mathcal A$R,q($\\gamma$) contains codes ofcodimension $r$u$=Ru + \\gamma$ and length $f$q($\\gamma$)($r$u)where $f$q($\\gamma$)$(r)=O(q$(r-R)/R$)$ and$u$0 is a constant. Then, we were able to construct thenecessary families $\\mathcal A$R,q($\\gamma$) for anycovering radius $R\\geq 2$, with $q$ ranging over the (infinite)set of $R$-th powers. A result of independent interest is thatin each of these families $\\mathcal A$R,q($\\gamma$), thelower limit of the covering density is bounded from above by aconstant independent of $q$. The key tool in our investigation is the design of new smallsaturating sets in projective spaces over finite fields, whichare used as the starting point for the $q$m-concatenatingconstructions of covering codes. A new concept of $N$-foldstrong blocking set is introduced. As a result of ourinvestigation, many new asymptotic and finite upper bounds onthe length function of covering codes and on the smallest sizesof saturating sets, are also obtained.

We show that the boomerang uniformity of an odd APN function is given by the maximum of the entries (except for the first row/column) of the function's $ (-1) $-Difference Distribution Table. In fact, the boomerang uniformity of an odd permutation APN function equals its $ (-1) $-differential uniformity. We then use this connection to easily compute the boomerang uniformity of several odd APN functions. In the second part we give two classes of differentially low-uniform functions obtained by modifying the inverse function. The first class of permutations (CCZ-inequivalent to the inverse) over a finite field $ \\mathbb F_{p^n} $ ($ p $, an odd prime) is obtained from the composition of the inverse function with an order-$ 3 $ cycle permutation, with differential uniformity $ 3 $ if $ p = 3 $ and $ n $ is odd; $ 5 $ if $ p = 13 $ and $ n $ is even; and $ 4 $ otherwise. The second class is a family of binomials and we show that their differential uniformity equals $ 4 $. Finally, we extend to odd characteristic a result of Charpin and Kyureghyan (2010) providing an upper bound for the differential uniformity of the function and its switched version via a trace function.",

The number of different such codes is very large and the classification, enumeration and description of all perfect 1-error correcting codes is still an open problem. This survey paper is devoted to the rather many recent results, that have appeared during the last ten years, on perfect 1-error correcting binary codes. The following topics are considered: Constructions, connections with tilings of groups and with Steiner Triple Systems, enumeration, classification by rank and kernel dimension and by linear equivalence, reconstructions, isometric properties and the automorphism group of perfect codes.",

    "abstract": "Thirty years ago, Rothaus introduced the notion of bent function andpresented a secondary construction (building new bent functions fromalready defined ones), which is now called the Rothausconstruction. This construction has a strict requirement for itsinitial functions. In this paper, we first concentrate on the designof the initial functions in the Rothaus construction. We show how toconstruct Maiorana-McFarland's (M-M) bent functions, which can then be used as initial functions, from Boolean permutations and orthomorphic permutations. We deduce that at least $(2^n!\\times 2^{2^n})(2^{2^n}\\times2^{2^{n-1}})^2$bent functions in $2n+2$ variables can be constructed by usingRothaus' construction. In the second part of the note, we present anew secondary construction of bent functions which generalizes theRothaus construction. This construction requires initial functionswith stronger conditions; we give examples of functions satisfyingthem. Further, we generalize the new secondary construction of bentfunctions and illustrate it with examples.",

We give a minimum-distance decoding algorithm which requires $\\mathcal{O}((n-k)k^3)$ operations over an extension field $\\mathbb F_{q^k}$. Our algorithm is more efficient than the previous ones in the literature, when the dimension $k$ of the codewords is small with respect to $n$.

    "abstract": "In a threshold scheme, the sensitivity of the secret as well as the number of players may fluctuate due to various reasons, e.g., mutual trust may vary or the structure of the players' organization might be changed. A possible solution to this problem is to modify the threshold and/or change the secret. Moreover, a common problem with almost all secret sharing schemes is that they are 'one-time', meaning that the secret and shares are known to everyone after a public secret recovery process. This problem could be resolved if the dealer shares various secrets at the beginning, but a better solution is to dynamically generate new secrets in the absence of the dealer. These issues are our main motivation to revisit dynamic threshold schemes. Therefore, we first provide the first comprehensive study of threshold modification techniques in both the passive and active adversary models. We first review an existing method for threshold modificationbased on resharing shares of a secret; this method is secure in the setting of a passive adversarialcoalition. We then discuss two methods, termed public evaluation (for thresholdreduction) and zero addition (for threshold increase) that can be used in both the passive andactive adversarial setting. In the case of an active adversary, the techniques makeuse of verifiable secret sharing schemes, whereas the schemes considered in the passiveadversary model are all based on the Shamir scheme.As an application, we discuss how the threshold and the secret can be changed multiple timesto arbitrary values after the scheme's initialization.",

In most of the cases, PSI allows two parties to securely determine the intersection of their private input sets, and no other information.

The security of our scheme is achieved in the standard model under the Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption against semi-honest adversaries. Our scheme is flexible in the sense that set size of one participant is independent from that of the others. We consider the number of modular exponentiations in order to determine computational complexity.

As far as we are aware of, there is no other MPSI so far where individual computational cost of each participant is independent of the number of participants.

In a $w$-anonymous membership broadcast scheme no coalition of up to $w$ receivers, not containing the selected receiver, is able to determine any information about the identity of the selected receiver. We present two new constructions of $w$-anonymous membership broadcast schemes. The first construction is based on error-correcting codes and we show that there exist schemes that allow a flexible choice of $w$ while keeping the plexities for broadcast communication, user storage and required randomness polynomial in log $n$. The second construction is based on the concept of collision-free arrays, which is introduced in this paper. The construction results in more flexible schemes, allowing trade-offs between different complexities.",

In an earlier work, 2006, we considered a different improvement, based on the observation that the decoding algorithm corrects an error vector based not so much on the weight of the vector but rather the ''footprint'' of the error locations. In both cases one can find minimal sets of parity checks defining the codes by means of the order function. In this paper we show that these minimalsets have a very useful closure property. For several important families of codes that we consider, this property allows us to construct a generating matrix for the code that has properties amenable to encoding. The generating matrix can be constructed by evaluating monomials in a set which also has the closure property.",

These classes are mostly defined with respect to linear isometry, but it is well known that there is also the more general definition of semilinear isometry taking the field automorphisms into account. This notion leads to bigger classes so the data becomes smaller. Hence we describe an algorithm that gives canonical representatives of these bigger classes by calculating a unique generator matrix to a given linear code, in a well defined manner. &nbsp; &nbsp The algorithm is based on the partitioning and refinement idea which is also used to calculate the canonical labeling of a graph [12] and it similarly returns the automorphism group of the given linear code. The time needed by the implementation of the algorithm is comparable to Leon's program [10] for the calculation of the linear automorphism group of a linear code, but it additionally provides a unique representative and the automorphism group with respect to the more general notion of semilinear equivalence. The program can be used online under http://www.algorithm.uni-bayreuth.de/en/research/Coding_Theory/CanonicalForm/index.html.",

A combinatorial batch code with parameters $n,k,m,t$ means that $n$ items are stored on $m$ servers such that any $k$ different items can be retrieved by reading out at most $t$ items from each server. If $t=1$, this can equivalently be represented with a family $\\mathcal F$ of $n$ not necessarily distinct sets over an $m$-element underlying set, such that the union of any $i$ members of $\\mathcal F$ has cardinality at least $i$, for every $1\\le i\\le k$.

This class of codes is known to contain many codes with good parameters. Although constacyclic codes and QT codes have been the subject of numerous studies and computer searches over the last few decades, we have been able to discover a new fundamental result about the structure of constacyclic codes which was instrumental in our comprehensive search method for new QT codes over GF(7). We have been able to find 41 QT codes with better parameters than the previously best known linear codes.

In this paper we show that this can be done by incorporating a notion of multiplicities. As the original Power decoding, the proposed algorithm is a one-pass algorithm: decoding follows immediately from solving a shift-register type equation, which we show can be done in quasi-linear time.

It is natural toconsider for those problems the Graver basis associated to them which turns out tobe the minimal cycles of the matroid associated to the code, i.e. minimal supportcodewords in the binary case and its geometry. This provides us a universal test set for the programs considered.",

Consider $N_1 = p_1 q_1$ and $N_2 = p_2 q_2$, where $p_1, p_2, q_1, q_2$ are large primes. The primes $p_1, p_2$ are of same bit-size with the constraint that certain amount of Least Significant Bits (LSBs) of $p_1, p_2$ are same. Further the primes $q_1, q_2$ are of same bit-size without any constraint. May and Ritzenhofen proposed a strategy to factorize both $N_1, N_2$ in poly$(\\log N)$ time ($N$ is an integer with same bit-size as $N_1, N_2$) with the implicit information that $p_1, p_2$ share certain amount of LSBs. We explore the same problem with a different lattice-based strategy. In a general framework, our method works when implicit information is available related to Least Significant as well as Most Significant Bits (MSBs). Given $q_1, q_2 \\approx$Nα, we show that one can factor $N_1, N_2$ simultaneously in poly$(\\log N)$ time (under some assumption related to Gröbner Basis) when $p_1, p_2$ share certain amount of MSBs and/or LSBs. We also study the case when $p_1, p_2$ share some bits in the middle. Our strategy presents new and encouraging results in this direction. Moreover, some of the observations by May and Ritzenhofen get improved when we apply our ideas for the LSB case.",

If $C$ is a linear $[n,k,d]_4$-code, then $S(C)$ is an additive $(2n,2^{2k},2d)_4$-code. If $C$ is an additive cyclic code then $S(C)$ is an additive quasi-cyclic code of index $2$. Moreover, if $C$ is a module $\\theta$-cyclic code, a recently introduced type of code which will be explained below, then $S(C)$ is equivalent to an additive cyclic code if $n$ is odd and to an additive quasi-cyclic code of index $2$ if $n$ is even. Given any $(n,M,d)_4$-code $C$, the code $S(C)$ is self-orthogonal under the trace Hermitian inner product. Since the mapping $S$ preserves nestedness, it can be used as a tool in constructing additive asymmetric quantum codes.",

They showed that this bound was sharp in the case $ q=2 $, and in the case $ k=2 $. They conjectured that the bound is sharp for every prime power $ q $ and every positive integer $ k $. In this work quickly establish the truth of this conjecture. We provide two proofs, each employing different construction techniques. The first relies on the geometric view of linear codes as systems of projective points. The second approach is purely algebraic.

We give (1) a polynomial-time algorithm for finding smallsolutions of polynomial equations modulo ideals over algebraic numberfields, (2) a faster variant of the Guruswami-Sudan algorithm for listdecoding of Reed-Solomon codes, and (3) an algorithm for list decoding ofalgebraic-geometric codes that handles both single-point and multi-pointcodes.

To prevent this attack, we provide an implementation of a constant time algorithm for the decoding of BCH codes.

    "abstract": "Using a method for constructing binary self-dual codes having an automorphism of odd prime order $p$ we classify, up to equivalence, all singly-even self-dual $[78,39,14]$, $[80,40,14]$, $[82,41,14],$ and $[84,42,14]$ codes as well as all doubly-even $[80,40,16]$ codes for $p=13$. The results show that there are exactly 1592 inequivalent binary self-dual $[78,39,14]$ codes with an automorphism of type $13-(6,0)$ and we found 6 new values of the parameter in the weight function thus increasing more than twice the number of known values. As for binary $[80,40]$ self-dual codes with an automorphism of type $13-(6,2)$ there are 162696 singly-even self-dual codes with minimum distance 14 and 195 doubly-even such codes with minimum distance 16. We also construct many new codes of lengths 82 and 84 with minimum distance 14. Most of the constructed codes for all lengths have weight enumerators for which the existence was not known before.",

In this paper, we consider more generally the codes associated with functions that have differential uniformity at least $ 4 $. We emphasize, for such a function $ F $, the role of codewords of weight $ 3 $ and $ 4 $ and of some cosets of its associated code $ C_F $. We give some properties on codes associated with differential uniformity exactly $ 4 $. We obtain lower bounds and upper bounds for the numbers of codewords of weight less than $ 5 $ of the codes $ C_F $. We show that the nonlinearity of $ F $ decreases when these numbers increase. We obtain a precise expression to compute these numbers, when $ F $ is a plateaued or a differentially two-valued function. As an application, we propose a method to construct differentially $ 4 $-uniform functions, with a large number of $ 2 $-to-$ 1 $ derivatives, from APN functions.",

In contrast to previous work on the subject, it is not assumed that the ideal in question is principal. In particular, it is shown that the corresponding inverse norm sum depends not only on the regulator and discriminant of the number field, but also on the values of the ideal class Dedekind zeta functions. Along the way, we derive an estimate of the number of elements in a given ideal with a certain algebraic norm within a finite hypercube. We provide several examples which measure the accuracy and predictive ability of our theorems.",

In order to measure the quality of an MCF code, we use a natural extension of the notion of density for ordinary covering codes, that is the $\\mu$-density for MCF codes; a generalization of the length function for linear covering codes is also introduced. Our main results consist in a number of upper bounds on such a length function, obtained through explicit constructions, especially for the case of covering radius $R=2$. Akey tool is the possibility of computing the $\\mu$-length function in terms of Projective Geometry over finite fields. In fact, linear $(R,\\mu )$-MCF codes withparameters $ [n,n-r,d]_{q}R$ have a geometrical counterpart consisting of special subsets of $n$ points in the projective space $PG(n-r-1,q)$. We introduce such objects under the name of $(\\rho,\\mu)$-saturating sets and we provide a number of example and existence results.Finally, Almost Perfect MCF (APMCF) codes, that is codes for which each word at distance $R$ from the code belongs to {exactly}$\\mu $ spheres centered in codewords, are considered and their connections withuniformly packed codes, two-weight codes, and subgroups ofSinger groups are pointed out.",

The hidden weighted bit function (HWBF), introduced by Bryant in 1991, seems to be the simplest function with exponential BDD size. In [28], Wang et al. investigated the cryptographic properties of the HWBF and found that it is a very good candidate for being used in real ciphers. In this paper, we modify the HWBF and construct two classes of functions with very good cryptographic properties (better than the HWBF). The new functions are balanced, with almost optimum algebraic degree and satisfy the strict avalanche criterion. Their nonlinearity is higher than that of the HWBF. We investigate their algebraic immunity, BDD size and their resistance against fast algebraic attacks, which seem to be better than those of the HWBF too. The new functions are simple, can be implemented efficiently, have high BDD sizes and rather good cryptographic properties. Therefore, they might be excellent candidates for constructions of real-life ciphers.",

First, we compute the weight enumerators of several ensembles of such codes, establishing conditions under which they attain the Gilbert-Varshamov bound and deriving estimates of their distance. In particular, we show that this bound is attained by codes constructed on a fixed bipartite graph with a large spectral gap.We also suggest a new decoding algorithm of hypergraph codes that corrects a constant fraction of errors, improving upon the algorithm of Bilu and Hoory.",

In this article we continue research on connections between bent functions and partial difference sets respectively strongly regular graphs. For the first time we investigate relations between vectorial bent functions and partial difference sets. Remarkably, properties of the set of the duals of the components play here an important role. Seeing conventional bent functions as 1-dimensional vectorial bent functions, some earlier results on strongly regular graphs from bent functions follow from our more general results.

Since the famous Welch bound is a lower bound on $I_{\\max}(\\mathcal{C})$, it is desired to construct codebooks meeting the Welch bound strictly or asymptotically. Recently, N. Y. Yu presents a method for constructing codebooks associated with a binary sequence from a $\\Phi$-transform matrix. Using this method, he discovers new classes of codebooks with nontrivial bounds on the maximum inner products from Fourier and Hadamard matrices. We construct more near optimal codebooks by Yu's idea. We first provide more choices of binary sequences. We also show more choices of the $\\Phi$-transform matrices.

Protocols conforming to our model can be highly efficient, since they do not require the resource-intensive modular exponentiations of the Diffie--Hellman protocol. We also introduce a protocol, called FORSAKES, and prove rigorously that it is a forward-secure AKE protocol in our model. FORSAKES is a very efficient protocol, and can be implemented by merely using hash functions.",

    "abstract": "Trapping sets significantly influence the performance of low-density parity-check codes. An $ (a, b) $ elementary trapping set (ETS) causes high decoding failure rate and exert a strong influence on the error floor of the code, where $ a $ and $ b $ denote the size and the number of unsatisfied check-nodes in the ETS, respectively. The smallest size of an ETS in $ (3, n) $-regular LDPC codes with girth 6 is 4. In this paper, we provide sufficient conditions to construct fully connected $ (3, n) $-regular algebraic-based QC-LDPC codes with girth 6 whose Tanner graphs are free of $ (a, b) $ ETSs with $ a\\leq5 $ and $ b\\leq2 $. We apply these sufficient conditions to the exponent matrix of a new algebraic-based QC-LDPC code with girth at least 6. As a result, we obtain the maximum size of a submatrix of the exponent matrix which satisfies the sufficient conditions and yields a Tanner graph free of those ETSs with small size. Some algebraic-based QC-LDPC code constructions with girth 6 in the literature are special cases of our construction. Our experimental results show that removing ETSs with small size contribute to have better performance curves in the error floor region.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we are interested in the construction of maximumdistance separable (MDS) self-dual codes over large prime fields that arise fromthe solutions of systems of diophantine equations. Using this method we con-struct many self-dualMDS (or near-MDS) codes of lengths up to 16 over variousprime fields $GF(p)$, where $p$ = 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 53, 61, 73,89, 97, 101, 109, 113, 137, 149, 157, 173, 181, 193 and 197. In addition, a numberof optimal codes are presented for many lengths up to 40 over small prime fields$GF(p)$. Furthermore, our results on the minimum weight of self-dual codes overprime fields give a better bound than the Pless-Pierce bound obtained from amodified Gilbert-Varshamov bound.",

We focus on two approaches. In the first approach, the goal is to minimize the number of keys per participant.An almost complete answer is presented. The second approach is to minimize the total number of keys that are needed in the network.The number of communication paths that are needed to guarantee secure communication becomes a relevant parameter. Our security relies on the random oracle model.",

This is a generalization of an earlier method proposed by Tonchev for constructing self-orthogonal codes from orbit matrices of $2$-designs with a fixed-point-free automorphism of prime order. As an illustration of our method we provide a classification of self-orthogonal codes obtained from the non-fixed parts of the orbit matrices of the symmetric $2$-$(56,11,2)$ designs, some symmetric designs $2$-$(71,15,3)$ (and their residual designs), and some non-symmetric $2$-designs, namely those with parameters $2$-$(15,3,1)$, $2$-$(25,4,1)$, $2$-$(37,4,1)$, and $2$-$(45,5,1)$, respectively with automorphisms of order $p$, where $p$ is an odd prime. We establish that the codes with parameters $[10,4,6]_3$ and $[11,4,6]_3$are optimal two-weight codes. Further, we construct an optimal binary self-orthogonal $[16,5,8]$ code from the non-fixed part of the orbit matrix of the $2$-$(64,8,1)$ design with respect to an automorphism group of order four.",

The size of the arrays is commensurate with the length of the underlying perfect sequences. For a given size we can construct an exponential number of inequivalent perfect arrays. For each perfect array we construct a family of arrays whose pairwise cross-correlation values are almost all zero (large zero correlation zones (ZCZ)).

Domingo-Ferrer et al. focus on using a peer-to-peer community to construct a UPIR scheme, which we term P2P UPIR. In this paper, we establish a strengthened model for P2P UPIR and clarify the privacy goals of such schemes using standard terminology from the field of privacy research. In particular, we argue that any solution providing privacy against the database should attempt to minimize any corresponding loss of privacy against other users. We give an analysis of existing schemes, including a new attack by the database. Finally, we introduce and analyze two new protocols. Whereas previous work focuses on a special type of combinatorial design known as a configuration, our protocols make use of more general designs. This allows for flexibility in protocol set-up, allowing for a choice between having a dynamic scheme (in which users are permitted to enter and leave the system), or providing increased privacy against other users.",

    "abstract": "Order domains are a class of commutative rings introduced byHøholdt, van Lint, and Pellikaan to simplify the theory of error control codes using ideas from algebraic geometry. The definition is largely motivated by the structures utilized in the Berlekamp-Massey-Sakata (BMS) decoding algorithm, with Feng-Rao majority voting for unknown syndromes, applied to one-point geometric Goppa codes constructed from curves. However, orderdomains are much more general, and O'Sullivan has shown that the BMS algorithm can be used to decode codes constructed from order domains by a suitable generalization of Goppa's construction for curves. In this article we will first discuss the connection between order domains and valuations on functionfields over a finite field. Under some mild conditions, we will see that a general projective variety over a finite field has projective models which can be used to construct order domains and Goppa-type codes for which the BMS algorithm is applicable. We will then give a slightly different interpretation of Geil and Pellikaan's extrinsic characterization of order domains via the theory of Gröbner bases, and show that their results are related to the existence of toric deformations of varieties. To illustrate the potential usefulness of these observations, we present a series of new explicit examples of order domainsassociated to varieties with many rational points over finite fields: Hermitian hypersurfaces, Deligne-Lusztig varieties, Grassmannians, and flag varieties.",

The consequence is that such groups are avoided. In the past, there have been proposals for cryptography based on cyclic infrastructures. We will show that the Pohlig-Hellman method can be adapted to certain cyclic infrastructures, which similarly implies that certain infrastructures should not be used for cryptography. This generalizes a result by M\\\"uller, Vanstone and Zuccherato for infrastructures obtained from hyperelliptic function fields. We recall the Pohlig-Hellman method, define the concept of a cyclic infrastructure and briefly describe how to obtain such infrastructures from certain function fields of unit rank one. Then, we describe how to obtain cyclic groups from discrete cyclic infrastructures and how to apply the Pohlig-Hellman method to compute absolute distances, which is in general a computationally hard problem for cyclic infrastructures. Moreover, we give an algorithm which allows to test whether an infrastructure satisfies certain requirements needed for applying the Pohlig-Hellman method, and discuss whether the Pohlig-Hellman method is applicable in infrastructures obtained from number fields. Finally, we discuss how this influences cryptography based on cyclic infrastructures.",

The scheme can be used as a (not necessarily polynomial-time) list decoder as well as a polynomial-time probabilistic unique decoder. Both interpretations allow to decode interleaved subspace codes beyond half the minimum subspace distance. Both schemes can decode $\\gamma $ insertions and $\\delta $ deletions up to $\\gamma +L\\delta \\leq L({{n}_{t}}-k)$, where ${{n}_{t}}$ is the dimension of the transmitted subspace and $k$ is the number of data symbols from the field ${{\\mathbb{F}}_{{{q}^{m}}}}$.

Both schemes use properties of minimal Gröebner bases for the interpolation module that allow predicting the worst-case list size right after the interpolation step. An efficient procedure for constructing the required minimal Gröebner basis using the general Kötter interpolation is presented. A computationally- and memory-efficient root-finding algorithm for the probabilistic unique decoder is proposed. The overall complexity of the decoding algorithm is at most $\\mathcal{O}\\left( {{L}^{2}}n_{r}^{2} \\right)$ operations in ${{\\mathbb{F}}_{{{q}^{m}}}}$ where ${{n}_{r}}$ is the dimension of the received subspace and $L$ is the interleaving order.

Montgomery's simultaneous modular inversion can also be used to speed up Pollard rho when running many walks in parallel. We generalize these ideas and exploit the fact that for any two elliptic curve points X and Y, we can efficiently get X-Y when we compute X+Y. We apply these ideas to speed up the baby-step giant-step algorithm. Compared to the previous methods, the new methods can achieve a significant speedup for computing elliptic curve discrete logarithms in small groups or small intervals.Another contribution of our paper is to give an analysis of the average-case running time of Bernstein and Lange's 'grumpy giants and a baby' algorithm, and also to consider this algorithm in the case of groups with efficient inversion.Our conclusion is that, in the fully-optimised context, both the interleaved BSGS and grumpy-giants algorithms have superior average-case running time compared with Pollard rho. Furthermore, for the discrete logarithm problem in an interval, the interleaved BSGS algorithm is considerably faster than the Pollard kangaroo or Gaudry-Schost methods.",

    "abstract": "<p style='text-indent:20px;'>When Kevin Ashton proposed the catchword 'Internet of Things' in 1999, little did he know that technology will become an indispensable part of human lives in just two decades. In short, the Internet of Things (IoT), is a catch-all terminology used to describe devices connected to the internet. These devices can share and receive data as well as provide instructions over a network. By design itself, the IoT system requires multicasting data and information to a set of designated devices, securely. Taking everything into account, Broadcast Encryption (BE) seems to be the natural choice to address the problem. BE allows an originator to broadcast ciphertexts to a big group of receivers in a well-organized and competent way, while ensuring that only designated people can decrypt the data. In this work, we put forward the first Identity-Based Broadcast Encryption scheme based on multivariate polynomials that achieves post-quantum security. Multivariate public key cryptosystems (MPKC), touted as one of the most promising post-quantum cryptography candidates, forms the foundation on which our scheme relies upon, which allows it to be very cost-effective and faster when implemented. In addition, it also provides resistance to collusion attack, and as a consequence our scheme can be utilized to form an efficient and robust IoT system.",

The key-insulated security provides a promising approach to deal with this threat since it can effectively mitigate the damage caused by the secret key exposure. To eliminate the cumbersome certificate management in traditional PKI-supported key-insulated signature while overcoming the key escrow problem in identity-based key-insulated signature, two certificateless key-insulated signature schemes without random oracles have been proposed so far. However, both of them suffer from some security drawbacks and do not achieve existential unforgeability. In this paper, we propose a new certificateless strong key-insulated signature scheme that is proven secure in the standard model. Compared with the previous certificateless strong proxy signature scheme, the proposed scheme offers stronger security and enjoys higher computational efficiency and shorter public parameters.",

Wiener and Zuccherato and Gallant, Lambert and Vanstone showed that one can accelerate the Pollard rho algorithmfor the discrete logarithm problem on Koblitz curves. This implies that when using Koblitz curves,one has a lower security per bit than when using general elliptic curves defined over the same field.Hence for a fixed security level, systems using Koblitz curves require slightly more bandwidth. We present a method to reduce this bandwidth when a normal basisrepresentation for $\\mathbb F$2n is used. Our method is appropriate forapplications such as Diffie-Hellman key exchange or Elgamalencryption. We show that, with a low probability of failure, ourmethod gives the expected bandwidth for a given security level.",

The bijectivity of any encryption function is guaranteed by the use of invertible layers or by the Feistel structure. In this work a new family of ciphers, called wave ciphers, is introduced. In wave ciphers, round functions feature wave functions, which are vectorial Boolean functions obtained as the composition of non-invertible layers, where the confusion layer enlarges the message which returns to its original size after the diffusion layer is applied. Efficient decryption is guaranteed by the use of wave functions in FNs. It is shown how to avoid that the group generated by the round functions acts imprimitively, a serious flaw for the cipher. The primitivity is a consequence of a more general result, which reduce the problem of proving that a given FN generates a primitive group to proving that an SPN, directly related to the given FN, generates a primitive group. Finally, a concrete instance of real-world size wave cipher is proposed as an example, and its resistance against differential and linear cryptanalyses is also established.",

Plateaued functions bringtogether various nonlinear characteristics and include twoimportant classes of Boolean functions defined in even dimension: the well-known bent functions ($0$-plateaued functions) and the semi-bent functions ($2$-plateaued functions). Bent functions have been extensively investigated since 1976. Very recently, the study of semi-bent functions has attracted a lot of attention in symmetric cryptography. Many intensive progresses in the design of such functions have been made especially in recent years.The paper is devoted to the construction of semi-bent functions on the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ ($n=2m$) in the line of a recent work of S. Mesnager [IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, Vol 57, No 11, 2011]. We extend Mesnager's results and present a new construction of infinite classes of binary semi-bent functions in polynomial trace. The extension is achieved by inserting mappings $h$ on $\\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ which can be expressed as $h(0) = 0$ and $h(uy) = h_1(u)h_2(y)$ with $u$ ranging over the circle $U$ of unity of $\\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$, $y \\in \\mathbb{F}_{2^m}^{*}$ and $uy \\in \\mathbb{F}_{2^n}^{*}$, where $h_1$ is a isomorphism on $U$ and $h_2$ is an arbitrary mapping on $\\mathbb{F}_{2^m}^{*}$.

In this paper, we start to investigate in more detail different families of non-abelian groups with respect to the entropic vectors they yield. In particular, we address the question of whether a given non-abelian group $G$ and some fixed subgroups $G_1,\\ldots,G_n$ end up giving the same entropic vector as some abelian group $A$ with subgroups $A_1,\\ldots,A_n$, in which case we say that$(A, A_1, \\ldots, A_n)$ represents $(G, G_1, \\ldots, G_n)$. If for any choice of subgroups $G_1,\\ldots,G_n$, there exists some abelian group $A$ which represents $G$, we refer to $G$ as being abelian (group) representable for $n$. We completely characterize dihedral, quasi-dihedral and dicyclic groups with respect to their abelian representability, as well as the case when $n=2$, for which we show a group is abelian representable if and only if it is nilpotent.

It is shown that the complexity of solving the underlying problem for the proposed system is dominated by the complexity of solving a fixed number of discrete logarithm problems in the group of an elliptic curve. Using an adapted Pollard rho algorithm it is shown that this problem is essentially as hard as solving one discrete logarithm problem in the group of an elliptic curve. Hence, the CFVZ cryptosystem has no advantages over traditional elliptic curve cryptography and should not be used in practice.",

Firstly, an efficient method to construct OA$ (pq, q, p, 1) $ is presented via solving a linear equation system. Secondly, we propose some schemes to construct more $ q $-variable 1-resilient RSFs by modifying the $ l $-value support tables of the known $ q $-variable 1-resilient RSFs.

Operations over such elliptic curves require arithmetic over the underlying field. In particular, fast implementations of multiplication and squaring over the finite field are required for performing efficient elliptic curve cryptography. The present work considers the problem of obtaining efficient algorithms for field multiplication and squaring. From a theoretical point of view, we present a number of algorithms for multiplication/squaring and reduction which are appropriate for different settings. Our algorithms collect together and generalize ideas which are scattered across various papers and codes. At the same time, we also introduce new ideas to improve upon existing works. A key theoretical feature of our work is that we provide formal statements and detailed proofs of correctness of the different reduction algorithms that we describe. On the implementation aspect, a total of fourteen primes are considered, covering all previously proposed cryptographically relevant (pseudo-)Mersenne prime order fields at various security levels. For each of these fields, we provide 64-bit assembly implementations of the relevant multiplication and squaring algorithms targeted towards two different modern Intel architectures. We were able to find previous 64-bit implementations for six of the fourteen primes considered in this work. On the Haswell and Skylake processors of Intel, for all the six primes where previous implementations are available, our implementations outperform such previous implementations.&lt;/p&gt;",

As APN $(n,n)$-functions, these functions offer the best resistance against differential cryptanalysis and they can be used as substitution boxes in block ciphers with a Feistel structure. Constructing such functions is assumed to be as difficult as constructing APN $(n,n)$-functions. A function in our family of functions can be viewed as the concatenation of two APN $(n-1,n-1)$-functions satisfying some necessary conditions. Then, we study the special case of this construction in which the two APN functions differ by an affine function. Within this construction, we propose a family in which one of the APN functions is a Gold function which gives the quadratic differentially 4-uniform $(n,n-1)$-function $(x,x_n)\\mapsto x^{2^i+1}+x_n x$ where $x\\in \\mathbb{F}_{2^{n-1}}$ and $x_n\\in \\mathbb{F}_2$ with $\\gcd(i,n-1)=1$. We study the nonlinearity of this function in the case $i=1$ because in this case we can use results from Carlitz which are unknown in the general case. We also give the Walsh spectrum of this function and prove that it is CCZ-inequivalent to functions of the form $L \\circ F$ where $L$ is an affine surjective $(n,n-1)$-function and $F$ is a known APN $(n,n)$-function for $n\\leq 8$, or the Inverse APN $(n,n)$-function for every $n\\geq 5$ odd, or any AB $(n,n)$-function for every $n>3$ odd, or any Gold APN $(n,n)$-function for every $n>4$ even.",

Unlike existing lattice-reduction aided decoding techniques, algebraic reduction exploits the multiplicative structure of the code. Its principle is to absorb part of the channel into the code, by approximating the channel matrix with a unit of the maximal order of the corresponding algebra. In the case of $2 \\times 2$ space-time codes, we propose a low-complexity algorithm to approximate a channel with a unit, and apply it to the Golden Code. Simulation results for the Golden Code evidence that algebraic reduction has the same performance of LLL reduction but significantly lower complexity. We also show that for MIMO systems with $n$ receive and $n$ transmit antennas, algebraic reduction attains the receive diversity when followed by a simple ZF detection.

However, these matchings in general are not straightforward and because of the fact that the reverse of the codewords ($k$-mers) need to exist in the code, the matching problem is difficult and it is referred to as the reversibility problem. Here, $8$-mers (DNA 8-bases) are matched with the ring elements of $R_{16}=F_{16}+uF_{16}+vF_{16}+uvF_{16}.$ Furthermore, cyclic codes over the ring $R_{16}$ where the multiplication is taken to be noncommutative with respect to an automorphism $\\theta$ are studied.

We focus on characterizing matrix codes that are both efficient (have high rate) and effective at error correction (have high minimum rank-distance). It is well known that the inherent trade-off between dimension and minimum distance for a matrix code is reversed for its dual code; specifically, if a matrix code has high dimension and low minimum distance, then its dual code will have low dimension and high minimum distance. With an aim towards finding codes with a perfectly balanced trade-off, we study self-dual matrix codes.

    "abstract": "We call a subset $C$ of vertices of a graph $G$ a $(1,\\leq l)$-identifying code if for all subsets $X$ of vertices with size at most $\\ell$, the sets $\\{c\\in C~|~\\exists u\\in X, d(u,c)\\leq 1\\}$ are distinct. The concept of identifying codes was introduced in 1998 by Karpovsky, Chakrabarty and Levitin. Identifying codes have been studied in various grids. In particular, it has been shown that there exists a $(1,\\leq 2)$-identifying code in the king grid with density $\\frac{3}{7}$ and that there are no such identifying codes with density smaller than $\\frac{5}{12}$. Using a suitable frame and a discharging procedure, we improve the lower bound by showing that any $(1,\\leq 2)$-identifying code of the king grid has density at least $\\frac{47}{111}$. This reduces the gap between the best known lower and upper bounds on this problem by more than $56\\%$.",

We point out that their intersections pattern with lines is related to the weight distribution of the considered linear set $ L $.

By choosing $ L $ to be an $ {\\mathbb F}_{q} $-linear set with a short weight distribution, then the associated codes have few weights.

In contrast, IPP codes do not have an efficient decoding algorithm in the general case. Other codes that have been widely studied but possess weaker identification capabilities are separating codes. It is a well-known result that a TA code is an IPP code, and an IPP code is a separating code. The converse is in generalfalse. However, it has been conjectured that for Reed-Solomoncodes all three properties are equivalent.

Aubry, McGuire and Rodier conjectured that the only exceptional APN functions are the Gold and the Kasami-Welch monomial functions. They established that a polynomial function of odd degree is not exceptional APN provided the degree is not a Gold number $(2^k+1)$ or a Kasami-Welch number $(2^{2k}-2^k+1)$. When the degree of the polynomial function is a Gold number or a Kasami-Welch number, several partial results have been obtained by several authors including us. In this article we address these exceptions. We almost prove the exceptional APN conjecture in the Gold degree case when $\\deg{(h(x))}$ is odd. We also show exactly when the corresponding multivariate polynomial $φ(x, y, z)$ is absolutely irreducible. Also, there is only one result known when $f(x)=x^{2^{k}+1} + h(x)$, and $\\deg(h(x))$ is even. Here, we extend this result as well, thus making progress in this case that seems more difficult.",

The objective of this paper is to extend a recent construction of binary LCD codes and self-orthogonal codes to the general $ p $-ary case, where $ p $ is an odd prime. Based on the extended construction, several classes of $ p $-ary linear codes are obtained. The characterizations of these linear codes to be LCD or self-orthogonal are derived. The duals of these linear codes are also studied. It turns out that the proposed linear codes are optimal in many cases in the sense that their parameters meet certain bounds on linear codes.

A sequence of subsequent works have developed and applied these methods to the multiple and the (extended) tower number field sieve algorithms. This line of work has led to new asymptotic complexities for various cases of the discrete logarithm problem over finite fields. The current work presents a unified polynomial selection method which we call Algorithm $ \\mathcal{D} $. Starting from the Barbulescu et al. paper, all the subsequent polynomial selection methods can be seen as special cases of Algorithm $ \\mathcal{D} $. Moreover, for the extended tower number field sieve (exTNFS) and the multiple extended TNFS (MexTNFS), there are finite fields for which using the polynomials selected by Algorithm $ \\mathcal{D} $ provides the best asymptotic complexity. Suppose $ Q = p^n $ for a prime $ p $ and further suppose that $ n = \\eta\\kappa $ such that there is a $ c_{\\theta}&gt;0 $ for which $ p^{\\eta} = L_Q(2/3, c_{\\theta}) $. For $ c_{\\theta}&gt;3.39 $, the complexity of exTNFS-$ \\mathcal{D} $ is lower than the complexities of all previous algorithms; for $ c_{\\theta}\\notin (0, 1.12)\\cup[1.45, 3.15] $, the complexity of MexTNFS-$ \\mathcal{D} $ is lower than that of all previous methods.",

The graphs are therefore stored in encrypted form.We study the link prediction problem on encrypted graphs.

We are especially interested in cryptographic problems, and we note that some of these problems need cover-free families with an increasing size $ n $. Solutions that propose the increase of $ n $, such as monotone families and nested families, have been recently considered in the literature. In this paper, we propose a generalization that we call embedding families, which allows us to increase both $ n $ and $ d $. We propose constructions of embedding families using polynomials over finite fields embedded via extension fields; we study how different parameter combinations can be used to prioritize increase of $ d $ or of the compression ratio as $ n $ grows. We also provide new constructions for monotone families with improved compression ratio. Finally, we show how to use embedded sequences of orthogonal arrays and packing arrays to build embedding families.",

We give a concrete analysis of this multi-step reduction. We find that the tightness gap in the reduction is so great as to vitiate any meaningful security guarantee, and we find reasons to doubt the feasibility in the foreseeable future of the quantum part of the reduction. In addition, when we make the reduction concrete it appears that the approximation factor in the SIVP problem is far larger than expected, a circumstance that causes the corresponding approximate-SIVP problem most likely not to be hard for proposed cryptosystem parameters.

    "abstract": "The generalized Hamming weights of linear codes have attracted scholars' attention since Wei used them to characterize the cryptography performance of a linear code over the wire-tap channel of type II in 1991. Generally speaking, it is hard to determine linear codes' generalized Hamming weights, especially the weight hierarchy. On the other hand, since Ding and Niederreiter presented a generic approach toconstruct linear codes with good properties by suitable defining sets in 2007, many linear codes with few weights have been obtained using cryptographic functions. However, there does not seem to be much research on the generalized Hamming weights of linear codes from cryptographic functions.In this paper, we first provide a general formula to compute the generalized Hamming weights of linear codes from the defining sets, which generalizes several known results. Next, some weight hierarchies of linear codes from three famous classes of Bent functions (the Maiorana-McFarland class, the class $ \\mathcal{PS}_{ap} $, the class $ H $) and two classes of Semi-Bent functions (the Maiorana-McFarland class, the summation of $ \\mathcal{PS}_{ap} $ and $ H $) are considered. We hope this paper can attract interested scholars to find more results about the generalized Hamming weights of linear codes from cryptographic functions.",

Specifically, we derive the duals of ACC codes by using a trace inner product and obtain the trace hull and its dimension. Also, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for an additive code to have a complementary dual (ACD). Additionally, we identify a necessary condition for an additive conjucyclic complementary pair of codes over $ \\mathbb{F}_4 $. Furthermore, we show that the trace code of an ACC code is cyclic and provide a condition for the trace code of an ACC code to be LCD.

Recently, Maitra et al. (Phys. Rev. A, 2017) identified that the B92 QKD-based QPQ scheme proposed by Yang et al. (Quant. Inf. Process., 2014) is vulnerable whenever the devices involved in that scheme are dubious and to improve the overall security, they suggested a semi-Device Independent (DI) proposal for that QPQ scheme by introducing a local test at the server's end. In this work, we overcome the limitation of the Maitra et al. proposal by removing trustworthiness from all the (involved) devices, and suggest a full DI proposal for the Yang et al. scheme, exploiting a proper self-testing mechanism of observables along with the local version of the tilted CHSH game. We compare the performance of our proposal with a recent full DI-QPQ scheme (arxiv 1901.03042) and discuss their relative advantages. Additionally, we present a DI proposal for a modified version of the Yang et al. scheme, enabling the client to retrieve maximum raw key bits during the oblivious key generation phase.

In this paper MDS-GC matrices over $ \\mathbb{F}_{2^k} $ are constructed which are involutory, Hadamard, circulant or orthogonal. The construction is based on using linearly related Vandermonde matrices. First, the construction of $ n\\times n $ circulant MDS-GC matrices over $ \\mathbb{F}_{2^k} $ is given for $ n $ a divisor of $ 2^k-1 $; and an $ n\\times n $ circulant MDS-GC matrix $ \\bf C $ and its inverse $ {\\bf C}^{-1} $ are used to obtain the $ n \\times 2n $ matrix $ {\\bf H} = ({\\bf C} \\| {\\bf C}^{-1}) $ with square nonsingular submatrices. A class of $ 2^m\\times 2^m $ orthogonal MDS-GC matrices over $ \\mathbb{F}_{2^k} $ is given subject to the divisibility of $ 2^k-1 $ by $ 2^m-1 $. These orthogonal MDS-GC matrices are used to construct a new class of multiple MDS matrices over $ \\mathbb{F}_{2^k} $ which have applications in the design of Feistel ciphers.

This provided $ (n,m) $-functions $ \\mathcal{F}_A $ as restrictions of $ \\mathcal{F} $. We showed that the nonlinearity of $ \\mathcal{F} $ must not be too large for allowing this, and we observed that if it was zero, then it was always possible. In this case, we showed that the nonlinearity of the restriction may be large. We then focused on the case $ M = N $ and $ \\mathcal{F} $ of the form $ \\psi(\\mathcal{G}(x)) $ where $ \\mathcal{G} $ was almost perfect nonlinear (APN) and $ \\psi $ was a linear function with a kernel of dimension 1. We observed that the problem of determining the D-property of APN $ (N-1,N) $-functions $ \\mathcal{G}_A $, where $ A $ was a hyperplane, was related to the problem of constructing APN $ (N-1,N-1) $-functions $ \\mathcal{F}_A $. For this reason, we introduce the strong D-property defined for $ (N,N) $-functions $ \\mathcal{G} $. We gave a characterization of this property for crooked functions and their compositional inverse (if it existed) by means of their ortho-derivatives, and we proved that the Gold APN function and its inverse in dimension $ N $ odd big enough both had the strong D-property. We also proved in simpler a way than Taniguchi in 2023 that the strong D-property of the Gold APN function holds for $ N $ even big enough. Then, we gave a partial result on the Dobbertin APN power function, and on the basis of this result, we conjectured that it has the strong D-property as well. We then moved our focus to two known infinite families of differentially 4-uniform $ (N-1,N-1) $-permutations constructed as the restrictions of $ (N,N) $-functions $ \\mathcal{F}(x) = \\psi(\\mathcal{G}(x)) $ or $ \\mathcal{F}(x) = \\psi(\\mathcal{G}(x))+x $ where $ \\psi $ was linear with a kernel of dimension 1 and $ \\mathcal{G} $ was an APN permutation. After a deeper investigation on these classes, we provided proofs (which were missing) that they are not APN in dimension $ n = N-1 $ even. Then, we presented our own construction by relaxing some hypotheses on $ \\psi $ and $ \\mathcal{G} $.",

This representation has many interesting and useful properties. In traditional number systems, there is one radix used to represent numbers. For example in decimal systems, numbers are expressed as sum of powers of 10. In DBNS numbers are represented as sum of product of powers of 2 radices. In the current article we present a scheme to represent numbers in double (and multi-) base format by combinatorial objects like graphs and diagraphs. The combinatorial representation leads to proof of some interesting results about the double and multibase representation of integers. These proofs are based on simple combinatorial arguments. In this article we have provided a graph theoretic proof of the recurrence relation satisfied by the number of double base representations of a given integer. The result has been further generalized to more than 2 bases. Also, we have uncovered some interesting properties of the sequence representing the number of double (multi-) base representation of a positive integer $n$. It is expected that the combinatorial representation can serve as a tool for a better understanding of the double (and multi-) base number systems and uncover some of the mysteries still associated with it.",

In addition, some $ 16\\times16 $ or $ 32\\times32 $ involutory MDS matrices with only $ 36 $ or $ 72 $ xor gates over $ \\mathbb{F}_2 $ are also proposed, which are better than previous results. Moreover, our method can be extended to general linear groups, and we prove that the lower bound of the sequential xor count based on words for $ 4 \\times 4 $ MDS matrix over general linear groups is $ 8n+2 $.",

In the proposed scheme, the running time of the private key extraction and decryption algorithms and the sizes of the user's initial private key and the ciphertext are independent on the total number of time periods, and any other performance parameter has at most log-squared complexity in terms of the total number of time periods.

    "abstract": "Communication over channels that may vary in an arbitrary and unknown manner from channel use to channel use is studied. Such channels fall in the framework of arbitrarily varying channels (AVCs), for which it has been shown that the classical deterministic approaches with pre-specified encoder and decoder fail if the AVC is symmetrizable. However, more sophisticated strategies such as common randomness (CR) assisted codes or list decoding are capable to resolve the ambiguity induced by symmetrizable AVCs. AVCs further serve as the indispensable basis for modeling adversarial attacks such as jamming in information theoretic security related communication problems. In this paper, we study the arbitrarily varying multiple access channel (AVMAC) with conferencing encoders, which models the communication scenario with two cooperating transmitters and one receiver. This can be motivated for example by cooperating base stations or access points in future systems. The capacity region of the AVMAC with conferencing encoders is established and it is shown that list decoding allows for reliable communication also for symmetrizable AVMACs. The list capacity region equals the CR-assisted capacity region for large enough list size. Finally, for fixed probability of decoding error the amount of resources, i.e., CR or list size, is quantified and shown to be finite.",

This high security comes at the cost of reducing the data injection rate to $ (n-s) $ bits per primitive invocation and restricting the query length up to $ (n-s)2^s $ bits, for a fixed counter size $ s $. Recently in ASIACRYPT'21, Chattopadhyay et al. have shown that $\\textsf{LightMAC}$ achieves the same security even when it is instantiated with a single keyed block cipher. However, it limits the length of a message to $ (n-s) \\min\\{2^{n/4}, 2^s\\} $ bits for a fixed counter size $ s $. In this paper, we propose $\\textsf{LightFORK}$, a forkcipher variant of $\\textsf{LightMAC}$ that achieves an improved query length independent security bound of the order of $ O(q^2/2^{n+s}) $, maintaining full $ n $ bit message injection per primitive call, where $ n $ and $ s $ denote the block size and tweak size of the forkcipher respectively. The maximum message length is also increased to $ n2^{n/6+s/2} $ bits. Our security proof is based on a new technique called resetting with delayed sampling, which is an extension of the reset-sampling technique of Chattopadhyay et al.",

    "abstract": "By a fundamental result by Mesnager et al. in 2018, a generalized bent function (originally defined as a class of functions from an $ n $-dimensional vector space $ \\mathbb{V}_n^{(p)} $ into a cyclic group), is a bent function $ g: \\mathbb{V}_n^{(p)}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}_p $ with a partition $ \\mathcal{P} $ of $ \\mathbb{V}_n^{(p)} $, such that for every function $ C $ which is constant on the sets of $ \\mathcal{P} $, the function $ g + C $ is bent. The set of these bent functions forms then an affine space of dimension $ |\\mathcal{P}| \\le p^{n/2} $. This characterization of generalized bent functions is much more comprehensive than any earlier description.In this article, we analyse some classes of bent functions under this perspective. As shown earlier, Maiorana-McFarland bent functions permit the largest possible partitions, giving rise to $ p^{n/2} $-dimensional affine bent function spaces. The reason behind is their characterization as the bent functions, which are affine restricted to the $ n/2 $-dimensional affine subspaces of a trivial cover of $ \\mathbb{V}_n^{(p)} $. We will show that maximal possible partitions can also be obtained for other classes of (regular) bent functions. Most notably, these classes are described as bent functions which are affine restricted to non-trivial covers of $ \\mathbb{V}_n^{(p)} $. We investigate (largest) partitions for other types of bent functions, including weakly regular and non-weakly respectively non-dual bent functions. We round off the article giving partitions for bent functions obtained from bent partitions, which includes the partial spread class, and partitions for Carlet's class $ \\mathcal{C} $ and $ \\mathcal{D} $.",

Its success, though, relies heavily on the enumerability of the rationals, and therefore it cannot be generalized over the reals in an obvious way.",

With these explicit equations at hand, it is now possible to concretely study the corresponding discrete logarithm problem (DLP); this is what we undertake in this paper.

    "abstract": "We investigate the security of $n$-bit to $m$-bit vectorial Boolean functions in stream ciphers. Such stream ciphers have higher throughput than those using single-bit output Boolean functions. However, as shown by Zhang and Chan at Crypto 2000, linear approximations based on composing the vector output with any Boolean functions have higher bias than those based onthe usual correlation attack. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for analyzing vector Boolean functions called generalized correlation analysis. It is based on approximate equations which are linear in the input $x$ but of freedegree in the output $z = F(x)$. The complexity for computing the generalized nonlinearity for this new attack is reduced from $2$2m×n+n to $2$2n. Based on experimental results, we show that the new generalized correlation attack gives linear approximation with much higher bias than the Zhang-Chan andusual correlation attack. We confirm this with a theoretical upper bound for generalized nonlinearity, which is much lower than for the unrestricted non-linearity (for Zhang-Chan's attack) and a fortiori for usual nonlinearity. We also prove a lower bound for generalized nonlinearity which allows us to construct vector Boolean functions with high generalized nonlinearity from bent and almost bent functions. We derive the generalized nonlinearity of some known secondary constructions for secure vector Boolean functions. Finally, we prove that if a vector Boolean function has high nonlinearity or even a highunrestricted nonlinearity, it cannot ensure that it will have high generalized nonlinearity.",

In other words, the cross-correlation function (CCF) between two arbitrary sequences which belong to different subsets has quite a large zero cross-correlation zone (ZCCZ). Analytical results demonstrate that the UA-ZCZ sequence set proposed herein is optimal with respect to the upper bound of ZCZ sequence set. Specifically, our scheme enables the flexible selection of ZCZ length, which makes it extremely valuable for designing spreading sequences for quasi-synchronous code-division multiple-access (QS-CDMA) systems.",

In 1996, Coppersmith showed that the RSA modulus $N = pq$ with balanced $p,q$ can be efficiently factored, if the high order $\\frac{1}{4} \\log_2 N$ bits of one prime factor is given. Later, this important result is also generalized to the factorization of RSA variants moduli such as $N = p^r q$ or $N = p_1 p_2 ··· p_n$. In 2000, Lim et al. proposed a new RSA variant with the modulus of the form $N = p^r q^s$, which is much faster in the decryption process than the standard RSA. Then from 2015 to 2018, in order to investigate the security property of this RSA variant, Lu et al. and Coron et al. have presented three works studying the polynomial-time factorization of $N = p^r q^s$ with partial known bits of $p^u q^v$ (or one of the prime factors $p,q$) for different choices of $u, v$. In this paper, we present a new lattice construction used for Coppersmith's method, and thus improve previous results. Namely, our result requires fewer known bits to recover the prime factors $p,q$. We also generalize our result to the factorization of $N = p_1^{r_1}p_2^{r_2}··· p_n^{r_n}$.",

Combinatorial repairable threshold schemes (or combinatorial RTS) were recently introduced by Stinson and Wei [8]. In these schemes, 'multiple shares' are distributed to each player, as defined by a suitable combinatorial design called the distribution design. In this paper, we study the reliability of these combinatorial repairable threshold schemes in a setting where players may not be available to take part in a repair of a given player's share. Using techniques from network reliability theory, we consider the probability of existence of an available repair set, as well as the expected number of available repair sets, for various types of distribution designs.",

Up to now, Boolean functions with optimal algebraic immunity have been built in several ways, but there are not many known results on their fast algebraic immunities. In this paper, we first derive a relation on the fast algebraic immunity between a Boolean functionfand it's modificationsf+s, which shows that iffhas low fast algebraic immunity and s has low algebraic immunity thenf+smay also have low fast algebraic immunity in general.

    "abstract": "The security of public-key systems is based on the difficulty of solving certain mathematical problems. With the possible emergence of large-scale quantum computers several of these problems, such as factoring and computing discrete logarithms, would be efficiently solved. Research on quantum-resistant public-key cryptography, also called post-quantum cryptography (PQC), has been productive in recent years. Public-key cryptosystems based on the problem of computing isogenies between supersingular elliptic curves appear to be good candidates for the next generation of public-key cryptography standards in the PQC scenario. In this work, motivated by a previous work by D. Moody and D. Shumow [17], we derived maps for elliptic curves represented in Jacobi Intersection and Twisted Hessian models. Our derivation follows a multiplicative strategy that contrasts with the additive idea presented in the Vélu formula. Finally, we present a comparison of computational cost to generate maps for isogenies of degree $ l $, where $ l = 2k + 1 $. In affine coordinates, our formulas require $ 46.8 \\% $ less computation than the Huff model and $ 48\\% $ less computation than the formulas given for the Extended Jacobi Quartic model when computing isogenies of degree $ 3 $.

Unlike the usual construction in code-based encryption schemes which has restrictions on the Hamming weight of the error introduced into the ciphertext, the $ {\\sf IKKR} $ approach allows error vectors of arbitrary weight being introduced into the ciphertext. Using this new approach, Ivanov et al. constructed two cryptosystems, namely the modified and the upgraded $ {\\sf IKKR} $-PKE. This paper aims to discuss the practical security of the $ {\\sf IKKR} $-PKE. In particular, we describe the weaknesses in the design of the public key used in the $ {\\sf IKKR} $-PKE. We exploit such weaknesses and propose two attacks to recover the plaintext in the $ {\\sf IKKR} $-PKE. The approach of our first attack is similar to the LCKN attack [12], whilst our second attack is more efficient than the LCKN attack. Our experimental results show that we can recover the plaintext from a given ciphertext in less than 176 milliseconds for schemes based on random Goppa codes and BCH codes.",

In the computational setting we give a generic construction using smooth projective hash functions for languages derived from perfectly-binding commitments. Further, we give two size-hiding constructions: the first one is theoretical and evidences the equivalence between PSI, oblivious transfer and the secure computation of the AND function. The second one is a twist on the oblivious polynomial evaluation construction of Freedman et al. from EUROCRYPT 2004. We further sketch a generalization of the latter using algebraic-geometric techniques. Finally, assuming again there is a set-up authority (yet not necessarily trusted) we present very simple and efficient constructions that only hide the size of the client's set.",

We introduce the existing 2-fold Forrelation formulation with bent duality-based promise problems as desirable instantiations. Next, we concentrate on the 3-fold version through two approaches. First, we judiciously set up some of the functions in 3-fold Forrelation so that given oracle access, one can sample from the Walsh Spectrum of <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"M1\">\\begin{document}$ f $\\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula>. Using this, we obtain improved results than what one can achieve by exploiting the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. In turn, it has implications in resiliency checking. Furthermore, we use a similar idea to obtain a technique in estimating the cross-correlation (and thus autocorrelation) value at any point, improving upon the existing algorithms. Finally, we tweak the quantum algorithm with the superposition of linear functions to obtain a cross-correlation sampling technique. This is the first cross-correlation sampling algorithm with constant query complexity to the best of our knowledge. This also provides a strategy to check if two functions are uncorrelated of degree <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"M2\">\\begin{document}$ m $\\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula>.

In analogy to the symbol probabilities, by introducing a constraint at a certain depth in the trellis we obtain symbol distributions and symbol moments, respectively. These moments are required for an efficient implementation of the discriminated belief propagation algorithm in [8], and can furthermore be utilized to compute conditional entropies in the trellis.The moment computation algorithm has the same asymptotic complexity as the BCJR algorithm.

    "abstract": "An $(n,N,k,m)$-combinatorial batch code (CBC) was defined by Paterson, Stinson and Wei as a purely combinatorial version of batch codes which were first proposed by Ishai, Kushilevitz, Ostrovsky and Sahai. It is a system consisting of $m$ subsets of an $n$-element set such that any $k$ distinct elements can be retrieved by reading at most one (or in general, $t$) elements from each subset and the number of total elements in $m$ subsets is $N$. For given parameters $n,k,m$, the goal is to determine the minimum $N$, denoted by $N(n,k,m)$.So far, for $k≥5$, $m+3≤ n&lt; \\binom{m}{k-2}$, precise values of $N(n,k,m)$ have not been established except for some special parameters. In this paper, we present a lower bound on $N(n,k,k+1)$, which is tight for some $n$ and $k$. Based on this lower bound, the monotonicity of optimal values of CBC and several constructions, we obtain $N(m+4,5,m)$, $N(m+4,6,m)$ and $N(m+3,7,m)$ in different ways.",

We show that NewHope and NewHope-Simple share very similar notion as DING12 in the sense that NewHope series also send small additional bits with small size (i.e. signal) to assist error reconciliation, where this idea was first practically proposed in DING12. We believe that DING12 is the first work that presented complete LWE & RLWE-based key exchange constructions. The idea of sending additional information in order to realize error reconciliation and key exchange in NewHope and NewHope-Simple remain the same as DING12, despite concrete approaches to compute signal and reconcile error are not the same.",

The celebrated Lenstra–Lenstra–Lovász reduction algorithm (so-called LLL) has been improved in many ways through the past decades and remains one of the central methods used for reducingintegrallattice basis. In particular, its floating-point variants---where the rational arithmetic required by Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization is replaced by floating-point arithmetic---are now the fastest known. However, the systematic study of the reduction theory ofrealquadratic forms or, more generally, of real lattices is not widely represented in the literature. When the problem arises, the lattice is usually replaced by an integral approximation of (a multiple of) the original lattice, which is then reduced. While practically useful and proven in some special cases, this method doesn&#39;t offer any guarantee of success in general. In this work, we present an adaptive-precision version of a generalized LLL algorithm that covers this case in all generality. In particular, we replace floating-point arithmetic by Interval Arithmetic to certify the behavior of the algorithm. We conclude by giving a typical application of the result in algebraic number theory for the reduction of ideal lattices in number fields.",

Therefore, it is critical for a locally repairable code to have multiple repair groups. In this paper we consider robust locally repairable coding schemes which guarantee that there exist multiple distinct (not necessarily disjoint) alternative local repair groups for any single failure such that the failed node can still be repaired locally even if some of the repair groups are not available. We use linear programming techniques to establish upper bounds on the size of these codes. We also provide two examples of robust locally repairable codes that are optimal regarding our linear programming bound. Furthermore, we address the update efficiency problem of the distributed data storage networks. Any modification on the stored data will result in updating the content of the storage nodes. Therefore, it is essential to minimise the number of nodes which need to be updated by any change in the stored data. We characterise the update-efficient storage code properties and establish the necessary conditions of existence update-efficient locally repairable storage codes.",

The basic concepts of spherical codes in tori layers are reviewed and two constructions are presented for the shape by exploiting the $ k/2 $-dimensional lattices $ D_{k/2} $ and $ A^{*}_{k/2} $ as its pre-image. A scalar quantizer is optimized for the gain by using the Lloyd-Max algorithm for a given rate. The computational complexity of the quantization process is dominated by the lattice decoding process, which is linear for the $ D_{k/2} $ lattice and quadratic for the $ A^{*}_{k/2} $ lattice. The proposed quantizer is described in details and some numerical results are presented in terms of the SNR as a function of the quantization rate, in bits per dimension. The results show that the quantizer designed from the $ D_4 $ lattice outperform previous records when the rate is equal to 1 bit per dimension. These quantizer also outperform the quantizers designed from the dual lattice $ A^{*} $ for all rates tested. In general the two proposed frameworks perform within 2 dB of the rate distortion function, which may be a good trade-off considering their low computational complexity.",

Over binary fields, the Montgomery scalar multiplication algorithm which was presented at the first CHES workshop by López and Dahab has been a favorite of ECC implementors, due to its nice properties such as high efficiency (outperforming the binary NAF), natural SPA-resistance, generality (coping with all ordinary curves) and implementation easiness. Over odd characteristic fields, the new scalar multiplication algorithms are the first ones featuring all these properties. Building-blocks of our contribution are new efficient differential addition-and-doubling formulae and a novel conception of on-the-fly adaptive coordinates which varies in accordance with not only the base point but also the bits of the given scalar.",

Several instantiations of ${\\sf {FAST}}$ are described. These are targeted towards two goals, the specific task of disk encryption and a more general scheme suitable for a wide variety of practical applications. A major contribution of this work is to present detailed and careful software implementations of all of these instantiations. For disk encryption, the results from the implementations show that ${\\sf {FAST}}$ compares very favourably to the IEEE disk encryption standards XCB and EME2 as well as the more recent proposal AEZ. ${\\sf {FAST}}$ is built using a fixed input length pseudo-random function and an appropriate hash function. It uses a single-block key, is parallelisable and can be instantiated using only the encryption function of a block cipher. The hash function can be instantiated using either the Horner's rule based usual polynomial hashing or hashing based on the more efficient Bernstein-Rabin-Winograd polynomials. Security of ${\\sf {FAST}}$ has been rigorously analysed using the standard provable security approach and concrete security bounds have been derived. Based on our implementation results, we put forward ${\\sf {FAST}}$ as a serious candidate for standardisation and deployment.&lt;/p&gt;",

    "abstract": "Cais, Ellenberg and Zureick-Brown recently observed that over finite fields of characteristic two, all sufficiently general smooth plane projective curves of a given odd degree admit a non-trivial rational $2$-torsion point on their Jacobian. We extend their observation to curves given by Laurent polynomials with a fixed Newton polygon, provided that the polygon satisfies a certain combinatorial property. We also show that in each of these cases, if the curve is ordinary, then there is no need for the words ``sufficiently general''. Our treatment includes many classical families, such as hyperelliptic curves of odd genus and $C_{a,b}$ curves. In the hyperelliptic case, we provide alternative proofs using an explicit description of the $2$-torsion subgroup.",

Moderate and high genus curves also arise in cryptographic applications, for example, via the Weil descent attack on the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem, but for these curves, the generic algorithms are to date the most efficient available. Nagao [22] described how some of the techniques used in deriving efficient explicit formulas can be used to speed up divisor arithmetic using Cantor's algorithm on curves of arbitrary genus. In this paper, we describe how Nagao's methods, together with a sub-quadratic complexity partial extended Euclidean algorithm using the half-gcd algorithm can be applied to improve arithmetic in the degree zero divisor class group.

We begin in Section 2 with a very abstract setting and try to avoid all structures which are not necessary for protocols like Diffie-Hellman key exchange, ElGamal signature and pairing based cryptography (e.g. short signatures). As an unavoidable consequence of the generality the result is difficult to read and clumsy. But nevertheless it may be worthwhile because there are suggestions for systems which do not use the full strength of group structures (see Subsection 2.2.1) and it may motivate to look foralternatives to known group-based systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, of course, the main part of the article deals with the usual realization by discrete logarithms in groups, and the main source for cryptographically useful groups are divisor class groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;We describe advances concerning arithmetic in such groups attached to curves over finite fields including addition and point counting which have an immediate application to the construction of cryptosystems.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the security of these systems one has to make sure that the computation of the discrete logarithm is hard. We shall see how methods from arithmetic geometry narrow the range of candidates usable for cryptography considerably and leave only carefully chosen curves of genus $1$ and $2$ without flaw.&nbsp;&nbsp;A last section gives a short report on background and realization of bilinear structures on divisor class groups induced by duality theory of class field theory, the key concept here is the Lichtenbaum-Tate pairing.",

In particular if the code is self-dual and the length is a multiple of $8$ this theta function is a modular form for some subgroup of the modular group.

This scenario is modelled by the concept of arbitrarily varying wiretap channels (AVWCs). In this paper, we derive a full characterization of the list secrecy capacity of the AVWC, showing that the list secrecy capacity is equivalent to the correlated random secrecy capacity if the list size L is greater than the order of symmetrizability of the AVC between the transmitter and the legitimate receiver. Otherwise, it is zero. Our result indicates that for a sufficiently large list size L, list codes can overcome the drawbacks of correlated and uncorrelated codes and provide a stable secrecy capacity for AVWCs. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of relaxing the reliability and secrecy constraints by allowing a non-vanishing error probability and information leakage on the list size L. We found that we can construct a list code whose rate is close to the correlated secrecy capacity using a finite list size L that only depends on the average error probability requested. Finally, we point out that our capacity characterization is an important step in investigating the analytical properties of the capacity function such as: the continuity behavior, Turing computability and super-activation of parallel AVWCs.",

In this article we give an alternative characterization of the generalized Walsh-Hadamard transform in terms of the Walsh spectra of the component Boolean functions of $f$, which then allows us to derive sufficient conditions that $f$ is generalized bent for any even $q$. The case when $q$ is not a power of two, which has not been addressed previously, is treated separately and a suitable representation in terms of the component functions is employed. Consequently, the derived results lead to generic construction methods of this class of functions. The main remaining task, which is not answered in this article, is whether the sufficient conditions are also necessary. There are some indications that this might be true which is also formally confirmed for generalized bent functions that belong to the class of generalized Maiorana-McFarland functions (GMMF), but still we were unable to completely specify (in terms of necessity) gbent conditions.",

A natural question which seems to have been considered independently by several groups is to use this representation as a starting point for small characteristic finite field discrete logarithm algorithms. This idea has been recently proposed by two groups working on it, in order to achieve provable quasi-polynomial time for discrete logarithms in small characteristic finite fields. In this paper, we don't try to achieve a provable algorithm but, instead, investigate the practicality of heuristic algorithms based on elliptic bases. Our key idea, is to use a different model of the elliptic curve used for the elliptic basis that allows for a relatively simple adaptation of the techniques used with former Frobenius representation algorithms. We haven't performed any record computation with this new method but our experiments with the field F 3 1345 indicate that switching to elliptic representations might be possible with performances comparable to the current best practical methods.",

However, while their implementation is simple, their parameterization is not trivial and relies on a suitable choice of the polynomial on which the PMNS operates. The initial proposals were based on particular binomials and trinomials. But these polynomials do not always provide systems with interesting characteristics such as small digits, fast reduction, etc. In this work, we study a larger family of polynomials that can be exploited to design a safe and efficient PMNS. To do so, we first state a complete existence theorem for PMNS which provides bounds on the size of the digits for a generic polynomial, significantly improving previous bounds. Then, we present classes of suitable polynomials which provide numerous PMNS for safe and efficient arithmetic.",

Cyclotomic classes of order 4 are widely used in the constructions of quaternary sequences due to the convenience of defining a quaternary sequence with the cyclotomic classes of order 4 as its support set. Recently, several classes of optimal quaternary sequences of period &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math id=\"M1\"&gt;\\begin{document}$ 2p $\\end{document}&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt;, which are all closely related to the cyclotomic classes of order 4 with respect to &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math id=\"M2\"&gt;\\begin{document}$ \\mathbb{Z}_p $\\end{document}&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; were introduced in the literature. However, less attention has been paid to the equivalence between these known results. In this paper, we introduce the unified form of this kind of quaternary sequences to classify these known results and then conclude the unified forms of these optimal quaternary sequences. By doing this, we disclose the relationship between the optimal quaternary sequences derived from different methods in the literature on one hand. And on the other hand, when the new obtained optimal quaternary sequence period is &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math id=\"M3\"&gt;\\begin{document}$ 2p $\\end{document}&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; and the cyclotomic classes of order 4 are involved, the methods and the results given in this paper can be used to identify if the sequence is new or not.&lt;/p&gt;",

    "abstract": "<p style='text-indent:20px;'>As numerous applications in wireless communications and radar sensing all rely on the finite and precious spectral resource, contiguous spectrum allocation schemes have become very difficult to continue nowadays. Spectrally constrained sequences (SCSs) are specially designed sequences which display low correlation sidelobes to effectively utilize the increasingly congested and fragmented spectrum. Recently, Liu <i>et. al</i> (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 64(4):2571-2582, 2018) proposed a lower bound of the maximal correlation for SCSs and constructed two classes of optimal SCSs by using Singer difference sets and perfect ternary sequences. For the application of SCSs, it is desirable that the spectrally constrained position should be as flexible as possible, and the correlation tolerance should be as small as possible. In this paper, we present some systematic constructions based on cyclotomy which generate some asymptotically optimal SCSs with respect to Liu's bound. The proposed constructions result in SCSs with new parameters and are more flexible in terms of the \"position of the null constraint\". In addition, we propose a framework which control the power of new SCSs while maintaining the correlation magnitudes by using cyclic algorithm-new (CAN) algorithm.",

    "abstract": "A concatenated code $\\mathcal{C} $ based on an inner code with Hamming distance $d^i$ and an outer code with Hamming distance $d^o$ is considered. An outer decoder that corrects $\\varepsilon$ errors and $\\theta$ erasures with high probability if $\\lambda \\varepsilon + \\theta \\le d^o - 1,$ where a real number $1<\\lambda\\le 2$ is the trade-off rate between errors and erasures for this decoder is used. In particular, an outer $l$-punctured RS code, i.e., a code over the field $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{l }}$ of length $n^{o} < q$ with locators taken from the sub-field $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$, where $l\\in \\{1,2,\\ldots\\}$ is considered. In this case, the trade-off is given by $\\lambda=1+1/l$. An $m$-trial decoder, where after inner decoding, in each trial we erase an incremental number of symbols and decode using the outer decoder is proposed. The optimal erasing strategy and the error correcting radii of both fixed and adaptive erasing decoders are given. <br> Our approach extends results of Forney and Kovalev (obtained for $\\lambda=2$) to the whole given range of $\\lambda$. For the fixed erasing strategy the error correcting radius approaches $\\rho_F\\approx\\frac{d^i d^o}{2}(1-\\frac{l^{-m}}{2})$ for large $d^o$. For the adaptive erasing strategy, the error correcting radius $\\rho_A\\approx\\frac{d^i d^o}{2}(1-l^{-2m})$ quickly approaches $d^i d^o/2$ if $l$ or $m$ grows. The minimum number of trials required to reach an error correcting radius $d^i d^o/2$ is $m_A=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\log_ld+1\\right)$. This means that $2$ or $3$ trials are sufficient in many practical cases if $l>1$.",

In this paper we give several new coordinate ordering-free and coordinate ordering-depending upper bounds for the insdel distances of linear codes. These upper bounds do not depend on dimensions of linear codes and only depend on the formations of codewords. It is shown that for many natural well-known linear codes including binary simplex codes, Kasami codes, many linear binary codes with few non-zero weights and some algebraic geometry codes, the new coordinate ordering-free upper bounds on their insdel distances are strictly smaller than the half-Singleton bound and the direct upper bound. On the other hand for many linear binary codes, the ordering-depending upper bound on their insdel distance is 2. We also give ordering-depending upper bounds on the insdel distances of some linear ternary codes with few non-zero weights and some binary and ternary algebraic geometry codes.",

One significant advantage of radical isogeny formulas over other formulas with similar purpose is that they eliminate the need to generate a point of order $ N $ that generates the kernel of the isogeny. While radical isogeny formulas were originally developed using elliptic curves in Tate normal form, Onuki and Moriya have proposed radical isogeny formulas of degrees $ 3 $ and $ 4 $ on Montgomery curves and attempted to obtain a simpler form of radical isogenies using enhanced elliptic and modular curves. In this article, we translate the original setup of radical isogenies in Tate normal form into the language of modular curves.

    "abstract": "For a positive integer $ b\\ge2 $, the $ b $-symbol code is a new coding framework proposed to combat $ b $-errors in $ b $-symbol read channels. Especially, the $ 2 $-symbol code is called the symbol-pair code. Remarkably, a classical maximum distance separable (MDS) code is also an MDS $ b $-symbol code. Recently, for any MDS code $ \\mathcal{C} $, Ma and Luo determined the symbol-pair weight distribution of $ \\mathcal{C} $. In this paper, by calculating the number of solutions for some equations and utilizing some shortened codes of $ \\mathcal{C} $, we give the connection between the $ b $-weight distribution and the number of codewords in shortened codes of $ \\mathcal{C} $ with special shape. Note that shortened codes of $ \\mathcal{C} $ are also MDS codes, the number of these codewords with special shape are also determined by the shorten method and the number of $ r $-combinations of the multiset problem. From the above calculation, the $ b $-weight distribution of $ \\mathcal{C} $ is determined. Our result generalizes the corresponding result of Ma and Luo [15].",

In this paper, we determine the sizes of absorbing sets that can occur in general and left-regular LDPC code graphs, with emphasis on the range of $ b $ for a given $ a $ for which an $ (a,b) $-absorbing set may exist. We identify certain cases of extremal absorbing sets that are elementary, a particularly harmful class of absorbing sets, and also introduce the notion of minimal absorbing sets which will help in designing absorbing set removal algorithms.",

Hence, if the above statement is true, then so is the following weaker statement: every ideal access structure admits an ideal perfect GC SSS. One contribution of this paper is to show that ideal SSSs are not necessarily GC. Our second contribution is to study the above two statements with respect to several variations of weakly-ideal access structures. Recently, Mejia and Montoya studied ideal access structures that admit ideal multi-linear schemes and provided a classification-like theorem for them.

    "abstract": "Rivest proposed the idea of a chaffing-and-winnowing scheme, inwhich confidentiality is achieved through the use of an authentication code. Thus it would still be possible to have confidential communications even if conventional encryption schemes were outlawed. Hanaoka et al. constructedunconditionally secure chaffing-and-winnowing schemes which achieve perfect secrecy in the sense of Shannon. Their schemes are constructed from unconditionally secure authentication codes. In this paper, we construct unconditionally secure chaffing-and-winnowing schemes from unconditionally secure authentication codes in which the authentication tags are very short. This could be a desirable feature, because certain types of unconditionally secure authentication codes can provide perfect secrecy if the length of an authentication tag is at least as long as the length of the plaintext. The use of such a code might be prohibited if encryption schemes are made illegal, so it is of interest to construct chaffing-and-winnowing schemes based on ''short'' authentication tags.",

    "abstract": "The problem of private set-intersection (PSI) has been traditionally treated as an instance of the more general problem of multi-party computation (MPC). Consequently, in order to argue security, or compose these protocols one has to rely on the general theory that was developed for the purpose of MPC. The pursuit of efficient protocols, however, has resulted in designs that exploit properties pertaining to PSI. In almost all practical applications where a PSI protocol is deployed, it is expected to be executed multiple times, possibly on related inputs. In this work we initiate a dedicated study of PSI in the multi-interaction (MI) setting. In this model a server sets up the common system parameters and executes set-intersection multiple times with potentially different clients. We discuss a few attacks that arise when protocols are naïvely composed in this manner and, accordingly, craft security definitions for the MI setting and study their inter-relation. Finally, we suggest a set of protocols that are MI-secure, at the same time almost as efficient as their parent, stand-alone, protocols.",

    "abstract": "A key-aggregate cryptosystem (KAC) is the dual of the well-known notion of broadcast encryption (BE). In KAC, each plaintext message is encrypted with respect to some identity, and a single aggregate key can be generated for any arbitrary subset $ \\mathcal{S} $ of identities, such that any ciphertext designated for any identity in $ \\mathcal{S} $ can be decrypted using this aggregate key. A KAC scheme is said to be efficient if all public parameters, ciphertexts and aggregate keys have polynomial overhead, and can be generated using poly-time algorithms.A KAC scheme is said to be identity-based if remains efficient even when the number of unique identities supported by the system is exponential in the security parameter $ \\lambda $. Unfortunately, existing KAC constructions do not satisfy this property. In particular, adopting these constructions to the identity-based setting leads to public parameters with exponential overhead.In this paper, we propose new identity-based KAC constructions using multilinear maps that are secure in the generic multilinear map model, and are fully collusion resistant against any number of colluding parties. Our first construction is based on asymmetric multilinear maps, with a poly-logarithmic overhead for the public parameters, and a constant overhead for the ciphertexts and aggregate keys. Our second construction is based on the more generalized symmetric multilinear maps, and offers tighter security bounds in the generic multilinear map model. This construction has a poly-logarithmic overhead for the public parameters and the ciphertexts, while the overhead for the aggregate keys is still constant.",

All previously used key randomisation hypotheses as also zero correlation attacks can be seen as special cases of the general framework. Derivations of expressions for the success probability are carried out under both the settings of the plaintexts being sampled with and without replacements. Compared to previous analysis, we uncover several new cases which have not been considered in the literature. For most of the cases which have been considered earlier, we provide complete expressions for the respective success probabilities.

    "abstract": "In large scale distributed storage systems (DSS) deployed in cloud computing, correlated failures resulting in simultaneous failure (or, unavailability) of blocks of nodes are common. In such scenarios, the stored data or a content of a failed node can only be reconstructed from the available live nodes belonging to the available blocks. To analyze the resilience of the system against such block failures, this work introduces the framework of Block Failure Resilient (BFR) codes, wherein the data (e.g., a file in DSS) can be decoded by reading out from a same number of codeword symbols (nodes) from a subset of available blocks of the underlying codeword. Further, repairable BFR codes are introduced, wherein any codeword symbol in a failed block can be repaired by contacting a subset of remaining blocks in the system. File size bounds for repairable BFR codes are derived, and the trade-off between per node storage and repair bandwidth is analyzed, and the corresponding minimum storage regenerating (BFR-MSR) and minimum bandwidth regenerating (BFR-MBR) points are derived. Explicit codes achieving the two operating points for a special case of parameters are constructed, wherein the underlying regenerating codewords are distributed to BFR codeword symbols according to combinatorial designs. Finally, BFR locally repairable codes (BFR-LRC) are introduced, an upper bound on the resilience is derived and optimal code construction are provided by a concatenation of Gabidulin and MDS codes. Repair efficiency of BFR-LRC is further studied via the use of BFR-MSR/MBR codes as local codes. Code constructions achieving optimal resilience for BFR-MSR/MBR-LRCs are provided for certain parameter regimes. Overall, this work introduces the framework of block failures along with optimal code constructions, and the study of architecture-aware coding for distributed storage systems.",

We find many optimal additive Toeplitz codes (OATC) over $ \\mathbb{F}_{4} $. These optimal codes also contain optimal non-circulant codes, so we find new additive codes in this manner. We provide some theorems to partially classify OATC. Then, we give a new algorithm that fully classifies OATC by combining these theorems with Gaborit's algorithm. We classify OATC over $ \\mathbb{F}_{4} $ of length up to $ 13 $. We obtain $ 2 $ inequivalent optimal additive toeplitz codes (IOATC) that are non-circulant codes of length $ 5 $, $ 92 $ of length $ 8 $, $ 2068 $ of length $ 9 $, and $ 39 $ of length $ 11 $.

To be more precise, we want to recover the original data from a received word under the constraint that the decoder can download only an $ \\alpha $ proportion of the received word. This is called fractional decoding.We show that for any $ (n,k,l) $ maximum RT distance separable array code, it is possible to utilize just an $ \\alpha $-proportion of the received corrupted codeword to decoding without losing the RT-error correcting capability. Furthermore, we introduce a novel probabilistic fractional decoding algorithm designed to handle random errors.

Several hash functions are proposed and upper bounds on their differential probabilities are derived. Concrete instantiations are provided for the primes $ p = 2^{127}-1 $ and $ p = 2^{130}-5 $. A major contribution of the paper is an extensive 64-bit implementation of all the proposed hash functions in assembly targeted at modern Intel processors. The timing results suggest that using the prime $ 2^{127}-1 $ is significantly faster than using the prime $ 2^{130}-5 $. Further, a judicious mix of the usual polynomial based hashing and BRW-polynomial based hashing can provide a significantly faster alternative to only usual polynomial based hashing. In particular, the timing results of our implementations show that our final hash function proposal for the prime $ 2^{127}-1 $ is much faster than the well known Poly1305 hash function defined over the prime $ 2^{130}-5 $, achieving speed improvements of up to 40%.",

Its goal is to present a previously neglected approach to non-adaptive group testing and describes it in terms of residuated pairs on partially ordered sets. Our approach has an advantage, as it naturally yields an efficient decision scheme (decoder) for any given testing scheme. This decoder generally allows to detect large classes of infection patterns.Apart from this, we devise a construction of good group testing schemes that are based on incidence matrices of finite partial linear spaces. The key idea is to exploit the structure of these matrices and make them available as test matrices for group testing. These matrices may generally be tailored for different estimated disease prevalence levels. As an example, we discuss the group testing schemes based on generalized quadrangles.",

    "abstract": "We present an approach to showing that a linear code is resilient to random errors. We use this approach to obtain decoding results for both transitive and doubly transitive codes. We give three kinds of results about linear codes in general, and transitive linear codes in particular.1. We give a tight bound on the weight distribution of every transitive linear code $ C \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_2^N $:$ \\mathop {\\Pr }\\limits_{c \\in C}[ \\text{wt}(c) = \\alpha N] \\leq 2^{-(1-h(\\alpha)) \\mathsf{dim}(C)}. $2. We give a criterion that certifies that a linear code $ C $ can be decoded on the binary symmetric channel. Let $ K_s(x) $ denote the Krawtchouk polynomial of degree $ s $, and let $ C^\\perp $ denote the dual code of $ C $. We show that bounds on $ \\mathbb{E}_{c \\in C^{\\perp}}[ K_{\\epsilon N}( \\text{wt}(c))^2] $ imply that $ C $ recovers from errors on the binary symmetric channel with parameter $ \\epsilon $. Weaker bounds can be used to obtain list-decoding results using similar methods. One consequence of our criterion is that whenever the weight distribution of $ C^\\perp $ is sufficiently close to the binomial distribution in some interval around $ \\frac{N}{2} $, $ C $ is resilient to $ \\epsilon $-errors.3. We combine known estimates for the Krawtchouk polynomials with our weight bound for transitive codes, and with known weight bounds for doubly transitive codes, to obtain list-decoding results for both these families of codes. In some regimes, our bounds for doubly transitive codes achieve the information-theoretic optimal trade-off between rate and list size.",

However, most current research has focused on the design of single-channel SNC sequences and few studies have concentrated on the constructions of mutually orthogonal complementary sets (MOCSs)/Z-complementary code sets (ZCCSs) under spectral null constraints, where Z denotes the zero correlation zone (ZCZ) width. Our objective of this paper is to present some constructions of SNC-MOCSs with low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) property and SNC-ZCCSs. Firstly, extended Boolean function (EBF) and polynomial representation are employed to design SNC-MOCSs and SNC-CSSs. The proposed parameters of SNC-CSSs include a recent iterative result as a special case. Then SNC-ZCCSs, which have potential applications for cognitive radio (CR) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel estimation and CR quasi-synchronization communications to achieve interference-free performance, are constructed by using the same method.",

    "abstract": "This paper deals with linear codes invariant under an endomorphism $ T, $ that we call $ T $-codes. Since any endomorphism can be represented by a matrix when a basis is fixed, we shall, for simplicity, consider linear codes invariant under right multiplication by a square matrix $ M \\in \\mathbb{M}_{n}( \\mathbb{F}_{_q}) $, and we call them $ M $-codes. In particular, we distinguish three fundamental types: $ M $-cyclic codes, quasi $ M $-cyclic codes, and $ (M_1, M_2, \\dots, M_r) $-multi-cyclic codes. The approach developed here allows us to realize cyclic codes and many of their generalizations as special cases. It also helps us better understand the structure of linear codes invariant under some special matrices, such as a permutation matrix or a monomial matrix. Next, we study the duality of $ M $-codes, where we show that the $ b $-dual of an $ M $-code is an $ M^{^{*}} $-code, where $ M^{^{*}} $ represents the adjoint matrix of $ M $ for a non-degenerate bilinear form $ b $, and we explore some important results on the duality of these codes. In order to use polynomial rings in the study of $ M $-codes, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between $ M $-codes and $ \\mathbb{F}_{_q}[x] $-submodules of $ \\prod_{i = 1}^{r}R_{_{f_i}}, $ where $ R_{_{f_i}} : = \\mathbb{F}_{_q}[x]/\\langle f_{i}(x)\\rangle $ and $ ( f_{_1}(x), f_{_{2}}(x), \\ldots, f_{_r}(x) ) $ is the sequence of invariant factors of $ M $. Finally, we investigate the structure of 1-generator $ M $-codes and provide BCH-like and Hartmann-Tzeng-like bounds for them.

    "abstract": "An error in the paper 'On vectorial functions mapping strict affine subspaces of their domain into strict affine subspaces of their co-domain, and the strong D-property' comes from incorrectly using a result from the article by Shanbhag et al. 'An upper bound for the extended Kloosterman sums over Galois rings' has led to a flawed proof of Theorem 5.22 in that paper. We provided a revised version of this theorem. We offered an alternative proof (more beautiful since it is a second proof) of the first part of Theorem 5.22 while we do not have a proof of the second part. Therefore, proving the strong D-property of the compositional inverse of the Gold Almost Perfect Nonlinear (APN) function remains an open problem. We provided a correction to subsections 5.3 and 6.2, which used this theorem.",

    "abstract": "The matrix representations of linear codes have been well-studied for use as disjunct matrices. However, no connection has previously been made between the properties of disjunct matrices and the parity-check codes obtained from them. This paper makes this connection for the first time. We provide some fundamental results on parity-check codes from general disjunct matrices (in particular, a minimum distance bound). We then consider three specific constructions of disjunct matrices and provide parameters of their corresponding parity-check codes including rate, distance, girth, and density. We show that, by choosing the correct parameters, the codes we construct have the best possible error-correction performance after one round of bit-flipping decoding with regard to a modified version of Gallager's bit-flipping decoding algorithm.",

Certain group theoretic constructs are now showing promise in providing quantum-resistant cryptographic primitives, and may provide suitable alternatives for those looking to address known quantum attacks. In this paper, we introduce a new protocol called a <i>Meta Key Agreement and Authentication Protocol</i> (MKAAP) that has some characteristics of a public-key solution and some of a shared-key solution. Specifically, it has the deployment benefits of a public-key system, allowing two entities that have never met before to authenticate without requiring real-time access to a third-party, but does require secure provisioning of key material from a trusted key distribution system (similar to a symmetric system) prior to deployment. We then describe a specific MKAAP instance, the Ironwood MKAAP, discuss its security, and show how it resists certain quantum attacks such as Shor's algorithm or Grover's quantum search algorithm. We also show Ironwood implemented on several \"internet of things\" (IoT devices), measure its performance, and show how it performs significantly better than ECC using fewer device resources.",

We restrict ourselves to the family of orthogonal functions, that correspond to binary sequences with ideal 2-level autocorrelation, used as filtering functions. After the twenty years of discovery of Welch-Gong (WG) transformations, there are no much significant results on randomness of WG transformation sequences. In this article, we present new results on uniformity of the WG transform of orthogonal functions on de Bruijn sequences. First, we introduce a new property, called &lt;i&gt;invariant under the WG transform&lt;/i&gt;, of Boolean functions. We have found that there are only two classes of orthogonal functions whose WG transformations preserve &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math id=\"M4\"&gt;\\begin{document}$ t $\\end{document}&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt;-tuple uniformity in output sequences, up to &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math id=\"M5\"&gt;\\begin{document}$ t = (n-m+1) $\\end{document}&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt;.

Characterizations of hyper-bentness were provided firstly by Charpin and Gong fourteen years ago for functions defined over $ \\mathbb{F}_{2^{2m}} $, with coefficients in $ \\mathbb{F}_{2^{m}} $, in terms of some exponential sums over $ \\mathbb{F}_{2^m}{} $ involving Dickson polynomials. Mesnager extended their results in 2011 by considering adding a trace monomial function defined over specific fields of small cardinalities.By employing the Möbius transformation, we succeed in characterizing the hyper-bentness property of functions with Dillon-like exponents with coefficients in the whole $ \\mathbb{F}_{2^{2m}} $. We emphasize that this ascension offers more choices on the coefficients (and therefore in exhibiting possible new hyper-bent functions) by keeping the evaluations of the related exponential sums in the $ \\mathbb{F}_{2^m}{} $ as well as the computation of the number of rational points on the associate hyperelliptic curves on the same field in the spirit of previous achievements due to Lisoněk (2011) and Flori and Mesnager (2012-2013) in this context. This strategy gives a generalization of the result due to Charpin and Gong, and its effectiveness can be seen from a new infinite family of binomial hyper-bent functions. Their coefficients are in an extension field. Nevertheless, as all the previously found functions, they still lie in the well-known class denoted by $ \\mathcal{PS}_{ap}^{\\#} $, initially studied in 2006 by Carlet and Gaborit.",

Canetti, Rothblum, and Varia showed how to obfuscate evasive membership functions of hyperplanes over a finite field of order an exponentially large prime, assuming the hardness of a modified decisional Diffie-Hellman problem. Barak, Bitansky, Canetti, Kalai, Paneth, and Sahai extended their work from hyperplanes to hypersurfaces of bounded degree, assuming multilinear maps. Both works are limited to algebraic sets over large fields of prime orders, and are based on less standard assumptions, although they prove virtual black-box security.In this paper, we handle much more general algebraic sets based on more standard assumptions, and prove input-hiding security, which is not weaker nor stronger than virtual black-box security (i.e., they are incomparable). Our first obfuscator handles affine algebraic sets over finite fields of order an arbitrary prime power. It is based on the preimage-resistance property of cryptographic hash function families. Our second obfuscator applies to both affine and projective algebraic sets over finite fields of order a polynomial size prime power. It is based on the same hardness assumption(s) required by input-hiding small superset obfuscation. Our paper is the first to handle the obfuscation problem of projective algebraic sets over small finite fields.",

However, with the rising of quantum computers, the problem of prime factorization and discrete logarithm will be solvable in polynomial-time, due to Shor's algorithm, which dilutes the security features of existing ElGamal, RSA, ECC, and the proxy signature schemes based on these problems. As a consequence, construction of secure and efficient post-quantum proxy signature becomes necessary. In this work, we develop a post-quantum proxy signature scheme Mult-proxy, relying on multivariate public key cryptography (MPKC), which is one of the most promising candidates of post-quantum cryptography. We employ a 5-pass identification protocol to design our proxy signature scheme. Our work attains the usual proxy criterion and a one-more-unforgeability criterion under the hardness of the Multivariate Quadratic polynomial (MQ) problem. It produces optimal size proxy signatures and optimal size proxy shares in the field of MPKC.",

    "abstract": "A tweakable enciphering scheme (TES) is a length preserving (tweakable) encryption scheme that provides (tweakable) strong pseudorandom permutation security on arbitrarily long messages. TES is traditionally built using block ciphers and the security of the mode depends on the strong pseudorandom permutation security of the underlying block cipher. In this paper, we construct TESs using public random permutations. Public random permutations are being considered as a replacement of block cipher in several cryptographic schemes including AEs, MACs, etc. However, to our knowledge, a systematic study of constructing TES using public random permutations is missing. In this paper, we give a generic construction of a TES which uses a public random permutation, a length expanding public permutation based PRF and a hash function which is both almost xor universal and almost regular. Further, we propose a concrete length expanding public permutation based PRF construction. We also propose a single keyed TES using a public random permutation and an AXU and almost regular hash function.",

The algorithm consists of two sub-algorithms, the first one in the ring of integers $ \\mathbb{Z} $ and the second one in the Gaussian integer ring $ \\mathbb{Z}[i] $. We observe that $ \\mathbb{Z}[i] $ in the second sub-algorithm can be replaced by another Euclidean domain $ \\mathbb{Z}[\\omega] $ $ (\\omega = \\frac{-1+\\sqrt{-3}}{2}) $. As a consequence, we design a new twofold Cornacchia-type algorithm with a theoretic upper bound of output $ C\\cdot n^{1/4} $, where $ C = \\frac{3+\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\sqrt{1+|r|+|s|} $ with small values $ r, s $ given by the curves.The new twofold algorithm can be used to compute $ 4 $-GLV decompositions on two classes of curves. First it gives a new and unified method to compute all $ 4 $-GLV decompositions on $ j $-invariant $ 0 $ elliptic curves over $ \\mathbb{F}_{p^2} $. Second it can be used to compute the $ 4 $-GLV decomposition on the Jacobian of the hyperelliptic curve defined as $ \\mathcal{C}/\\mathbb{F}_{p}:y^{2} = x^{6}+ax^{3}+b $, which has an endomorphism $ \\phi $ with the characteristic equation $ \\phi^2+\\phi+1 = 0 $ (hence $ \\mathbb{Z}[\\phi] = \\mathbb{Z}[\\omega] $).

    "abstract": "We describe a filtering technique improving the performanceof index-calculus algorithms for hyperelliptic curves.Filtering is a stage taking place between the relation searchand the linear algebra. Its purpose is to eliminateredundant or duplicate relations, as well as reducing the size of the matrix, thus decreasing the time required for the linear algebra step.&nbsp;&nbsp;This technique, which we call harvesting,is in fact a new strategy that subtly alters the whole index calculus algorithm. In particular, it changes the relation search to find many times more relations thanvariables, after which a selection process is applied to the set of the relations - the harvesting process. The aim of this new process is to extract a (slightly) overdetermined submatrixwhich is as small as possible. Furthermore, the size of the factor base also has to be readjusted, in order to keep the (extended) relation search faster than it would have been in an index calculus algorithm without harvesting. The size of the factor base must also be chosen to guarantee that the final matrix will be indeed smaller than it would be in an optimised index calculus without harvesting, thus also speeding up the linear algebra step.&nbsp;&nbsp;The version of harvesting presented here isan improvement over an earlier version by the same authors.By means of a new selection algorithm,time-complexity can be reduced from quadraticto linear (in the size of the input),thus making its running time effectively negligible with respectto the rest of the index calculus algorithm. At the same time we make the process of harvesting more effective - in the sense that the final matrix should (on average) be smaller than with the earlier approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;We present an analysis of the impact of harvesting(for instance, we show that its usage can improve index calculus performance by more than 30% in some cases), we showthat the impact on matrix size is essentially independent on thegenus of the curve considered, and provide an heuristicargument in support of the effectiveness of harvesting asone parameter (which defines how far the relation search is pushed) increases.",

We apply our characterization of the set of correctable error patterns to a few codes in a family of low-rate list-of-2 decodable Reed-Solomon codes. We study the increase in error-correction performance obtained in a symmetric AWGN channel by using list-of-2 decoding instead of traditional decoding for these codes. Some simulation results for list-of-2 decoding on QAM channels using the Guruswami-Sudan algorithm for decoding of Reed-Solomon codes are alsopresented.",

In order to protect the privacy of such sensitive data, cloud users (clients) encrypt their data before outsourcing. However, this poses a difficulty to later perform search operations on the encrypted data. Searchable encryption schemes enable a client to search and retrieve the cloud data (based on the keywords present in the data) when the data is encrypted. Dynamic searchable encryption schemes allow the client to search over the encrypted cloud data even when new documents are added to or deleted from the encrypted data. There is a trade-off between security (that is measured in terms of information leaked to the cloud) and the efficiency of dynamic searchable encryption schemes. Stronger security guarantees often come at a cost of less efficiency.In this work, we propose a new dynamic searchable encryption scheme for cloud data that achieves better security guarantees and improved efficiency compared to popular dynamic searchable encryption schemes. Our scheme uses an efficient data structure that reduces storage, lookup (search) time, and database modification time. We build a prototype of our scheme and experiment on large real-life datasets. We show our scheme performs better than the existing schemes, which provide similar (or weaker) security.",

Then we also construct several classes of nearly optimal or optimal THS sets with respect to the lower bound on the maximal cross correlation, which have longer sequence periods and more flexible family sizes than known ones. These THS sets may be more applicable for UWB systems. In particular, some proposed THSs are nearly optimal with respect to the Johnson bound on the maximal possible number of THSs.",

In this framework, we first prove that symmetric $ (n, n) $-functions (defined as commuting with any permutation of the input/output coordinates) cannot be APN and we propose several super-classes of the symmetric function class, within which our non-existence result does not work, and which can be investigated for finding APN functions. We study in particular rotation symmetric (RS) functions (defined as commuting with the cyclic shift of the input/output coordinates), among which are known APN functions, obtained from power APN functions by decomposing their input and their output over a normal basis. We show necessary conditions that RS functions (and more generally functions commuting with some permutation of the coordinates) must satisfy for being APN. We deduce a general result on RS APN functions which, when the RS function is specifically a power function whose input and output are decomposed over a normal basis, gives Dobbertin's result saying that any APN power function for $ n $ odd is a permutation and for $ n $ even is 3-to-1 over $ \\mathbb F_{2^n}^* $. In a second part of the paper, we derive a lower bound on the differential uniformity of monotone $ (n, n) $-functions, implying that no function in this large class (of size asymptotically equivalent to $ (2^{2^n})^{\\sqrt{\\frac {2n}{\\pi }}} $) can be APN for $ n\\geq 8 $.

One key tool for relating the weight of a code to that of it's dual is the MacWilliams Identity, first developed for the Hamming metric. This identity has two forms: one is a functional transformation of the weight enumerators, while the other is a direct relation of the weight distributions via (generalised) Krawtchouk polynomials. The functional transformation form can in particular be used to derive important moment identities for the weight distribution of codes. In this paper, we focus on codes in the skew rank metric. In these codes, the codewords are skew-symmetric matrices, and the distance between two matrices is the skew rank metric, which is half the rank of their difference. This paper develops a $ q $-analog MacWilliams Identity in the form of a functional transformation for codes based on skew-symmetric matrices under their associated skew rank metric. The method introduces a skew-$ q $ algebra and uses generalised Krawtchouk polynomials. Based on this new MacWilliams Identity, we then derive several moments of the skew rank distribution for these codes.",

Noticing the ad-hoc nature of security analysis prevalent in the existing literature, Boldyreva, Palacio and Warinschi proposed a formal security model for proxy signature. We revisit their proposed security definition in the context of the most natural construction of proxy signature – delegation-by-certificate. Our analysis indicates certain limitations of their definition that arise due to malleability of proxy signature as well as signature ownership in the context of standard signature. We propose a stronger definition of proxy signature to address these issues. However, we observe that the natural reductionist security argument of the delegation-by certificate proxy signature construction under this definition seems to require a rather unnatural security property for a standard signature.",

Following the CCA conversions of Yamada et al. (PKC 2011, 2012) and Nandi et al. (ePrint Archive: 2015/457, AAECC 2018), one can have CCA-secure PE from CPA-secure PE if the primitive PE has either verifiability or delegation. These traditional approaches degrade the performance of the resultant CCA-secure PE scheme as compared to the primitive CPA-secure PE. As an alternative, we provide a direct fully secure CCA-construction of PE from the pair encoding scheme. This costs an extra computation of group element in encryption, three extra pairing computations and one re-randomization of key in decryption as compared to the CPA-construction of Attrapadung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style='text-indent:20px;'&gt;Recently, Blömer et al. (CT-RSA 2016) proposed a direct CCA-secure construction of predicate encryptions from pair encodings. Although they did not use the aforementioned traditional approaches, a sort of verifiability checking is still involved in the CCA-decryption. The number of pairing computations for this checking is nearly equal to the number of paring computations in CPA-decryption. Therefore, the performance of our direct CCA-secure PE is far better than Blömer et al.&lt;/p&gt;",

The main results of this paper are the followings:$ - $ We propose a zero-sum distinguisher on reduced round Fountain v1. In this context, we study the non-randomness of the cipher with a careful selection of cube variables. Our obtained cube provides a zero-sum on Fountain v1 till $ 188 $ initialization rounds and significant non-randomness till $ 189 $ rounds. This results in a distinguishing attack on Fountain v1 with $ 189 $ initialization rounds. $ - $ Further, we find that the same cipher has a weakness against conditional Time-Memory-Data-Tradeoff (TMDTO). We show that TMDTO attack using sampling resistance has online complexity $ 2^{110} $ and offline complexity $ 2^{146} $. $ - $ Finally, we revisit the Time-Memory-Data-Tradeoff attack on Lizard by Maitra et al. (IEEE Transactions on Computers, 2018) and provide our observations on their work. We show that instead of choosing any random string, some particular strings would provide better results in their proposed attack technique.",

In traditional regenerating codes, the collection of any <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"M1\">\\begin{document}$ k $\\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula> nodes can reconstruct all stored information and is called the reconstruction set, <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"M2\">\\begin{document}$ \\aleph _R $\\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula>. A failed node can be regenerated from any <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"M3\">\\begin{document}$ d $\\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula> surviving nodes. These collections of <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"M4\">\\begin{document}$ d $\\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula> nodes are called the regeneration sets, <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"M5\">\\begin{document}$ \\aleph _H $\\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula>.

In this paper, we address the problem of secure generalized regenerating codes and present a coding scheme by focusing on the features of the generalized regenerating codes that protects data in the distributed storage system in presence of an active omniscient adversary. This adversary can maliciously alter the data stored on the nodes under its control and send erroneous outgoing message when contacted for the repair of failed nodes. In our scheme notwithstanding the presence of an adversary in distributed storage system, a data collector can still obtain the original file using a classical minimum distance decoder.",

Numerous generalizations and extensions of all-or-nothing transforms have been discussed in recent years, many of which are motivated by diverse applications in cryptography, information security, secure distributed storage, etc. In particular, <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"M3\">\\begin{document}$ t $\\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula>-AONTs, in which no information can be obtained about any <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"M4\">\\begin{document}$ t $\\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula> input blocks in the absence of any <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"M5\">\\begin{document}$ t $\\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula> output blocks, have received considerable study. <p style='text-indent:20px;'>In this paper, we study three generalizations of AONTs that are motivated by applications due to Pham et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b13\">13</xref>] and Oliveira et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b12\">12</xref>]. We term these generalizations rectangular, range, and restricted AONTs. Briefly, in a rectangular AONT, the number of outputs is greater than the number of inputs. A range AONT satisfies the <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"M6\">\\begin{document}$ t $\\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula>-AONT property for a range of consecutive values of <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"M7\">\\begin{document}$ t $\\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula>. Finally, in a restricted AONT, the unknown outputs are assumed to occur within a specified set of \"secure\" output blocks. We study existence and non-existence and provide examples and constructions for these generalizations. We also demonstrate interesting connections with combinatorial structures such as orthogonal arrays, split orthogonal arrays, MDS codes and difference matrices.",

By using the algebraic structure of quasi-cyclic codes, a new upper bound on the generalised rank weights of quasi-cyclic codes is formulated, which is tighter than the known Singleton bound. Additionally, it is shown that the first generalised rank weight of self-dual $ 1 $-generator quasi-cyclic codes is almost completely determined by the choice of $ {\\mathbb F}_{q^{m}} $.",

Group signature permits the members of a group to sign a document on behalf of the entire group keeping signer's identity secret and enabling disclosure of the signer's identity if required. In this work, we present the first code-based fully-dynamic group signature scheme which allows group members to join or leave the group at any point of time. We employ a code-based updatable <i>Merkle-tree accumulator</i> in our design to achieve logarithmic-size signature and utilize randomized <i>Niederreiter</i> encryption to trace the identity of the signer. More positively, we equipped our scheme with <i>deniability</i> characteristic whereby the tracing authority can furnish evidence showing that a given member is not the signer of a particular signature. Our scheme satisfies the security requirements of <i>anonymity</i>, <i>non-frameability</i>, <i>traceability</i> and <i>tracing-soundness</i> in the random oracle model under the hardness of generic decoding problem. We emphasize that our scheme provides full-dynamicity, features deniability in contrast to the existing code-based group signature schemes and works favourably in terms of signature size, group public key size and secret key size.",

In this paper, two constructions of ZCSSs are investigated. First of all, flexible and diverse seed sequence sets are employed to generate a large number of optimal ZCSSs, which is a generalization of an existing construction. Next, note that most ZCSSs obtained by orthogonal-matrix-based constructions have lengths that are multiples of the ZCZ widths. Toward the challenge of designing ZCSSs of various lengths, we proposed a noval construction that can yield ZCSSs with arbitrary lengths based on orthogonal matrices. In this way, different transmission rates can be facility provided to cater for different application scenarios. In addition, the flock sizes and ZCZ widths can be chosen flexibly. It means that, in theory, the obtained ZCSSs can be applied to MC-CDMA systems of various sub-carriers. To the best of our knowledge, the construction of ZCSSs have not been reported in the literature.",

    "abstract": "MDS matrices are widely used in block ciphers. Constructing lightweight MDS matrices is one of the research focuses of lightweight cryptography. In this paper, we define a new operation called the Copy operation by using registers. It is a generalization of Type 3 elementary operations (add a row to another one multiplied by a nonzero number). It is shown that any nonsingular matrix can be obtained by Copy operations and Multiplication operations from the identity matrix $ I $ (a Copy Block Implementation of the matrix). Thus we introduce a new metric called gw-xor using Copy Block Implementations to construct lightweight MDS matrices with respect to low xor gates. Compared with sw-xor, the gw-xor count is a better approximation of the optimal implementation cost, and in particular it may be a better approximation of the optimal implementation cost than s-xor. By searching the potential paths of Copy operations that can obtain formal MDS matrices (i.e., matrices with indeterminate elements and each determinant of square submatrix of any order is a nonzero polynomial in these indeterminates), we find 52 classes $ 16\\times 16 $ and $ 32\\times 32 $ binary MDS matrices with 35 and 67 xor gates respectively, which are the best known results. Furthermore, by considering the depth of MDS matrices, we find more $ 4\\times4 $ MDS matrices over $ \\mathbb{F}_{2^n} $ with the lowest xor gates at depths 3, 4, 5.",

A 2-function is called monomial rotation symmetric (MRS) if it is generated by applying powers of $ \\rho^2 $ to a single monomial. If the quartic MRS 2-function in $ 2n $ variables has a monomial $ x_1 x_q x_r x_s $, then we use the notation $ {2-}(1,q,r,s)_{2n} $ for the function. A detailed theory of equivalence of quartic MRS 2-functions in $ 2n $ variables was given in a $ 2020 $ paper by Cusick, Cheon and Dougan. This theory divides naturally into two classes, called $ mf1 $ and $ mf2 $ in the paper. After describing the equivalence classes, the second major problem is giving details of the linear recursions that the Hamming weights for any sequence of functions $ {2-}(1,q,r,s)_{2n} $ (with $ q &lt; r &lt; s, $ say), $ n = s, s+1, \\ldots $ can be shown to satisfy. This problem was solved for the $ mf1 $ case only in the $ 2020 $ paper. Using new ideas about 'short' functions, Cusick and Cheon found formulas for the $ mf2 $ weights in a $ 2021 $ sequel to the $ 2020 $ paper. In this paper the actual recursions for the weights in the $ mf2 $ case are determined.",

    "abstract": "<p style='text-indent:20px;'>The weight distribution of the cosets of maximum distance separable (MDS) codes is considered. In 1990, P.G. Bonneau proposed a relation to obtain the full weight distribution of a coset of an MDS code with minimum distance <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"M1\">\\begin{document}$ d $\\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula> using the known numbers of vectors of weights <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"M2\">\\begin{document}$ \\le d-2 $\\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula> in this coset. In this paper, the Bonneau formula is transformed into a more structured and convenient form. The new version of the formula allows to consider effectively cosets of distinct weights <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"M3\">\\begin{document}$ W $\\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula>. (The weight <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"M4\">\\begin{document}$ W $\\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula> of a coset is the smallest Hamming weight of any vector in the coset.) For each of the considered <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"M5\">\\begin{document}$ W $\\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula> or regions of <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"M6\">\\begin{document}$ W $\\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula>, special relations more simple than the general ones are obtained. For the MDS code cosets of weight <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"M7\">\\begin{document}$ W = 1 $\\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula> and weight <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"M8\">\\begin{document}$ W = d-1 $\\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula> we obtain formulas of the weight distributions depending only on the code parameters. This proves that all the cosets of weight <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"M9\">\\begin{document}$ W = 1 $\\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula> (as well as <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"M10\">\\begin{document}$ W = d-1 $\\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula>) have the same weight distribution. The cosets of weight <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"M11\">\\begin{document}$ W = 2 $\\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"M12\">\\begin{document}$ W = d-2 $\\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula> may have different weight distributions; in this case, we proved that the distributions are symmetrical in some sense. The weight distributions of the cosets of MDS codes corresponding to arcs in the projective plane <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"M13\">\\begin{document}$ \\mathrm{PG}(2,q) $\\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula> are also considered. For MDS codes of covering radius <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"M14\">\\begin{document}$ R = d-1 $\\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula> we obtain the number of the weight <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"M15\">\\begin{document}$ W = d-1 $\\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula> cosets and their weight distribution that gives rise to a certain classification of the so-called deep holes. We show that any MDS code of covering radius <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"M16\">\\begin{document}$ R = d-1 $\\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula> is an almost perfect multiple covering of the farthest-off points (deep holes); moreover, it corresponds to an optimal multiple saturating set in the projective space <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"M17\">\\begin{document}$ \\mathrm{PG}(N,q) $\\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula>.",

We develop the necessary theoretical tools to estimate the complexity of the algorithms for such sequences.
