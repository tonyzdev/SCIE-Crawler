    "abstract": "This review summarizes data on the biogeography and dispersal of bacteria, microfungi and selected protists, such as dinoflagellates, chrysophytes, testate amoebae, and ciliates. Furthermore, it introduces the restricted distribution and dispersal of mosses, ferns and macrofungi as arguments into the discussion on the postulated cosmopolitism and ubiquity of protists. Estimation of diversity and distribution of micro-organisms is greatly disturbed by undersampling, the scarcity of taxonomists, and the frequency of misidentifications. Thus, probably more than 50% of the actual diversity has not yet been described many protist groups. Notwithstanding, it has been shown that a restricted geographic distribution of micro-organisms occurs limnetic, marine, terrestrial, and fossil ecosystems. Similar as, cryptogams and macrofungi about, 30% of the extant suprageneric taxa, described and undescribed, might be morphological and/or genetic and/or molecular endemics. At the present state of knowledge, micro-organism endemicity can be proved/disproved mainly by flagship species, excluding sites (e.g., university ponds) prone to be contaminated by invaders. In future, genetic and molecular data will be increasingly helpful. The wide distribution of many micro-organisms has been attributed to their small size and their astronomical numbers. However, this interpretation is flawed by data from macrofungi, mosses and ferns, many of which occupy distinct areas, spite of their minute and abundant means of dispersal (spores). Thus, I suggest historic events (split of Pangaea etc.), limited cyst viability and, especially, time as major factors for dispersal and provinciality of micro-organisms. Furthermore, the true number of species and their distribution can hardly be estimated by theories and statistics but require reliable investigations on the number of morphospecies representative ecosystems. Generally, the doubts on Beijerinck's famous metaphor in micro-organisms everything is everywhere can be focussed on a simple question: If the world is teeming with cosmopolitan unicells, where is everybody?",

Seven key advantages of protist bioindicators are highlighted, namely: environmental sensitivity, functional importance, distribution, size and numbers, response times, ease of analysis and preservation potential. Protist bioindicators have been used in a wide range of contexts from ecosystem restoration to fire history, and particularly environmental pollution. Most major protist groups have been used as bioindicators with diatoms, foraminifera and testate amoebae particularly widely studied. To increase uptake of protist bioindication techniques in routine environmental monitoring technique development should consider the needs of stakeholders from an early stage. Papers in this special issue reflect the diversity of both protist life and possible bioindicator applications.",

    "abstract": "Summary. The amoeboflagellate genus Naegleria contains pathogenic and nonpathogenic species. As most species are morphologically indistinguishable, species are defined and identified by molecular methods. For routine identification, isoenzyme analyses are performed. For the description of a new species, sequences of ribosomal DNA are increasingly used and the analyses of these sequences also allow us to define the phylogenetic relationships between species and strains. In the present monograph 27 Naegleria lineages are discussed and identified as separate species. Using molecular methods, Naegleria spp. have been identified which either form dividing flagellates or which do not form flagellates at all, thus contradicting the accepted definition of the genus. Willaertia, which forms dividing flagellates, is the genus that is the closest relative of the genus Naegleria. The genus Naegleria has some particularities in its molecular biology, such as circular ribosomal DNA plasmids, group I introns in the small and large subunit ribosomal DNA, and an unusual pyrophosphate-dependant phosphofructokinase. The phylogeny of the Naegleria spp. is compared to the situation concerning the other genera of the familyVahlkampfiidae. Also discussed is the state of affairs concerning species designation based on phylogeny in the genus Acanthamoeba, another free-living amoeba with species pathogenic to man.",

    "abstract": "By feeding on bacterial biomass protozoa play an acknowledged role in the liberation of nutrients in the plant rhizosphere. In addition there are suggestions that plants have mechanisms working through changes in root architecture and initiation of active release from soil organic matter, which are used to improve uptake and recirculation of nutrients in the ecosystem. All processes are carried out on a local scale in soil with roots, bacteria and protozoa interacting. The many actors and the small scale of interactions make experimentation difficult. We discuss mistakes, pit falls and misinterpretations and provide suggestions for improvement. Recent methodological progress has opened new exciting avenues for protozoan research. New techniques have already helped to reveal protozoan regulation of cooperation as well as conflict in bacterial communities. These mechanisms in turn affect bacterial functioning and target molecular control points in rhizosphere food webs in relation to plants. Integrating nutritional and regulatory aspects into new concepts of protozoan functioning in soil is a challenging frontier in protozoology.",

The ubiquitous and very numerous protists, eukaryotic organisms mostly unicellular in structure and small in size, play numerous roles of importance that are often neglected or overlooked in biodiversity, biocomplexity, and conservation considerations of life on planet Earth. The present review article reminds readers, who hopefully include general biologists and other scientists as well as persons engaged directly in research activities that primarily involve solely protists (e.g. diverse studies on species belonging mainly to many individual groups of algae or protozoa), of such roles whether they be in areas directly or indirectly beneficial to human comfort and survival or in ones deleterious to our health and welfare. Matters become complex when multiple interactions are part of the overall picture (e.g. in food webs or in symbiotic relationships). Clearly, our far from complete knowledge of protistan taxonomic and phylogenetic interrelationships, as well as of their ecology, physiology, biochemistry, and molecular and evolutionary biology, hinders rapid progress in better understanding of their multiple roles in sustaining todayis biosphere.",

    "abstract": "Summary. Most recent ecological studies of testate amoebae were conducted in acid Sphagnum-dominated mires. Little data exists about the variation in testacean assemblages along the complete gradient from extremely poor acid fens to strongly calcareous spring fens. This so called poor-rich gradient is the most important gradient for the majority of mire biota and can display a time dimension as well. In order to fill this gap we studied modern testacean assemblages in spring fens in the Western Carpathians (Czech Republic and Slovakia ). The DCA of all testacean assemblages revealed two major factors controlling species variation, the poor-rich gradient and the micro habitat-type: waterlogged bare sediments versus bryophytes. Sampled sediments of poor acidic fens have species composition similar to that of bryophyte tufts from mineral-richer fens. The ordination of the subset of samples taken from bryophyte tufts shows the clear poor-rich gr adient on the first axis and moisture gradient causing variation of “acid” samples along the second axis. Based of DCA results, testacean assemblages were divided into six major types for which the diagnostic species were determined using phi-coefficient. Nearly all types are dominated by Euglyphidae, Centropyxidae, Cyclopyxidae and Difflugiidae were characteristic for calcareous habitats. Species richness did not correlate with the poor-rich gradient. The species variation in testate amoebae assemblages is better predicted by both the species compo sition of the vegetation as a whole and by the composition of bryophyte tuft than by long-term averages of water chemistry variables. The autecology of many species living in acid Sphagnum fens corresponds well with published data with several exceptions. On the other hand, the study of the complete poor-rich gradient revealed different species optima reported from higher pH Sphagnum fens, and thus it changed our view on the indicative value of some species.",

DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane in a slot or dot blot and incubated with a primary antibody (anti thymine dimer KTM53) against thymine dimers. The secondary antibody was an anti-mouse IgG (Fab specific) peroxidase conjugate. The blots were quantified in a Kodak Digital Science Image Station 440 CF by the chemiluminescence method. The calibration of the method was achieved by using the plasmid pBSK with known DNA sequence, length and number of adjacent thymine pairs. This method permits the measurement of low as well as high levels of DNA lesions in nanogram quantities of DNA. This method can be used for cultured as well as naturally occurring organisms.",

The effects of artificial UV-B irradiation on growth, survival, pigmentation, nitrate reductase (NR), glutamine synthetase (GS) and total protein profile have been studied in a number of Infixing cyanobacterial strains isolated from rice (paddy) fields in India. Different organisms show different effects in terms of growth and survival. Complete killing of Anabaena sp. and Nostoc carmium occurs after 120 min of UV -B exposure, whereas the same occurs only after 150 min of exposure in the case of Nostoc commune and Scytonema sp. Growth patterns of the cells treated with UV-B revealed that Nostoc commune and Scytonema sp. are comparatively more tolerant than Anabaena sp. and Nostoc carmium. Pigment content, particularly phycocyanin, was severely decreased following UV-B irradiation in all strains tested so far. In vivo NR activity was found to increase, while in vivo GS activity was decreased following exposure to UV -B for different durations in all test organisms; although complete inhibition of GS activity did not occur even after 120 min of UV -B exposure. SDS PAGE analysis of the total protein profile of the cells treated with UV-B shows a linear decrease in the protein content with increase in UV -B exposure time. Complete elimination of most of the protein bands occurs after 90 and 120 min of UV-B exposure in Nostoc carmium and Anabaena sp. whereas the same occurs only after 150 min of UV -B treatment in Nostoc commune and Scytonema sp.",

    "abstract": "The benthic foraminiferal assemblages in Lake Varano (southern Italy) have been investigated in detail. Statistical analyses enable us to recognize two main biotopes and five sub-biotopes that reflect different ecological and environmental conditions. The assemblages mainly seem to be influenced by the hydrological (namely salinity) and sediment conditions in the lake. These biotopes are characterized by specific sub-assemblages and variations in relative species’ abundances. The Outer Lake Biotope is affected by marine influence and is dominated by the foraminiferal species Ammonia beccarii, Ammonia parkinsoniana and Aubignyna perlucida, which are more common in open water environments. In contrast, the Inner-Marginal Lake Biotope reflects more restricted conditions where low salinity values and sand are associated with high numbers of miliolids. These two main biotopes are thus subjected to different degrees of confinement and water residence times, both of which are related to the water exchange time of the lake with the Adriatic Sea. In addition five sub-biotopes (Intermediate Marine, Mixing, “Urban”, Marginal, and Innermost) represented by particular foraminiferal assemblages are identified that characterize particular sub-environments.

Parasites were grown at 28 or 37℃, in a chemically defined or a complex medium, containing essential oil obtained from Ocimum gratissimum. At concentrations from 20 to 250 μg/ml, the essential oil, progressively inhibited the protozoan growth. The IC50, in defined and complex media, at 28℃ were 100 and 91 μg/ml, respectively. Cells cultivated in chemically defined medium were more sensitive to essential oil at concentration of 50, 62.5 and 100 μg/ml in relation to those cultured in complex medium at 37℃. In addition, ultrastructural and enzymatic alterations of the trypanosomatid were also evaluated. H. samuelpessoai exposed to 100 μg/ml of essential oil, in chemically defined medium at 28℃ for 72 h, presented considerable ultrastructural alteration, mainly at mitochondrial level, as showed by transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, cells cultivated in the presence of 100 μg/ml of essential oil showed a decrease of activity of the succinate cytochrome c reductase enzyme, a typical mitochondrion marker, as compared to untreated cells.",

    "abstract": "The morphology, the infraciliature, and two stages of physiological reorganization of Hemigastrostyla elongata spec. nov., isolated from the Yellow Sea near Qingdao (China), are described. The new species differs from the type H. stenocephala, inter alia, by the length of the dorsal bristles and the position of the pretransverse ventral cirri; from H. enigmatica by the number of caudal cirri; and from H. para-enigmatica spec. nov. - established for the H. enigmatica populations from the Yellow Sea - by the arrangement of the postoral ventral cirri and the cortical granulation. A key to the Hemigastrostyla species and some other 18-cirri hypotrichs is provided. Hemigastrostyla szaboi is fixed as type species of Heterooxytricha gen. nov. because the type population lacks the extra cirri which are characteristic for Hemigastrostyla. In addition, Oxytricha geleii is assigned to this new genus, whose species have, like many oxytrichids, 18 frontal-ventraltransverse cirri, but a Gonostomum dorsal kinety pattern. The old, large, and difficult genus Oxytricha is briefly reviewed, mainly on the basis of the dorsal kinety pattern. Very likely, only species with the Oxytricha pattern belong to this genus. Oxytricha marcili and O. pseudofurcata, which have the Urosomoida kinety pattern (i.e. kinety 3 fragmentation lacking), are transferred to Urosomoida which is, inter alia, defined by a more or less distinctly reduced number of ventral and transverse cirri. Some other Oxytricha species with this kinety pattern (O. islandica, O. lanceolata, O. pseudosimilis, O. setigera) are not transferred to Urosomoida, but preliminarily classified as incertae sedis in Oxytricha, because they have the full set of 18 cirri. The available molecular data on O. lanceolata indicate that this type of 18-cirri hypotrichs likely needs a genus of its own because O. lanceolata does not cluster with O. granulifera, type of this genus. The marine Actinotricha saltans, classified for a very long time in Oxytricha, seems to be a non-dorsomarginalian hypotrich according to molecular data, justifying the reactivation of the old genus Actinotricha. Oxytricha shii has a multiple dorsal kinety 3 fragmentation, three dorsomarginal rows, and the undulating membranes arranged in the Cyrtohymena pattern, strongly indicating that it is a member of the subgenus Cyrtohymena (Cyrtohymenides). This brief review is a further step to unravel the complicated systematics of the old, but still little-known genus Oxytricha. The following new combinations are made in this paper: Cyrtohymena (Cyrtohymenides) shii (Shi et al., 1997) comb. nov.; Heterooxytricha szaboi (Wilbert and Song, 2005) comb. nov.; Heterooxytricha geleii (Wilbert, 1986) comb. nov.; Urosomoida marcili (Paiva and Silva-Neto, 2004) comb. nov.; Urosomoida pseudofurcata (Berger, 1999) comb. nov.",

Since then the pace of publication was uneven but some very significant early works such as the seminal works of Leidy, Penard, and Cash, Hopkinson and Wailes paved the way to future research (Penard, 1890, Penard, 1902, Penard, 1911, Leidy, 1879, Cash et al., 1905-1921). These early studies focused on describing the diversity of testate amoebae but also included discussions (or speculations) about their geographical distribution and ecology. The lives and scientific careers of Leidy and Penard were nicely described by Corliss who had the privilege of meeting Penard towards the end of his long life (Corliss, 2001).",

Out of 17 falconiform species nine were infected with blood parasites whereas the Eurasian buzzard (Buteo buteo) had the highest prevalence for haematozoa; i.e. Leucocytozoon toddi (31%), the highest prevalence (25%) for Haemoproteus sp. was found in the hobby (Falco subbuteo). Eight species of owls were examined for blood parasites; the tawny owl (Strix aluco) had the highest prevalence with Haemoproteus syrnii (22%). In the one pygmy owl (Glaucidium passerinum) examined Trypanosoma avium and Plasmodium (Giovannolaia) fallax were detected. The white-tailed sea eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) was found to be a host of L. toddi for the first time. Differences in the prevalence of blood parasites were found in the seasons and age classes of the birds but not between birds admitted to a rehabilitation centre or samples in the wild, the sexes, bird orders and the regions.",

Therefore, we examined the potential of 21 different species of free-living amoebas to serve as hosts of a newly found bacterium, Waddlia chondrophila. The Chlamydia-like bacterium Waddlia chondrophila 2032/99 was originally isolated from an aborted bovine foetus in Rheinstetten, Germany. The inoculum of the obligate intracellular agent was prepared from Buffalo Green Monkey (BGM) cells. The infection of Hartmannella vermiformis OS101 revealed typical morphological stages of a Chlamydia-like life cycle, including the presence of elementary and reticulate bodies. The following infection studies with a Hartmannella-adapted Waddlia isolate showed that also Acanthamoeba sp. Gr. II HLA, Vahlkampfia ovis Rhodos, H. vermiformis C3/8, Hyperamoeba-like amoeba B1,2-100PE and Dictyostelium discoideum So-P2 supported the growth of Waddlia. An interesting finding was that Hartmannella-adapted Waddlia exhibited a broader host range when compared to the BGM cell isolate. The concept that Waddlia may fall into the group of environmentally preadapted pathogens is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Free-living amoebae are amphizoic organisms living in soil, air, fresh and sea water. Species belonging to the genera Acanthamoeba, Naegleria and Balamuthia are human parasites, which may invade the central nervous system, lungs, adrenal glands, skin, eyes and lower jaw. In this paper, we examine the occurrence of potentially virulent strains of amoebae in water bodies of the West Pomeranian and Lubuskie voivodeships (north-western Poland) and in biological material from patients with symptoms of pneumonia. We examined 45 natural water bodies (lakes, ponds, rivers, seas and lagoons), 39 artificial water bodies (swimming pools, firefighting and reservoirs fountains) and the water supply system in the city of Szczecin, and collected altogether 216 samples. We also examined biological material from 130 immunocompromised patients with atypical symptoms of pneumonia. From the collected environmental samples we isolated 110 strains of amoebae from the amphizoic group, 24 of which were thermophilic. Based on the morphological attributes of trophozoites and cysts, all the isolates were classified to the genus Acanthamoeba. Amoebae from the genus Acanthamoeba were also isolated from biological samples from patients with symptoms of pneumonia with secondary immune deficiencies. The presence of amoebae was determined in 2 samples of bronchoaspirate fluid taken from patients after chemotherapy and in 2 samples of bronchoalveolar lavage from patients with respiratory insufficiency. Molecular identification of the amoeabe isolated from biological samples confirmed their affinity to Acanthamoeaba genus, two of them classified as T4 genotypes. The two other sequences could not be classified to any known Acanthamoeba genotype. Thus there is a need for further investigation to establish Acanthamoeba genotype in biological material from patients with immunosuppression and pneumonia symptoms.",

Due to the great confusion in the species definition of the well-known species U. marinum , we have documented a detailed discussion/comparison and believe that most of the confusion is due to the fact that at least 2 closely-related sibling morphotypes exist which are often not recognized. Based on the data available, U. marinum is strictly defined as follows: marine Uronema ca. 30 × 10 μm in size, with truncated apical frontal plate and smooth pellicle, extrusomes inconspicuous, cytostome located equatorially, 12–14 somatic kineties and one contractile vacuole pore near posterior end of kinety 2. Uronema heteromarinum nov. spec. resembles U. marinum but can be distinguished morphologically by its notched pellicle with conspicuous extrusomes and reticulate ridges, the 15–16 somatic kineties, widely separated membranelle 1 and membranelle 2, as well as the subequatorially positioned cytostome. Based on the Qingdao population, an improved diagnosis for the poorly known Pleuronema setigerum is: marine slender oval-shaped form, in vivo about 40–50 × 15–20 μm; 3–5 preoral kineties and 14–22 somatic kineties; membranelle 1 and 3 three-rowed, and posterior end of M2a ring-like.

Historical morphological species data can be used to validate new records provided that more of these species are identified using standard molecular markers. Environmental surveys can also go further by identifying species over regions, seasons and depths. High throughput sequencing and bioinformatics tools provide a means of monitoring and eventually predicting the consequences of change.

    "abstract": "The pelagic / anoxic hypolimnion population of Spirostomum teres was investigated as a part of the long-term ciliates’ monitoring (2003–2016) in an oligo- to mesotrophic monomictic hyposaline crater lake Alchichica (Puebla / Veracruz, Mexico), including an analysis of picoplankton (both heterotrophic, HPP and autotrophic, APP) and inorganic compounds of nitrogen (ammonium, nitrite, nitrate), phosphorus (dissolved reactive phosphorus, DRP) and silicon. Additionally, detailed studies of the ciliate vertical distribution and feeding activity measured upon fluorescently labelled APP (picocyanobacteria) were carried out. The results were compared with those from a neighbour freshwater crater lake La Preciosa and with a meromictic karstic lake La Cruz (Cuenca, Spain). The ciliate vertical distribution within the water column was very well defined: During the first decade, the benthic population was frequently found throughout a developing stratification of the lake. The established stratification of the lake turned the conditions favourable for the formation of an oxycline / hypolimnion population, typically, several meters below the deep chlorophyll maximum (formed basically by diatoms); the population preferred the layers without detectable dissolved oxygen. However, an observed gradient of light (PAR) could support both oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis. Late stratification after deepening of the thermocline reduced the layers with S. teres population to a minimum apparently due to the drastic change in physicochemical conditions within a metalimnion, coupled with an oxycline, and limited to 1 to 2 meters; microstratification was found. Last years, the very bottom population disappeared or it was reduced and the late stratification S. teres peaks were smaller or did not appeared. Generally, S. teres oxycline / anoxic hypolimnion population was observed from June through November. Optimum picoplankton numbers in conditions that supported the ciliate growth were found: The ciliate was peaking at APP of 0.6 to 1 × 105 cells mL–1; the optimum of HPP was observed round 1.4 × 106 cells mL–1. S. teres was efficiently feeding upon picocyanobacteria in numbers of 105 cells mL–1 reaching the clearance rate of 2000 nL cell–1h–1, which represented in average 130 to 210 cells cell–1h–1 ingested. Feeding upon purple sulphur bacteria was observed but only during the end of the lake stable stratification when the ciliate population was already dropping. On the other hand, the volume specific clearance of S. teres upon picocyanobacteria (103 h–1) did not support the hypothesis that they could serve as a sole prey. Feeding upon eukaryote phytoplankton (chlorophytes Monoraphidium minutum, diatoms Cyclotella choc tawhatcheeana) could be of higher importance that previously supposed. Additionally, a use of ingested and retained photosynthetic prokaryotes is hypothesized.",

    "abstract": "Testate amoebae (TA) are unicellular protozoans enclosed in a test capable of indicating a wide variety of environmental conditions. Among others, characteristics such as short life cycle, great sensitivity and worldwide distribution makes them adequate bioindicators. As a complement to physical and chemical measurements, biomonitoring can be a cheaper and fastest way of environmental monitoring. This research sought to evaluate the extent of TA use in biomonitoring and the responses given by them to environmental features. The research was conducted in Scielo, Science Direct, Online Library, Google Scholar and Capes Journal Portal and yielded 211 papers. TA bioindication is able to provide information on metal, trace element and atmospheric pollution, and to point out different trophic states, pH, and evidence on characteristics of hydrology. Further, TA can be used in paleoenvironmental reconstruction as they reflect climate, volcanic and even sea level change phenomena. Sometimes, together with other organisms in environmental analysis, they have shown to be an important complement to biomonitoring. Additionally, a functional traits approach has been recently included as a promising tool. Methodological adjustments that have been conducted throughout the years are allowing TA use to be more reliable and precise. This review provides insight on the many possible functions of TA in bioindication studies, highlighting their wide use as bioindicators.",

This method has the characteristic of simplicity, quickness and good reproducibility, so it is especially suitable for ecologists and ontogenetists.

Batch cultures were grown for 96 h at final salt concentrations of 3, 5, 10, 20 and 40 NaCl g/l.

An increase in salt concentration from 3 to 10 g/l gradually affected the microbial community and few protozoa and metazoa survived at 96 h. Ciliate abundance was species dependent: Vorticella spp. and Opercularia articulata resisted the high dosages of NaCl better than other ciliates. Total ciliate abundance and diversity fell drastically at 20 g/l, which would compromise reliability in activated sludge processes. At 40 g/l neither protozoa nor metazoa survived after 24 h. This study evaluates the effects of a short-term NaCl shock on the dynamics of activated sludge microorganisms and their community composition. The study also contributes to the understanding of the wastewater treatment process.",

The character of variability (its amplitude and correlativity) differs not only in different species, but also in different populations of the same species.

    "abstract": "Summary. We investigated the oral apparatus of several stichotrichine spirotrichs, such as Stylonychia, Saudithrix, and Holosticha. Scanning electron microscopy reveals the oral opening into the buccal cavity covered by a membranous sheet, the “buccal seal”, which is very fragile and thus probably restored after each feeding process. Depending on the depth of the buccal cavity, there is an upper or an upp er and a lower seal, for example, in Cyrtohymena and Saudithrix, where the buccal cavity extends near to the dorsal side of the cell. Scanning electron microscopy further reveals special cilia at the right end of the ventral membranelles. These “lateral membranellar cilia” origi nate mainly from the short fourth row at the anterior side of each membranelle. The lateral membranellar cilia, which are usually covered by the (upper) buccal seal, may be numerous and long (Cyrtohymena) or sparse and short ( Holosticha). Live observations reveal that they are involved in feeding, while the long paroral and endoral cilia remain almost motionless. Based on these and other new observations, especially on the buccal lip and the membranellar bolsters, we propose an improved model for the organization of the stichotrichine oral apparatus. The dist ribution of buccal seal-like structures throughout the ciliate phylum, the nature and possible functions of the buccal seal and the late ral membranellar cilia, and the alpha-taxonomic significance of the new features are discussed.",

Members of the novel family Parachlamydiaceae are commonly observed in free-living amoebae (FLA) as host cells. Therefore,we examined the potential of 14 different species of free-living amoebae to serve as hosts of the Chlamydia-like bacterium, Simkanianegevensis, previously isolated as a contaminant from a cell culture in Israel (Kahane et al. 1993, 1995). The inoculum of the obligateintracellular agent was prepared from Buffalo Green Monkey (BGM) cells. The infection of Acanthamoeba strain HLA and of Naegleriaclarki (N-DMLGo) revealed typical morphological stages of a Chlamydia-like life cycle, including the presence of elementary and reticulatebodies, as could be shown by electron microscopy. Subsequent infection studies with an Acanthamoeba-adapted Simkania isolate showedthat also Balamuthia mandrillaris and one of two Hartmannella strains supported the growth of Simkania. Balamuthia can be consideredas an experimental host for mass production of elementary bodies. This is based on the finding that the host amoebae expelled g reat numbersof bacteria leading to a long-term survival of the infected trophozoites. The observation that Simkania negevensis can survive and replicatewithin at least four of tested FLA species suggests that various free-living amoebae may serve as survival and multiplication vehiclessupporting the spread of these pathogens in aquatic environments. The concept that Simkania may fall into the group of environmentallypreadapted pathogens is discussed as well.Key words: Acanthamoeba, Balamuthia, Chlamydia, endoparasite, Hartmannella, host range, Neochlamydia, Simkania negevensis,ultrastructure, Waddlia.",

This amoeba has a typical dactylopodiid morphotype, a coat of delicate, boat-shaped scales, and a Perkinsela -like organism (PLO), an obligatory, deeply-specialized kinetoplastid symbiont near the nucleus. These characters allow us to include this species into the genus Paramoeba . However, it differs from its only described species, P. eilhardi , in the structure of scales. P. atlantica n. sp. is established therefore to accommodate the studied strain. SSU rRNA gene sequence analysis suggests that P. atlantica belongs to the Dactylopodida, and is sister to a monophyletic clade of P. eilhardi and all Neoparamoeba spp., branching separately from P. eilhardi. Therefore, the genera Paramoeba and Neoparamoeba , currently defined based on the cell surface ultrastructure, might be paraphyletic and probably should be synonymized, as further evidence is accumulated. Based on the data available we emend the families Vexilliferidae and Paramoebidae to make them more consistent with the current phylogenetic schemes.",

Spleen/body mass ratios and numbers of splenocytes were significantly lower (P<10 -4 ) than in untreated both infected and uninfected mice, indicating decreased immune reactivity in treated animals. Acquired immunity too was impaired by corticoids, as shown by lower resistance to challenge infection with the mouse-virulent RH strain of T. gondii in mice with established chronic infection treated with DXM than in those left untreated (P=0.038). Most importantly, 8 of the 56 treated animals (14.2%) developed clinical signs of toxoplasmic encephalitis, which was verified histologically.

This community of organisms has not previously been studied in Tasmania, and the isolation of the freshwater habitats from like habitats elsewhere in the world increases the probability of the emergence of an endemic community. Forty-four species are described with uninterpreted records based on lightmicroscopy of living cells in natural communities. The records include an account of one new species: Ploeotia tasmanica sp. n. Of the 44 species (excluding unidentified taxa), 23 species are new to Australian freshwater sites but the majority of the species encountered here have also been found at other locations worldwide including Australian marine sites. The new records for Australian freshwater sites are: Adriamonas peritocrescens, Ancyromonas sigmoides, Astasia cfr. gomphonema, Bodo saltans, Ciliophrys infusionum, Colpodella vorax, Goniomonas truncata, Gyromonas ambulans, Heteromita globosa, Heteronema exaratum, H. globuliferum, Microcometes paludosa, Neobodo designis, N. saliens, Parabodo caudatus, Petalomonas poosilla, Ploeotia tasmanica sp. n., Protaspis obliqua, P. simplex, Reclinomonas americana, Rhynchomonas nasuta, Trepomonas agilis, Urceolus cyclostomus. The relative lack of novelty provides little support for the existence of endemic biota among this group of organisms, as has been shown to also be the case with marine species. This suggests that contiguity of habitats has not been a major determinant of the distribution of heterotrophic flagellates.",

All four exotic species are redescribed from Australian material. Trichodina heterodentata was recorded from 17 species of fishes, 15 of which were new host records; this species is identified as one of emerging importance in fish parasitology and a list of its known hosts is presented. Two new native species are also described based on silver stained specimens: T cribbi sp. n. from Hypseleotris galii, H. klunzingeri, and Hypseleotris sp. 5; and T. bassonae sp. n. from Selenotoca multifasciata. Trichodina cribbi is characterised by a large circular central inclusion and approximately 28 denticles, which have a blade length slightly greater than the ray length. Trichodina bassonae is characterised by a small, round, central inclusion and approximately 25 denticles, which have straight, non tapering rays that are in line with the leading edge of the denticle blade. It is estimated that the Australian trichodinid fauna may include up to 150 as yet undescribed species and represents a major source of unexplored biodiversity.",

Such a multi-level testing approach in one species facilitates the establishment of missing causal relationships between biochemical responses and ecological effects. The review illustrates that Tetrahymena spp. represent excellent ecotoxicological test species due to their important role in the microbial foodweb, wide distribution and abundance, sequenced genome in T. thermophila, large background knowledge and scientific publications in cellular biology, ecology and ecotoxicology. Several bioassays have already been developed on different biological organisation levels, such as enzyme assays (biochemical level), behavioral tests (individual level), population growth tests (population level) and microcosms (community level). Moreover, specific mode-of-action based assays are available (e.g. genotoxicity), or are in development (e.g. endocrine disruption and neurotoxicity). Tetrahymena spp. combine traits of (1) a single cell, thus might replace or complement specific cell-line testing approaches, with traits of (2) a whole organism and population, thus allowing to study complete metabolic pathways and its consequences on population growth and genetic adaptation. Assays involving Tetrahymena spp. might easily be adapted for a rapid multi-level in situ or ex situ toxicity biosensor test system for ecologically relevant risk assessment.",

Resting spores are the perennation life cycle stage of plasmodiophorids, allowing them to survive for long periods and infect subsequent host generations. Light microscopy was used to measure resting spores and sporosori of Sp. subterrane a, and enumerate resting spores in individual sporosori. Mean resting spore diameters differed for two sporosorus collections, being 4.0 μm (from New Zealand) and 4.3 μm (from Switzerland). Counts of resting spores in 4 μm thick serial sections of sporosori from one collection gave a mean of 667 (range 155 to 1,526) resting spores per sporosorus. Number of resting spores per sporosorus was closely related to sporosorus volume, and could be accurately estimated using the formula; number of resting spores = 0.0081 × sporosorus volume (assuming sporosori to be spheroids). Using this formula, mean numbers of resting spores in sporosori from 37 Sp. subterranea collections from field-grown potato tubers from 13 countries were determined to range from 199 to 713. Differences in numbers of resting spores between the collections were statistically significant (P < 0.05), and independent of country or host cultivar of origin, indicating that enumeration should be carried out for individual sporosorus collections to accurately quantify inoculum. Morphology, using scanning electron microscopy, also showed that between 2 and 51% (average 20%) of resting spores released zoospores after exposure to roots of host plants. The formula for resting spore enumeration validated in this study can be used to standardise Sp. subterranea resting spore inoculum for plant pathology studies, and possibly to assist determination of soil inoculum potential for disease risk evaluations.",

    "abstract": "Several dinoflagellates are known to practice acquired phototrophy by either hosting intact algal endosymbionts or retaining plas- tids. The acquisition of phototrophy in dinoflagellates appears to occur independently over a variety of orders, rather than being restricted to any specific order(s). While dinoflagellates with intact algal cells host endosymbionts of cyanobacteria, pelagophyte, prasinophyte or dictyochophyte, most organelle-retaining dinoflagellates acquire plastids from cryptophytes. In dinoflagellates with acquired phototrophy, the mechanism by which symbionts or plastids are obtained has not been well studied at sub-cellular or ultrastructural level, and thus little is known regarding their mechanism to sequester and maintain photosynthetic structures, except for three cases, Amphidinium poecilochroum, Gymnodinium aeruginosum, and Dinophysis caudata with peduncle feeding. Dinoflagellates with acquired phototrophy display different degrees of reduction of the retained endosymbiont and organelles, ranging from those which contain intact whole algal cells (e.g. green Noc­ tiluca scintillans), to those which have retained almost a full complement of organelles (e.g., Amphidinium poecilochroum and Podolampas bipes), to those in which only the plastids remain (e.g., Amphidinium wigrense and Dinophysis spp.). A series of events leading to acquisition and subsequent degeneration of a whole-cell endosymbiont have been widely recognized as evolutionary pathway of the acquisition of plas- tids. However, recent work on D. caudata suggests that acquisition of phototrophy by predation (i.e. kleptoplastidy) may be a mechanism and evolutionary pathway through which plastids originated in dinoflagellates with 'foreign' plastids other than the 'typical' peridinin-type plastids. Most organelle-retaining dinoflagellates are facultative mixotrophs, with Dinophysis species and an undescribed Antarctic dino- flagellate being the only obligate mixotrophs known so far. The establishment of dinoflagellates with acquired phototrophy in cultures and careful research using the cultures would help improve our knowledge of the evolution of the dinoflagellate plastids and their ecophysiology.",

In this study, we sequenced 18S rRNA (SSU rRNA), 5.8S rRNA, and 28S rRNA (LSU rRNA) genes of two gregarine species from crustacean hosts (gregarine superfamily Cephaloidophoroidea): Cephaloidophora cf. communis from a marine cirripedian Balanus balanus (White Sea), and Heliospora cf. longissima from the freshwater amphipods, Eulimnogammarus verrucosus and E. vittatus (Lake Baikal). Phylogenetic analyses of SSU rDNA sequences failed to produce a robust tree topology, for a limited taxon sample (31 operational taxonomic units (OTU), based on 1,604 sites), while LSU (2,869 sites), and concatenated dataset based on SSU, 5.8S, and LSU (4,627 sites) produced more consistent tree topologies for the same taxon sample. Analyses testing for LBA-influence were negative, therefore we suggested that the main reason of the failed topologies in SSU rDNA analyses is insufficient data (insufficient taxon sampling and limited molecular data), rather than LBA. Possible advantages of Bayesian analyses, compared to Maximum Likelihood, and usage of LSU rDNA within the context of apicomplexan phylogenetics were discussed. One of the advantages of LSU is likely its lower rate of evolution in long-branching apicomplexans (e.g., gregarines), relative to other (non-long-branching) apicomplexans, compared to SSU rDNA. Ultrastructure of the epicytic folds was studied. There are 3 to 5 apical arcs (also known as rippled dense structures) and 2 to 5 apical filaments in the tops of the folds. This small number of the apical structures fits into morphological diversity of the epicyte in other Cephaloidophoroidea, but this is not a synapomorphy of the group because this was also detected in several unrelated gregarines. C. cf. communis was found to contain a septum between the epimerite and the protomerite, which has not been reported in other gregarines. More exact terminology, which takes into account number of body sections and septa, is proposed for morphological descriptions of trophozoites and free mature gamonts of gregarines. In accordance with this, C. cf. communis gamonts are tricystid and biseptate, whereas H. cf. longis­ sima gamonts are tricystid and uniseptate, similar to other eugregarines.",

Based on the present observation and previous descriptions, A. tihanyiensis is characterized by having an elliptical body shape, yellowish cortical granules, two long frontoventral rows, enlarged frontal and transverse cirri, highly variable numbers of frontoventral, and postoral ventral cirri, and six to 11 caudal cirri arranged in three short rows. New data confirm the presence of pretransverse ventral cirri in this species.

The new genus is outstanding in having epicortical scales (lepidosomes) and a strongly flattened and distinctly projecting preoral dome. Diagnostic features of L. platycephalus include a small, reniform body carrying an elongated caudal cilium, about 11 ciliary rows, and an adoral zone composed of an average of 11 polykinetids. The morphogenesis of L. platycephalus matches data from other metopids in that (1) the body is drastically re-shaped, (2) the parental oral structures are reorganized but do not contribute to the daughter oral ciliature, (3) the opisthe's adoral polykinetids originate pleurotelokinetally, (4) the opisthe's paroral membrane is formed via re-arrangement of the posterior portion of the first two perizonal rows, and (5) the opisthe's perizonal stripe is made by three parental perizonal rows and two dorsolateral ciliary rows. The morphogenetic data corroborate phylogenetic analyses in that caenomorphids are only superficially similar to metopids; metopids and clevelandellids are closely related; and litostomateans are the best candidates for a sister group of the metopid-clevelandellid assemblage within the SAL superclade.",

Thus, resting cystformation and structure could be studied by light and scanning electron microscopy and cytochemical methods. The resting cyst of M. corlissi belongs to the kinetosome-resorbing (KR) type and has a conspicuous coat of extracellular organic scales, here termed lepidosomes, embedded in mucus mainly composed of acid mucopolysaccharides, as shown by the strong reaction with alcian blue. The lepidosomes, which likely consist of glycoproteins, are finely faceted, hollow spheres with a diameter of 2-14 μm. They are formed underneath the cortex and liberated almost concomitantly to the external surface of the cell before the cyst wall is produced. Resting cyst size is dependent on temperature, the average diameter is 46 μm (without lepidosome coat) at 20°C. The cyst wall, which contains considerable amounts of glycoproteins and a layer of chitin, is smooth, 1.5-2 μm thick, and composed, in the light microscope, of two distinct layers highly resistant to various inorganic and organic solvents. The cyst doubles the diameter during excystment and the lepidosome coat is left behind. The occurrence of lepidosomes throughout the ciliate phylum, their genesis and function, and the conspicuous morphological similarity with leafhopper's brochosomes are discussed.",

In this report, the SS rRNA genes for three congeners of Frontonia, namely F. lynmi, F. tchibisovae and F. didieri, were sequenced and characterized. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by means of Bayesian, neighbor-joining (NJ), least-squares (LS) and maximum parsimony (MP) to assess the inter-and intra-generic relationships of the class Oligohymenophorea. All trees show similar topologies with stable bootstrap support and indicate that: (1) four well known groups, i.e., Peritrichia, Hymenostomatia, Scuticociliatia and Peniculia are distinctly outlined within the class Oligohymenophorea; (2) members of Frontonia are likely more divergent, that is, morphotypes assigned into this genus based on traditional methods might belong to different assemblages, which hence conflicts with the separation of Apofrontonia from the family Frontoniidae, in which the genus Frontonia locates; (3) Apofrontonia always clusters with Paramecium and then groups with the closely related genus Frontonia. In contrast to investigations based on morphology and morphogenesis, the SS rRNA gene sequence determines that the well-outlined genus Frontonia appears to be a paraphyletic assemblage, in which the morphotype Frontonia didieri is more closely related to Apofrontonia than to its congeners.",

Based on the data obtained for the China population, new information of the living morphology of Pleuronema puytoraci is documented and details of the complete infraciliature is available for the first time. The stomatogenesis of Parauronema longum is basically similar to that of its congeners and can be summarized as follows: membranelle 1, membranelle 2 and the scutica of the opisthe originate from the parental paroral membrane, whereas membranelle 3 of the opisthe develops from the parental scutica; the paroral membrane originates from the parental paroral membrane.",

The trophozoites of this new isolate have eruptive pseudopodes and do not transform into flagellates. The strain forms cysts that have a double wall. This thermophilic amoeba grows at temperatures up to 50°C. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of the small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA) places the amoeba into the Heterolobosea. The closest relatives are Paravahlkampfia spp. Like some other heterolobosean species, this new isolate has a group I intron in the SSU rDNA. Because of its position in the molecular phylogenetic tree, and because there is no species found in the literature with similar morphological and physiological characteristics, this isolate is described as a new genus and a new species, Fumarolamoeba ceborucoi gen. nov., sp. nov.",

    "abstract": "The nature conservation, and wider environmental importance of peatlands, particularly in relation to carbon management, has led to there being a growing interest in attempting to manage degraded peatlands in a way that will restore them to fully functioning peat- land ecosystems. Much of this management is concerned with the rewetting of these sites therefore it has become important to monitor the surface wetness of these bogs and if possible compare current wetness with previous, pre-damage, conditions. We present previously unpublished case studies of the use of testate amoebae to monitor bog restoration schemes in N.W. England (Holcroft Moss, Cheshire) and Ireland (Ardagullion Bog, Co. Longford). In addition we summarise the key conservation related conclusions of our previously published work on two other sites in N.W. England - Astley Moss (in the Chat Moss complex of Greater Manchester) and Danes Moss (Cheshire). At Holcroft the record of lead pollution from the peat core allows us to date recent changes in the testate community preserved in a peat core and relate these to both conservation management and other changes in the landscape around the bog in over the last 50 years. Ardagullion Bog provides an illustration of the utility of using multiple peat cores in the testate monitoring of peat bog restoration and illustrates that a bog that has only suffered limited 'damage' is able to be restored to something close to pre damage conditions on a decadal time scale. We also summarise what we see as the main lessons from testate studies of bog restoration - both from the case studies described in this paper and from the wider literature - and discuss the conditions under which testate amoebae may be of particular use in peatland restoration.",

This study develops existing analytical techniques con- cerned with the preparation and counting of testate amoebae for sea-level studies and demonstrates the predictive power of this group of micro-organisms. Two salt marshes in northwestern Norway were sampled for testate amoebae and multiple sub-samples were prepared using different procedures and count totals. Analytical efficiency can be improved upon by using a mild alkali, chemical disaggregant (5% KOH) to break up fibrous, salt-marsh peat and concentrate tests prior to counting. A count total of 100 individuals, rather than 150, can be used to make time gains with little or no loss of taxon information. The Norwegian salt-marsh testate amoebae showed strong zonation relative to tidal elevation. Key indicator taxa from the high marsh included Centropyxis cassis type, Cyclopyxis arcelloides type and Eugly- pha spp. Those from the low marsh included Difflugia pristis type and a distinctive morphotype of Centropyxis platystoma type. Combined, the two surface data sets from Norway were capable of predicting marsh surface elevations to within ± 0.09 m.",

This rare species is characterized, inter alia, by narrowly spaced, small, colourless cortical granules and several conspicuous ring-shaped structures in the cytoplasm. The caudal cirri and the simple dorsal kinety pattern (three bipolar kineties) are probably plesiomorphic traits within the Hypotricha, the composition of the adoral zone of the proter from new and parental membranelles, as well as the presence of two ‘extra’ cirri behind the right marginal row strongly suggest a misclassification in Tachysoma. The SSU rRNA gene sequence data indicate that T. rigescens branches off rather basally in the Hypotricha tree, which supports the hypothesis that the 18-cirri pattern occurred very early, probably already in the last common ancestor of the Hypotricha. A detailed survey of the early branching 18-cirri hypotrichs and similar taxa (e.g. Trachelostyla pediculiformis, Hemigastrostyla enigmatica, Protogastrostyla pulchra) reveals that for T. rigescens a new genus (Apogastrostyla gen. nov.) has to be established, because there are important differences, inter alia, in the dorsal infraciliature. Besides the type species, A. rigescens comb. nov., which seems to be confined to the northern hemisphere according to the sparse faunistic data, a second marine species, A. szaboi comb. nov. (basionym Hemigastrostyla szaboi), so far only twice recorded from the Antarctic region, can be included. The Chinese population is fixed as neotype to define the species objectively, because no type material of A. rigescens is present and the original type locality is not known.

Amoebae are broadly oval to somewhat triangular during locomotion with average length of 37 μm and breadth of 50 μm, and surrounded by a hyaloplasm margin, somewhat narrow when at rest but more expanded during locomotion (~ 5–10 μm at the anterior). Sparsely occurring subpseudopodia, barely emergent from the hyaloplasm, are blunt and finger-like, occasionally becoming adhesive laterally or at the posterior. Cysts develop after 2–3 weeks in culture and are round with a distinct margin, decreasing in size from 20 to 5 μm during maturation. The granuloplasm contains refractile crystals. A vesicular nucleus (~ 6 μm), containing a nucleolus (2–3 μm), is variable in shape from somewhat lenticular in section to irregularly rounded with undulating or lobed margins. Surface scales (~ 0.3 μm in height) have an apical deeply concave funnel-like collar (~ 0.15 μm deep), without a spine, composed of radial fine rays and concentric filaments forming a finemesh, supported on four non-cross-linked styles (~ 0.2 μm apart) attached to a round to broadly angular base plate (0.6–1 μm) with a fine gridtexture. Cysts are rounded and enclosed by an organic wall bearing remnants of the scales on its outer surface. Both concatenated analysis of SSU-rDNA and COI genes and comparative morphologies support the designation of Cochliopodium megatetrastylus n. sp. as a new species.",

Therefore, we developed and applied specific PCR primers for the detection of species belonging to the genus Paramecium and the Paramecium aurelia complex. These primers were successfully tested with different Paramecium species including representatives of the P. aurelia complex as well as closely related species like Frontonia sp. and Tetrahymena sp. in both experimental and environmental samples.

    "abstract": "The response of ciliate communities to cyanobacterial bloom was investigated in a shallow, hypertrophic reservoir in Slovakia, central Europe. Seasonal dynamics of ciliate communities corresponded negatively with course of water bloom formation. The highest numbers and abundances of ciliate species occurred during the spring season when cyanobacterial bloom was not fully developed, while there was an abrupt decrease in both numbers and abundances at the beginning of summer when water bloom culminated. Cyanobacterial blooming thus significantly lowered diversity and equitability of ciliate communities: many rare and sporadic species disappeared and few common taxa flourished and dominated. Nonetheless, these leading ciliates formed a functionally diverse assemblage whose members showed mostly positive contemporaneous and only rarely time-shifted interactions. There were fine filter feeders (Cinetochilum margaritaceum, Dexiotricha granulosa, Paramecium caudatum and Spirostomum teres) grazing heterotrophic bacteria and picocyanobacteria, omnivorous fine to coarse filter feeders (Frontonia leucas) as well as hunters (Coleps hirtus, Holophrya teres and Loxophyllum helus) looking for an individual prey. Also a comparatively rich, anaerobic coenosis comprising various bacterivorous armophoreans and plagiopyleans, developed at the bottom of the reservoir. Our study documents that ciliates form functionally diverse communities with potential to control cyanobacterial blooms in hypertrophic reservoirs.",

    "abstract": "Summary. Gromia oviformis is a common marine rhizopod, possessing a large ovoid membraneous theca that resembles the tests of certain monothalamous (single-chambered) foraminifers. In fact, the genus Gromia was initially classified among the Foraminifera, but because of its non-granular, filose pseudopodia it was later included among filopodia-bearing protists (the Filosea). Recent molecular phylogenies suggested that Gromia branches among Cercozoa, a heterogeneous assemblage of mainly amoeboid protists, which show some affinities to Foraminifera. To test how closely related are Gromia and Foraminifera, we have analysed the sequences of actin, large subunit of the RNA polymerase II (RPB1) and small subunit (SSU) rRNA genes. We also analysed the structure of the polyubiquitin gene of G. oviformis. Our analyses show that Gromia’s actin is specifically related to one of the two actin genes families known in Foraminifera. In RPB1-based phylogenies, Gromia appears as the closest relative of Foraminifera, while in the SSU rRNA trees it branches as sister to Foraminifera and Haplosporidia. We identified also a single serine insertion in the polyubiquitin of Gromia, similar to that found in Foraminifera, Plasmodiophorida and some Cercozoa. Altogether, these findings support the hypothesis that the morphological resemblance between Gromia and Foraminifera may be due to a shared common ancestor. If further analyses of protein-coding genes including a more representative sampling of Cercozoa confirm this relationship, then the molecular study of G. oviformis will be of key importance for understanding the origin of Foraminifera.",

Species separation among some brightly coloured marine Pseudokeronopsis spp. is difficult because of the accumulation of inaccurate descriptions or misinterpretations in previous studies. Based on isolates collected from Chinese coastal waters, fou r “well-known” yellow, brown or reddish species, i.e. P. carnea, P. flava, P. flavicans, and P. rubra, are re-examined, particularly with respect to their cortical granules, cell colour, infraciliature and other morphological features in vivo. Improved diagnoses for these organisms are given, synonyms are listed and a key to their identification is supplied. A recently reported marine form, Pseudokeronopsis pararubra Hu, Warren et Suzuki, 2004, is believed to be a junior synonym of P. carnea and is synonymized with the latter.",

Encystment was promoted by an increase in concentration of ions such as Ca 2+ , Na + and K + contained in the surrounding medium, which may be detected by ciliates as an environmental signal for forthcoming desiccation, and was suppressed by the presence of bacteria in the surro unding media. When the surrounding media contained both low concentrations (1 mM) of salts and bacteria (10 7 cells/ml), encystment triggered by cations was completely canceled. However, a gradual increase up to finally 8 mM in salt concentration accomplished by a natural evapora tion of the surrounding saline solutions invalidated the encystment-suppression effect by bacteria.",

A total of 74 taxa, belonging to 21 genera was observed. While most taxa belonged to the genera Difflugia, Euglypha and Centropyxis, most counted tests were identified as Trinema lineare. The substrate type showed the largest influence on testate amoebae communities, regardless of the habitat type. Centropyxis aerophila, C. aerophila var. sphagnicola, Difflugia pristis and D. tenuis showed a clear preference for sediments (sapropelium and rock scraping), both in standing and running water bodies. The differences in site characteristics induced also differences among the epiphytic communities. Assulina muscorum, A. seminulum, Difflugia glans, D. tenuis, Difflugiella crenulata var. globosa and Euglypha strigosa were typical taxa living on macrophytes in standing water bodies. No typical epiphytic taxa were found in running water bodies. Homothermic systems, which are ice-free year-round, accommodate more developed testate amoebae communities. This reflects in a higher ratio of K-strategic lobose testate amoebae as compared to r-strategic Filosa (LF-index).",

Spore with a quadrate or pseudoquadrate shape in apical view with four equal valves were observed in the pseudocysts. Each valve had 4 lateral opposite cytoplasmic projections up to 2 μm long. Spore length and width ranged between 3.2 (2.9-3.5) μm and 6.8 (6.2-7.1) μm (n=25), respectively, while the equal polar capsules averaged 2.2 (2.0-2.6) x 1.2 (1.1-1.5) μm (n=20). The polar capsules were located side by side in quadrate position with the apex converging to the apical pole of the spore. Each of the polar capsules was pyriform in shape and contained a coiled filament with 3-4 coils with irregular transverse sections. There was no evidence of any immunological reaction in the parasitized muscle or encapsulated cysts. Spores seemed free among disintegrated myofibrils, showing some aspects of liquefaction of the muscle. Morphological and ultrastructural comparisons with other Kudoa spp. enabled us to determine this parasite to be a new species that we name Kudoa aequidens. These ultrastructural data are the first record obtained of a Kudoa sp. from Brazil.",

The effects of linoleic acid supplementation on protozoa counts, fermentation parameters and fatty-acid composition of Entodinium caudatum and Diploplastron affine were examined in in vitro cultures. Entodinium caudatum (EC) and Diploplastron affine (DA) were isolated from the rumen of sheep (Slovak Merino breed) and cultivated anaerobically in the presence of bacteria in caudatum-type medium. To test the effect of soluble linoleic acid (LA) on protozoan growth, both ciliate species were supplemented with LA (1.51 µg/L) on the day of dilution over a 30-day period. Twenty-four-hour fermentation parameters were examined on both ciliate cultures and their respective bacterial fractions. Ciliate counts of both EC and DA cultures were not significantly affected by supplemented LA. The major impact of the soluble form of LA supplement was found in the bacterial fractions of both ciliate cultures. LA supplementation had a greater effect on fermentation parameters and fatty-acid contents in the EC experimental groups than in the DA groups. Our results suggest that experimental rumen ciliates and their associated bacterial populations had different metabolic responses to the tested form and concentration of supplemented LA.",

In most terrestrial habitats, hydrophilous, soil and even xerophilous testaceans were co-occurring. The likely reason for this phenomenon are sharp seasonal changes in hydrological regime including temporal over-wetting or inundation. Typical members of soil communities were Plagiopyxis callida, Tracheleuglypha acolla, Euglypha cristata, E. tuberculata, Trinema complanatum. The fauna was composed mainly of eurybiont species. Less abundant but still common were moss-dwelling species from the genera Heleopera, Hyalosphenia, Nebela and Sphenoderia. Calciphilous species were also present, including Centropyxis plagiostoma, Geopyxella cf. sylvicola, Schwabia terricola, Plagiopyxis callida, P. intermedia v. cyrtostoma, Heleopera petricola v. humicola. Species from the genera Hoogenraadia, Planhoogenraadia, Apolimia were found in this region of South-East Asia for the first time. The variations in the species composition and diversity of testate amoebae in soils was likely caused by several mechanisms including local variations in hydrological regime, the differences in chemical and physical properties and decomposition rates of plant litter, and mineralogical features of soils. The fauna of lake sediments was very distinct with characteristic species Difflugia bacillariarum, Lesquereusia modesta, Arcella gibbosa, Euglypha acanthophora. In the relatively uniform lake sediments local microcommunities were rich in species but very similar in species composition (low beta-diversity). In contrast, in soil samples the micro-scale heterogeneity was usually very pronounced, though the alpha-diversity was lower than in lake sediments. The updated list of testate amoebae of Vietnam includes 237 taxa. Taxa with restricted geographical distribution form up to one tenth of the total species richness.",

Euplotes balteatus can be identified by the following combination of characters: 10 frontoventral cirri, 2 widely separated marginal cirri, 2 fine caudal cirri, 8 dorsal kineties and a double-eurystomus type silverline system. Its morphogenesis, which is similar to that of several congeners, can be summarized as follows: (1) the opisthe’s oral primordium appears de novo under the pellicle whereas the old oral apparatus is retained by the proter; (2) two groups of frontoventral transverse cirral anlagen, each with five streaks, occur de novo and then develop into the frontoventral and transverse cirri separately according to the formula of “3:3:3:3:2” from left to right; (3) the anlagen for the marginal cirri occur de novo near the parental oral apparatus; (4) migratory cirri of both dividers derive from the anlagen near the paroral membrane; (5) the dorsal kinety anlagen come from dedifferentiation of the parental structures in the mid-body region; (6) caudal cirri are formed at the posterior ends of the two rightmost dorsal kineties. In the light of the present findings, it was concluded that the Antarctic population of E. balteatus reported by Song and Wilbert (2002) was misidentified.

Sixty-seven heterotrophic flagellate species were identified by means of phase and interference contrast light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy.

Most characteristic taxa for the lake sediments were Helkesimastix faecicola, Petalomonas minuta, P. pusilla, Diphylleia rotans, Amastigomonas caudata. Amoeboflagellates such as Cercomonas angustus, C. granulifera, Paracercomonas crassicauda were specific for the terrestrial habitats. There were no specific taxa in the river sediments.

The molecular data based on the small-, large subunit, and internal transcriber spacers ribosomal RNA gene (SSU-, LSU-, ITS rRNA) sequences confirmed P. shikokuense in the Mediterranean Sea. The Mediterranean ribotype is identical to a subtropical North Atlantic ribotype, and with slight divergence from the numerous sequences from the Pacific Ocean.

Initially cells in 1 mM Zn 2+ moved slowly whereas in higher concentrations a dose-dependent number of cells ceased to move exhibiting rocking movements; the cells recovered, however, and regained motility during the lag period. All Zn-treated cells had small refractive granules which increased in number during the lag period, decreased when cell proliferation resumed, and increased again in non-proliferating cells in high density cultures. The endocytic capacity of the cells was elevated in the low concentrations but suppressed dose-dependently in 1-2 mM Zn 2+ , concommitantly with an increase in cells not forming vacuoles (up to 80%), corresponding to the immobile cells mentioned above. Tetrahymena exposed to Zn 2+ in dilute, 1% and 0.5% PP, medium showed the same trend of growth pattern and endocytosis as in 2% PP but at lower Zn concentrations.

A non-thermophilic Naegleria species isolated from an aquarium for ornamental fishes harboured coccoid Gram-negative bacteria of 1µm in diameter as endocytobionts multiplying by binary fission. These intracytoplasmic bacteria, called “KNic” inhibited cy st formation of their host, but not its transformation to the flagellate stage. Consequently the resulting flagellates contained these intracel lular parasites as could be verified by electron microscopy. The endocytic bacteria could not be grown on eight different bacteriological media under va rious atmospheric conditions. The ribbon-like roughly hexagonal surface of the bacteria as shown by SEM is responsible for the spiny appearance a s seen by TEM. The successful axenisation of the infected host amoebae made it possible to harvest pure bacterial suspensions for cocultivatio n assays with different free-living amoebae and Dictyostelium discoideum. As a result, an extremely wide host spectrum of the endocytobionts could be determined including other Naegleria spp., acanthamoebae, and members of the genera Hartmannella, Vahlkampfia, and Balamuthia. Successful infection of four additional Naegleria strains with the coccoid endocytobionts resulted also in impairment of the capability to form cysts but did not interfere with transformation to the flagellate stage. Dictyostelium discoideum as a member of the Acrasiales was also highly susceptible to infection with the Gram-negative bacteria inducing a strong disturbance of their normal aggregation pattern.",

    "abstract": "Summary. We show that the varieties Centropyxis aerophila aerophila, C. aerophila sphagnicola, and C. aerophila sylvatica, described by Deflandre in 1929 and later recorded by many workers worldwide, cannot be distinguished with the features provided in the or iginal descriptions, and even not with refined morphometrical data. Very likely, this applies also to most varieties and forms describ ed later. Some of these taxa are obviously extremes of variability clines, while others are distinct but morphometrically inseparable (sibling ) species or subspecies, as indicated by concrete morphological traits and/or different ecologies. A representative example is the variety sylvatica, which is a distinct species because it has a unique inner pseudostome (ventral lip perforation) produced by material agglutinated on the dorsal and lateral shell wall. This peculiar feature, first recognised by Bonnet and Thomas (1955), is shown by clear light and scanni ng electron micrographs in the present paper. However, the inner pseudostome is recognisable only on refined investigation. Thus, we sugges t to lump taxa, which are morphologically and/or morphometrically difficult to distinguish, into “complexes”, as it has been done in sibl ing ciliate species. This would make testacean alpha-taxonomy more reliable and elegant, especially for field ecologists. Nomenclaturally, the varieties described by Deflandre (1929) are subspecies because he did not unambiguously indicate that the names were proposed for infrasu bspecific entities.",

The ultrastructures of both species well agree with the characteristics approved within Ichthyosporea: walled spores produce uniflagellate zoospores lacking a collar or cortical alveoli. The two Dermocystidium species resemble Rhinosporidium seeberi (as described by light microscope), a member of the nearest relative genus, but differ in that in R. seeberi plasmodia have thousands of nuclei discernible, endospores are discharged through a pore in the wall of the sporangium, and zoospores have not been revealed. The plasmodial stages of both Dermocystidium species have a most unusual behaviour of nuclei, although we do not actually know how the nuclei transform during the development. Early stages have an ordinary nucleus with double, fenestrated envelope. In middle-aged plasmodia ordinary nuclei seem to be totally absent or are only seldom discernible until prior to sporogony, when rather numerous nuclei again reappear. Meanwhile single-membrane vacuoles with coarsely granular content, or complicated membranous systems were discernible. Ordinary nuclei may be re-formed within these vacuoles or systems. In D. percae small canaliculi and in D. fennicum minute vesicles may aid the nucleus-cytoplasm interchange of matter before formation of double-membrane-enveloped nuclei. Dermocystidium represents a unique case when a stage of the life cycle of an eukaryote lacks a typical nucleus.",

However, etiolated algae could not be detected by fluorescent microscopic analyses. Therefore, the absence of symbiotic algae should be confirmed by examining the presence or absence of algal DNA in P. bursaria. In this study, we tried to detect the DNA of symbiotic algae by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using plant genome-specific primers designed to amplify the DNA sequence in the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit (rbcS) encoding gene. Using this technique, it was confirmed that the DNA of endosymbiotic algae was absent in paraquat-treated paramecia.",

Fresh spores are pyriform, measuring 3.1 x 2.3 μm.All stages have unpaired nuclei. Meronts lie in direct contact with degenerate host cell cytoplasm but produce numerous small blisters at the surface. Multinucleate meronts divide by constriction into groups or chains of uninucleate products. Sporogony is initiated by deposition of a dense surface coat on the plasma membrane of uninucleate or multinucleate stages and fusion of blisters to enclose the sporont in a sporophorous vesicle (SV). Episporontal secretions in the SV are involved in the division of the sporont. During sporogonic division into chains of sporoblasts, the SV divides together with the body of the sporont, so that each sporoblast is enclosed in its own SV. Spores have a flattened anchoring disc that lies in the polar sac, membranous and spongiform regions of the polaroplast and 9-10.5 coils of the isofilar polar tube, around a posterior vacuole. The endospore layer of the spore wall is not thinned over the anchoring disc. The spore wall is adorned with a complex series of ridges. New data are presented on the spores of Perezia nelsoni (Sprague 1950) in L. setiferus. Of special interest is the polaroplast which is composed of an outer region of tightly-packed membranes in the form of a globule, which almost invariably completely encloses an inner region of loosely packed membranes. The isofilar polar tube, arranged in 8-10 coils angled around the large nucleus in the posterior half of the spore, passes through the membranes of the globular polaroplast near the periphery of the spore, then runs a curved course through the inner polaroplast and passes again through the globular polaroplast to join the anchoring disc. A polaroplast with one region completely enclosed by another has not been described previously.",

This species has been regarded as firstly branched-off species within this genus, and repo rted its higher genetic variation. We determined rDNA 5’ half regions of 13 strains of P. bursaria, and investigated their intraspecific genetic divergences with comparisons of 18S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2). The 18S rDNA divergence among the strains of P. bursaria reached 1.61% which definitely greater than that of P. caudatum, P. multimicronucleatum and P. aurelia complex, and also greater than some interspecific relations (e.g. between P. jenningsi and P. schewiakoffi). These results seemed to be caused by the strains used for the experiments; we used large number (14) of P. bursaria strains and small number of others (four P. caudatum, three P. multimicronucleatum and three P. aurelia complex strains). Comparison of the ITS2 region using 10 P. bursaria, 13 P. caudatum, 11 P. multimicronucleatum and 18 P. aurelia complex strains showed inverted results: P. multimicronucleatum and P. aurelia complex diverged greater than P. bursaria in the quantitative (number of nucleotide substitutions) as well as the qualitative sense (presence/absence of [hemi-] compensator y base change). Increasing the divergent sequence number occasionally changed the topology of the phylogenetic tree. We re-evaluated the phylog enetic relationships of Paramecium spp. as inferred from 18S rDNA with our 20 added paramecian sequences. The trees indicated that paramecia divided into four lineages: i) P. bursaria, ii) P. duboscqui and P. putrinum, iii) P. calkinsi, P. jenningsi, P. nephridiatum, P. polycaryum, P. woodruffi, and P. aurelia complex, and iv) P. caudatum, P. multimicronucleatum and P. schewiakoffi; in strict correspondence with the latest subgeneric concept of „ Chloroparamecium”, „Helianter”, „Cypriostomum” and „Paramecium”, respectively. „Chloroparamecium” and „Helianter” of which there are similar characteristics were claded, as were „ Cypriostomum” and „Paramecium”.",

We combined molecular and morphological analyses to clarify if the morphospecies Caecitellus parvulus includes genetically as well as ultrastructurally and behaviourally distinguishable species with or without a different geographical distribution. Therefore we compared the ultrastructure, the small subunit of the ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA), the growth rates as well as the locomotion patterns of two strains of C. cf. parvulus isolated from deep sea sediments and from the surface water of the oligotrophic Angola Basin, South Atlantic. The reconstruction of the kinetid architecture of two strains of C. cf. parvulus revealed differences in the number of microtubules in flagellar root 3, which surrounds the oral region and forms the cytoskeleton of the feeding basket. The number of microtubules in this region is also different from the description given earlier in the literature for Caecitellus parvulus. Additionally, there are significant differences between the two studied strains in the length of their posterior flagellum, their locomotion velocity and their moving pattern as well as in their growth rates. These observations, together with the results of the molecular comparison of the SSU rDNA of 11 different strains of Caecitellus, suggest the existence of at least three distinguishable species. Our results indicate cryptic speciation within the morphospecies Caecitellus parvulus. We describe two new Caecitellus species, i.e. Caecitellus paraparvulus and Caecitellus pseudoparvulus, which have been newly established within a Caecitellus-complex.",

The cyst wall consists of five distinct layers (from inside to outside): metacyst, endocyst, mesocyst, ectocyst, and the pericyst, a new term for all materials produced by the encysting cell and deposited upon the ectocyst. Structurally, the five layers of the Meseres cyst are similar to those of the stichotrichine (e.g., Oxytricha) and phacodinine (Phacodinium) spirotrichs, except of the thin ectocyst which is not lamellar but coarsely granular. The ectomesocyst likely corresponds to the chitin layer demonstrated by the Van Wisselingh colour test. The lepidosomes are within the fluffy, mucous pericyst whose proximal zone forms a reticulate, membrane-like structure on the ectoc yst. The mucus consists of very fine filaments with a diameter of about 3 nm, while the lepidosomes are composed of fibres about 20 nm a cross. The encysted cell is similar to other kinetosome-resorbing ciliate cysts, except of curious inclusions possibly related to the lepidosomes. The data are compared with respect to the classification of the halteriids. While the general wall structure indicates a sticho trichine relationship, the ectocyst, the lepidosomes, and the chitin layer in the cyst wall suggest the halteriids as a distinct group m ore closely related to the oligotrichine than stichotrichine spirotrichs.",

These species have shown various levels of intraspecificpolymorphism in previous RAPD, RFLP and ARDRA analyses, i.e. Paramecium dodecaurelia (high intraspecific polymorphism),P. quadecaurelia and P. tredecaurelia (no intraspecific polymorphism). Studies were performed on six strains of P. dodecaurelia and in twostrains each (only available) of P. tredecaurelia and P. quadecaurelia , originating from geographically remote collecting sites. Alignment ofboth rDNA gene fragments containing 3’SSU rRNA-ITS1 and 5’ LSU rRNA revealed a distinct polymorphism within P. dodecaurelia, i.esix polymorphic sites were found in a fragment of rDNA at the 3’ end of SSU rRNA-ITS1, only one site differentiating strains ofP. tredecaurelia, and no changes in P. quadecaurelia. Similarly, at 5’ LSU several polymorphisms characteristic for the particular strainsof P. dodecaurelia were observed, three polymorphic sites when two strains of P. tredecaurelia were compared, and one polymorphic sitein the case of two strains of P. quadecaurelia . Neighbor- joining and maximum parsimony phylogenies showed that P. dodecaurelia strainsare scattered, particular strains differ as much as different species of the P. aurelia complex. Our present study confirmed previous results(RAPD, RFLP, and ARDRA analyses) which revealed such exceptional intraspecific differentiation in P. dodecaurelia.

Neokeronopsis asiatica nov. spec. differs from N. spectabilis (Kahl, 1932) by the following features: body size (~300×120 μm vs 400×170 μm), posterior body end (acute with distinct indentation at site of caudal cirri vs. broadly rounded and without or indistinct indentation); posterior end of marginal rows (ending at different vs. same or similar level); dorsal kinety 1 (continuous vs. fragmented); and the size of the bases of the adoral membranelles (largest membranelles on average 18 μm vs. 29 μm wide). Improved diagnoses are provided for the family Neokeronopsidae and the genera contained therein, viz., Neokeronopsis, Afrokeronopsis, and Pattersoniella. Our study shows the importance of depositing type and voucher material in recognized repositories. Only this will allow future researchers to restudy the populations, for the sake of improved taxonomic and biogeographic knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Testate amoebae are routinely used as paleoenvironmental indicators. However, considerable variability occurs in test morphology, even within commonly identified taxa. Relationships between morphological variability and environmental conditions might be useful in paleohydrological studies of peatlands, assuming good preservation of characteristics. Hyalosphenia papilio is a common taxon, well preserved in Sphagnum peatlands, that displays variability in the number of pores on the broad side of the test. We assessed whether variability in pore number was related to substrate moisture by comparing the abundance of individuals with different numbers of pores to measured water-table depths at 67 sites in North America. Results indicated that the abundance of individuals with higher numbers of pores increased in wetter conditions. Individuals with 2 pores were relatively widespread, although they dominated drier habitats. Transfer functions developed with and without pore-number quantification suggest that when communities contain abundant individuals with greater than 2 pores, water-table depth reconstructions can be improved by including pore-number information. Results have implications for peatland paleohydrological studies and suggest that greater exploitation of morphological variability could improve testate amoeba-based reconstructions of past environmental change.",

    "abstract": "This essay introduces the special issue of this journal on the ecology of soil protists. This issue marks approximately the first 100 years of soil protistology as a discipline as some of the first studies to show that protozoa were an important part of soil ecology took place at Rothamsted, in southern England, towards the end of the first decade of the twentieth century. Much of the work on soil protists – and indeed the papers in this special issue – concentrate on traditional protozoa. In addition it is now realised that slime molds (Eumycetozoans) can potentially make an important contribution to the numbers and diversity of soil amoebae. We also argue that diatoms and other algae are likely important in soils and in need of more detailed study. By its nature microbiology (including soil protist ecology) is a science limited by technology – for example the subject could not really exist before the invention of the microscope. We suggest ways in which newer technologies (molecular methods, stable isotopes etc) may contribute to future studies on the ecology of soil protists.",

Four different kinetid types are found in protargol-stained choreotrichids and used for reconstructing the taxon's evolution (the \"Kinetid Transformation Hypothesis\"). Proof for this hypothesis requires transmission electron microscopic studies, which are very rare in the choreotrichids and oligotrichids. Such an approach provides insights into the ultrastructural variability of somatic kinetids in spirotrichs and may also detect apomorphies characterising certain choreotrichid families.

These scales have species-specific morphology and, since they present in the trophic stage of the cell cycle can be termed “trophic” scales. Several species are known to form cysts; during this process they can produce specific “cyst” scales, different from trophic scales. The present paper describes morphology of cyst scales in two species of centrohelid heliozoans: Raineriophrys erinaceoides and Raphidiophrys heterophryoidea. The latter species has two types of cyst scales: scales of the first type resemble trophic scales in general structure but, their borders are broad, flattened and not enrolled. Scales of the second type are polygonal and connected to each other by special teeth, forming a single layer organized in a jig-saw puzzle-like manner. In Raineriophrys erinaceoides only one type of cyst scale was found. These scales are polygonal and completely different from trophic scales. It is unclear whether these scales form a puzzle-like layer or just overlap each other. Newly excysted individuals keep remnants of cyst scales in their cell coverings and at this stage cyst scales can easily be noted. The morphology of the cyst scales reported here is unlike any other previously reported.",

Research on testate amoebae has increased dramatically in recent years but there are still large parts of the world which have seen very little research. Here we consider testate amoeba communities of the West Siberian Lowland, the world’s largest peatland region and therefore one of the largest potential habitats for testate amoebae. Extensive sampling identified 89 taxa and showed that testate amoeba communities are structured by their physical and biological environment. We identified significant relationships between amoeba communities and both moisture content and vegetation composition. Despite the assemblages containing many widely-distributed species, some taxa considered typical of peatlands (e.g. Archerella flavum and Hyalosphenia papilio) were comparatively rare or absent, paralleling findings further south in Asia. We suggest that testate amoebae in this region deserve further study and may have useful applications in palaeoecological reconstruction and as bioindicators of the impacts of oil and gas extraction.",

Molecular data also indicate a close relationship between Cercozoa and Foraminifera (Granuloreticulosea). Little is known, however, about the origin of both groups and their phylogenetic relationships. Here we present the complete small-subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) sequence of Gymnophrys cometa, formerly included in the athalamid Granuloreticulosea, as well as that of the test-bearing filose amoeba Lecythium sp. Our study shows that the two organisms clearly belong to the Cercozoa, and indicates that Gymnophrys is not closely related to Foraminifera, supporting the view that Granuloreticulosea sensu lato do not form a natural assemblage. Phylogenetic analyses including most available SSU rRNA sequences from Cercozoa suggest that a rigid, external cell envelope appeared several times independently during the evolution of the group. Furthermore, our results bring additional evidence for the wide morphological variety among Cercozoa, which now also include protists bearing granular pseudopodia and exhibiting mitochondria with flattened cristae.",

The morphology and morphogenesis of the marine ciliate, Pseudokeronopsis rubra (Ehrenberg, 1838) isolated from shrimp culturing water of Qingdao (Tsingtao, China), are investigated using protargol silver impregnation. The Qingdao population presents the following characteristics: body slim and reddish, size in vivo 160-200 x 24-40 µm, with longitudinal furrow on the ventral side; brick-red pigments constituting rosettes on dorsal side and ventral arrays along the base of cirri; blood cell-like cortical granules throughout the endoplasm. AZM consisting of 46-60 membranelles; long midventral row with 30 pairs of cirri on average; 2-4 transverse cirri and 4-6 dorsal kineties. The overall pattern of the morphogenetic events resembles the other populations described previously: in the opisthe new basal bodies originate close to intact left midventral cirri; the adoral membranelles primordia (AMP), undulating membranes anlagen (UMA) and fronto-midventral-cirral anlagen (FMA) develop from the growing anarchic primordium. In the proter, the AMP and UMA generate de novo on the surface of the buccal cavity. The FMA originate apokinetally to the right of the parental paroral membrane. The UMA generate the first frontal cirrus, PM and EM in both daughter cells as in other hypotrichs. The AMP, UMA and FMA develop in a usual way as in other urostylids. Marginal cirral rows and dorsal kineties occur within the parental structures. The numerous macronuclear segments divide without prior fusion. Reorganization corresponds to the divisional processes in the opisthe. The most remarkable feature is that the old structures do not participate in the formation of the new organelles.",

Diagnosis for Pseudokeronopsis pararubra sp. n.: Marine Pseudokeronopsis, long elliptical in outline, 180-350x50-90 μm in vivo and dark reddish in colour. Ciliature comprising: 64-92 adoral membranelles; bicorona of 15-26 frontal cirri; 1 buccal and 2 frontoterminal cirri; 7-1 transverse cirri; two midventral rows comprising 62-93 cirri and extending to transverse cirri; 48-79 left and 46-80 right marginal cirri; 5-8 dorsal kineties. Numerous (> 100) macronuclear segments. Two types of cortical granules: one orange-red pigment, mainly grouped around cirri and dorsal bristles; the other, colourless and blood-cell-shaped, lying just beneath the former and densely distributed. The morphogenetic process corresponds well with those of its congeners. The most notable point is that the fronto-midventral transverse cirral anlagen never develop in connection with new oral primordium at posterior portion during divisional process in the proter. Supplementary comparison of Amphisiella annulata with some marine congeners has been provided in this study. Some morphogenetic and reorganizational stages show that its stomatogenesis seems to be similar to that of its congeners, i.e. the oral primordium originates parakinetally from the amphisiellid median cirral row (ACR) in the opisthe, and the old adoral zone of membranelles seems to be retained completely by the proter. Usually only 6 cirral anlagen (including the anlage for undulating membrane) develop. In the proter, the undulating membranes, the buccal cirrus and cirri left of the ACR provides three streaks, other two anlagen derive from the ACR. In the opisthe, the oral primordium produces the anlage for the undulating membranes and very likely three cirral streaks; the other two anlagen also occur within ACR. The new ACR is formed by alignment of the two rightmost cirral anlagen.",

    "abstract": "Summary. Nosema locustae is a pathogen of orthopterans with an unusually wide host range. It is the only microsporidian that has been developed as a microbial control agent. In spite of its practical importance the ultrastructure of N. locustae life stages other than spores, has not been studied. The insects used in this study, all in the family Acrididae, were the Migratory locust, Locusta migratoria migratorioides (Oedipodinae), the South American locust, Schistocerca cancellata (Cyrtacanthacridinae), and the grasshopper Dichroplus schulzi (Melanoplinae). All insects were reared routinely in the laboratory. The spores of N. locustae used for the experimental peroral inoculations were all of North American origin. Fat body cells were the predominant site of parasite development, though infection of tracheal epithelium cells and haemocytes also occurred. Ultrastructure of meronts, sporonts, sporoblasts and spores is described. The fine morphology of N. locustae stages is typical for microsporidians of the genus Nosema. Nuclei were always in diplokaryotic arrangement. Transition from meront to sporont was characterized by striking changes in parasite ultrastructure: appearance of electron dense granules (50-100 nm in diameter, presumable RNP complexes) in the nucleoplasm, and stacks of ER cisternae and prominent vacuoles in cytoplasm. The beginning of sporogony was marked by an increase in size of parasite cells due to extensive vacuolization. Tubule-like structures appeared in the host cell cytoplasm during parasite sporogony. Elongated conglomerates of electron dense material were scattered in the host cell and eventually ornamented the outersurface of the parasite membrane, forming an electron dense layer around sporonts. Spores were diplokaryotic, measured 4.95 ‐ 0.07 x 2.65 ‐ 0.04 µm (mean ‐ SE, n=24) on fresh smears and 3.49 ‐ 0.18 x 1.73 ‐ 0.04 µm (n = 10) on ultrathin sections, and had electron-dense cytoplasm in which all internal structures typical of microsporidian spores were recognizable. The polaroplast was lamellar, the endospore was 200-300 nm thick, and the exospore was 40-50 nm. The polar filament was isofilar, arranged in 17-18 coils. Our study did not reveal any difference in the morphology of N. locustae while developing in the three different hosts.",

This is the first of a series of papers describing the morphology and ontogenesis of new ciliates occurring in the cisterns of tank bromeliads, a group of rosette plants of tropical America, entrapping rainwater between the coalescing leaf axils. Likely, most of these new ciliates have a restricted (Gondwanan) geographic distribution, and some might even be specific inhabitants of tank bromeliads. Bromeliophrya brasiliensis gen. n., sp. n. was discovered in the tanks of ground bromeliads at the east coast (Mata Atlantica) of Brazil, South America. Its morphology and ontogenesis were investigated using live observation, silver impregnation, and scanning electron microscopy. Bromeliophrya belongs to the hymenostome ciliate order Tetrahymenida, where it represents a new family, Bromeliophryidae fam. n., unique by the partially reduced somatic ciliature and migrating somatic kinety fragments during ontogenesis. The oral apparatus, especially a patch (“X-group”) of basal bodies originating from the anterior end of adoral membranelle 2, indicates the Glaucomidae as the nearest relatives of the Bromeliophryidae. Further main characteristics of B. brasiliensis are: (i) a metopid body shape and ciliary pattern; (ii) two large, unciliated areas: one left of the oral opening, the other with barren basal bodies occupies the right posterior half of the cell; (iii) elongated caudal cilia; (iv) silverlines projecting loop-like in the right side kineties; (v) a large, C-shaped adoral membranelle 3 forming a ring-like oral pattern with membranelle 1 at left margin of buccal cavity; and (vi) an unciliated paroral membrane.",

This species shows a great diversity in total length, collar height and aboral horn length which have high variability (CV between 11.76 and 24.52). However, body width, collar diameter, neck width, body length and aperture diameter are fairly constant with low variability (CV between 5.34 and 8.79) which shows a remarkable uniformity of D. biwae. Also, the size frequency distributions of both body width and body length yield bell-shaped (normally distributed) curves and indicate that D. biwae is a size-monomorphic species, characterized by a main-size class and a small size range. D. biwae is probably endemic to East Asia (China and Japan) because it has such a large size (165-306 mu m) that it would have been easily found in Europe and North America, if it were there. Consequently, D. biwae must have a restricted geographical distribution, disproving the old hypothesis that microscopic organisms are cosmopolitan.",

    "abstract": "Summary. Characteristics found in morphogenetic process of the Uronychia setigera Calkins, 1902 during binary division and the molecular data of several euplotid genera inferred from 18S rRNA gene sequence analyses are compared and discussed. The results indicate that the traditional order Euplotida might comprise 3 paraphyletic groups: the eueuplotids, i.e. euplotids with a 5-cirral anlagen mode and a subcortical origin of the oral primordium during morphogenesis (we call them the “typical” euplotids in the text), gastrocirrhids (the pseudoeuplotids) and discocephalids, the last of which is possibly a convergent lineage. The results suggest also that Uronychia represents a primitive type within typical euplotids in phylogeny. Based on these analyses, a conclusion is suggested which consists of essentially the following points: (1) The traditional euplotids are likely a paraphyletic assemblage with differently originated groups. As a suggestion based on the new definition, the euplotids s. l. contains at least 2 subgroups: the eueuplotids and the sister group, gastrocirrhids (pseudoeuplotids) with multianlagen mode which is a divergent or apomorphic feature. (2) The systematic position of discocephaline remains unclear, but possibly an intermediate group between the euplotids s. str. and stichotrichs. We agree, however, that it is presently placed within the order Euplotida, as an outer group of other two assemblages. (3) The morphogenetic feature of 5-cirral-anlagen-mode is highly conservative and should be hence weighted with more phylogenetic value(s) in systematic analysis. (4) We suppose that some features like the origin mode of the leftmost frontal (formed from the UM-anlage), the situation of undulating membranes (e.g. two in number, curved in appearance) represent apomorphic features, and should not be over-evaluated, which caused often the diverse structures of the phylogenetic trees. (5) Euplotids s. str. might be derived from the 5-anlagen ancestor-type of hypotrichs s. l., which is possibly also the ancestor of the current stichotrichs.

    "abstract": "Summary. The morphology and the morphogenesis of the marine hypotrich Uroleptopsis citrina Kahl, type of Uroleptopsis Kahl, were investigated using live observation and protargol impregnation. The results are used for a redefinition of Uroleptopsis and a phylogenetic analysis of the Pseudokeronopsidae. Each of the many macronuclear nodules of U. citrina divides individually as in Pseudokeronopsis spp., that is, the nodules do not fuse to a single mass. Consequently, Uroleptopsis, Pseudokeronopsis, and Thigmokeronopsis - which shows an intermediate type of macronuclear division - are united to the Pseudokeronopsidae. Uroleptopsis has three autapomorphies, namely the lack of transverse cirri, the formation of two cirri from the undulating membrane anlage, and a gap in the adoral zone. Uroleptopsis ignea has midventral rows which are the autapomorphy for the new subgenus Uroleptopsis (Plesiouroleptopsis). Uroleptopsis (Uroleptopsis), which contains the four other Uroleptopsis species, lacks a buccal cirrus in the ordinary position right of the paroral; in non-dividers this cirrus is part of the posterior bow of the bicorona. In U. citrina some cirral anlagen of the middle portion of the midventral complex do not form an ordinary cirral pair, but only a single midventral cirrus. Keronopsis tannaensis Shigematsu is transferred to Uroleptopsis because it lacks transverse cirri and has likely a bicorona. Keronopsis multiplex Ozaki and Yagiu is synonymized with U. roscoviana (Maupas). A key to the five Uroleptopsis species is provided and the terminology for urostylids is actualized. The Uroleptopsis citrina population from the Adriatic Sea is designated as neotype because (i) no preparations are available of the original type population, and ( ii) synonymy with Pseudokeronopsis rubra and some other species was proposed by Borror (1979) and Borror and Wicklow (1983).",

Beetles were repeatedly collected from three logs of trap trees during 2009 and 2010 at one study site in the Czech Republic with a high level of G. typographi infection (seasonal mean of 15.7% in 2009 and 19.8% in 2010).

Strains of the genus Acanthamoeba are usually assigned to sequence types or genotypes according to pair-wise similarity values of the nuclear gene for the small subunit of ribosomal RNA. This classification system was established by comparing full or nearly full gene sequences, > 2000 bp. For practical reasons, diagnostic fragments of smaller lengths have been identified and used for rapid and economic identification of large number of strains. While the use of these small fragments in diagnostics applications remains valid when and only if the reference full sequence-type is available, we contest their use to identify and describe new genotypes. We report herein the case of a new genotype described on the basis of solely a small partial sequence and discuss the poor reliability of this fragment to correctly infer phylogenetic relationships, and its limits in the description of new genotypes of Acanthamoeba.",

    "abstract": "A fish-infecting myxosporean was found in the urinary bladder of the teleostean Colomesus psittacus, collected from the Amazon River, Brazil. Specimens were sampled in three different periods: May and June, with water temperature ranging from 18-23oC; August, with water temperature ranging from 24-28oC; and November and December, with water temperature ranging from 29-32oC. Upon observation, several fish displayed abnormal behaviour, consisting of erratic movements, and mortality was recorded among them. Necropsy of all sampled fishes revealed hypertrophy of the urinary bladder only among specimens previously displaying the irregular behaviour. Microscopic analysis of this organ confirmed the parasitic infection, resulting in the observation of spores floating free in the urine, and numerous plasmodia attached to the epithelium of the urinary bladder. Light and ultrastructural studies allowed recognition of the spores and plasmodia morphological characteristics. Coelozoic plasmodia were polysporic with varying organizational structure, according to the sampling period. Spores were equilaterally triangular with rounded ends in valvar view, measuring 8.8 ± 0.4 μm (n = 30) in length and 8.4 ± 0.5 μm (n = 30) in width, and displaying a ridge surface pattern. Two polar capsules were observed in the anterior end of the spores, measuring 3.1-3.2 μm in diameter. The spores were morphologically identified as belonging to the recently described genus Triangulamyxa. Further observation and comparison to the morphological features described for Triangulamyxa amazonica, the only other species within this genus, allowed us to conclude our parasite as a new species, herein named Triangulamyxa psittaca sp. nov. from the Amazon River, Brazil. Also, three different stages were distinguished in the plasmodium evolution, based on the observed morphological features at the three sampling periods. Fish sampled during May and June displayed small plasmodia (up to ~ 15-20 μm long), containing early stages of sporogenic development. Fish sampled during November and December presented larger plasmodia (up to ~ 850 μm long), which appeared flattened against and lining the urinary bladder epithelial cells and contained the later stages of sporogenic development, including some mature spores. Fish sampled during August presented plasmodia displaying intermediate morphological features between those observed in infected fish from the other sampling periods. Several immature and mature spores were among the different developmental stages. The parasite-host interface evolution is described throughout the different observed stages, with emphasis on the formation of septate junctions. Considering several previous reports, as well as the different environmental conditions during the sampling periods, the plasmodium development here described appears to be influenced by environmental factors, namely water temperature.",

Resting cysts were investigated using light microscopy, SEM and TEM. The cyst wall is composed of four distinct layers (from inside to outside), namely the metacyst, the endocyst, the mesocyst and the ectocyst with spine-like protuberances. The cysts of R. quadrinucleata belong to the kinetosome-resorbing (KR) type, which is typical for oxytrichids. The processes of encystation and excystation were observed only in the light microscopy. During the encystation process, the trophic cell changes in shape and volume due to dehydration, four macronuclear nodules fuse into a compact mass, the ciliature is resorbed and cyst wall is formed. The most significant feature is surface ornamentation and yellowish color of resting cysts. We also focuse for the first time on excystation process of R. quadrinucleata. We identified two excystation modes: (i) standard and (ii) rare mode. The beginning of both excystation is characterised by the formation of excystation vacuole which helps the excysting cell to break the cyst wall. The specimen regenerates within a thin, flexible membrane. During the standard mode, the cell leaves the resting cyst in the membrane that is resorbed in the environment. During the rare mode, the excystation vacuole and the pressure of the regenerating cell break the transparent membrane that remains in the resting cyst. The results suggest that not only ciliate resting cysts, but also the excystation process is much more variable than what literature data indicate.",

Testate amoebae are useful bioindicators of hydrological changes, but little experimental work has been done on the impact of water table changes on communities. Using a mesocosm experimental setting that was previously used to assess the impact of drought disturbance on communities and ecosystem processes with three contrasted water table positions: wet (–4 cm), intermediate (–15 cm) and dry (–25 cm), we studied the capacity of testate amoeba communities to recover when the water table was kept at –10 cm for all plots. The overall experiment lasted three years. We assessed the taxonomic and functional trait responses of testate amoeba communities. The selected traits were hypothesised to be correlated to moisture content (response traits: shell size, aperture position) or trophic role (effect traits: mixotrophy, aperture size controlling prey range). During the disturbance phase, the mixotrophic species Hyalosphenia papilio dominated the wet and intermediate plots, while the community shifted to a dominance of “dry indicators” (Corythion dubium, Nebela tincta, Cryptodifflugia oviformis) and corresponding traits (loss of mixotrophy, and dominance of smaller taxa with ventral or ventral-central aperture) in dry plots. During the recovery phase we observed two contrasted trends in the previously wet and intermediate plots: communities remained similar where the Sphagnum carpet remained intact but species and traits indicators of drier conditions increased in plots where it had degraded. In the former dry plots, indicators and traits of wet conditions increased by the end of the experiment. This is one of the first experiment simulating a disturbance and subsequent recovery in ex-situ mesocosms of Sphagnum peatland focusing on the response of testate amoebae community structure as well as functional traits to water table manipulation. The results generally confirmed that testate amoebae respond within a few months to hydrological changes and thus represent useful bioindicators for assessing current and past hydrological changes in Sphagnum peatlands.",

Molecular characterization of tintinnid ciliates has revealed the occurrence of cryptic species, genetically distinct forms with similar loricas, as well as polymorphic species in which genetically identical forms have distinct loricas. Among this latter category may be forms currently recognized as species of the genus Salpingacantha, erected by Kofoid and Campbell for forms originally described as varieties of species of Salpingella with ‘teeth’ on the margin of the lorica oral opening. Some workers have expressed the opinion that the genus is artificial and notably a recent molecular study suggested that Salpingella and Salpingacantha are likely synonyms. In this short communication we report on finding morphologically distinct loricas (containing ciliate cells) of Salpingacantha in single samples from stations in the North Pacific and Arctic Oceans in 2010, 2015 and 2016. We found up to 5 distinct Salpingacantha forms co-occurring, often with abundant Salpingella acuminata populations suggesting that some Salpingacantha species may be varieties of Salpingella acuminata. While we lack genetic data needed for definitive proof of polymorphism, here we document remarkable gradual gradients in morphology suggestive of polymorphism.",

This organism is morphologically very similar to the well-known  Euplotes eurystomus  but differs from the latter both in the number of dorsal kineties and the molecular data. According to the information obtained, it is characterized by a combination of features including nine frontoventral cirri, ca. 60 membranelles, 12–15 dorsal kineties, a macronucleus in the shape of the number 3, and a ‘double- eurystomus ’ type of silverline system. Its morphogenesis proceeds broadly in the same pattern as in its congeners. In this study, the SSU rRNA gene was sequenced for the first time, and phylogenetic analyses indicated that it is closely related to the  eurystomus-aediculatus-woodruffi-  complex. Considering the extreme similarities in morphology between  E. amieti  and  E. eurystomus , we believe that the four sequences (four isolates) under the name of  Euplotes eurystomus  (No. FR873716; FR873717; EF193250; AJ310491 deposited in GenBank) are very likely from misidentified material; that is, they represent different populations of  Euplotes amieti .",

    "abstract": "We investigated interrelationships between four free-living litostomatean lineages, using 18S rRNA gene and ITS region sequences as well as the secondary structure of the ITS2 molecules. Our phylogenetic analyses confirmed the deep split of free-living litostomateans into Rhynchostomatia and Haptoria represented here by Haptorida, Pleurostomatida, and Spathidiida. This bifurcation is also corroborated by the signature of the rhynchostomatian and haptorian ITS2 molecules. Specifically, the consensus stems of helices II and III are longer by one base pair in Rhynchostomatia, while the terminal loops of both helices are longer by one or two nucleotide/-s in Haptoria. A close relationship of Pleurostomatida and Haptorida is favored by quartet likelihood-mapping and supported by a 5’-AG vs. CU-3’ motif in the variable part of helix II and by two morphological apomorphies, i.e., meridionally extending somatic kineties and a non-three-rowed dorsal brush. Although monophyletic origin of Spathidiida is poorly supported in phylogenetic trees, the unique motif 5’-GA vs. UC-3’ present in the consensus helix II stem could be an important molecular synapomorphy of spathidiids, apart from the ancestrally anteriorly curved somatic kineties and the three-rowed dorsal brush. The peculiar family Pseudoholophryidae has very likely found its phylogenetic home among spathidiids, as an early branching lineage.",

Despite their ecological importance, their diversity and spatial distribution in Philippine landscapes remains understudied. Hence, this study randomly collected foliar litter on five timber upland forests and five coastal lowland forests to capture the range of microhabitats that may influence protosteloid diversity and investigate the spatial distribution of protosteloid amoebae across a ridge-to-reef ecosystem in San Fernando City, La Union, Philippines. Using established laboratory protocols and morphological examination, the following results were revealed: (i) eleven determinable species belonging to seven genera reflected a moderate sampling effort for the study, (ii) species diversity of protosteloid amoebae was higher in the upland than in the lowland but almost the same when microhabitats (aerial vs ground) were compared, and (iii) there were more similarities in composition in terms of substrates rather than elevation. These findings suggest that the distribution between upland and coastal lowland habitats is affected by possible ecological gradients and habitat specificity playing a vital role in shaping protist communities. This study highlights the urgent need for management strategies to protect unique microhabitats along the Philippine ridge-to-reef ecosystems and preserve the region's hidden microbial biodiversity.",

We conducted a 35-month field experiment using pig carcasses (Sus scrofa Linnaeus) in a deciduous forest in Switzerland to characterise the impact of decomposing cadavers on the diversity and community composition of soil micro-eukaryotes by high throughput sequencing of soil environmental DNA. The diversity of soil microbial eukaryotes strongly declined under decomposing cadavers. Several taxa which were rare in control soils became more abundant in cadaver-impacted soils. The clear temporal succession and turnover in soil microbial eukaryote diversity and community structure underneath cadavers offers potential for inferring the PMI. The diversity of soil micro-eukaryotes remains poorly documented, especially in under-studied habitats such as cadaver-impacted soils. Characterising this \"rare biosphere\" diversity will help better understand cadaver impacts on terrestrial ecosystems and is necessary to develop new PMI tools.",

    "abstract": "Summary. The rumen ciliate protozoan Epidinium ecaudatum was isolated from rumen fluid of sheep and either grown in vitro or inoculated into the rumen of the ciliate-free sheep. Population density of ciliates in vitro was about 320 cells/ml when culture salt solution was supplemented with hay (0.6 mg/ml/d) and wheat gluten (0.15 mg/mg/d). Addition of the microcrystalline cellulose (0.25 mg/ml/d) to the control diet increased the ciliate numbers to about 440 cells/ml (P < 0.01). Conversely, oat spelt xylan decreased the concentration of protozoa to 250 cells/ml (P < 0.05). Ciliates readily ingested and digested cellulose particles while xylan particles were only sporadically engulfed. Only glucose was released from the microcrystalline cellulose and cellobiose during incubation of the both substrates with protozoal protein; the release rate was 0.19 and 14.9 µM/mg protein/h, respectively. Carboxymethylcellulose and xylan were degraded at 17.5 and 66.6 µM reducing sugars released from substrate/mg protein/ml. Degradation rate of microcrystalline cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, cellobiose and xylan was the highest at pH 6.5, 5.5, 6.0 and 6.5, respectively. Non-denaturating polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis combined with CMC-ase and xylanase zymogram revealed the presence of three protein bands active against CMC and two protein bands degrading xylan. Thin layer chromatography showed a presence of only oligosaccharides in the end products released from CMC and xylan by enzymes isolated from gel slices. Neither glucose nor xylose were found there. Conversely only glucose was detected by TLC following incubation of microcrystalline cellulose with solution of protozoal protein. The same preparation released mainly xylose from xylan but different oligosaccharides were also present.",

Data on the morphology, size, their hosts, and the prevalence and intensity of invasion of each of these parasite species were gathered. The most commonly found parasite species were: H. belopolskyi, H. lanii, H. balmorali, and H. payevskyi. Two parasite species encountered very rarely in the Palearctic Zone: H. velans and H. caprimulgi, were also found. The prevalence of the invasion was especially high (up to 66.7%, n=30) in the case of H. lanii in the host genus Lanius (Laniidae). The total prevalence of the invasion of the birds studied was 18.5%. The highest prevalence found in the shrike family (Laniidae): 66.7% (n=30). A high rate was also found in the flycatcher family (Muscicapidae): 27.3% (n=33); the warbler family (Sylviidae): 22.8% (n=351); and the thrush family (Turdidae): 15.0% (n=81). The lowest rate was established in the sparrow family (Ploceidae): 3.45% (n=58). The highest rate of prevalence was found during spring, with a maximum in May (an average of 37.8%). Locally nesting migratory birds were more commonly invaded (a prevalence of 25.3%) than locally resident birds (5.8%). Spring migrants were also more frequently invaded (31.4%) than fall migrants (13.3%). Most invasions were of low intensity (between 1 and 10 parasites per 100 microscope fields at magnification 2000x). In only a few instances intensive invasions were observed; for example, in the host genus Lanius (Laniidae), between 200 and 330 parasites per 100 microscope fields were noted.",

    "abstract": "The unicellular flagellate Euglena gracilis orients itself in the water column by means of pronounced phototaxis and gravitaxis. The antagonism of phototaxis and gravitaxis brings the cells in a position in the water column providing them with optimal light conditions for their photosynthetic apparatus (about 30 Wm^(-2)). Long exposure to solar or artificial radiation induces a loss of the negative gravitactic orientation in Euglena gracilis or very often a pronounced, persistent (＞4 h) sign change in gravitaxis. The effects on gravitaxis are exclusively due to UV and intensive blue light as experiments with different light qualities revealed. This phenomenon is not caused by the phototaxis photoreceptor or chloroplast processes, because also the colorless and blind (no photoreceptor) Euglena gracilis 1f mutant and Astasia longa reverse the sign of gravitaxis upon strong radiation. The sign change is oxygen-dependent, because gravitaxis is not affected in oxygen free medium (in wild type Euglena gracilis, as well as in the 1f mutant and Astasia longa). This indicates the involvement of oxygen radicals as a trigger of gravitaxis sign reversal. As the destruction of the photoreceptor molecules by light leads to a loss of phototaxis, the switch from negative to positive gravitaxis might be an adaptation mechanism of the cells to escape from deleterious radiation even after loss of the ability to perceive the light direction.",

The fish were collected in the Poty River, near the city of Teresina (State of Piaui, Brazil). Large spherical to ellipsoidal plasmodia up to 0.5 mm were filled with disporic pansporoblasts and mature spores. The plasmodial wall presented a sinuous outline surrounded by several fibroblasts and a continuous layer of numerous collagen fibrils. The plasmodia contained different proliferative stages. Early sporogenic cells were present in the cortical zone. Immature and mature spores were located more internally. Ellipsoidal spores measured 8.6±0.5 μm (n=30) length, 7.2±0.5 μm (n=15) width, and 2.7±0.4 μm (n=12) thickness. The anterior end of the spores contained two equal pyriform polar capsules measuring 3.5±0.3 μm (n=15) length, 1.7±0.4 μm (n=10) width, each with an isofilar polar filament with 5-6 turns obliquely to the longitudinal axis. The wall of the polar capsule was filled with a hyaline substance contrasting with the very dense internal matrix. The spores consisted of two equal valves forming the wall. The spore wall was surrounded by a dense and uniform layer with variable thickness (up to 0.6 μm) consisting of a complicated network of anastomosed microfibrils closely adhered to the wall. More externally, in the plasmodial matrix, the fibrils formed a looser network. Based on the ultrastructural morphology and specificity to the host species, we propose the creation of a new species, named Myxobolus testicularis sp. n.",

In a study of six urban woodlands in the Liverpool area of north west England, the presence of Rhododendron was found to apparently modify the community of testate amoebae living in the soil. A comparison of paired soil samples (Rhododendron soil and non-Rhododendron soil) from each of six broadleaved woods showed a smaller number of testate amoebae taxa in Rhododendron affected soils, along with a smaller total number of individual testate amoebae. A hierarchical classifi cation of the testate amoeba communities using TWINSPAN analysis showed a clear difference between soils from under Rhododendron and Rhododendron-free soils. In this study testate community composition was a more sensitive indicator of environmental differences between sites than a simple comparison of total number of individual testate amoebae. This study provides circumstantial evidence of a role for Rhododendron leaf chemistry in affecting soil living microbes and also provides a case study of the utility of technically straightforward testate amoebae analysis in environmental monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Summary. Trichomonas vaginalis can be infected with double stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses known as T. vaginalis virus (TVV). This viral infection may have important implications for trichomonal virulence and disease pathogenesis. The objective of this study was to determine the possible clinical significance of dsRNA viral infection of Trichomonas vaginalis, by determining whether the presence of dsRNA virus infection was associated with particular features of clinical presentation. Forty T. vaginalis isolates were obtained from among 575 adolescent females studied. Laboratory tests were conducted on samples from all the patients, for the diagnosis T. vaginalis and for the presence of others sexually transmitted microorganisms. Patients diagnosed with T. vaginalis infection were included in the study; patients diagnosed with other sexually transmitted microorganism were excluded. Medical doctors recorded the principal clinical symptoms and signs associated with trichomoniasis. The presence of T. vaginalis virus (TVV) was determined from total extraction of nucleic acids (DNA-RNA). Fisher’s exact test was used to test for associations between TVV infection and clinical findings. The prevalence of trichomoniasis in this study was 13.2%. A significant association was found between the detection of TVV and the presence of particular clinical symptoms and signs in infected patients (P < 0.01). The presence of vaginal discharge (P < 0.01), dysuria (P < 0.05); dyspareunia (P < 0.05) and cervical erythema (P < 0.01) were significantly associated with TVV infection. No association was found between TVV and pruritus, vulvar erythema and vagi nal erythema. The strong association detected between TVV and particular clinical features of trichomoniasis is indicative of a possible clinical significance of TVV in T. vaginalis isolates and demonstrates a possible role of the virus in the pathogenesis of human trichomoniasis.",

The infraciliature and the general morphology of living cells closely resemble those of a population from the French Atlantic coast at Roscoff (Foissner and Dragesco 1996b). However, some differences were noted including the size of the macronuclei, the appearance of the nucleoli and the presence of vacuoles that contained peculiar figure-of-eight inclusions. The small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene was sequenced for the China-population and phylogenetic trees based on SSU rRNA gene sequence data were constructed. These revealed that Trachelocerca ditis clusters with another trachelocercid, Tracheloraphis sp. (sensu Hirt et al. 1995), with high support.",

We used these protists to analyze initial colonization processes occurring in an artificial water catchment built as a terrestrial hillside and located in a reclaimed lignite mining area in Lower Lusatia (Germany). In the first two years after site construction, only few testate amoebae species and individuals had been found on the predominantly uncovered, sandy study site. However, the substrate removed from small vegetation patches (containing organic matter) revealed tenfold higher amoebal densities compared to uncovered, sandy sites which were only a few cm apart. A cluster analysis separated these colonization patterns into covered and uncovered micro-sites. However, larger-scaled, consistent processes dependent on environmental parameters or gradients were not visible, as demonstrated by redundancy analysis. To conclude, the immigration and colonization process of testate amoebae on newly exposed soil surfaces is highly dependent on substrate quality, also assigned to specific site structures characterized by small vegetation patches.",

The identity of these fossils is important for our understanding of the origins and early morphological evolution within ciliate clades. Here we compare the homology of the fossil characteristics with those in their proposed ciliate relatives. Eotintinnopsis resembles a tintinnid, but its feathery tentacle-like apical structure is probably not homologous within any known ciliate. Wujiangella presents homology issues with the size and distribution of its putative somatic cilia. Yonyangella appears to be a suctorian with its tentaclelike structures, but the presence and size of its putative somatic cilia pose homology issues. We suggest that these three fossils are likely to be taphonomically and diagenetically distorted and altered acritarchs. These alterations include secondary mineral encrustations on the interiors of vesicles, the crushing, folding and other distortions of the vesicles, the bending and crushing of the acritarch spines, and the preservation of organic material in and outside of the cysts. The earliest known ciliate fossil remains a tintinnid that occurs in the Ordovician of Kazakhstan.",

Important for species identification are the following main characteristics: (1) the presence or absence of endosymbiotic algae (zoochlorellae); (2) the colour of the pigmented cortical granules, and (3) the shape of the macronucleus. The complete small subunit rDNA (SSU rDNA) of 19 further representatives of the genus Stentor was sequenced to examine the phylogenetic relationships within this genus and to determine the taxonomic value of these main characteristics. The detailed phylogenetic analyses yielded a separation of all species possessing a single compact macronucleus from those species with an “elongated” macronucleus (moniliform or vermiform). The data also indicate that the uptake of algae as well as the loss of pigmentation happened independently in different lineages. Furthermore, a high level of intraspecific variation within several species was found. Thus, S. muelleri and S. (sp.) cf. katashimai appear to represent distinct species and S. multiformis is composed of a species complex.",

Three shallow firn cores of 10 m depth were obtained from the Mocho-Choshuenco and Osorno volcanoes, Southern Andes, Chile, in October and November, 2005. Euglyphid testate amoebae were detected in 28 samples that correspond to the spring-summer layers of the firn cores. Inspection of 454 collected individuals reveals the presence of four different taxa. Three of these taxa, Trinema lineare, Trinema enchelys and Puytoracia bergeri have previously been reported in ice-free environments. The fourth taxon corresponds to a new species Puytoracia jenswendti nov. sp. The observation of food content and reproductive activities in a significant fraction of specimens evidence that testate amoebae are competent to inhabit glaciers. The testate amoebae found in the firn cores display clear seasonal variations in abundance indicating that these records can provide a new and novel proxy as paleoindicator for firn/ice core dating and for estimation of past glacier mass balance.",

We studied the morphology of non-dividers and the cell division using protargol impregnation. Since we disregarded live observations and due to the lack of a modern revision of the uroleptids, a final identification was not possible. A detailed comparison with the most similar limnetic Uroleptus -like hypotrichs and with Rigidothrix goiseri revealed that the Chinese population is very likely identical with Uroleptus magnificus [basionym Holosticha (Paruroleptus) magnificus Kahl, 1932], a very rare species possibly confined to limnetic, stagnant water bodies of the holarctic region. Besides the large size, main features of U. cf. magnificus are: (i) about 80 adoral membranelles; (ii) three or four inconspicuous transverse cirri; (iii) 5–8 dorsomarginal kineties; (iv) the oral primordium originates de novo left of the postoral midventral cirri; (v) the frontal-ventral-transverse cirri anlagen of the proter and the opisthe originate via primary primordia; (vi) the left frontal cirrus of the proter originates from the middle portion of the disorganizing parental paroral; (vii) the parental endoral becomes the undulating membrane anlage for the proter; and (viii) the frontoterminal cirri originate in the plesiomorphic manner, that is, from the rearmost anlage.

The morphology of this isolate was studied using in vivo observation and protargol impregnation, and its evolutionary history was revealed by phylogenetic analysis of the 18S rRNA gene. The main features of T. brachypharynx include (i) a very narrowly fusiform and slightly contractile body about 380 × 40 μm in size; (ii) two ellipsoidal macronuclear nodules typically connected by a fine strand; (iii) a single terminal contractile vacuole; (iv) filiform extrusomes that are typically 30 µm long; (v) an average of 24 ciliary rows, with two of them anteriorly differentiated into an isostichad dikinetidal dorsal brush; and (vi) hat-shaped lepidosomes. Based on the 18S rRNA gene phylogeny, T. brachypharynx clustered together with Trachelophyllum sp. within the order Spathidiida. Furthermore, phylogenetic trees and networks indicate some members from the genera Enchelyodon and Spathidium as the nearest relatives of trachelophyllids. Therefore, based on the present molecular and comparative-morphological analyses, we suggested a hypothesis explaining how trachelophyllids may have evolved from a spathidiid-like ancestor via an enchelyodonid-like stage.",

The non-flooded Petri dish and optical microscopy methods were used. A total of 132 ciliates were found, mostly Spirotrichea and Colpodea. Taxonomic richness differed between paths (GLMM, p = 0.05), being 1.4 times higher in Sendero Macuco, which had more exclusive taxa than Circuito Inferior.

Bryophytes and lichens were dampened by the waterfall’s spray in Circuito Inferior during the wet period when higher richness was observed. In Sendero Macuco, higher richness occurred during the dry period, suggesting these differences could be related to contrasting habitats instead of climatic conditions. Nevertheless, C/P indices revealed a prevalence of the r-selected Colpodea over the K-selected Spirotrichea + Heterotrichea in both paths during the dry period, indicating unstable environmental conditions. Further research is needed to deepen our knowledge on terrestrial ciliates in this natural protected area from South America, which is a world hotspot for biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Despite of the rapid advancements in genomic tools over the past decade, genomic data remains limited for many protists, with some taxonomic groups lacking it entirely. One such group is testate amoebae, a group of shelled amoeboid protists known to have a long fossil record. Indeed, for some of them (i.e., arcellinid testate amoebae) the evolutionary roots trace back approximately 730 million years. Beyond their fascinating evolutionary history, these organisms are highly valued for their diverse applications across various research fields, including paleoecology, environmental monitoring, ecotoxicology, microbial community ecology, endosymbiont studies, and more. Consequently, their genomic data harbors significant potential for yielding crucial insights within the contexts of evolution, ecology, and climate change, while also offering opportunities for exploration from both biotechnological and functional perspectives. This short communication gives an overview of possible research directions for testate amoebae based on molecular data and outlining innovative techniques that have the potential to elevate testate amoebae research to a new next level.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the physiological and genetic diversity of single-cell eukaryotes remains a big challenge for scientists. Single-cell omics technologies have revolutionized our possibilities for many previously uncharacterized groups. Despite the great advancement, there is still a substantial gap in our genomic knowledge about eukaryotes, with less than 1% of species sequenced. This knowledge gap is even more pronounced in some microbial eukaryote groups such as Arcellinids. Arcellinida is a group of bioindicator protists that inhabit mostly freshwater and soil environments. Currently, we don’t have any genome available for the Arcellinida group, undermining our capacity to understand their biology, metabolic capacities, and resistance mechanisms that makes them useful as bioindicators. Using transcriptomic data only, we made great progress in this group by elucidating, for example, their systematics, sex, and metabolism. This manuscript highlights the potential of Arcellinida as a model for genomic studies, particularly the Arcella uspiensis species. Through comparative analysis, we demonstrate that despite its importance, transcriptomics hinders some limitations that need to be acknowledged. Finally, considering that we have much basic biology knowledge and protocols for Arcella uspiensis, we propose sequencing the genome of this species as a way to unlock further potential insights into ecology, evolution, and function of Arcellinida. This manuscript emphasizes the importance of exploring genomics as a way to understand the ecology and evolution of microbial eukaryotic groups.",

The involvement of Cyclospora cayetanensis in diarrhoea cases globally has been documented, though with little from the Africa continent. This study was thus carried out to investigate the possible existence of this emerging pathogen and the parasitic profile in stool samples in the city of Lagos, Nigeria. A total of 1109 stool samples (216 of which came from diarrhoeal patients) were screened microscopically for intestinal parasites. Parasites were detected in just 16% (177). Cyclospora cayetanensis was detected from 11 stool samples: 10 diarrhoeal stools and one non-diarrhoeric stool. All stool samples positive for this emerging pathogen, were from patients aged 22 to 45‰ years, seven of which were seropositive for HIV (p > 0.05). Result thus revealed for the first time in this state and country, the existence of Cyclospora cayetanensis and its possible involvement in diarrhoea cases. It also identified Cryptosporidium parvum as the most prevalent intestinal parasite in the state, a strong departure from previous reports. There is the need however for a more detailed study, in order to determine the exact extent of C. cayetanensis involvement in diarrhoea cases and the effect of seasons and cultural feeding practices on its epidemiology for effective management of diarrhoeal cases.",

    "abstract": "The facsimile presentation of a forgotten ciliate monograph of Alfred Kahl from the year 1943 is a convenient occasion for a detailed biography of this outstanding ciliate researcher. Kahl was born in the village of Warwerort, that is, at the north coast of Germany on 18 t h February 1877. Nothing is known about his parents and youth. At the turn of the century, when Kahl was twenty, he became a primary school master; later, he taught English, French, and natural history in a Gymnasium (high school) in Hamburg, where he married and had a daughter, who initiated, as a student of the famous Eduard Reichenow, his microscopic studies. Kahl published his first paper, a monograph with 241 pages, in the year 1926, when he was nearly fifty. In the following nine years, Kahl produced 1800 printed pages, containing, inter alia, the descriptions of 17 new ciliate families, 57 new genera, about 700 (!) new species, and thousands of excellent pen- and -ink drawings. Although Kahl had contact with several academic protozoologists, such as E. Reichenow and H. Kirby, he was a self-made man working alone and performing his meticulous live observations with a simple bright field microscope equipped, however, with a 100:1 oil immersion objective. Kahl did not only excellent original research, but also thorough taxonomic revisions. This culminated in the 1930-35 monographs in Dahl's Die Tierwelt Deutschlands series. These four reviews, which bring together and freshly characterize most ciliates known to that time, soon became classics and are Kahl's most important scientific legacy. Kahl's meticulous observations and phylogenetic ideas also influenced the higher classification of the ciliates, though this is less obvious than for species taxonomy. After 10 years of intense work, Kahl abruptly stopped publishing in 1935, possibly because of problems with some academic protozoologists and zoologists. However, his reviews in the Tierwelt Deutschlands series soon made him famous throughout the protozoological landscape. This might have stimulated him to commence work again in the early forties, when he produced a revision of the 1930-35 monographs. The revision should be a book addendum for the subscribers of the Mikrokosmos, a popular journal for amateur microscopists. Unfortunately, only part I, here reproduced as a facsimile, was published in 1943, while part 2 was likely lost during the Second World War troubles. This fine piece of work is not only a simple repetition of the previous reviews, but contains 10 new taxa, the freshwater species described between 1935 and 1940, several nomenclatural novelities, interesting remarks on various genera, and many improved figures. Two of the 10 new species were rediscovered recently, and one is redescribed and neotypified here, viz., Phialinides muscicola (Kahl, 1943) nov. comb. Kahl used the morphospecies concept and emphasized that ciliate diversity is much greater than previously recognized. This and other matters caused conflicts with some academic protozoologists, especially A. Wetzel, who disliked Kahl's simple drawings and splitting of seemingly very similar species. However, time confirmed Kahl, whose life and work are an impressive example of how to become an unforgettable taxonomist: excellent original research and revisions, diligence, objectivity, respect for the field's history and, last but not least, a good deal of talent. Kahl died in November 1946. The reason and his grave are unknown.",

The studies with application of the classical genetic method (strain crosses) and a molecular technique (RAPD-PCR fingerprinting, primer Ro 460-04) revealed the presence of separate sibling species within P. jenningsi. One of these is confined to six genetically related strains originating from Japan, separated from other group (results of strain crosses) and showing only one characteristic band pattern. The other of these includes strains from India, Saudi Arabia and China (Przyboś et al. 2003). We wanted to verify the RAPD markers specific for P. jenningsi and to prove the existence of two sibling species within it (revealed by one primer only), by application of others Ro-type primers. The conducted RAPD-PCR fingerpring analysis revealed that the genomes of the studies strains of P. jenningsi have polymorphic DNA sequences complementary to the four applied primers. The band patterns can be used as species-specific markers for P. jenningsi. DNA amplification by four primers used differentiates P. jenningsi into two groups of strains, one of which includes the Indian, Saudi Arabian and Chinese strains, the other the Japanese strains. Our results are congruent with inter-strain crossing experiments in which reproductive isolation was found when continental and Japanese strains were tested. This is further evidence for the existence of two sibling species, whose reproductive isolation is genetically induced.",

    "abstract": "Euglena gracilis responds to abiotic stress factors (high light, salinity, heavy metals) with a sign change of its gravitactic behavior. This phenomenon is oxygen dependent and can be suppressed by the application of the reductant dithionite. It is not mediated by the photoreceptor since also blind mutants change their movement behavior upon high light exposure. It is also not mediated by the chloroplasts since the gravitactic sign change was also found in white, chloroplast-free mutants. The NO radical donor SNAP and the NO cleaver carboxy-PTIO had no obvious effects on gravitaxis or gravitactic sign change, respectively, indicating that NO radicals are not likely involved in gravitactic sign change. Gravitactic sign change was suppressed when oxygen was removed by flushing the cell suspension with nitrogen. Also, the addition of the radical scavengers Trolox, ascorbic acid or potassium cyanide abolished or reduced gravitactic sign change. Quantification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cells indicated that these treatments reduced the evolution of ROS. Furthermore, addition of hydrogen peroxide induced gravitactic sign change in the absence of external stress factors. These results indicate that gravitactic sign change is triggered by ROS (most likely hydrogen peroxide) which are probably produced by cytochrome-c-oxidase in the mitochondria. The clear responses of Euglena to abiotic stress factors suggest that these cells are probably interesting model systems in the study of stress signaling.",

Based on the present work and on previous data, an improved diagnosis for the genus Kentrophyllum Petz, Song et Wilbert, 1995 is suggested: leaf-shaped Amphileptidae without conspicuous neck-like region and having numerous somatic kineties on both cell sides; spines along ventral and dorsal margins; somatic ciliature on the right side forming sutures; one peripheral kinety consisting of dikinetids and forming a complete circle surrounding cell margin on right side. The new genus Epiphyllum is diagnosed by the following combination of characters, which separates it from other pleurostomatids: (1) sutures present on both right and left sides; (2) peripheral kinety present; (3) numerous somatic kineties on both sides of cell; (4) cell without typical neck-like portion, hence generally oval or leaf-like in body outline, although it also exhibits high levels of metaboly; (5) presence of peribuccal papillae along left side of oral slit; (6) spines absent. Redefined diagnoses for K. verrucosum and E. soliforme are also supplied.

Four assemblages of characteristic testate amoebae species with specific ecological preferenceswere distinguished. The moss dwelling testacean fauna of South Georgia was compared to other sub-Antarctic islands, such as Mar ion Island,Iles Kerguelen and Ile de la Possession.Key words: aquatic mosses, assemblages, biogeography, Ile de la Possession, South Georgia, sub-Antarctica, terrestrial mosses, testateamoebae.",

    "abstract": "Among a population of Thecamoeba quadrilineata (Thecamoebidae) isolated from moss samples some trophozoites harboured intracellular aggregates of round-oval parasites which turned out to be spores with a real nucleus. These organisms were supposed to be fungal endoparasites beginning their development within the nucleus of the host invaded by young parasitic stages after the host amoeba had engulfed free spores from the environment. The complete developmental cycle was studied by electron microscopy, showing the intranuclear growth of freshly invaded young stages into large spore forming parasites differentiating into a great number of spores – all within the border of the host’s nuclear membrane. These spores were not released into the environment until the death and decay of the host amoeba, where they could be ingested as infective stages by hitherto not infected thecamoebae. Host range studies with various free-living amoebae (FLA) showed that T. striata and T. terricola were as permissive to infection as the original host T. quadrilineata. Sappinia was only susceptible to a certain extent and therefore not considered as possible natural host. Remarkably, this observation shows that both nuclei of the bi-nucleate amoeba became simultaneously infected. The present morphological description corresponds to early observations with fungal intranuclear parasites called Nucleophaga Dangeard, 1887. However, genetic and phylogenetic studies have to corroborate the supposed fungal nature.",

Comparison of trophozoite morphology and SSU rDNA sequences identified one of the five fish-isolated strains as closely related to V. bacillipedes, and characteristics of another three strains allowed to establish three new species: Vexillifera multispinosa, V. fluvialis and V. tasmaniana. The enlargement of dataset of Vexillifera SSU rDNA sequences enables us to doubt the identification of ATCC strain 50883 designated as V. armata. Since sequence of this strain branched in our analysis in a distant phylogenetic position within Korotnevela and Neoparamoeba clade, the Vexillifera origin of this sequence is called in question.

It differs from its congeners mainly by the body shape, no cortical granules and number of macronuclear nodules. The ontogenesis of U. macrostyla is typical for species with such a somatic ciliary pattern: the oral primordium develops hypoapokinetally and FVT-anlagen develop in 5-streaks and primary mode. However, a unique characteristic in morphogenetic process is reported: anlagen for both the left and right marginal cirri occur de novo to the right of the parental structure which has never been seen in other oxytrichids. This characteristic was considered an apomorphy (Berger 1999).

Arcuospathidium bromelicola nov. spec. is very similar to the previously described A. muscorum but its resting cyst has conspicuous, pillar-shaped lepidosomes on the surface. Protospathidium lepidosomatum nov. spec. is very similar to the previously described P. muscicola but has outstanding, nipple-shaped (vs. conical) lepidosomes on the cyst surface. Spathidium bromeliophilum nov. spec., whose ontogenesis is highly similar to that of S. turgitorum, differs from similar species by the body length: width ratio, the number of ciliary rows, the shape of the oral bulge, and details of the ciliary pattern. Spathidium bromelicola nov. spec. is similar to S. muscicola (extrusomes bluntly fusiform and 4 mu m long vs. rod-shaped and > 15 mu m long) and S. stammeri (resting cyst wall smooth vs. spinous). Spathidium wolfi nov. spec. has an anterior and a posterior contractile vacuole.

    "abstract": "Planktonic ciliates occasionally form brief rapid increases in numbers (blooms) that can be trophically important. Although model simulations and mesocosm studies indicate that blooms occur over 10 to 20 days, field data are rarely sufficiently detailed to reveal their occurrence and demise. Our data (collected over 57 weeks across a coastal lagoon) offer insights into the population dynamics of a single species, place these in the context of the entire ciliate assemblage, and provide guidance on what should continue to be examined. Specifi- cally, to evaluate population dynamics we examine two species of Cyrtostrombidium, characterise temporal and spatial variation of their abundance, and relate these to abiotic phenomena and biological factors. This is also the first report of Cyrtostrombidium in a tropical coastal lagoon. Collectively our analysis reveals key aspects of the dynamics of this genus: 1) small-scale peaks in abundance are ~30 m in size and can persist for ~10-30 days, reaching a maximum of 100 cells ml -1 ; 2) these increases are driven by biotic factors (revealed through autocorrelation analysis); 3) long-term trends are driven by the shift between dry and rainy seasons and by the periods of isolation of lagoon from the sea (revealed through multiple regression analysis); 4) blooms may at times control primary production; 5) conjugation, an ecologi- cally important event, may be associated with blooms (at times 9% of population was conjugating); and 6) dinoflagellate parasitism, poorly described in oligotrichs, is potentially important in population demise. These results both reflect on how ciliates may behave in short-term events and should encourage the continued need for detailed observations of field samples at a high taxonomic resolution.",

Results revealed low alpha diversity and a high proportion of cosmopolitan species. One genus, four species and two subspecies were identified for the first time for southwestern South America. Further, four morphotypes were not identifi ed to species level, and one could not be identifi ed to species or genera level. They are probably endemics of this poorly studied and remote zone. These results were consistent with the moderate endemicity hypothesis of microbial biogeography. We hypothesized that the low diversity of species recorded on the island is due to selective colonization-extinction dynamics, processes that determines the low species richness of insular macro-organisms. However, this hypothesis needs to be evaluated in the future. Statistical analysis showed that testate amoebae were distributed in two discrete communities in the island. The first consisted of organisms inhabiting habitats located within a forest and the second by organisms inhabiting habitats located outside the forest. The suggested primary factor differentiating these both communities was the availability of appropriate habitat for the different species of testate amoebae.",

    "abstract": "Karst freshwater caves are subterranean habitats characterized by the constant absence of light and relatively small variations of temperature and air humidity. They are mostly food deprived environments, with the exception if large bat colonies are present or if they are intensively supplied with organic matter by sinking rivers. Even though these habitats are often described as harsh, they have enabled the evolution of highly specialized and often endemic animals. The cave eukaryotic micro-organisms, on the other hand, are scarcely researched. The results of research of testate amoebae in the caves of the Dinaric arc detected 23 species, 12 of which were first found in caves. Also, a description of Centropyxis bipilata sp. nov. is presented. This species is clearly distinguished from other described species based on shell size, the presence of two struts and the usually dark ring around the aperture. Testate amoebae were registered on aquatic and terrestrial cave sediments and transitional habitats (like hygropetric and wet walls). The most frequent species within the samples were: Trinema lineare, Cryptodifflugia oviformis and Centropyxis bipilata sp. nov. Maximum diversity of testate amoebae was registered in Ponor Kovači with twenty species. In 24.4 % of the investigated samples microphototrophs were found, implying good surface-subsurface connectivity that could also affect testate amoebae diversity. This research showed that caves are underestimated habitats that can provide us with new data about the testate amoebae biogeography and diversity.",

    "abstract": "Here we summarize the results from 10 cruises in the Chukchi Sea, in August, each year from 2011 to 2020. Samples for the qualitative analysis of the microzooplankton were obtained from stations located across the Chukchi Sea using a 20μm plankton net. Conditions encountered, in terms of sea ice coverage and chlorophyll concentrations, varied widely from year to year without any obvious relationship with the composition of the microzooplankton assemblage. Examining a total of 242 samples gathered, we found a total of 44 tintinnid species (morphologically distinct forms). Plotting cumulative number of tintinnid species encountered vs cumulative number of samplings gave a typical species accumulation curve showing no sign of saturation suggesting that continued sampling in the Chukchi Sea will likely yield increases in the tintinnid species catalogue. The tintinnid species found ranged widely in lorica opening diameters (LOD) from about 11 μm to 80 μm in diameter. However, the median size of the LOD of the tintinnid assemblages varied little from year to year ranging only from about 30 μm to 40 μm. Most of the forms encountered were found in samples from only 1 or 2 cruises. Very few forms were found every year throughout the 10 years of sampling. These were 5 species of tintinnids (Acanthostomella norvegica, Leprotintinnus pellucidus, Pytchocylis obtusa, Salpingella acuminata, Salpingella faurei) and the nasselarian radiolarian Amphimelissa setosa. Examples of the morphological variability observed among individuals of Acanthostomella norvegica and Pytchocylis obtusa within single samples are shown with some individuals easily confused with forms described as other species are shown. To our knowledge, our data are the most extensive data set on Chukchi Sea microplankton. We provide all of the data recorded, which may serve as a baseline from which to assess changes projected in Arctic Sea systems, in a supplementary data file.",

For long time the genus comprised only two species, S. pedata and S. diploidea, based on morphological investigations. However, recent molecular studies on gene sequences of the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene revealed a high genetic diversity within the genus Sappinia. This indicated a larger species richness than previously assumed and the establishment of new species was predicted. Here, Sappinia platani sp. nov. (strain PL-247) is described and ultrastructurally investigated. This strain was isolated from the bark of a sycamore tree (Koblenz, Germany) like the re-described neotype of S. diploidea. The new species shows the typical characteristics of the genus such as flattened and binucleate trophozoites with a differentiation of anterior hyaloplasm and without discrete pseudopodia as well as bicellular cysts. Additionally, the new species possesses numerous endocytobionts and dictyosomes. The latter could not be found in previous EM studies of the genus Sappinia. Standing forms, a character of the species S. pedata, could be formed on older cultures of the new species but appeared extremely seldom. A loose layer of irregular, bent hair-like structures cover the plasma membrane dissimilar to the glycocalyx types as formerly detected in other Sappinia strains.",

Xenoma were often rounded, but would be occasionally ovoid or irregular shape, generally creamy but rarely opaque, and filled with mature spores. The spores were unikaryotic pyriform measuring 5–5.5 (5.25±0.24) µm in length and 2.5–3 (2.75±0.24) µm in width. The posterior vacuole was large and occupied more than half of the spore. Ultrastructural study indicated that the mature spore has 13–14 coils of polar filament arranged in one layer, and a rough exospore. Intermediate stages were rare and randomly distributed in the xenoma. Merogonial and sporogonial stages were uni or binucleate. The plasma membrane surrounding the meront was irregular and indented. The mean prevalence was 18.3% and it varied according to season and locality. The distribution of prevalence according to fish size indicated that small fish were primarily affected. Phylogenetic analysis using the partial sequence of the SSU rDNA showed consistent association with species of the genusGlugea.

    "abstract": "The morphology and taxonomy of two new and two poorly known ciliate species of Ancistrum, found in the mantle cavity (mainly on gills) of marine molluscs from culture beds and pools along the Chinese coast of the Yellow Sea, were investigated using living observation and silver impregnation. Ancistrum haliotis n. sp. was isolated from the abalone Haliotis discus hannai Ino, A. crassum Fenchel, 1965 from the purple clam Saxidomus purpuratus (Sowerby), A. acutum n. sp. from the surf clam Mactra veneriformis Reeve, and A. japonicum Uyemura, 1937 from both the venus clam Cyclina sinensis (Gmelin) and from Dosinia japonica (Reeve). Ancistrum haliotis differs from its most similar relative A. mytili (Quennerstedt, 1867) by the body outline (anterior portion narrower vs. wider than the posterior portion), the macronuclear shape (broadly ellipsoidal vs. reniform or sausage-like), and by having fewer somatic kineties (28-32 vs. usually more than > 40). Ancistrum crassum is characterized by the naked area at the apical end of the cell, the relatively short buccal field occupying about two thirds of the body length, and the posterior-dorsal cone-shaped prolongation. Ancistrum acutum n. sp. and A. japonicum are almost identical in morphometry, but differ distinctly in the live morphology (anterior end pointed and posterior end rounded vs. anterior end narrowly rounded and posterior-dorsal end protruded) and ciliary pattern (all right-side kineties extend to posterior body end vs. all right-side kineties excluding somatic kinety 1 distinctly shortened posteriad, forming a glabrous zone). We neotypify Ancistrum japonicum and discuss the taxonomic status of the four species. Based on an evaluation of all nominal species of Ancistrum and Ancistrumina, we recognize nine valid species of Ancistrum and provide a tabular guide to their identification. Fenchelia Raabe, 1970 is regarded as a junior synonym of Ancistrum Maupas, 1883. We synonymize Ancistrumina nucellae Khan, 1970 with Ancistrum japonicum Uyemura, 1937 and Ancistrum edajimanum Oishi, 1978 with A. crassum Fenchel, 1965.",

The infection induces the formation of hyperplastic testes within the bryozoan host from which cord-like xenomas form. Development of diplokaryotic sporonts is preceded by haplophasic schizogony. Sporogony forms diplokaryotic spores. The spores formed within the xenomas are oval, tapering to one end and were 7.2 ‐ 0.3 µm by 5.0 ‐ 0.3 µm with 22-23 turns of the polar filament. Sporogony occurred within the hyaloplasm with the exospore developing into two distinct layers. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the parasite was most closely related to a Bacillidium sp. and Janacekia debaisieuxi.",

    "abstract": "Summary. Stentor coeruleus and the related Blepharisma japonicum possess photoreceptor systems that render the cells capable of avoiding light. On account of this unique feature, these ciliates exhibit photodispersal as they tend to swim away from a bright illumin ation and accumulate in shady or dark areas. The observed photobehaviour is largely the result of a step-up photophobic response displaye d by both ciliates, although other behavioral reactions like phototaxis or photokinesis may also contribute to the photodispersal. The ph otophobic response caused by a sudden increase in light intensity (light stimulus) starts with a delayed cessation of ciliary beating tha t results in the disappearance of the cells forward swimming, then a period of ciliary reversal (backward movement) followed finally by renewed forward movement, often in a new direction. Reversal of ciliary beating during the photophobic response correlates with the generation of an action potential. The action potential is elicited by a photoreceptor potential, a transient membrane depolarization produced by the l ight stimulus. The photoreceptor potentials in both ciliates are initiated by light absorption in a cellular photoreceptor system based on hyp ericin-like chromophores - blepharismin in Blepharisma and stentorin in Stentor. Recent evidence indicates that biochemical processes, which couple the photochemical cycle within the cell pigment with photoreceptor potential, may be different in these organisms. In the case of Stentor, cyclic GMP is the probable candidate for an internal second messenger in photosignal transduction. In related Blepharisma cells, however, InsP 3 seems to be responsible for the alterations in membrane potentials and induction of light avoiding response. The data show tha t lower eukaryotic cells may use similar signal transduction pathways as observed in multicellular organisms. Therefore, on the basis o f lightdependent events observed in Blepharisma and Stentor, it seems appropriate to use protozoan cells as a model system for multidisciplinary studies of sensory signal transduction within single cells.",

Previous phylogenies of the group have exclusively considered members of one family, the Ophryoscolecidae, which are symbiotic within ruminants. We sought to improve understanding of evolution within the entodiniomorphs by expanding the range of ciliates examined to include the Cycloposthiidae and Macropodimidae (symbionts of equids and macropodids respectively). The entire SSU-rRNA gene was sequenced for 3 species, Cycloposthium edentatum, Macropodinium ennuensis and M. yalanbense, and aligned against 14 litostome species and 2 postciliodesmatophoran outgroup species. Cycloposthium was consistently grouped as the sister-taxon to the Ophryoscolecidae although support for this relationship was low. This suggests that there is more evolutionary distance between the Cycloposthiidae and Ophryoscolecidae than previously inferred from studies of gross morphology, cell ontogeny or ultrastructure. In contrast, Macropodinium did not group with any of the entodiniomorphs, instead forming the sister group to the entire Trichostomatia (Entodiniomorphida + Vestibuliferida). This early diverging position for the macropodiniids is concordant with their morphology and ontogeny which failed to group the family with any of the entodiniomorph suborders. The currently accepted classification of the Trichostomatia is thus deficient and in need of review.",

    "abstract": "We analyzed the testate amoebae communities from two sets of moss samples taken forty years apart (1961 and 2001) in the same locations of a peat bog of the Swiss Jura Mountains. Peat cutting and lateral drainage of Le Cachot bog have caused a clear increase in tree cover, especially near the edges. Changes affecting herbaceous plants, mosses, or soil organisms can be subtle, and may easily be overlooked. We hypothesized that we would see changes in the dominant Sphagnum species and the structure of testate amoebae communities living in the mosses. More specifically, we hypothesized that the frequency of bryophyte and testate amoebae species indicative for dry conditions would increase and that the frequency of species indicative for wet conditions would decrease. The mean testate amoebae species richness per sample decreased from 11.9 to 9.6, but the overall species richness was identical (33 species) in both years. Three species increased significantly in mean relative abundance: Nebela tincta s.l. (+97%), Bullinularia indica (+810%), and Cyclopyxis eurystoma (+100%; absent in 1961), while two species decreased significantly: Assulina muscorum (-63%) and Euglypha compressa (-93%). The testate amoebae communities clearly differed among microhabitat types (hummocks, lawns, hollows), but no overall significant change in the community was detectable between the two sampling dates (Mantel test). These results could signify that changes at the microscopic level had already taken place by 1961 and no further overall significant changes in micro-environmental conditions took place during the 40-year period of this study. This would agree with the faster response time usually attributed to microorganisms and would also imply that the bushes and trees may be poor predictors of the response of microorganisms if they are themselves in a non-equilibrium stage. Other possible causes for the lack of overall differences are discussed.",

Moreover, the entire gene of the SSU rRNA was sequenced and compared to published sequences of various Naegleria species and a cluster analysis was performed in order to reveal the phylogenetic position of this endocytobiont harbouring Naegleria strain. The amoeba was shown to grow well at 37℃, to migrate under-agarose and to lyse human HEp-2 cells, properties related to pathogenicity. With the help of SSU rDNA sequencing and subsequent cluster analysis the strain N_DMLG was identified as N. clarki. The N. clarki strains altogether formed a cluster with N. gruberi and the potentially pathogenic N. italica, N. australiensis and N. tihangensis.",

The population from the Adriatic Sea matches almost perfectly the authoritative redescription by Kahl (1932). Characteristic features of A. annulata are (i) several ring-shaped structures (lithosomes?) 4-8 µm across scattered throughout the cytoplasm; (ii) the very narrowly spaced and rather wide cirri of the amphisiellid median cirral row; and (iii) the formation of an additional cirral anlage between the ordinary anlagen IV and V. This additional anlage produces only a transverse cirrus so that A. annulata has six transverse cirri. In addition, the oral primordium is formed from several roundish anlagen pits which originate left of the middle and rear portion of the amphisiellid median cirral row, resembling the situation in A. marioni, type of the genus. The literature on A. annulata is reviewed, showing that this conspicuous and thus easy to identify species has been recorded only about 11 times since its discovery before 75 years. The population from the Italian coast of the northern Adriatic Sea is designated as neotype because (i) no preparations are available of the original type population from saltwater in North Germany; (ii) synonymy with an older species was proposed in the revision by Hemberger (1982); and (iii) the descriptions available so far do not agree very well.",

    "abstract": "The phylogenetic relationships among trichodinids remain obscure. As an important diagnostic marker, the morphology of the denticles in the adhesive disc as well as the adoral spiral has been widely used in generic discrimination and species identification of trichodinids. We studied the characters of denticles of the ten genera of Trichodinidae and the sole genus Urceolaria of Urceolariidae by using a quantitative method. The characteristic values were used to generate Manhattan distance, on which the dendrogram was based to construct with the Unweighted Paired Group Method using the Arithmetic mean (UPGMA). The investigations show that all the genera of the family Trichodinidae were clearly separate from the outgroup Urceolaria, and within the Trichodinidae: (i) Dipartiella grouped with Trichodinella and Tripartiella and lay in the closest position to the outgroup with a low dissimilarity, suggesting Dipartiella might be the most primitive genus in the family; (ii) Hemitrichodina clustered in a single clad and lay in the farthest position to the outgroup with the highest dissimilarity, indicating that it might be the most advanced genus; and (iii) the other 6 genera, Trichodina, Paratrichodina, Semitrichodina, Vauchomia, Pallitrichodina and Trichodoxa clustered in a big clad with very low dissimilarity, showing that they are closely related to each other. We discuss the evolutionary trend of the denticle and conclude that the denticles of the adhesive disc should be an apomorphic feature of the trichodinids and their changes could reflect the evolutionary tendencies of these ciliates.",

The effects of low ethanol concentrations (0.25-1.0%) were modest as the rate of endocytosis was almost normal and the rate of cell proliferation only slightly decreased. In high concentrations (＞1.0%) the acute effects of ethanol were dose- and time-dependent with respect to a lag period before proliferation resumed at a decreased rate and to the capacity of cells to form food vacuoles. After 24 h in the low ethanol concentrations the cells appeared to have adapted. In the high concentrations, however, chronic effects of ethanol were a much decreased rate of endocytosis and a distinct separation of the cells into two populations: normal sized cells and small mostly round cells. The small round cells were lying at the bottom af the culture dish, motionless or slowly moving with no visible oral structure but with somatic cilia, some cells lacked cilia and had a refractive outline or layered wall structure. These cells looked like precystic stages among which a few resting cysts were seen with pores in the cyst wall.

The cirrus V/3 participates in morphogenesis at very late stages of division; its kinetosomes merging with the posterior part of the developing UMs of the opisthe. There is no spli tting of the third dorsal primordium. Consequently three dorsal kineties (DK 1-3 ) are formed and only one caudal cirrus develops at the end of DK 3 .",

    "abstract": "Summary. An initial account of the terrestrial protozoan fauna of Ascension Island (7 ° 57´s, 14°22´w), based on nine samples from across the range of the island’s habitats, describes 52 taxa: 11 flagellates, 8 gymnamoebae, 1 helizoa, 11 ciliates and 21 testate amo ebae. These tend to be cosmopolitan species with wide habitat tolerances (e.g. many are also found in polar regions). The testate amoebae a re missing the larger (>150 µm) taxa, suggesting these may show dispersal limitation. There is evidence that compared to an area of contin ental land mass the protozoan fauna may be relatively species poor, however unlike the case with the macroscopic organisms, there is no ev idence for endemic species on this island. These results are discussed in the context of microbial biogeography, especially in the con text of debates over the claimed cosmopolitan nature of microbial distributions.",

Studies on the choanoflagellate distribution during two deep-sea expeditions, to the South Atlantic (5038 m) and Antarctica (Weddell Sea, 2551 m), revealed the deepest records of choanoflagellates so far. A new species, (Lagenoeca antarctica) with a conspicuous spike structure on the theca is described from deep Antarctic waters. Lagenoeca antarctica sp. n. is a solitary unstalked free living salpingoecid-like choanoflagellate. The protoplast is surrounded by a typical theca with unique spikes only visible in SEM micrographs. The ovoid cell nearly fills the whole theca and ranges in size from 4 to 6 pm. The collar measures 2-3 μm and the flagellum 3-5 μm. A second species, Salpingoeca abyssalis sp. n., was isolated from the abyssal plain of the South Atlantic (5038 m depth). Floating and attached forms were observed. The protoplast ranges from to 2 to 4 μm in length and 1 to 2 μm in width. The collar is about the same length as the protoplast and the flagellum has 2 to 2.5 x the length of the protoplast. Phylogenetic analyses based on a fragment of SSU rDNA revealed Salpingoeca abyssalis to cluster together with a marine isolate of Salpingoeca infusionum while Lagenoeca antarctica clusters separately from the other codonosigid and salpingoecid taxa. Salpingoeca abyssalis and an undetermined Monosiga species seems to be the first choanoflagellate species recorded from the abyssal plain.",

The Qingdao population of D. trimarginata is characterized by: body flexible, elongated elliptical in outline, 95-185 × 30-50 μm in vivo; two kinds of cortical granules, grass-green and red wine-coloured, respectively; single contractile vacuole positioned at anterior 1/3-1/4 of body; ca 80-140 macronuclear nodules and 7-10 micronuclei; about 37 adoral membranelles; 4 enlarged frontal cirri and 1 frontal row composed of 3-5 cirri; 5-8 buccal, 1-4 frontoterminal, 7-10 transverse cirri; midventral rows with 16-29 pairs of cirri, terminating at posterior 1/4 of the body; 4 left marginal rows, the length of which shorten incrementally from right to left; 3-4 dorsal kineties. The morphogenetic process is characterized by the following features: (1) the parental ciliature including the oral apparatus is entirely renewed; (2) the oral primordium of the proter originates de novo beneath the parental buccal cavity; (3) the right marginal row develops 2 separate anlagen intrakinetally; (4) in both dividers the left marginal rows derive from a single anlage that originates intrakinetally in the rightmost parental row, while all other old structures are morphogenetically inactive and are gradually resorbed during the division process; (5) the macronuclear nodules fuse to form a single mass prior to division. The morphogenetic data suggest a close relationship between the genera Diaxonella and Pseudourostyla, with their marginal cirri arising from a common primordium. Based on the data obtained, the genus Diaxonella Jankowski, 1979 is redefined thus: Pseudourostylidae with long midventral rows; several clearly distinct large frontal cirri and one row of frontal cirri; single long row of buccal cirri; transverse and frontoterminal cirri present; caudal cirri absent; one right and two or more left marginal rows which derive from a single anlage intrakinetally.",

DWM constitutes a special terrestrial habitat with its own ciliate fauna characteristic by numerous rare and many strongly and exclusively autochthonous species. Litostomes, spirotrichs and colpodids were the most prominent systematic groups. Peritrichs, suctorians, and prostomatids were under-represented in DWM as typical for terrestrial habitats worldwide. The structure of trophic guilds was very similar in DWM and soils with the prevalence of bacterivorous and predaceous species followed by omnivores and fungivores. Bacterivores, participating in decomposition processes and nutrient cycling, dominated in the far-gone decayed samples. The evaluation of C/P ratios indicates that DWM could be considered as an unstable and unpredictable habitat. Hierarchical classification showed that different clusters constitute niches with their own ciliate fauna rather affected by prevalent environmental factors (moisture, temperature, pH and food supply) than certain tree species.",

This study evaluates the profiles of the saturated and unsaturated fatty acids and their isomers in three common species of rumen ciliates: Entodinium caudatum, Eudiplodinium maggii and Diploplastron affine. The protozoa were collected from the rumen of monofaunated sheep and were purified by a sedimentation method. It was found that palmitic acid predominated in all three species of protozoa. The highest level of palmitic acid was found in Entodinium caudatum (P＜0.05) while Eudiplodinium maggii contained the highest content of C18:3 cis-9, cis-12, cis-15 (P＜0.05). In contrast with these two species, ciliate Diploplastron affine were characterized by the highest level of C18:1 trans-11, total C18:1 trans, total C18:1 and MUFA (P＜0.05). On the other hand, the representatives of species Diploplastron affine and Entodinium caudatum contained more conjugated C18:2 cis-9, trans-11 in comparison to Eudiplodinium maggii (P＜0.05). The obtained results suggest that the fatty acid profile of the examined protozoa depends on the species of ciliates and presumably may be influenced by dietary fatty acids. It is also suggested that ciliates Diploplastron affine can be considered as an important source of UFA for the host animal.",

    "abstract": "So far, no molecular investigations have been carried out on the systematically uncertain ciliate Epiclintes in spite of the recent reviews. In an attempt to solve this problem, we sequenced the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene of two forms of Epiclintes: E. auricularis auricularis and E. auricularis rarisetus. Phylogenetic trees were then constructed by means of bayesian inference (BI), maximum-likelihood (ML), maximum parsimony (MP), and neighbor-joining (NJ) methods in order to test previously presumed phylogenetic assignments of Epiclintes based on morphological and morphogenetic data. The main results are that the two isolates form a branch that is peripheral to all other typical stichotrichs. Epiclintes branched off first in all analyses performed with high BI and moderate MP supporting value (100% BI, 58% MP) while low ML and NJ supporting value (＜50%). This suggests that this genus could represent a unique taxon considering its systematic position. Morphological and ontogenetic investigations on Epiclintes auricularis indicates that this genus demonstrates several special features compared with most other related urostylids: (1) several (instead of one) left-most frontal cirri are developed from the FVT anlage I in E. auricularis rarisetus; (2) buccal and frontoterminal (or migratory) cirri are lacking at interphase and never occur during divisional processes; (3) each FVT anlage, except the anlage I, develops a transverse cirrus; and (4) anlagen for both marginal rows and dorsal kineties are formed de novo. Based on both morphological/morphogenetical and molecular data available, Epiclintes might represent an individual taxon at suborder level, i.e., Epiclintina Wicklow, 1983 (nom. nud.) and as a peripheral branch within stichotrichs s. str.",

    "abstract": "Few studies have examined testate amoebae assemblages of estuarine tidal marshes. This study investigates the possibility of using soil testate amoebae assemblages of a brackish tidal marsh (Scheldt estuary, Belgium) as a proxy for water level changes. On the marsh surface an elevation gradient is sampled to be analyzed for testate amoebae assemblages and sediment characteristics. Further, vegetation, flooding frequency and soil conductivity have been taken into account to explain the testate amoebae species variation. The data reveal that testate amoebae are not able to establish assemblages at the brackish tidal marsh part with flooding frequencies equal to or higher than 36.5%. Further, two separate testate amoebae zones are distinguished based on cluster analysis. The lower zone’s testate amoebae species composition is influenced by the flooding frequency (~ elevation) and particle size, while the species variability in the higher zone is related to the organic content of the soil and particle size. These observations suggest that the ecological meaning of elevation shifts over its range on the brackish tidal marsh Testate amoeba assemblages in such a brackish habitat show thus a vertical zonation (RMSEP: 0.19 m) that is comparable to the vertical zonation of testate amoebae and other protists on freshwater tidal marshes and salt marshes.",

    "abstract": "A survey of the summer phytoplankton communities of thirty-six moderately-deep north temperate lowland lakes showed that the proportions of Dinophyta and non-heterocyst-bearing cyanobacteria taxa, measured as biovolume, were inversely related to the total nitrogen: total phosphorus (TN:TP) ratio and that these groups were predominant in lakes where available nitrogen fell to undetectable concentrations. The proportion of heterocyst-bearing cyanobacteria was positively correlated to the TN:TP ratio and nitrate. Dinophyta and/or non-heterocystous cyanobacteria were prevalent in lakes with the highest epilimnion nutrient concentrations, whilst heterocystous cyanobacteria predominated in lakes with moderate nutrient concentrations. It is argued that the ability of Dinophyta to migrate vertically and to supplement their nutrient requirements though heterotrophy may enable them to be at least as successful as Cyanobacteria in high nutrient lakes and in overcoming nitrogen-scarcity. Our findings provide evidence that Dinophyta can be used as indicators of water quality.",

The densities varied markedly among the two particle fractions, and therefore the mean densities were not significantly different between the larger and smaller particle fractions. In contrast, the mean sizes and mean carbon content were statistically greater on larger size suspended particles compared to smaller size particles. There was a broader size range of amoebae on the larger particles, including very large Cochliopodium, Vannella, Mayorella, and Hartmannella species suggesting a larger biodiversity, also indicated by a larger diversity coefficient for the > 200-μm-particle fraction compared to the < 200-μm-particle fraction, 4.51 and 4.18, respectively. In conclusion, the size of suspended particulates in the water column of near-shore, estuarine habitats may have a significant influence on the composition of naked amoebae communities and their ecological roles, especially the organization of particle-associated microbial food webs.",

The described species is characterized by a flexible body, with body size (in vivo) of about 148 × 46 µm and yellowish green cortical granules. Morphological characters exhibit: undulating membranes in Notohymena–pattern; two macronuclei and absence of micronucleus (amicronucleate); about 36 adoral membranelles; 18 frontoventral-transverse (FVT) cirri; one right and one left marginal row separated posteriorly; 6 dorsal rows; 7 caudal cirri arranged in 2 + 2 + 3 pattern (constant). In the present study, a detailed description of all the developmental stages is also provided. Prominent distinguishing features of the new species are the absence of micronucleus, 7 caudal cirri (constant), yellowish green cortical granules aligned along the margins and irregularly distributed throughout the cell. They may also be randomly concentrated as clusters along the left margin and posterior end of the cell. Molecular phylogeny based on small subunit rDNA sequence data suggests sister relationship of Aponotohymena isoaustralis n. sp. with Notohymena apoaustralis and Aponotohymena australis (Notohymena australis) which cluster in a clade with Paraurostyla weissei and Paraurostyla coronata. Further analysis of nucleotide sequence of SSU rDNA also suggests that A. isoaustralis n. sp. is distinct from the type species A. australis.",

Protosteloid amoebae, sometimes called protostelids, are sporocarpic amoebae that make fruiting bodies that consist of a stalk and one to a few spores. This new taxon was cultured from dead leaves of mamaki (Pipturus albidus) from the Manuka Natural Area Reserve, Hawaii, USA. Light microscopic examination showed that this amoeba has a short, rigid stalk with a small apophysis and a spore that changes shape continuously until it is shed and crawls away from the stalk. In addition, this amoeba was initially observed to maintain a diurnal rhythm in which fruiting body formation occurred primarily in the late afternoon. This new species is unique in both its amoebal and fruiting body morphology. Spore deciduousness appears to be a result of shape changes in the spore itself. This is the fourth species of protosteloid amoeba described with a clearly described diurnal rhythm. In addition, previous molecular phylogenetic analyses suggested that this new species has SSU rRNA gene sequences that clearly separate it from any other protosteloid amoebae and place it as sister to Protacanthamoeba bohemica among the Acanthamoebidae family in Centramoebida of Amoebozoa. Because this new amoeba species does not fit into any of the centramoebid genera, we have proposed a new genus Luapeleamoeba.",

In colpodid ciliates, cyst formation is accompanied by large-scale morphological changes such as changes of cell shape, resorption of cilia, and formation of a cyst wall; additionally, the cell cycle is arrested. These changes provide acquired tolerance against environmental stresses. During cyst formation, mitochondrial membrane potential is reduced and the level of the ATP synthase beta chain is suppressed, strongly indicating that metabolism has ceased. Here, however, we show that ATP levels are elevated during the initial phases of encystment implying that metabolism may not be completely suppressed. This finding suggests another aspect of resting cyst formation that is not applicable to cryptobiosis.",

The objectives of this research were to examine the abundance, diversity and patchiness of gymnamoebae sampled at a distance of 3.0 cm apart and at three soil depths (surface, 5.0 cm and 10.0 cm) during a drought and after a significant precipitation event. The observed gymnamoebae were categorized into four morphotypes using a standard categorization scheme, but genera of the family Cochliopodiidae were categorized separately since their abundance patterns were different from the other gymnamoebae, and taxonomically they possess characteristics of both naked and testate amoebae. Gymnamoebae abundance was significantly correlated with soil moisture (r = 0.75, n = 18, p < 0.001). The mean abundance of gymnamoebae (combining all the data) after the precipitation event was significantly larger than the abundance during the drought based on a univariate ANOVA test (F(2, 15) = 12.8, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the mean gymnamoebae abundance of the triplicate samples taken at the surface and at 5.0 cm after the precipitation event was significantly greater than the mean abundance during the drought F(1, 4) = 18.3, p < 0.013 (surface), F(1, 4) = 15.0, p < 0.018 (5.0 cm). There was no significant difference in the mean gymnamoebae abundances at a depth of 10 cm, F(1, 4) = 6.4, p = 0.064. Within triplicates assays, diversity coefficients were generally more similar following the precipitation event than in samples taken during the drought, and there was evidence of patchy distribution in most of the triplicate samples taken at 3.0 cm apart.",

Nosema locustae occurred at nine localities, and P. dichroplusae at five. There was almost no overlap of occurrence, and mixed infections were not registered. The presence and prevalences (1% to 6.1%) of P. dichroplusae were relatively stable over the years in all localities while N. locustae alternated years of presence and absence, and prevalences fluctuated markedly from 1.8% up to 41%.

In this study, we used in vivo behavioral assays along with pharmacological inhibitors to investigate the behavior of the lysozyme/PACAP receptor in Tetrahymena. This receptor behaves like a PAC 1 receptor in some respects; however, PACAP 6-38 serves as an agonist, rather than an antagonist, for this receptor.

    "abstract": "Summary. Yellow-necked mice, Apodemus flavicollis, were examined for the presence of Herpetosoma trypanosomes at the Mazurian Lakeland, Poland. Bloodstream trypomastigotes were used for light microscopy investigations. In the host’s blood, slender and s tout trypomastigote stages of Trypanosoma grosi kosewiense subsp. n. were observed. The body length of the slender form ranged from 16.27 to 28.05 µm, mean 23.00 µm, and width from 0.79 to 2.56 µm, mean 1.43 µm. The free flagellum is 3.66-12.79 µm long, mean 7.59 µ m. The kinetoplast is particularly large. Stout forms have a characteristic broad and short body and is 10.78-23.54 µm long, mean 14.74 µm, and 1.18-2.78 µm width, mean 1.76 µm. In contrast to the slender form of T. grosi kosewiense and many other trypanosomes, the broadest size of its body falls midway of the PN distance, not at the nuclear level. The free flagellum is 5.06-11.86 µm long. It is eas y to notice the wide range of morphometric parameters. The results of light microscopy morphological description and morphometrical values of Trypanosoma grosi kosewiense subsp. n. were compared with those of Trypanosoma grosi Laveran et Pettit, 1909 parasitizing the wood mouse, A. sylvaticus, and revealed that trypanosomes parasitizing the yellow-necked mouse are different in many investigated parameters.",

The two other isolates belong to the genus Vahlkampfia and represent also novel species, with as their closest relatives V. avara and V. inornata respectively. The new Vahlkampfia spp. are more divergent from their nearest relatives than the new Naegleria spp. are to their closest relatives. The latter is probably due to the already high number of described Naegleria spp. in contrast to the few known Vahlkampfia spp. There are no morphological features in these new species of either genus that allow their identification. Only molecular typing can discriminate species within the vahlkampfiids.",

Seventy one percent of buzzard broods were positive for Frenkelia-like sporocysts. Prevalence increased with nestling age and number, and reached 100% at nest desertion. The prevalences of brain sarcosporidia (Frenkelia glareoli and F. microti) in rodents were higher in ecotones than in open habitats, in spring than in autumn, in heavier individuals, and on 2nd and 3rd day of trapping. These factors were significant although the overall prevalence was different in different host species (Clethrionomys glareolus, Microtus arvalis, Apodemus flavicollis, A. sylvaticus). The prevalences of muscle sarcosporidia in rodents and Sorex araneus were also positively influenced by habitat and host weight, while only for M. arvalis was the prevalence higher in spring. Host sex, locality and year did not show any effects on the prevalences. Besides two Frenkelia species, five Sarcocystis species were found (S. putorii, S. cernae, S. cf sebeki, and two undescribed species from C. glareolus and Sorex araneus). Natural infections of C. glareolus with F. microti and of A. flavicollis with F. glareoli are reported for the first time. Our study demonstrates that prevalences of brain and muscle sarcosporidians in small mammals are influenced by similar factors (intermediate host habitat and age) in different host-parasite combinations.",

The phylogenetic positions within the class Phyllopharyngea were deduced using Bayesian, distance matrix and maximum parsimony methods. Dysteria procera and Hartmannula derouxi, together with other available ciliates of the class Phyllopharyngea, form a monophyletic clade with strong bootstrap support in all the tree constr uction methods (values of 100% Bay, 100% LS, 100% NJ, 100% MP). The SSrRNA genealogy showed that the class Phyllopharyngea contained two monophyletic subclasses Chonotrichia and Suctoria, while the subclass Phyllopharyngia was paraphyletic. Our results revealed th at some taxa of the subclass Chonotrichia (e.g. Isochona species) had a close relationship with the subclass Phyllopharyngia, suggesting that heteromeric nuclear apparatus and the dorsal-reduced ciliature are likely phylogenetically informative. Additionally, consistin g with traditional morphological descriptions, dysteriids may be a specialized group within the class in our phylogenetic trees.",

We studied the genesis of the cyst wall precursors and the assemblage of the cyst wall in Meseres corlissi Petz and Foissner (1992), an oligotrichous ciliate closely related to the common Halteria grandinella, using transmission electron microscopy. Meseres corlissi has five types of cyst wall precursors, of which type (A), the lepidosomes of the pericyst, has been described by Foissner et al. (2006). Each precursor type has a complex genesis showing six to nine distinct stages described in detail. Types (A) and (C) develop fr om Golgi vesicles, while the origin of types (B), (D) and (E) remains obscure. None of the precursors is similar to those reported from other ciliates, suggesting the oligotrichs as a very distinct group of ciliates. Except of precursor (E), they develop and release their conten ts almost concomitantly by exocytosis, whereby the precursor membrane closes the exocytotic openings and the contents lose the property t o be stained with the usual dyes. Thus, the assemblage of the cyst wall, which suddenly “condenses” out off the mass formed by the e xtruded contents of the wall precursors, could be followed only during the last stages when the precursor materials became stainable ag ain. There is cortex reorganization and intense perilemma endocytosis before the cyst wall assembles, events not described in any other st udy. Thus, the perilemma is a real structure whose function, however, remains obscure. Based on the present and literature data, a high mo rphological diversity of cyst wall precursors and wall assemblage emerges. If this variety is added to that of overall cyst morphology (e.g ., wall ornamentation), cyst wall composition (e.g., with or without chitin) and cell restructuring (e.g., the infraciliature may be ma intained or resorbed), an overwhelming diversity emerges which should contain considerable phylogenetic and ecological information; unfortu nately, the message is only partially understood, likely because detailed data are available from less than 40 species.",

The spores possess two spherical nuclei, 8-10 coils of the polar filament and a posterior vacuole. All morphological and ultrastructural features indicate that the described microsporidium belongs to the genus Nosema. The microsporidian parasite presented here differs from Nosema chaetocnemae in spore size, number of polar filament coils, tissue specificity and locality. Therefore the parasite is considered to be a new microsporidian parasite of C. tibialis. This new species has been named Nosema tokati sp. n. after the name of its host's location.",

Based on the previous and the current studies, improved diagnoses for both species are supplied. A brief description of the asexual division process in Ephelota gemmipara is also presented, which can be summarized as follows: initially the basal bodies that give rise to the locomotor cilia in the transient larval (swarmer) stage appear to undergo multiplication before the budding process has commenced. The mastoid buds then develop in the apical region of the body, and one elongated branch of the parental macronucleus enters each bud. The buds undergo further development for several hours before eventually becoming swarmers which depart from the parent cell, swimming freely in the water.",

Using standard morphological methods, we describe four new fuscheriid taxa, each discovered in a specific biogeographic region. Fuscheriides tibetensis nov. gen., nov. spec. has rod-shaped extrusomes and two dorsal brush rows. It is a small (~ 80 × 10 μm), slender ciliate with only seven ciliary rows, and was discovered in grassland soil of southern Tibet, about 4600 m above sea-level. Aciculoplites ethiopiensis nov. gen., nov. spec. has acicular extrusomes and two dorsal brush rows. It is a middle-sized (~ 100 × 30 μm), oblong ciliate with about 22 ciliary rows, and was discovered in floodplain soil from a lake in Ethiopia. Fuscheria uluruensis nov. spec., which we discovered in mud and aeolic soil from pools on top of the Ayers Rock in the red centre of Australia, is unique in having the macronucleus split into about 12 oblong nodules. The nodules originate post-divisionally via the branching macronucleus strand, as in multinucleate spathidiids. Fuscheria nodosa salisburgensis nov. sspec., which was discovered in mud and soil of a meadow pool in Salzburg (Austria), has a long, tortuous macronucleus and about 45 ciliary rows. The resting cyst has an escape apparatus absent from the cyst of F. uluruensis , indicating that Fuscheria is non-monophyletic.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of Acanthamoeba in the domestic water supply in Huntington, West Virginia (U.S.A.) and the factors that may contribute to their presence or absence. One hundred sixty-two one liter tap water samples were collected over eight months. Amoebae in the samples (cysts or trophozoites) were harvested by passively filtering onto 5 μm pore size filters and enriching for amoebae on non-nutrient amoeba saline agar plates seeded with Escherichia coli for cultivation. Thirteen percent of all samples were positive for amoebae and 9.3% were positive for the amoeba of interest, Acanthamoeba . Chlorine levels were determined for samples at the time of collection, yielding a mean level of 1.56 mg l–1 chlorine in the distribution system ca. 8 kilometers from the water treatment plant. Cysts and trophozoites of Acanthamoeba clonal isolates were found to tolerate up to 50 mg l–1 and 4 mg l–1 chlorine respectively. This study showed that Acanthamoeba were present in the domestic water supply in Huntington, WV and although no attempt was made to count cells in liter samples, their frequency of occurrence (9.3%) and failure to be present in all replicates, suggests they were present at background levels of perhaps a few cells per five liters. This is only the second U.S. study to consider amoebae in tap water and is unique since the source water was river water. Acanthamoeba trophozoites and cysts were able to withstand levels of chlorine higher than those typically found in tap water suggesting they may be present in either form in the distribution system. Acanthamoeba are opportunistic pathogens capable of causing eye infections and their presence in tap water is a potential risk factor for susceptible individuals, particularly contact lens wearers who may use tap water to clean lenses and storage cases.",

The newly described species is characterized by its almost uncompressed shell and by its large, rounded, voluminous and hollow structural elements (idiosomes). The analysis of the variation coefficients shows that the studied population is too homogeneous and all measured morphological characters are feebly variable (CV range from 3.28% to 5.02%). Size frequency distribution analysis indicates that N. golemanskyi is size-polymorphic species, characterized by not well-expressed main-size class in favour of many subsidiary classes. A biometrical and morphological comparison between N. golemanskyi and N. speciosa is made.",

This species was isolated from the Thermaikos Gulf in Greece, and its description is largely based on observations of cultured material.

Genetic phylogeny applying Bayesian Inference, Maximum Likelihood, and Neighbor-Joining analyses, places A. thermaeum in an independent position within the Amphidinium sensu stricto monophyletic group, and the new species is closely related to its small and morphologically similar siblings ( A. massartii, A. klebsii, A. trulla, A. gibbosum, A. carterae ).",

    "abstract": "The ecology of tundra terrestrial environments has gained increasing attention due to potential major changes resulting from global warming and climate change. However, the composition of terrestrial microbial communities and their role in the biogeochemical carbon cycle are less well studied. This is the first report of the C-biomass of bacteria, fungi, and representative protozoa (heterotrophic nanoflagellates, naked amoebae, and testate amoebae) in Alaskan tundra soil samples, and the effects of glucose solution enrichment in laboratory studies simulating release of soluble organic compounds as may occur during permafrost melt and increased plant root exudates due to global warming. The data for three moss-rich surface samples, two in spring and one in summer (2011), are reported for C-supplemented (8,000 μg glucose-C) and non-supplemented treatments in laboratory culture. Seven days after supplementation, fungal C-biomass in the glucose-treated and untreated samples were similar in the range of 5 to 11 mg g–1 soil dry weight, the highest values in the summer samples. The bacterial C-biomass was the next highest in the range of 20 to 120 μg g–1 soil dry weight, followed by heterotrophic nanoflagellates (2 to 14 μg g–1 soil dry weight). The naked amoebae (0.13 to 0.94 μg C g–1 soil dry weight) and testate amoebae (2 to 20 ng C g–1 soil dry weight) contributed the least C-biomass. All of the bacterial and protozoan treatments showed increased biomass with glucose supplementation. Based on size, and C-biomass estimates, the phagotrophic protozoa appear to be organized in a classical bacterial-based trophic hierarchy (i.e. bacteria – nanoflagellates – naked amoebae – testate amoebae, in ascending order). Correlations of the C-biomass of bacteria to each of the protozoa, provided further evidence of a trophic pyramid; bacteria vs. nanoflagellates (r = –0.986), indicating top-down control by predatory flagellates, bacteria vs. naked amoebae (r = –0.361) and bacteria vs. testate amoebae (r = –0.131), each of decreasing magnitude as would be predicted for higher level consumers. Estimates of bacterial predation indicated strong predatory pressures on bacteria by the protozoa, greater with C-supplementation compared to the non-supplemented treatments.",

One such habitat lacking basic data is epilithic mosses and lichens with only a small number of samples analysed in previous studies and no systematic attempt to understand potential environmental controls. We use a large dataset (n = 81) from sites in Russia, Switzerland and Italy to demonstrate that testate amoebae in this habitat are both abundant and diverse. The community of our samples was dominated by ubiquitous taxa and differed between the northern (Russia) and southern (Switzerland and Italy) sites, perhaps due to differences in climate or air quality. Community composition, concentration and diversity were explained by moisture content but not by elevation above the ground surface and there were no significant differences between communities of mosses and lichens. Surprisingly our data showed a significant difference between communities of epiphytic and epilithic lichens in the same region sampled at the same time. Our study adds to the evidence that moisture availability is a critical factor in structuring testate amoeba communities across habitats and highlights the paucity of knowledge of TA in many environments.",

    "abstract": "Cryptosporidium parvum, an Apicomplexan parasite, is an important cause of diarrheal disease, especially in immunodeficient hosts. Nevertheless, there is no entirely successful therapeutic agent against cryptosporidiosis to date. Hence, this study aims to test the potential prophylactic and therapeutic effect of Camellia sinensis (green tea extract) in dexamethasone immunosuppressed mice versus the nowadays used drug, Nitazoxanide (NTZ). Parasitological and molecular methods were used to characterize Cryptosporidium oocysts before infection. Fifty bred female Swiss Albino mice were divided into 5 groups; group I (GI)(GTP): immunosuppressed and prophylactically treated with green tea extract for 5 days prior to infection, group II (GII)(GTT): immunosuppressed, infected with Cryptosporidium parvum and treated with green tea extract, group III (GIII)(NT): immunosuppressed, infected and treated with NTZ, group IV (GIV)(PC): immunosuppressed and infected (Positive control), group V (GV)(NC): immunosuppressed and non-infected (Negative control). Furthermore, parasitological examination for oocysts in the stool, and histopathological examination for the small intestine and liver specimens were performed for the study groups. Cryptosporidium oocysts used for induction of infection proved to be Cryptosporidium parvum genotype 2. Moreover, a significant oocyst reduction in fecal samples correlated with an improvement of histopathological changes in the small intestinal and liver tissues in GI(GTP), GII (GTT) and GIII(NT) groups. Besides, the GII(GTT) group showed the best improvement in parasitological and histopathological parameters among the test groups. This study revealed that Camellia sinensis (green tea extract) has potential activity against cryptosporidiosis and could serve as a promising prophylactic and therapeutic anti-cryptosporidial agent.",

Oocysts were obtained from the gut of 1- to 2-year-old common carp intensively infected with Goussia carpelli. These oocysts were mixed into mud containing infection-free oligochaetes ( Tubifex tubifex and Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri). Laboratory-cultured fish demonstrated to be infection free were infected by feeding oligochaetes. The susceptibility of 3-5 cm long fingerlings of 8 fish species [common carp (Cyprinus carpio), goldfish (Carassius auratus), barbel (Barbus barbus), bleak (Alburnus alburnus), roach (Rutilus rutilus), bream (Abramis brama), white bream (Blicca bjoerkna) and vimba (Vimba vimba)] was experimentally evaluated. In the gut of common carp, intensive infection developed each of eight experiments, and oocysts were consistently detectable in the faeces and gut s crapings on days 11-20 after feeding the fish with the oligochaetes. At the same time, oocyst formation could not be demonstrated in the gu t of the other seven cyprinids. In another experiment of similar design, only the goldfish could be infected with oocysts obtained from naturally infected goldfish, and no infection was established in the common carp. The results of these experiments suggest that G. carpelli is strictly specific to common carp, while Carassius species most closely related to the common carp are parasitised by a distinct species of Goussia with which it shares morphological similarity .",

    "abstract": "Summary. A population of Pseudoamphisiella alveolata was isolated from the coastal waters off Nagasaki, Japan. Its morphology and morphogenesis were studied by observations on organisms from life and following protargol impregnation. Morphometrical data of this form correspond well with those of the Chinese population, thus the validity of this species is confirmed. Its morphogenetic pr ocesses show a few that differ from those of P. lacazei, the type species of this genus, and main events are documented here: (1) The oral primordium of the opisthe and primary primordium of the fronto-ventral transverse cirri are possibly derived from an anarchic field of kin etosomes originating de novo on cell surface, and most ventral cirri do not contribute to the formation of these primordia; (2) The posterior portion of the parental adoral zone of membranelles is renewed in situ while the anterior part is retained by the proter; (3) Oblique streaks of FVT-anlagen in both dividers are generated from the division of primary primordium. Two buccal cirri are derived from the anter ior two streaks of the FVT-anlagen; (4) The left marginal rows and dorsal kineties equally develop by “within proliferation”; the cauda l cirri develop from the posterior end of each dorsal kinety anlage; (5) The anlagen for the right marginal rows originate parallel to FVT-anla gen; (6) So-called caudal cirri near the rightmost transverse cirri are actually migratory right marginal cirri. The present study d emonstrates that morphogenetic data can be useful in differentiating species and genera with similar morphologies.",

    "abstract": "Meseres corlissi Petz and Foissner (1992) is an oligotrichine ciliate covering the resting cyst with epicortical scales called lepidosomes. We studied in detail encystment as well as the genesis and release of the lepidosomes, using live observation, morphometry, and transmission electron microscopy. Encystment is remarkable in changing body shape distinctly and showing two phases of intense rotation. When encysting, the conical body becomes globular and forms a discoidal head via a fibrous ligament. Then, the cell rotates rapidly about its main axis for a minute. We speculate that this rotation transports the lepidosomes and cyst wall precursors to the cell's cortex. When rotation stops, the lepidosomes are released within about 5 - 20 s. Then occurs a second, slow rotation phase lasting several minutes and possibly distributing the material released by the cyst wall precursors. The lepidosomes develop in Golgi vesicles. Maturation thus occurs in a membrane-bound vesicle and is a complex process with seven distinct stages. The central cavity of the lepidosome develops asymmetrically, and the large meshes of the lepidosome wall develop earlier than the small ones. Growth of the lepidosomes does not occur by vesicular transport processes. The lepidosomes are released by classical exocytosis. The lepidosome (vesicle) membrane closes the port and becomes part of the newly forming cortex. Detailed data on encystment and lepidosome genesis are rare. However, it turned out that both, encystment and lepidosome genesis are more complex in M. corlissi than in most other ciliates.",

Trichodina fugu is distinguished by its almost rod-shaped denticle blades. Trichodina jadranica is usually described as a small trichodinid with a clear central circle in the adhesive disc and with a low number of denticles. However, the data available suggest that the species is highly variable in morphometry and the Chinese population represents the largest in body size and denticle dimensions found to date. Based on the revision of T. jadranica, two major morphotypes, each represented by several populations are classified, differing in the shape of the blades, viz., distinctly curved and sickle-shaped with pointed distal ends (as in the classical T. jadranica) vs. less curved and more or less rectangle-like with rounded distal ends (as in T. domerguei gobii). Trichodina domerguei gobii Raabe,.1959, which was synonymised with T. jadranica, is thus elevated to species rank. Furthermore, Trichodina jadranica noblei Lom, 1970 has straight and stout blades with broadly rounded distal ends and is raised to species rank: T noblei Lom, 1970. Trichodina jadranica sensu Xu et al., 1995 shows high similarities in denticle shape and dimensions as well as the central granule pattern with T chlamydis Xu et al., 1999. Thus, it is synonymised with the latter species.",

We describe the amoeboid isolate ATCC© 50593™ as a new taxon, Telaepolella tubasferens n. g. n. sp. This multinucleated amoeba has fi lose pseudopods and is superfi cially similar to members of the vampyrellids (Rhizaria) such as Arachnula impatiens Cien- kowski, 1876, which was the original identifi cation upon deposition. However, previous multigene analyses place this taxon within the Gracilipodida Lahr and Katz 2011 in the Amoebozoa. Here, we document the morphology of this organism at multiple life history stages and provide data underlying the description as a new taxon. We demonstrate that T. tubasferens is distinct from Arachnula and other rhizari- ans (Theratromyxa, Leptophrys) in a suite of morphological characters such as general body shape, relative size of pseudopods, distinction of ecto- and endoplasmic regions, and visibility of nuclei in non-stained cells (an important diagnostic character). Although Amoebozoa taxa generally have lobose pseudopods, genera in Gracilipodida such as Flamella and Filamoeba as well as several organisms previously classifi ed as protosteloid amoebae (e.g. schizoplasmodiis, cavosteliids and Stemonitales) present fi lose pseudopodia. Thus, classifi cation of amoeboid organisms merely by fi lose-lobose distinction must be reconsidered.",

The sampled population of Uronema nigricans was characterized by a cell size of 30–40 μm × 12–20 μm in vivo, an elongated elliptical outline with a prominent apical plate, and 13–15 somatic kineties. The sampled population of Lembadion lucens was characterized by a cell size of 45–80 μm × 20–50 μm in vivo, 25–35 somatic kineties, five or six caudal kinetosomes with cilia about 20 μm in length, and a single right-positioned contractile vacuole. The small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rDNA) of these species was sequenced and compared with those of their congeners to reveal nucleotide differences. The phylogenetic trees showed that the Shenzhen population of Uronema nigricans clusters with two other sequences under the name of “Uronema nigricans” (which are possibly misidentified) and then groups with Uronemita sinensis (Pan et al., 2013) Liu et al., 2016 with full support. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that genus Lembadion is monophyletic with full support provided by both Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood algorithms.

The Boise population of P. pupula is characterized by a size of about 60–130 × 20–50 μm, an elliptical macronucleus with a single micronucleus, highly refractive dumbbell-shaped inclusions scattered throughout the cytoplasm and concentrated in the anterior body half, a single subterminal/terminal contractile vacuole, about 10 μm long rod-shaped extrusomes, and an average of 15 ciliary rows. In phylogenetic analyses, the newly obtained sequences from P. pupula and Lacrymaria olor clustered within the family Lacrymariidae with full to moderate statistical support. Neither the genus Phialina nor the genus Lacrymaria was depicted monophyletic both in the single gene and multigene phylogenetic inferences. Specifically, the genus Phialina was shown as a paraphyletic assemblage containing members of the polyphyletic genus Lacrymaria. This indicates that the phialinid bauplan, i.e., an anterior body end differentiated into a head-like structure directly attached to the trunk, might represent the ground pattern in the family Lacrymariidae. On the other hand, the long highly contractile neck carrying the head-like structure probably evolved later and convergently in multiple Lacrymaria species from Phialina-like ancestors.",

A total of 60 specimens of B. surinamensis were examined, of which 52 (86%) presented whitish pseudocysts containing numerous rounded spores (7.2±0.2 μm in length and 5.2±0.2 μm in width). These spores have four polar capsules of equal size, measuring 1.8±0.2 μm x 1.3±0.1 μm in the apical view, and 2.7±0.2 μm x 1.3±0.1 μm in the lateral view. A partial sequence (1400 bps) of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene was obtained and deposited in GenBank (access number: MK256272). The comparison of the morphological and molecular data with those of other Kudoa species supported the description of a new species of mixosporean from the Amazon region, which is denominated here as Kudoa viseuensis n. sp.",

    "abstract": "Resting cysts of the terrestrial ciliate Colpoda cucullus (Nag-1 strain) are highly resistant to UV light. It has been speculated that auto-fluorescent (blue fluorescent) particles surrounding the nuclei and yellowish fluorescent layers of the cyst wall are the candidate structures for the protection of the cellular components from UV light. The UV resistance of encysting cells was quickly acquired up to 5 h after the onset of encystment induction, and then gradually increased for several days. The less fluorescent ectocyst layer, yellowish fluorescent first-synthesized endocyst layer (en-1) and the NSPs were formed within 5 h after the onset of encystment induction, and thereafter endocyst layers became gradually thicker for several days. The cyst wall sample (ectocyst and endocyst layers) markedly absorbed a broad range of UV light. This result indicates that the cyst wall evidently has UV-cut function. These results support that the cyst wall and NSPs of C. cucullus play a role in the shielding of the cell components from UV light.",

In this study, we have shown that Colpoda resting cysts survived exposure to a gamma radiation dose of 4000 Gy, although vegetative cells were killed by 500 Gy. After 4000 Gy irradiation, more than 90% of resting cysts and approximately 70% of dry cysts could excyst to form vegetative cells. In both cases, the excystment gradually increased after the induction of excystment. In addition, we also showed that protein carbonylation level was increased by gamma irradiation, but decreased by incubation in the cyst state. These results indicated that cell damage was repaired in resting cysts. Colpoda probably developed tolerance to gamma radiation by forming resting cysts as a strategy for growth in terrestrial environments, as part of contending with the stress due to reactive oxygen species caused by desiccation.",

So far, it appears that all the trichodinid populations collected from calanoids in various parts of the world are the same species, i.e. Trichodina diaptomi Sramek-Husek, 1953. This paper reports on a new record of T. diaptomi from Metadiaptomus meridianus in a large reservoir in South Africa, as well as on a new host species, Metadiaptomus transvaalensis, and the first record of T. diaptomi from pools in an ephemeral river in northern Botswana, therefore adding a new country to the distribution of this species. We used the history of the discovery of T. diaptomi in different parts of the world and came to the conclusion that it is a cosmopolitan species, exclusively associated with copepods of the order Calanoida. Based on existing information, T. diaptomi does not appear to have a reservoir host. Against this background, we provide a discussion on the possibility that, although no dormant stage has been recorded for any trichodinid, it may be possible that T. diaptomi possesses some form of diapause and that this might be related to that of calanoid copepods.",

The parasite develops in the skeletal muscle of the abdominal cavity, forming a whitish cyst-like containing several groups of two types of spores (macrospores and microspores), which were observed in close contact with the myofibrils. Small groups of macrospores (ovoid elongate, tapering more anteriorly than posteriorly and measuring about 7.8 ± 0.4 × 4.7 ± 0.2 µm) were observed among the numerous microspores (lightly pyriform to ellipsoidal with rounded ends, measured about 4.7 ± 0.3 × 2.8 ± 0.4 µm). Both types of spores possessed a single large posterior vacuole containing flocculent material. The ultrastructural aspects observed, together with the formation of a cyst-like, suggest that the parasite belongs to the genus Pleistophora. This taxonomic positioning was confirmed by the molecular analysis of the SSU rRNA gene and Maximum-likelihood (ML) inference. Comparison to similar species previously described, recognized this as a new species, herein named Pleistophora beebei sp. nov.",

Confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to image fluor stained, NiSO 4 immobilized, living protozoans in situ. Most of the stains, specific for eucaryotic cell structures, such as Paclitaxel-BodipyFL, CellTracker, DiOC 6 (3), LysoTracker Red, MitoFluor Green and Rhodamine 6G showed potential for in situ staining of protozoa. However, some of the stains also stained bacterial or polymeric biofilm constituents. Nevertheless after staining, the usually transparent protozoan cells became clearly visible within the complex architecture of environmental biofilms. With respect to staining protozoan cells only and differentiation from other biofilm constituents, CellTracker showed the highest specificity. By using this approach, protozoa can be identified and distinguished within a complex habitat by virtue of (1) specific stains targeted for eucaryotic cell features, especially CellTracker, and (2) staining in combination with information on their size and morphology. With respect to fluorochrome concentration the approach has to be fine-tuned according to the specific characteristics of the sample as well as the identity and physiological status of the protozoa.",

A population of trichodinids (Ciliophora: Trichodinidae) was found on the gills of an Indian estuarine flathead sleeper, Ophiocara porocephalus collected from the Hooghly River in West Bengal, India and was described as a new species. The species is characterized by the shape of denticles having broad and rectangular blades with truncated distal margins, parallel borders, apexes with distinct notches in the lower border of the anterior margins; robust, conical central parts; backwardly directed short, stumpy rays with prominent ray apophyses and grooves; and argentophobic central areas which are somewhat elevated from the rest of the adhesive disc and contains few to many argentophilic dots or patches. The body diameter ranged from 32.5-50.5 (42.3 ‐ 5.2) µm, whilst the denticle number was 20-27 (24.3 ‐ 1.5). This ciliophoran infested approximately 20.8% of the host fishes (54 out of 240) on their gills during March 1996 to December 1997, sometimes along with Trichodina acuta Lom, 1961 and Tripartiella copiosa Lom, 1959. The highest percentage of infestation was recorded in October 1997 (90%). The variation of the adhesive disc is recorded and discussed.",

    "abstract": "Summary. Amoeba proteus cells, strains A and C t , with well pronounced motor polarity (the polytactic and orthotactic forms) develop dense coats of discrete minipodia which anchor them to the glass substratum. The scanning electron microscopy demonstrates that minipodia are surface microprotrusions about 0.5 µm thick and up to 8 µm long, covering mainly the middle-anterior area of the ventral cell surface. They are few at the frontal zone and absent at the tail region. It means that the dense felt of discrete minipodia is located in the same region which has been earlier described as the zone of most efficient adhesion of a directionally moving amoeba. The cells without stable motor polarity and those which adhere to the glass without moving, or just start locomotion, lack areas covered by discrete minipodia; instead, minipodia are grouped in rosette contacts, which have the form of papillae composed of supporting platforms with crones of minipodia projected from them. The cells detached from the substratum by simple experimental procedures: radiate heterotactic forms produced by mechanical shocks, anucleate fragments obtained by microdissection, and amoebae in course of cation-induced pinocytosis, neither have separate minipodia nor rosette contacts. In contrast, during phagocytosis amoebae strongly adhere and produce dense sheaths of discrete minipodia extending along the whole surface up to the tail, except the naked front enclosing the phagosome. It was demonstrated by staining with the fluorescein-conjugated phalloidin that both types of adhesive structures: the discrete minipodia as well as the rosette contacts are very rich in the cytoskeletal F-actin.",

Flagellates were subanteriorly biflagellate, uninucleate, and naked. Golgi dictyosomes were anterior to the nucleus, and a reticulate paranuclear body posterior to it. Two groups of refractile bodies were present, one at the anterior end of the cell, the other in the vicinity of the nucleus. Numerous elongate, unbranched mitochondria with tubular cristae were distributed around the periphery and parallel to the long axis of the cell. The kinetid consisted of two symmetrical subunits, each with two basal bodies (one of which was associated with a stubby flagellum), a compound microtubular root, and associated fibers and bands. Cytoskeletal microtubules emanated from the cell anterior and were not associated with any kinetid element. Feeding, on yeast, was accomplished by rapid pseudopodial action at the posterior end of the cell. Cholamonas cyrtodiopsidis is referred to Cercomonadida because it possesses a paranuclear body and has a kinetid architecture similar to some species of Cercomonas. It differs from all other cercomonads in its endocommensal habitat, mycophagy, doubled kinetid, distribution of refractile granules and mitochondria, and minimal production of pseudopodia.",

In the first comprehensive investigation of endocytobionts present in the cytoplasm of endosymbiotic ciliates from mussels, bacteria are described from Conchophthirus acuminatus and an undescribed Ophryoglena sp. species which are, respectively, commensal and parasitic in the freshwater bivalve Dreissena polymorpha. Light microscopy, electron microscopy, Feulgen staining, and in situ observation indicated that in some populations of C. acuminatus practically all individuals were infected with cytoplasmic bacteria. Some of these bacteria were in the α -subgroup of proteobacteria. In situ hybridization indicated that some other eubacteria with a very similar morphology were also present in the cytoplasm of C. acuminatus. Using in situ hybridization with appropriate oligonucleotide probes, a large amount of bacteria, most of which were also in the α -subgroup, were observed in the cytoplasm of each specimen of Ophryoglena sp. examined. Some bacteria with virus particles were also observed in a population of the Ophryoglena sp. The bacteria in C. acuminatus were not likely the same as in the Ophryoglena sp. The presence of α -subgroup proteobacteria in the cytoplasm of both endosymbiotic ciliates, in conjunction with previous reports of these bacteria in free-living species, indicates that they are widely established endocytobionts in these protists.",

    "abstract": "Insulin has many different effects on Tetrahymena, as e.g. on the glucose uptake, cell division, survival, phosholipase D activity and insulin production. PI 3-kinase is one of the key enzymes in the action of insulin. Thus it was supposed that similarly to the higher eukaryotes, PI 3-kinase activity plays fundamental role in the insulin action also in Tetrahymena. Here we report that PI 3-kinase-like activity is immunoprecipitated from Tetrahymena cell lysate with anti-IRS 1 and anti-p85 antibodies. Both immunoprecipitates contain higher PI 3-kinase activity from lysate of insulin treated cells than the lysate of untreated ones. In vivo treatments with PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin (100-500 nM) and LY 294002 (10-20 pM) elevated the PI 3-kinase activity in the IRS 1-antibody precipitable material, while in anti-p85 antibody precipitate this activity was lower than in the controls. In vitro, wortmannin proved to be an effective PI 3-kinase inhibitor. Immunostaining revealed that p85 immunoreactivity localized to the cortex of cells, while IRS 1 localized cytoplasmically. In vivo treatments with both PI 3-kinase inhibitors elevated the amount of IRS 1, while p85 immunoreactivity was increased only after wortmannin treatments. Both PI 3-kinase inhibitors reduced the F-actin content of cells. Wortmannin caused a forward cytoplasmic stream, which translocate the nucleus towards cytopharynx. These treatments inhibited the phagocytotic activity significantly. On the basis of the results, we propose that in Tetrahymena a PI 3-kinase like activity is functioning; the ability of both PI 3-kinase inhibitors and insulin to influence the synthesis or association of subunits of PI 3-kinase, and to influence F-actin remodelling and F-actin dependent processes (e.g. phagocytosis) indicate the supposed activity of PI 3-kinase in Tetrahymena.",

Two new species of the predominantly marine sand-dwelling testate rhizopod genera Psammonobiotus and Corythionella were discovered in sand beaches of the Canadian Laurentian Great Lakes. The most important differences between P. dziwnowi sp. n. its closest relative P. communis are (i) much smaller size of P. dziwnowi, (ii) greater length-to-width ratio in P. dziwnowi, (iii) greater angle of the plane of the oral aperture relative to the long axis of the test of P. dziwnowi. The only other known freshwater species of Corythionella, C. golemanskyi Nicholls, occurred together with C. georgiana sp. n. in samples from Wasaga Beach, Georgian Bay (Lake Huron) and enabled a direct comparison of test morphology of both populations occurring under the same environmental conditions. As well as a sign ificantly smaller test size in C. georgiana, other differences with C. golemanskyi include smaller more elongate scales arranged in a more open nonoverlapping pattern on the test surface of C. georgiana. Notwithstanding some uncertainties about the taxonomy of C. acolla, which is the only one of six marine species of Corythionella lacking a flared pseudostomal collar, the differences between it and C. georgiana, which has a minimally flared collar, include a generally shorter length, a much broader post-pseudostomal region and greater ratio of test widthto-pseudostome diameter in C. georgiana. These differences (ignoring, for the present, possible additional differences in the structure of the scale layer on the tests of C. georgiana and C. acolla), substantiate the designation of C. georgiana as an independent species.",

These xenomas are found in the skeletal muscle adjacent to the abdominal cavity. The xenoma wall, with an irregular surface, consists of concentric laminated layers of compressed cells, possibly fibroblasts. Developing cells are in direct contact with host cell cytoplasm. Among the mature spores, small groups of juxtaposed immature spores are observed. The spores are ellipsoidal and uninucleate, measuring ~2.95×1.68 μm (n=50). The isofilar filament (~55 nm diameter), consists of a regular coil in a single layer with 9-10 (or rarely 8) turns surrounding the posterior vacuole of the spore. The vacuole occupies about half of the total volume of the spore. The angle of tilt of the turns is ~37°. The spore wall is in direct contact with the cytoplasm of the host cells. A few larger grouped spores, measuring ~6.9×2.5 μm (n=20), were observed mainly at the periphery of the most xenomas. The filament consists of two or three irregular layers of coils with 27-28 turns surrounding the posterior vacuole. The ultrastructural morphology of the spores and host specificity suggest that they may be included in the collective group of new Microsporidium species and named Microsporidium brevirostris.

This trace gas is predominantly produced by strictly anaerobic methanogenic archaea, which thrive in the most divergent ecological niches, e. g. paddy fields, sediments, landfills, and the digestive tract of various animals. Methanogenic archaea also live as endosymbionts in the cytoplasm of anaerobic protozoa. In marine sediments these endosymbionts can contribute up to 90% to the overall rate of methanogenesis, whereas their role of in freshwater sediments is largely unknown. Here we describe the results of a one year's survey of the methanogenesis by endosymbiotic methanogens in four different Dutch freshwater sediments. The abundance of anaerobic protozoa, in particular ciliates, the methane production rates by the ecosystem and by the protists, and a number of abiotic parameters were measured. A novel method (heatshock for 5 min) for estimating the contribution by endosymbiotic methanogens was established. Our results reveal large fluctuations of ciliate abundance throughout the year, but on average, only minor contributions by methanogenic endosymbionts to the total methanogenesis in these environments",

A bit different situation was found for the most southern range of I. duplicatus (SE Czech Republic), where the insect's distribution mostly depends on spruce forests. Although the infection level of C. typographi is similar to E Czech Republic in both bark beetles, in contrary, only 4.4% beetles were infected by L. duplicati. Two pathogens, Gregarina typographi, and Pichia sp., appear only as minor admixture, apparently related to local population densities. The infection of I. duplicatus with L. duplicati frequently reaches a high level in both throughout the range of I. duplicatus and the season.",

Their capacity to produce cysts during unfavorable growth periods, especially drying, enhances their survivability as resting stages and promotes dispersal by wind and air currents. However, the dynamics of their cycles of encystment and active growth are poorly documented. Using a recently developed culture observation method, including a dried preparation stage to detect encysted amoebae, data are presented on the ratios of active and encysted stages of naked amoebae based on field samples from diverse terrestrial sites differing in plant cover and moisture content during spring and summer months 2008 at a location in northeastern U.S.A. Percentage of encysted amoebae varied between 32% and 100% depending on locale and moisture content. Carbon content of the cysts (estimated from recently excysted individuals) relative to trophic stages varied between 22% and 100% at these same locales. Laboratory experimental studies of winter soil samples, that were cultured at 25oC to promote amoeba community growth, indicated that a dynamic relationship exists between active and encysted stages during proliferation with varying ratios depending on the moisture content and qualities of the soil at the collection site, thus suggesting a revised model as presented here of the encystment-excystment cycle for populations during a growth succession.",

Understanding the spatial distribution of soil protozoa under the snow cover is important for estimation of ecosystem responses to climate change and interpretation of results of fi eld experiments. This work explores spatial patterns of soil testate amoebae under the snow cover at the plot scale (the range of metres) in arctic tundra (Qeqertarsuaq/Disko Island, West Greenland). To explain spatial patterns in abundance, species diversity and assemblage composition of testate amoebae, we measured microtopography, snow depth and substrate density. The results indicate that the abundance of active testate amoebae under the snow cover was quite low. The empty shell assemblage was characterised by the presence of linear spatial trends in the species composition across the site, whereas no patterns were detected within the plot. The distribution of the abundance and the species diversity were unstructured. The linear trends in the species composition corresponded to the site microtopography and were controlled by the topography-related soil moisture. Snow depth also affected the linear trends presumably by controlling soil temperatures. Overall, the results suggest that population processes do not generate spatial patterns in protozoan assemblages at the plot scale so that protozoan distribution can be considered random at macroscopically homogeneous plots.",

GF1 forms aggregated cyst masses similar to the early stages of Acrasis sorocarp development, in agreement with the view that it shares ancestry with the acrasids. Time-lapse video microscopy reveals that trophozoites are attracted to individuals that have already begun to encyst or that have formed cysts.

They are known to cause serious human infections, including a fatal encephalitis, a blinding keratitis, and pneumonia. The main aim of the study was detection and molecular identification of Acanthamoeba spp., Naegleria fowleri, Balamuthia mandrillaris, Sappinia pedata, and Vermoamoeba vermiformis (formerly Hartmannella vermiformis) in artificial water bodies in North-Western Poland. We examined 86 water samples collected during 2-year period from 43 water bodies, including outdoor and indoor swimming pools, firefighting reservoirs, fountains, as well as water network. The samples were filtrated using Filta-Max® membrane filters (IDEXX Laboratories, USA) and, in order to select potentially pathogenic, thermophilic strains and to limit the number of PCR examined samples, the thermal tolerance test was carried out. Obtained filtrates were transferred to non-nutrient agar plates with E. coli. The agar plates were incubated at 37°C and then proliferated amoebae were passaged at 42°C. DNA was extracted from the thermophilic trophozoites and then polymerase chain reactions and sequence analysis were performed for molecular identification of FLA. From the 86 collected water samples 57 strains of FLA were able to proliferate at 37°C and 7 of them showed ability to proliferate at 42°C. For molecular identification of Acanthamoeba spp. and V. vermiformis, regions of 18S rDNA were amplified. In order to detect B. mandrillaris DNA, we used mitochondrial 16S rDNA as a marker, and for detection of N. fowleri and S. pedata – ITS regions. Based on molecular analysis, isolates were classified to the genus Acanthamoeba (T4 and T11 genotypes, as well as the new genotypes detected earlier in clinical samples and named T16) and V. vermiformis species. Detected strains were highly similar or identical to pathogenic strains detected earlier in patients. Our results show a wide distribution of potential pathogenic FLA, as Acanthamoeba T4, T11, T16 genotypes, and V. vermiformis species in various artificial water bodies located in North-Western Poland and suggest a potential threat to health of humans in this part of the country.",

Combining morphologic observations with molecular-based analyses, we assessed the diversity of major phagotrophic protist groups in two contrasting glacier forefields in the Swiss Alps (Tiefen glacier forefield, siliceous bedrock, and Wildstrubel glacier forefield, calcareous bedrock), at sites differing in soil development. Ciliates and heterotrophic flagellates could be detected with both approaches, while amoebae could be observed only microscopically. Soils from Tiefen and Wildstrubel glacier forefields harboured distinctly different ciliate, flagellate and amoebae communities. The ciliate clone libraries from the Tiefen glacier forefield were dominated by Oligohymenophorea-related sequences while those from the Wildstrubel glacier forefield were dominated by Spirotrichea-related sequences. Testate amoebae morphospecies of the genera Corythion , Cryptodifflugia , Euglypha and Tracheleuglypha were restricted to the Tiefen glacier forefield, while Centropyxis and Trinema to the Wildstrubel one. No ciliate sequences and only a few ciliate and testate amoebae morphospecies could be retrieved from unvegetated soils of both glacier forefields. The ciliate and testate amoebae community detected at unvegetated sites were a subset of the community developed at vegetated sites. Overall, our results suggest that alpine glacier forefields are colonised by a diverse community of phagotrophic protists which seems to be shaped by bedrock geology and vegetation cover.",

Scanning electron microscope observations showed that E. gigantea had different striation patterns on the stalk; there was a swell made of cement by which the stalk was attached to wakame firmly; and the buds had cilia arranged in concentric circles about a ring in the center of the ventral side. A suctorian parasite was found to infect E. gigantea , and the infection seemed to have decreased drastically the attached density of E. gigantea on wakame. Cell size of parasite-infected E. gigantea individuals was larger than that of uninfected individuals, probably because larger E. gigantea has larger surface area for attachment of the parasite.

    "abstract": "Among the most prolific invasive plant species posing threats to the ecological balance of ecosystems in North America and Europe is Japanese knotweed (Fallopia japonica). In order to identify the potential role of protists in the invasive capacity of Japanese knotweed the winter abundances of naked amoebae in soils from three roadside thickets of Japanese knotweed were compared to nearby non-invaded sites. Japanese knotweed soils had higher abundances (t = 5.43, df, 16, p < 0.001) of amoebae than comparison sites. This is one of the first studies to document higher abundances of soil naked amoebae associated with an invasive plant, and may indicate more generally that below-ground abundances of amoebae can promote soil fertility and support the successful adaptation and expansion of some invasive plant species. Moreover, analysis of encysted vs. trophic forms of naked amoebae in the winter soil, provided evidence of freezeresistant, amoeba resting cells in soil samples from the natural environment in support of prior findings that were based solely on laboratory experimental evidence. Overall, high densities of naked amoebae in the winter soils of Japanese knotweed, some as resting cells capable of forming rapidly activated trophic stages, likely increase soil fertility and strengthen the species’ invasive capacity.",

These genera have been considered synonyms and thecal plate designations varied among authors. Several planktonic and sand-dwelling genera have been placed within the Oxytoxaceae. We obtained the first molecular data based on small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene sequences of Oxytoxum and Corythodinium, including the type species (O. scolopax and C. tessellatum) and C. frenguellii and C. cristatum. The three species of Corythodinium branched together a strong support [bootstrap (BP) of 98%]. This formed a sister clade with moderate support (BP 75%) with O. scolopax that supported the generic split. Oxytoxaceae should exclusively remain for Oxytoxum and Corythodinium, as an independent group, unrelated to any other known dinoflagellate. Oxytoxum was characterized by spindle-shaped cells with an anterior narrow epitheca, an apical spine and little cingular displacement. Corythodinium exhibits relatively broad cell shapes, with wider epitheca and greater cingular displacement, and an obovate or pentangular anterior sulcal plate that noticeably indented the epitheca. This suggested the need of new combinations for species that were described as Oxytoxum and possessed the characteristics of Corythodinium.",

    "abstract": "Shell composition is considered an important functional trait in testate amoebae community. Differences in the composition of shells may represent adaptations of these organisms to changes in the availability of environmental resources. We aimed to evaluate the influence of these environmental resources on the presence of different testate amoeba species, based on observation of one important functional trait (shell composition), in floodplain environments. We hypothesised that species diversity would increase with increased availability of food (chlorophyll-a; a critical environmental requirement). We also predicted that a higher concentration of suspended inorganic material would contribute to the occurrence of species that have an exogenous shell. Testate amoeba samples were taken between 2002 and 2011 in plankton of ten floodplain environments. A significant positive correlation was noted between the concentration of chlorophyll-a and the diversity of testate amoeba species according to a simple regression analysis. Furthermore, non-metric multidimensional scaling showed distinct groups with lower and higher concentration of suspended inorganic material. The occurrence of testate amoeba species with smaller exogenous shells was the most influenced by environments with higher concentrations of suspended inorganic material. Thus, our results emphasised that the evaluated environmental resources are important as assembly factors to shell traits in testate amoebae community.",

Although thousands of species have been discovered, their total diversity still remains unknown. Here, we will discuss two unsolved problems that hinder the further exploration of ciliate diversity at the species level, and potential solutions to these problems are proposed. First, ciliate morphospecies are difficult to identify because the different silver stains are not scalable (they do not represent high-throughput methods) and basic supplies are lacking (e.g., protargol); a solution may be the development of fluorescent staining techniques. Second, ciliate phylogenetic species are difficult to identify because of extensive paralogy in nuclear-protein-coding genes; a solution may be to concentrate on sequencing mitochondrial genomes. These two approaches could be integrated into a high-throughput fluorescent-single-cell sorting and mitochondrial genomes sequencing process that would enable the observation and better understanding of ciliate species on a massive scale.",

The technique of pulsed field gel electrophoresis has been used to differentiate the chromosomes of Glugea stephani, Microgemma ovoidea, and two isolates of Spraguea lophii from different regions of Spain (Atlantic Ocean at Galicia and Mediterranean Sea at Catalonia). Although the karyotype of M. ovoidea could not be completely resolved, the range of sizes of its chromosomes was obtained (282-2601Kb). G. stephani showed 15 bands ranging 340-2654Kb and an estimated total size of the haploid genome of about 16775Kb. Both isolates of S. lophii had a very similar karyotype with 10 bands for the Atlantic isolate (range 266-1076 Kb) and 11 bands for the Mediterranean isolate (range 271-1120Kb). Digital processing of the gels allowed detection of non-homologous chromosome co-migration and revealed that both S.lophii isolates had 15 different kinds of DNA fragments, which could be interpreted by a homozygotic hypothesis (15 chromosomes) or a heterozygotic hypothesis (14 chromosome pairs, 13 pairs with the same size for both homologous, and a pair formed by a chromosome of about 423-490 Kb and its homologous of 353-495Kb).",

The morphology of nondividers is described based upon light microscopy of living and silver stained cells. In addition we provide a detailed descrip tion of the ultrastructure of the cells. C. mnemosyne is dorsoventrally flattened and ciliated only on the ventral surface which is separated from the dorsal surface by a peculiar transversally striped band at the margin of the cells. This band consists of regularly arranged C- shaped clasps with a complex multilayered fine structure. The somatic ciliature is subdivided in right and left fields of kineties flanking a medial field of 4 postoral kineties. The somatic monokinetids are associated with tubular and fibrillar cytoskeletal elements according to the phyllopharyngid pattern, the most pronounced feature being a pack of subkinetal microtubules. Similar to other cyrtophorid ciliates the oral ci liature consists of an inner and an outer circumoral kinety as well as a preoral kinety all of which are built up from dikinetids with their ant erior kinetosome bearing the cilium. The oral apparatus consists of an inner ring of cytopharyngeal lamellae and an outer ring of 9 large and 2 small anteriorly positioned nematodesmal rods resulting in the bilateral appearance of the cytopharyngeal basket. The rods are capped with so ca lled dentes which harbour a barren kinetosome each. The detailed ultrastructural description provided here serves as a basis for studies on the morphogenesis of C. mnemosyne, part of which are presented in an accompanying paper (Bardele and Kurth 2001).",

The key features of the new family, which belongs to the order Spathidiida Foissner and Foissner, 1988, are the truncated anterior body end and the spoon-shaped oral bulge, respectively, circumoral kinety. The anterior truncation causes a highly characteristic bend of the oral bulge and circumoral kinety in the transition zone of spoon-shovel and spoon-handle, that is, subapically where the oral bulge and the circumoral kinety enter the ventral side of the cell. Based on literature data, Holophrya emmae Bergh, 1896 and Pseudoprorodon armatus Kahl, 1930a are classified as representatives of two further new myriokaryonid genera, viz., Berghophrya gen. n. and Kahlophrya gen. n. Genera within the Myriokaryonidae are distinguished by details of the dorsal brush and the arrangement of the somatic ciliary rows and extrusomes. Pseudoprorodon emmae (Bergh, 1896), as redescribed by Song and Wilbert (1989), is recognized as a new genus and species, Songophrya armata gen. n., sp. n., likely belonging to the gymnostomatous family Pseudoholophryidae.",

Among these, U. transfuga is morphologically different to the others (large cell size, more macronuclear segments etc.). By contrast, U. setigera and U. binucleata are very similar and difficult to separate based only on their morphologies. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fingerprinting and amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analyses (ARDRA riboprinting) were therefore performed in order to confirm the division between them and to aid species identification. Using 4 different random primers the RAPD fingerprinting revealed 3 distinct patterns. Thus, 7 strains could be separated into 3 species with a similarity index of over 82% between different strains of the same species and only 30% to 40% between strains of different species. The unique restriction pattern of highly-conserved rDNA fragments (ARDRA) of different strains of U. setigera and U. binucleata using the enzyme Msp I was found to be species-specific and could be applicable for both species identification and species separation. According to our molecular analyses, the Uronychia-populations comprised at least 3 taxa (morphospecies). Moreover, the morphologically similar U. setigera and U. binucleata could be reliably separated and identified at the molecular level.",

Amoeboid cells display a hyaline margin and a central granular area containing the nucleus, the internalized flagellar apparatus, and organelles such as Golgi bodies, hydrogenosomes, and food vacuoles with bacteria or wood particles. Immunofluorescence microscopy using monoclonal antibodies raised against Trichomonas vaginalis cytoskeleton, such as the anti-tubul in IG10, reveals the three long anteriorly-directed flagella, and the axostyle folded into the cytoplasm. A second antibody, 4E5, decorates the conspicuous crescent-shaped structure or cresta bordered by the adhering recurrent flagellum. Transmission electron micrographs show a microfibrillar network in the cytoplasmic margin and internal bundles of microfilaments similar to those of lobose amoebae that are indicative of cytoplasmic streaming. They also confirm the internalization of the flagella. The arrangement of basal bodies and fibre appendages, and the axostyle composed of a rolled sheet of microtubules are very close to that of the devescovinids Foaina and Devescovina. The very large microfibrillar cresta supporting an enlarged recurrent flagellum resembles that of Macrotrichomonas. The parabasal apparatus attached to the basal bodies is small in comparison to the cell size; this is probably related to the presence of many Golgi bodies supported by a striated fibre that are spread throughout the central cytoplasm in a similar way to Placojoenia and Mixotricha.",

The testate amoebae (Protozoa, Rhizopoda) fauna was studied along several small soil profiles, which were collected in the wetvalley soils of Ile de la Possession (Crozet Archipelago, sub-Antarctica). All soil cores were divided into 3 zones (0-3 / 3-6 / 6-10 cm) andresults were compared with an earlier soil study on the island, when soil samples were taken at a depth of 5 to 10 cm. There was no turn-over of testacean taxa between the different soil layers, but the changes in the community structure of the communities along t he soil horizonswere remarkable. In the upper soil layers (0-3 cm) more taxa belonging to characteristic morphological soil test types were observed, testtypes which were rarely encountered in the soil samples taken at a depth of 5 to 10 cm. The genera Assulina, Centropyxis, Corythion,Heleopera and Nebela were more abundant in the upper soil horizons, which led to a reduced dominance of the genus Trinema. Also theliving fraction of the testacean fauna was significantly higher in the upper soil zones, whereas the highest amount of cysts was observedin the lowest soil horizon (6-10 cm). Some notes are made on the different disappearance patterns of “Filose” and “Lobose” taxa alongthe valley soil profiles of Ile de la Possession. All observed changes along the small soil profiles emphasize the importance o f the soil samplingstrategy.Key words: community structure, Ile de la Possession, morphological soil test types, peaty valley soils, soil sampling strategy, testateamoebae.",

One of these was assigned to C. acolla Golemansky, after the specific circumscription of this taxon was revised to exclude smaller forms and forms with distinctively different test morphology that have been previously published under this binomen. The other two morphotypes were assigned to two new species, C. gwaii n. sp. and C. rachelcarsoni n. sp., owing to their consistent and statistically well-defined sizes and shapes. C. gwaii is characterized by a pronounced concavity of the ventral surface of its test and an elliptical pseudostomal aperture that is wider than long. C. rachelcarsoni is characterized by a test that is about one-half the size of C. gwaii and C. acolla and further differs from them by virtue of its relatively longer neck region associated with its minimally flared collar surrounding a pseudostomal aperture that is significantly larger (relative to test width) than in C. acolla. Also, the scales covering the test are significantly smaller than those in C. acolla. Scales of C. gwaii and C. rachelcarsoni apparently lack the marginal rim and median ridge found in scales of C. acolla emend.",

Eukaryot. Microbiol. 54: 125-136], it became obvious that Tuffrau actually had identified a morphologically highly similar novel Euplotes species. Therefore, we here describe Euplotes elegans sensu Tuffrau, 1960 as Euplotes pseudoelegans n. sp. As a cosmopolitan and euryhaline species, E. pseudoelegans n. sp. has been reported from marine, brackish and freshwater habitats from the tropics to the high Arctic. In vivo, the oval species is 40-89 μm long and 30-63 μm wide. The adoral zone extends to more than 2/3-3/4 of the body length and is composed of 33-49 membranelles. Euplotes pseudoelegans n. sp. possesses 9 fronloventral cirri (cirrus V1/2 is completely reduced), 5 transversal cirri and 4 caudal cirri (2 right caudal and 2 left marginal cirri). The dorsal silverline system is of the multiple type with 3-5 irregular shaped polygons between the dorsolateral kineties. Euplotes pseudoelegans n. sp. possesses 8 longitudinal kineties with approximately 20 kinetids in the mid-dorsal kinety. As no type preparation or type location is given, a neotypification or redescription including a phylogenetic analysis of this species and a detailed comparison with morphological highly similar species (e.g. E. muscorum Dragcsco, 1970 and E. muscicola Kahl, 1932) are highly recommended.",

Sporonts are spherical to elongate and measure 4.2 to 6.2 μm. Diplokaryotic sporonts divide once to produce two sporoblasts which mature into spores. Sporoblasts are elongated and measure 3.2 to 5.2 μm in length. Fresh spores with nuclei arranged in a diplokaryon are oval and measure 4.13 ± 0.25 μm in length and 2.26 ± 0.19 μm in width. Spores stained with Giemsa's stain measure 3.80 ± 0.25 μm in length and 2.18 ± 0.17 μm in width. Spores have an isofilar polar filament with six or seven coils.

Judging from the results that total α-tubulin content did not decrease much until 12 h after encystment induction, the result indicates that disassembly of microtubules may occur soon after encystment is induced. Therefore, we tried to visualize dynamics of microtubules. Immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-α-tubulin antibody indicated that disassembly of axonemal microtubules of cilia became within 1.5 h after encystment induction, and resorbed in 3 days. Although the cytoplasmic microtubules failed to be visualized clearly, encystmentdependent globulation of cells was promoted by taxol, an inhibitor of disassembly of microtubules. It is possible that a temporary formation of cytoplasmic microtubules may be involved in cell globulation. The phosphorylation level of actin (43 kDa) became slightly elevated just after encystment induction. Lepidosomes, the sticky small globes surrounding encysting cells, were vividly stained with Acti-stain 555 phalloidin, suggesting that 43-kDa actin or its homologues may be contained in lepidosomes.",

    "abstract": "We found that the water-rich (osmolality below 0.052 Osm/l) wet resting cysts of the soil ciliate Colpoda cucullus Nag-1 were tolerant to extremely low temperature (−65℃). When cell fluid obtained from the resting cysts was cooled at −65℃, small particles of ice crystals did not grow into large ice crystals. At −65℃, the cysts shrank due to an outflow of water, because a vapor pressure difference was produced between the cell interior and freezing surrounding medium. The osmolality of these shrunk cells was estimated 0.55 Osm/l, and the freezing point depression of the shrunk cell fluid was estimated to be 1.02℃. Hence, the antifreeze ability of wet cysts at −65℃can not be explained by freezing point depression due to elevation of cytoplasmic osmolality. The cytoplasm of resting cysts was vividly stained red with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and stained purple with toluidine blue. On the other hand, the excystment-induced cysts were not stained with PAS, and exhibited a loss of the antifreeze activity. PAS staining of SDSPAGE gel obtained from encysting Colpoda cells showed that a large amount of PAS-positive macromolecules accumulated as the encystment stage progressed. These results suggest that antifreeze polysaccharides may be involved in the antifreeze activity of C. cucullus Nag-1 dormant forms.",

The stalk elongated first, followed by enlargement of body length and body width, with body width increasing linearly with time. Over 5-6 days, E. gigantea increased 4-5-fold by external budding. Such an experiment was carried out for the first time for E. gigantea and possibly for any Ephelota species.

    "abstract": "Summary. This study was designed to determine the prevalence of coccidia species in the domestic geese (Anser anser domesticus) in Kars province, Turkey. The study involved 400 randomly selected geese of different age and localities. The faecal samples were collected between May and October, 2001 from the cloaca of individual animals. The samples were examined by using saturated salty water flotation technique. OPG (oocysts per gram of faeces) counts in faecal samples containing oocysts were calculated by modified McMaster technique. The sporulation of coccidia oocysts was done in potassium dichromate solution at 27 o C. Coccidian oocysts were detected in 80.8% of the samples and seven different species of Eimeriidae were identified. The species identified in this study were Tyzzeria parvula (81.7%), Eimeria anseris (11.2%), E. fulva (16.7%), E. hermani (13.3%), E. nocens (2.8%), E. stigmosa (31.6%), and E. truncata (37.8%). The OPG counts in infected geese ranged from 100 to 144 000. The rate of mixed infections was 64.4% and that of pure infection was 35.6%. The rate of mixed infections caused by two different coccidia species was 43%. During this study, necropsies were performed on 32 goslings that died of clinical diarrhea. Endogenous developing forms (meronts, gamonts) of coccidia species were seen in the intestine of 21 (65.6%) geese. Of these, 5 (5/21) had characteristic lesions of intestinal coccidiosis. Examination of kidneys revealed endogenous developing forms of E. truncata in the tubulus of 4 goslings (4/21).",

    "abstract": "Summary. The unicellular ciliate, Tetrahymena contains molecules which immunologically and functionally resemble to human hormones. Up to now, of the pituitary glycoprotein hormones only the presence of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was demonstrated. In the present experiment we observed the presence of molecules immunologically similar to human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). This hormone-li ke material is localized diffusely in the cell, and in higher amount in the cortical region, in the cilia and in the oral field. After one hour treatment (hormonal imprinting) with luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone, mixture of these two hormones, HCG, or thyrotropic hor mone (TSH), more fluorescence intensity (given by the hormone) can be observed. Twenty four hours or four days after these treatments the a mount of hormone-like materials seems to be higher, than in the untreated cells or immediately after treatment. The diffuse localization disappears in the body of the cell after LH or FSH treatment and the hormone concentrates peripheral, in the cortex and especially in (or on) the cilia. The largest amount of hormone-like material seems to be present after LH+FSH or TSH treatment. These results mean that in Tetrahymena enhanced production of the appropriate hormone could be induced by hormone treatment (imprinting), which is maintained in the progeny ge nerations. The experiments support that hormonal imprinting of receptor and hormone production can run parallel.",

(Microspora: Amblyosporidae) was isolated from testes of a water boatman Sigara lateralis (Heteroptera: Corixidae) near Bavorov, South Bohemia, Czech Republic. The life cycle of the pathogen includes a merogony with uninucleate stages, a meiotic sequence in part with binucleate stages (diplokarya) and a sporogony resulting in a persiste nt sporophorous vesicle containing eight spores. Spores are long oval, slightly curved, with broader basis and equally rounded ends, 5 ± 0.5 x 2.5 ± 0.5 µm in diameter. A series ending with early spores serving for autoinfection in the primary host and spread of the infection in oth er tissues differs in ultrastructure of spores. They are shorter and more constricted apically and measure 4 x 2.5 ± 3 µm. Both spore types have a polaroplast with a central part with multiple broad chambers enclosed anteriorly and posteriorly in circular layers of dense lamellae. The spore wall of both types is characterized by a thin exospore and an endospore of equal thickness all over the spore with exception of the attenuated apical pole. Mature spores have an anisofilar polar filament coiled in 9 - 11 turns with first 5 - 6 broader turns and 4 - 5 na rrower turns. The early spores have the filament coiled in 7 turns, of which 4 are broader and 3 narrower. All characteristics of the new mic rosporidium reveal that it is similar to different Amblyosporidae and we therefore propose to include it into this family. The new genus Becnelia is proposed with B. sigarae as a type species. The taxonomic position as well as the relationships to other microsporidia described from Heteroptera are discussed.",

R. China, were described based on observations of specimens in vivo and following protargol impregnation. Since no recent data deriving from silver staining methods on these two species are available, detailed redescriptions were presented. Based on the previous and current studies, improved redefinition for two hitherto confused genera Gastrocirrhus and Euplotidium are supplied. The diagnosis for Gastrocirrhus: marine planktonic Gastrocirrhidae, cells generally cup- or bell-shaped with anterior end truncated; oral field broad and opening anteriorly; adoral zone of membranelles dominant, terminated deeply near cytostome after spiraling around bell-edge in one turn; undulating membrane single-structured; frontoventral cirri arranged in two rows, which are formed by multi-anlagen during morphogenesis; 5 or more well-developed transverse cirri; marginal and caudal cirri absent. Diagnosis for the genus Euplotidium: marine Gastrocirrhidae, body shape cylindrical to dorso-ventrally flattened, buccal apparatus being of Euplotes-pattern; about 10 frontoventral cirri sparsely distributed but not in rows; ca 5 transverse and one or more left marginal cirri; no caudal cirri. Based on the new definition and the data available, 5 nominal species are recognized in the genus Euplotidium: E. itoi Ito, 1958; E. psammophilius (Vacelet, 1961) Borror, 1972 [basonym: Euplotes psammophilius Vacelet, 1961]; E. arenarium Magagnini et Nobili, 1964; E. helgae Hartwig, 1980 and E. prosaltans Tuffrau, 1985, and 5 in Gastrocirrhus: G. intermedius Lepsi, 1928; G. stentoreus Bullington, 1940; G. monilifer (Ozaki et Yagiu, 1942) Curds et Wu, 1983 [junior synonym: G. adhaerens Faure-Fremiet, 1954; G. trichocystus Ito, 1958]; G. agitatus (Noland, 1937) comb. n.

Oocysts of Eimeria arakanensis n. sp. are broadly oval to subspherical, 28.0 (24-30) × 23.6 (22-25) µm, with a smooth, colourless, uni-layered wall ~ 0.6 µm thick, possessing a large globular oocyst residuum. Sporocysts are ellipsoidal to oval, 12.8 (12-15) × 7 (6-8) µm, with a smooth and colourless sporocyst wall; St ieda body present, knob-like, ~ 1 × 1-2 µm, substieda body homogenous, sub-globular, 1-1.5 × 1.5-2 µm. Additionally, oocysts of Eimeria cf. mitraria (Laveran et Mesnil, 1902) were found in all nine examined turtles. H. depressa represents a new host for this coccidium. Host specificity and taxonomy of E. mitraria, yet recorded by previous authors from turtles of four families, is discussed.",

Samples were collected during different seasons (February, May and August in 2007) from two distinct ecological sites. A total of 695 clones from six libraries were clustered into 162 operational taxonomic unit (OTU), most of which were affiliated with cryptophyta, stramenopile, alveolata, fungi, cercozoa or chlorophyta. Overall, 74% of OTUs were ＜98% similar to any sequences in GenBank, and 56% of these were ＜95% similar to previously recovered sequences, which is indicative of undersampled taxa in freshwater ecosystems. Both sites included many unique OTUs and the MECC diversities were higher at East Bay than at Meiliang Bay. Nearly 90% of OTUs were only detected in one of three seasons, suggesting a temporal variation of MECC. Canonical correspondence analysis suggested that concentrations of total phosphorus and total dissolved nitrogen and the densities of cladocera and rotifera were the most important factors in explaining the spatio-temporal variations of MECC.",

The significant variables were screened and chosen from previously reported algal culture media using Plackett Burman Design (PBD). Optimization of the significant variables were performed using central composite design. The Pareto chart for PBD revealed that the salts such as sodium bicarbonate, sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate and ferrous sulphate had enhanced the biomass and lipid production. The variables and its effect on the responses were further studied by central composite design (CCD). A new medium was formulated based on the response surface methodology. The predicted concentration of NaHCO3, NaNO3, KNO3, MgSO4.7H2O were found to be 6.75 g/L, 0.75 g/L, 1.88 g/L and 0.35 g/L respectively. The actual and the predicted total lipid yield for the optimized media was around 0.74 g/L and 0.78 g/L respectively. The optimal medium has been named as AM medium. Growth and the lipid yields of C. oleofaciens were found higher in AM medium. The specific growth rates of C. oleofaciens in AM and CFTRI media were found to be 0.14 day-1 and 0.19 day-1 respectively. The biomass produced by the optimized AM medium was found to be 2.7 times greater compared to the CFTRI medium. The lipid was extracted and GC-MS was performed which revealed that the fatty acids were predominantly of the class C15:0, C18:0, C16:0 and C12:0. It is concluded that besides lipid content, AM medium increased the cell number leading to the increase in biomass.",

    "abstract": "The North Sea and the English Channel are regions with a long tradition of plankton studies, where the colony-forming haptophyte Phaeocystis globosa dominates the spring phytoplankton blooms. Among its predators, we investigated an abundant unarmored dinoflagellate (~3000 cells per liter) in the North Sea in May 2019. It has been reported in the literature as Gymnodinium heterostriatum or G. striatissimum, and often identified as Gyrodinium spirale. Phylogenetic analyses using the small-, large subunit- and Internal Transcriber Spacers of the ribosomal RNA (SSU-, LSU-, ITS rRNA) gene sequences indicate that our isolates clustered within the Gyrodinium clade. The new sequences formed a sister group with sequences of the freshwater taxon Gyrodinium helveticum, being one of the infrequent marine-freshwater transitions in the microbial world. This isolate is the first characterized member of a clade of numerous environmental sequences widely distributed from cold to tropical seas. This common and abundant taxon has received several names due to its morphological plasticity (changes of size and shape, often deformed after engulfing prey) and the difficulty in discerning surface striation. We conclude that the priority is for the species name Gymnodinium heterostriatum Kofoid &amp; Swezy 1921, a new name that was proposed for Gymnodinium spirale var. obtusum sensu Dogiel 1906. The species Gyrodinium striatissimum (Hulburt 1957) Gert Hansen &amp; Moestrup 2000 and Gymnodinium lucidum D. Ballantine in Parke &amp; Dixon 1964 (=G. hyalinum M. Lebour 1925) are posterior synonyms. We propose Gyrodinium heterostriatum comb. nov. for Gymnodinium heterostriatum.",

A new Enterobryus species that inhabits A. monilicornis is herein described. Traditionally, Enterobryus species are difficult to identify due to high intraspecific variation. Thus, statistical analysis of character measurements is included in an attempt to investigate character stability. Millipedes were dissected; gut linings with attached Enterobryus were placed on slides and preserved. Morphometric data of thalli, sporangiospores and holdfasts presented a normal distribution of parameters except for the basal disk width of the holdfast, which showed extreme variation. This character, although used to described Enterobryus species is not reliable in E. luteovirgatus when using the mean or range values in taxon descriptions.",

    "abstract": "Testate amoebae (TA) are an important part of soil microbial communities and in certain ecosystems they may represent a substantial proportion of total microbial biomass. Their distribution and abundance is driven by various abiotic factors (e.g. pH, organic matter, soil moisture, soil/water chemistry) but comparatively less is known about the role of biotic interactions. TA often co-occur with Ericaceae, a ubiquitous plant family inhabiting acidic soils with poor nutrient status. Ericaceae can significantly change soil properties through production of recalcitrant litter and possibly also due to root exudates and activities of root-inhabiting fungi; this may result in profound modifications of microbial communities. A recent study from northwest England shows that the invasive ericaceous shrub Rhododendron ponticum may significantly modify communities of soil TA. Here, we investigate the effect of pH, organic matter, soil moisture and R. ponticum presence on TA communities within the native range of the ericaceous shrub at two sites in south Spain and compare our results with the previous study from NW England. At the Spanish sites, organic matter content, R. ponticum presence and pH affected occurrence and abundance of several TA species; R. ponticum presence and organic matter content were highly correlated and explained most of the observed variability in TA communities (= the effect of the R. ponticum rhizosphere). R. ponticum rhizosphere affected especially TA with relatively large tests, i.e. Cyclopyxis eurystoma, Phryganella acropodi a and Trigonopyxis arcula . Interestingly, T. arcula was also positively associated with R. ponticum in the previously studied British sites. The rhizosphere of the ericaceous shrub appears to have a positive effect on testate amoebae taxon richness at the two studied autochthonous Spanish sites but may reduce taxon richness in the sites in Britain where R. ponticum is an introduced species.

    "abstract": "Summary. Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are bivalve mollusks that have invaded and altered the ecology of many North American lakes and rivers. To identify possible ecological effects of zebra mussels on naked amoebae, this study compared abundances of sediment and water column naked amoebae in shallow water zones of four lakes with and four lakes without zebra mussels. Additional data was collected on the density of macroflagellates. Although no statistically significant difference in naked amoebae density was found, higher ratios of sediment to water column naked amoebae abundances in zebra mussel lakes were observed due to increased naked amoebae abundances in the sediments. However, we did not observe a concomitant decrease in water column naked amoebae abundances. Flagellate abundances revealed no significant differences between the two lake types. Taken together, the data show that naked amoebae and flagellates thrive in shallow water zones of zebra mussel lakes and that the filter feeding activities of zebra mussels and reported reduced water column protists abundances may be offset by the flocculation of protists from the rich zebra mussel colonies.",

The forms appeared to be rare, found in only 7 of the 308 samples taken in annual August surveys from 2010 to 2022. Thus, we were surprised to find them relatively common and widespread in samples gathered in August of 2023. We found 18 different Papulifére forms, 8 of which appear to be new forms, in samples from 19 of the 36 stations sampled. They were found in localities ranging from 70.5°N to 80°N. Here we report on these Papulifére forms found in 2023, providing information on morphologies and geographical distributions. With this report we have expanded the catalogue of observed Papulifére, and photographed, forms of the Chukchi Sea to a grand total of 34 of morphologically distinct forms. However, we continue to urge caution in assigning a ciliate identity to any given Papulifére form in the absence of corroborating data.",

    "abstract": "Most eukaryotic microbial biodiversity is undescribed, and most species might be morphologically indistinguishable. Notable exceptions are so-called flagship species which are highly conspicuous and can therefore be used to address biogeographical questions. Here we describe Hyalosphenia papilio subsp. paynei, an arcellinid testate amoeba (Amoebozoa; Arcellinida; Hyalospheniidae) from wet hollows in two Sphagnum peatlands, one in Wales and one in Ireland. Phylogenetic analysis based on Cytochrome Coxidase subunit I (COI) sequencing places it within the lineage A of the H. papilio complex, but it differs from all 13 known H. papilio genetic lineages by its very distinctive, wider than long, morphology. The fact that such a conspicuous taxon was never reported in hundreds of studies published on Holarctic Sphagnum peatlands since Leidy’s description of H. papilio in 1874 suggests that this subspecies has not dispersed and survived beyond Britain and Ireland. Furthermore its genetic similarity to H. papilio s. str. suggests that it has recently evolved. The discovery of this new taxon calls for a more detailed analysis of the morphological, ecological and molecular diversity of the H. papilio species complex.",

    "abstract": "Although Myxobolus spores can often be detected from the gut of fish, from the mucus covering the intestinal wall and from the intestinal content, the number of species actually developing in the gut wall is rather low. Myxobolus cyprinicola can be considered a parasite rarely occurring in Europe. This parasite was found to cause infection in the gut of common carp caught from Lake Balaton. Its pinhead-sized plasmodia were located in the lamina propria at the tip of the mucosal folds of the intestine, immediately below the basement membrane. The plasmodia were closely connected with the capillaries of the lamina propria. The large number of red blood cells found between the basement membrane and the plasmodium wall suggests that they started their development in the lumen of a capillary. By their morphological characteristics, the spores of M. cyprinicola are well distinguishable from those of M. cyprini, which more commonly occur in the gut within necrotic macrophages (yellow bodies) after having reached that site as a result of a secondary process. Because of the small size of the plasmodia, the subepithelial location, and the low prevalence and intensity, M. cyprinicola can be considered a less pathogenic species.",

In this study, we have used Tetrahymena as a model in which to study the chemorepellent, PACAP. Using behavioral and biochemical (EIA) assays, we have found that the NO/cGMP pathway plays an important role in PACAP signaling. An increase in intracellular calcium is also critical for PACAP avoidance, which appears to be mediated through a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein.",

The main characteristics of the new species are: the aperture with five angles and five borders (like a pentagon), an internal transverse loop, extending from side to side coextensively with the constriction at the junction of the neck and body. Normal size frequency distribution and low coefficients of variation indicate that P. pentangulostoma is a size monomorphic species. Shell width and neck height are the most stable characters (coefficients of variation are 7.99 and 8.61 respectively), whereas the aperture diameter is the most variable (CV=12.03).

Two poorly known marine suctorian ciliates, Ephelota truncata Fraipont, 1878 and Ephelota mammillata Dons, 1918, collected from the coastal waters off Qingdao, China, were investigated using both live observations and protargol impregation methods. Improved diagnoses for both species are supplied based on previous and current studies. The adult form of each species has two types of tentacle, a long stalk and a ramose macronucleus. In addition, E. truncata has a short column-shaped body about 75–250 × 100–200 µm in vivo, 12–16 suctorial tentacles, 80–100 prehensile tentacles and a stalk that is 500–1200 µm long; the swarmer is ovoid, about 40 × 30 µm in vivo, with 19–24 somatic kineties and a C-shaped macronucleus. E. mammillata has a bowl-shaped body about 55–150 × 80–150 µm in vivo, ca. 10 suctorial tentacles, 30–50 prehensile tentacles and a stalk that is 350–800 µm long. The SSU rRNA genes were sequenced for both species in order to compare them with those of closely related congeners.",

Only three species were previously reported from coelenterates, i.e., Trichodina pediculus, T. zambeziensis and T. ctenophorii. This new ciliate is compared with other similar congeners including T. ctenophorii because it was reported from the same host. T. marplatensis differs from T. ctenophorii by having denticles with broad club-shaped blades and wide S-shaped rays, rather than falcate blades and thin, straight rays. The denticles of T. marplatensis are not similarly shaped to those of other described trichodinids. The new species is the first reported from a planktonic host in the Argentine Sea and the second species found associated with ctenophores.",

Its locomotive form is typical with membranous and flexible ovoid test having a single terminal aperture from which a broad pseudopodial network emerges on a pseudopodial peduncle. Additional data and details are described, illustrated and discussed. Lieberkuehnia wageneri is known from various freshwater, soil and marine habitats in Western and Middle Europe, suggesting a high ecological tolerance and wide distribution. It is hoped that the observations reported in this paper will aid the identification of this species based on the locomotive morphology at the light microscopical level.",

Polar capsules were 3.9±0.3 (3.0-.3) μm in length with polar filaments turned 4- turns. The pattern of polar filament coils was different in each of the polar capsules. In the same spore, one capsule contained oblique filament turns to the longitudinal axis of the capsule, while the other capsule contained perpendicular turns. SEM revealed completely different shell ridge patterns than those described by light microscopy in the original description. This emphasizes the necessity of SEM in the reliable description of any myxosporean genera with external shell ornamentation like Ortholinea and Chloromyxum. The present species is considered the first (purely) freshwater Ortholinea described from a proper freshwater host. Three different methods of isolation and preparation of coelozoic spores for SEM were evaluated.

Si was found to co-accumulate with Al and Fe at the extracellular matrix of the algae, supporting its proposed role in alleviating metal toxicity. Phosphorus deficiency was not observed in any of the studied species, in spite of the high levels of Fe and Al in the acidic medium.",

The fatty acid composition of the lipids and the double-bond position of the unsaturated acids have been determined by capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of their corresponding methyl esters, 2-alkenyl-4,4-dimethyloxazoline (DMOX) derivatives and dimethyldisulfide (DMDS) adducts. Evidence is given that lipids from A. castellanii in addition to the three already identified saturated straight chain fatty acids: tetradecanoic (C14:0), hexadecanoic (C16:0), octadecanoic (C18:0), and six preponderant unsaturated fatty acids: hexadecenoic (C16:1 Δ7), octadecenoic (C18:1 Δ9), octadecadienoic (C18:2 Δ9,12), eicosadienoic (C20:2 Δ11,14), eicosatrienoic (C20:3 Δ8,11,14), and eicosatetraenoic (C20:4 Δ5,8,11,14), contain additionally four very long chain unsaturated fatty acids: octacosenoic (C28:1 Δ21), octacosadienoic (C28:2 Δ5,21), triacontadienoic (30:2 Δ21,24), and triacontatrienoic (C30:3 Δ5,21,24) previously unreported in lipids of A. castellanii .

    "abstract": "The genus Eimeria Schneider, 1875, comprises of ＞ 1,000 described species, making it the most species-rich among coccidians. Within chelonian hosts, only 61 Eimeria spp. have been described to date, with the majority known from the New World. Yet, the Southeast Asia region has the highest turtle diversity in the world, from which only a few species have been discovered. Furthermore, the largest turtle family, Geoemydidae Theobald, 1868, has received little attention. In the past decade we examined samples from wild-caught geoemydid turtles from Southeast Asia and adjacent areas. Our work revealed considerable diversity of turtles' coccidia and we describe six new species of Eimeria in this report. Eimeria surinensis sp. n. from Malayemys subtrijuga caught in Thailand possesses almost spherical oocysts (22.6×21.4), with spindle-shaped to ellipsoidal sporocysts pointed at both poles (13.4×6.9). Eimeria pangshurae sp. n. from Pangshura sylhetensis residing in India has ellipsoidal to spherical oocysts (16.5×13.2) and broadly-ellipsoidal to flask-shaped sporocysts (11.1×5.7), with a Stieda body frequently connected with two to four filaments. Eimeria hynekprokopi sp. n. from Vietnamese Cuora galbinifrons has extremely thin-walled and fragile, elongated oocysts, and is a bit pointed at one pole (15.6×8.7), carrying ellipsoidal to broadly oval sporocysts (6.5×4.3). Eimeria zbatagura sp. n. from Batagur baska sampled in Singapore has tiny sub-spherical to broadly ellipsoidal oocysts (7.4×6.3 μm) with almost oval but relatively small sporocysts (5.5×3 μm). The broadly ellipsoidal, fragile oocysts of Eimeria petrasi sp. n. (22.9×18.6 μm) collected from Cyclemys dentata in the Philippines possess a wavy outer surface of the oocyst wall, and oval to ellipsoidal sporocysts (12.3×6.5 μm). Eimeria palawanensis sp. n. from Cyclemys dentata found in the Philippines has thin-walled and fragile spherical oocysts (14-17 μm wide), plus elongated, ellipsoidal sporocysts (12.6×5.8 μm). We also recorded Eimeria arakanensis Siroký et Modrý, 2006 from the new host species-Cuora flavomarginata collected in China. Since many chelonians are critically endangered species, their parasite biodiversity will be lost following the collapse of their populations.",

In a serotonin (10-12 M) containing medium up to 15 min. serotonin level does not elevate in the cells, but after 30 min. there is a significant elevation which remains till 4 h. In cells starved in salt solution the elevation is higher which calls attention to the effect of (starvation) stress. Using four enzyme blockers tryptophane hydroxylase inhibitor PCPA decreased (in serotonin-containing medium) and MAO B blocker deprenyl increased serotonin content, while serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine and MAO-A blocker clorgyline were ineffective. Extremely low concentrations of serotonin (10^(-15) M in case of histamine and 10^(-18) M in case of ACTH and T3) in the milieu was sufficient for increasing hormone (ACTH, T3, histamine) levels inside the cells. In conclusion; serotonin can be taken up by the cells and can be produced by induction, as Tetrahymena has enzymes for building it up and decomposing it. For synthesizing serotonin; basic molecules from outside are not needed. Serotonin in a minute amount can induce production of different hormones.",

During a survey on the epibiotic relationship between ciliated protists and planktonic copepods in a tropical floodplain, we reported for the first time the occurrence of Colacium vesiculosum as an epibiont on Thermocyclops minutus and Notodiaptomus amazonicus from southern Brazil. The mean infestation prevalence was significantly higher on adults 30.53% (± 2.85) in comparison with copepodites 0.87% (± 0.55). When hosts were separated by order (Calanoida and Cyclopoida) copepodites presented a mean infestation prevalence of 0.92% (± 0.85) and 0.83% (± 0.60) respectively, while adults had a mean prevalence of 29.55% (± 6.8) and 30.13% (± 5.83), which could be explained by the fact that adult copepods provide a more stable substrate for epibionts.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the diversity of testate amoebae in an urban stream located within the Igarapé São Francisco Environmental Protection Area in Acre, northern Brazil, during the dry season, and evaluated the factors mediating the structure of this protist community. We collected 108 water samples for the analysis of the testate amoeba community and the limnological variables at six sampling points on the stream, between July and September 2018. We used a Redundancy Analysis (RDA) to verify the influence of environmental variables on the protist community. We recorded 76 species of testate amoebae from eight families, with most records from the families Difflugiidae, Arcellidae, Centropydae and Netzeliidae. More than half (49) of the species were recorded in Acre for the first time. The abundance of the amoebae of the family Trigonopiridae was regulated by the dissolved oxygen concentrations and the pH, while that of the Netzeliidae, Dif-flugiidae and Lesquereusidae was influenced by the pH, chloride concentrations, and the depth and transparency of the water. In the case of the family Arcellidae, abundance was determined by the turbidity and transparency of the water and the nitrate concentrations, while that of Centropyxis sp. was associated with the concentrations of thermotolerant coliforms. These findings indicate that, while the São Francisco stream is subject to anthropogenic impacts, it still presents adequate conditions for these organisms in some of its stretches. The abundance of these amoebae was influenced primarily by the productivity of the system, as indicated by the high protist densities recorded in the areas in which primary productivity was highest. These findings support the use of these protists in studies that investigate the most appropriate indicator organisms that respond to anthropogenic impacts and shifts in environmental quality.The results of the present study demonstrated the importance of this aquatic ecosystem for the biodiversity of the study area, and the need to further expand our knowledge on the adaptations and interactions of the aquatic communities of the Amazon region.",

    "abstract": "Summary. The Hyperamoeba-like amoeboflagellate (Wi7/2-PE) has been isolated from a hydrotherapy pool inside a hospital at Wildbach/ Germany. Based on combined morphological and molecularbiological data we conclude that this isolate can neither be assigned to the genus Hyperamoeba nor to any of the myxogastrean slime moulds, which are the closest relatives of Hyperamoeba. We thus considered describing this isolate within a new genus, Pseudodidymium, as a new species, Pseudodidymium cryptomastigophorum. As observed by phase contrast microscopy the gross morphology and size of the three stages - trophozoite, cyst, and flagellate stage - is comparable to respective characters of Hyperamoeba as described by Karpov and Mylnikov (1997). However, in contrast to these characters they have in common with Hyperamoeba, the features of the flagellate stage shown by electron microscopy revealed marked differences to the previously described Hyperamoeba. In addition to the anterior flagellum responsible for the locomotion a second recurrent flagellum could be observed which is tightly attached to the cell membrane of the flagellate by a desmosome-like connection zone. Both flagellae are anchored to the tapered frontal part of the cell by kinetosomes with accessory structures located at an acute angle to each other. While the frontal flagellum is as long or even longer than the cell body the second one has a length of about one third of the cell and appears barren. This tight attachment of the inactive flagellum is the reason for its invisibility by means of light microscopy. All three stages possess mitochondria with a dense central core as known from Hyperamoeba, which are characteristic for myxogastrean slime moulds as well. However, various attempts to induce the formation of fruiting bodies in order to show a putative relationship to certain slime moulds remained unsuccessful. In 18S rDNA sequencing our isolate did not show highest identity to the only hitherto sequenced strain of Hyperamoeba sp., but, as also a undescribed strain of Hyperamoeba, to a strain of Didymium nigripes, a myxogastrean slime mould. However, this strain of Didymium shows an insertion, which our isolate does not have. In conclusion, it is neither possible to assign this Hyperamoeba-like isolate to the genus Hyperamoeba nor to the genus Didymium as it differs fundamentally from both genera in several aspects.",

Its morphology was investigated using live observation and protargol impregnation. Cultellothrix belongs to the gymnostomatous ciliate family Spathidiidae, where it represents a new genus characterized by the lateral location of the dorsal brush. Cultellothrix velhoi sp. n. differs from the European congener, C. lionotiformis (Kahl, 1930a) comb. n.

Foissner’s species is Spathidium scalpriforme Kahl, 1930a, which is assigned to the genus Arcuospathidium and lowered to subspecies rank: Arcuospathidium cultriforme scalpriforme (Kahl, 1930a) comb. n., stat. n.",

Among the tested nutrients, only polypepton (mixture of peptides and amino acids obtained by protease digestion of casein) showed a marked excystment-inducing activity. The excystment-inducing activity of polypepton was fractionated by a series of chromatography (gelfiltration chromatography, normal-phase HPLC and normal-phase TLC), and the activity was finally isolated in spots containing relatively hydrophobic peptides in the TLC. It is possible that certain common structures contained in such peptides having the excystment-inducing activity may be widely present in the plant extract.",

So, we expected the spatial and seasonal differentiation of P. dodecaurelia haplotypes originated from a single habitat, as the studied species is characterized by high intra-specific polymorphism. Fragments of 5'LSU rDNA (349 bp long) and COI mtDNA (309 bp long) of 18 strains of Paramecium dodecaurelia were compared, five of these came from the studied pond (strains A, B, C1, C2, C3) and others from our collection originating from Europe (Italy, Germany, Russia, Ukraine), Asia (Kazakhstan, Russia Eastern Siberia [RS], Japan), island of Tenerife, mainland USA and Hawaii. The following species were used as outgroups: a standard strain of P. pentaurelia (87, from Pennsylvania, USA), a representative of the P. aurelia complex showing no intraspecific differentiation; and P. caudatum, a representative of a different Paramecium morphospecies. A comparison of the distance matrix did not show any variability among strains from Krakow. The same haplotype appeared in several strains from Europe (RM, RV, RY, UV, IE, Poland), Asia (KA, RS), and Tenerife (TE). A different haplotype was detected in the other European strains from Germany and Italy (TR). Strains from USA, Japan, and Hawaii were more distant from other P. dodecaurelia strains. Polymorphism of P. dodecaurelia was confirmed, however, no correlation was found between geographical origin and genetic distance of strains. The strain from Trento, Italy of P. dodecaurelia revealed the same haplotype as strain 87 of P. pentaurelia, in spite of sexual isolation of both species. Perhaps, speciation of P. aurelia complex proceeds by a different way than differentiation of studied DNA fragments and relationships of species of the P. aurelia complex is more complicated that was expected. It may be connected with the origin of the P. aurelia complex. The hypothesis on the origin of the complex, proposed by Aury et al. (2006), is presented in discussion.",

Phryganella laurentiana n. sp. is among the smallest of the known Phryganella species (mean test diameter=26 μm) and has metabolic, polymorphic pseudopodia including those with pointed apices typical of the genus. The most important distinguishing feature is the total lack of a marginal ventral surface or border surrounding the pseudostomal aperture of the test. Tests are covered with agglutinated angular siliceous particles, except on the ventral edge of the pseudostomal aperture, where an abundance of organic cement covering the small particles in this region has created a smooth rim.\r\nDifflugia yorkui n. sp. is distinguished from other Difflugia species by its large size (mean length=333 μm) and its unique fusiform shape. Most of its test, including the bluntly tapered posterior, is covered with large, angular siliceous particles, but not the anterior region, where particles are markedly smaller surrounding the circular oral aperture (55 μm diam.). The taxonomy of both species is discussed relative to other similar species. Although light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used to describe and illustrate both species, the unique morphology of both should enable their future identification by light microscopy alone.",

Its description, based on one of the first ultrastructural studies of microsporidia from orthopteran hosts, lacked information on the details of cell surface structure, which are considered to be very important in modern taxonomy. We have re-investigated the material upon which the original description of N. maroccanus was based and revealed new ultrastructural characters of its cell surface. Late meronts are surrounded with microtubuli, about 20 nm in diameter, attached to the membrane, later replaced with electron dense granules, forming a typical coating of the sporont's surface (the primordium of exospore). Mature spores are also surrounded with a layer of microtubuli. Host cell cytoplasm contains small vesicles with electron-dense cores, up to 50 nm in diameter, surrounding late meronts, sporogonial stages and spores of the parasite. Polar tube is slightly anisofilar. These characters disagree with the diagnosis of Nosema, but fit that of the recently established genus Tubulinosema. Hence, we transferred the species studied into this genus, establishing Tubulinosema maroccanus comb. nov. Analysis of cell surface ultrastructure of two Tubulinosema species from Orthoptera showed that they shared two characters not mentioned in the diagnosis of the genus. Therefore, the diagnosis of Tubulinosema was modified to include two more characters: presence of vesicles with electron-dense cores surrounding sporogonial stages and presence of microtubuli not only in late meronts, but also, in some species, in spores.",

Since the pioneer Gause, many studies have used protist microcosm systems to study competitive exclusion. We explored a two-species system with the testate-amoebae: (Arcella intermedia and Pyxidicula operculata), where competitive exclusion is expected to occur. We determined their growth curves individually and under competitive interaction. We used a state-space model to represent system dynamics and calculated posterior population sizes simulating competition dynamics. Contrarily to our expectation, Arcella and Pyxidicula showed similar growth rates (1.37 and 1.46 days–1 respectively) and only different carrying capacity (1,997 and 25,108 cells cm–2 respectively). The maximum number of cells of both species when growing in competition was much lower if compared to the monospecific cultures (in average, 73% and 80% less for Arcella and Pyxidicula respectively). However, our competition experiments always resulted in coexistence. According to the models, the drop in growth rates and stochasticity mainly explains our coexistence results. We propose that a context of ephemeral resources can explain these results. Additionally, we propose generating factors of stochasticity as intraspecific variation, small population effects, toxicity of waste products and influence of the bacterial community.",

Prior to cytokinesis, two prospective daughter cells are of equal size and show metamery of their cortical patterns. We studied effects of 20 μM roscovitine (an inhibitor of several cyclin-dependent kinases) on the cell cycle progression of T. thermophila. We showed that roscovitine delayed cell division, delayed or arrested macronuclear division and induced increase of cell size and the number of BBs in the cortical rows. The increase in the number of BBs in cortical rows induced cell elongation which was proportional to the increase in cell surface area. There was uncoupling between this BBs proliferation which is continued during prolonged cell cycle and delayed cytokinesis, what resulted in topological alteration of the respective positions of the OA2 and of the contractile vacuole pores (CVPs). In roscovitine treated cells, the new OA2 was positioned subequatorialy, but the fission zone was shifted posterior to the equatorial plane of the cell and positioned across and in the extreme cases behind of the new OA2. This resulted in the formation of a large proter and small size opisthe. The roscovitine treatment induced a formation of a plethora of phenotypes of postdividing cells. We found that irrespective of changes in divisional morphogenesis induced by roscovitine treatment, all mature BBs were associated with the cdc14-like phosphatase. Taken together all these data indicate that during cell cycle of T. thermophila the normal morphology of the daughter cells depends on the proper division of micro- and macronucleus and on temporal control of BBs proliferation along the longitudinal rows, during OA2 stomatogenesis and during selection of BBs involved in differentiation of apical BBs (couplets) and cell division.",

    "abstract": "Zoelucasa sablensis n. gen et n. sp. is a small heterotrophic fl agellate housed within a pyriform lorica of relatively large imbricate, circular siliceous scales. It was found in near-shore benthic sand/seawater samples of both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (west and east coasts of Canada; salinity = 32–33 ppt). The median length and width of the lorica was 18 and 11 μm, respectively (n = 29). This taxon lacks chloroplasts and swims with a slow zig-zag motion controlled by a short (5–7 μm long), anteriorly-directed flagellum and a longer trailing flagellum, 15–20 μm in length. Its classification within the phylum Cercozoa (most likely, Class Imbricatea) is tentative, as there are no known morphological homologues (discoidal, overlapping siliceous plate-scales forming a test or lorica enclosing a heterotrophic flagellate). Further study of cultured and wild material, including a search for other possible non-flagellate (e.g. amoeboid?) life history stages, TEM examination of cell sections, and rDNA sequencing will most certainly provide more opportunities for a justifi able classifi cation, possibly including a new Order.",

    "abstract": "Summary. Since many aspects of nephridiophagids are still unknown, we investigated their most typical life cycle stage, the spore, using different light and electron microscopic techniques. Cytochemical and fluorescence labelling seemed to indicate the presence of chitin, protein, and calcium as components of the spore wall. Organic solvents, alone or in combination with proteases and chitinases, influenced the staining properties. This led to the assumption that hydrophobic substances at the spore surface and a close association of protein and chitin impede staining and enzymatic actions. Freeze-fracture studies and thin sections showed details of the spore surface and depicted the different wall layers of the spores. The innermost electron-transparent layer bound WGA (indirectly labelled with gold) and thus may contain chitin. A central cap-like structure was revealed to be an opening through which an infectious sporoplasm may emerge. Ultrastructural aspects of spore hatching and hatched sporoplasms were demonstrated for the first time. Spore wall features are reminiscent of microsporidian spores but the similarities are too few to assign the nephridiophagids to any of the known groups of unicellular organisms.",

Review of included formally and informally described species shows that they are a distinctive group with shared characters, including ten different morphotypes of probable species level. Two of these, including the type species A. fragaria, have been shown to form life-cycle associations with heterococcoliths of the Syracosphaera molischii type. Hence, all species are transferred to Syracosphaera and the new combinations S. periperforata, S. lafourcadii, and S. origami are proposed. In addition, various informally described morphotypes are now formally described as Syracosphaera molischii var. pertusa, S. periperforata var. cylindrata, S. periperforata var. tridentata, S. rotaconica, and S. elevata. urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:0E5D4BD7-BC3B-4D30-B319-964AC887DDDE",

Limited accessibility of the protozoan for experimental use, scarcity, genome heterogeneity of the isolates and narrow panel of molecular markers hamper zoonotic investigations. One of the significant limitation in zoonotic studies is the lack of precise molecular tools that would be useful in linking animal vectors as a source of human infection. Strong and convincing evidence of zoonotic features will be achieved through proper typing of Cyclospora spp. taxonomic units (e.g. species or genotypes) in animal reservoirs. The most promising method that can be employ for zoonotic surveys is next-generation sequencing.",

Its aperture is irregular in outline and inconspicuous; the nucleus contains one nucleolus and a few bent rods in the nucleoplasm. Bereczkya nov. gen., an incertae sedis cercozoan, has a minute spherical cell enclosed in a thin, rigid, more or less agglutinated organic test that is filled entirely by the cytoplasm. Its test bears an irregular and inconspicuous aperture. A collar-like ectoplasmic rim is situated in the aperture, from which a pseudopodial stem with filopodia is erected.

(test length: 3.5–8 μm, the diameter of the ectoplasmic rim: 0.8–2.3 μm) has a spherical test with asymmetric swellings and depressions, agglutinated with refractile mineral and other flat or irregularly-shaped xenosomes that may sometimes be almost entirely absent. Paramphitrema muelleri nov. spec. has a tubular or lemon-like test (length: 13–17 μm), which tapers towards the rigid apertures. The test is rigid, agglutinated and ism circular in cross section. The nucleus is vesicular. Thin filopodia, as well as 1–2 thick, straight, unbranched, tubular pseudopodia are produced.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 21-day and 6-month invasion of B. microti on Wistar rats spleen. Histological changes in the rats’ spleen were characterized by swelling of splenic tissue, especially the tissue adjacent to the capsule. In the structure of the white pulp in some rats, high concentrations of lymphocytes occurred. The boundary between the white pulp and red pulp was blurred. In the red pulp structure of rats, a lot of macrophages and extracellular deposits of bilirubin were present. The submicroscopic studies showed that the nuclear matrix was slightly shrunken. In the red pulp fragments of the damaged cells were located in the intercellular spaces. Near these areas, many thrombocytes were visible. The ultrastructural observation also revealed thickened endoplasmic reticulum membranes, local cellular swelling filled with amorphous substance, and digested erythrocytes. B. microti invasion affects the splenic morphology and ultrastructure in rats. The immunological hyperactivity and signs of inflammation indicate an important role of spleen in a fight against parasites.",

The basket-like skeleton has been interpreted as a thick cell covering or pellicle of organic composition, or as a siliceous endoskeleton. The skeleton of Achradina is known only from fresh material, being absent in preserved samples, sediments or the fossil record. X-ray microanalysis revealed that the endoskeleton of Achradina is composed of celestite (strontium sulfate) with traces of barite (barium sulfate), two minerals that readily dissolve after cell death. To date, Acantharia and polycystine radiolarians (Retaria) were the only known organisms with a skeleton of this composition. We can now add a dinoflagellate to the list of such mineralized skeletons, which influence on the biogeochemical fluxes of strontium and barium in the oceans. Moreover, we provided the first molecular data for a skeleton-bearing dinoflagellate. Molecular phylogeny based on the SSU rRNA gene sequences revealed that Achradina and several environmental clones branched as an independent lineage within the short-branching dinokaryotic dinoflagellates. To date, seven clades of dinokaryotic dinoflagellates are known living as symbionts in the endoplasm of Acantharia and polycystine radiolarians. Because celestite built skeletons were unknown outside radiolarians, we suggested that the ancestors of Achradina acquired the genes implicated in the deposition of strontium and barium from radiolarian hosts though a horizontal gene transfer event between microbial eukaryotes.",

Eodinium posterovesiculatum m. bilobosum and D. dogieli are new host records for cattle in Turkey. The infraciliature of M. medium (Entodiniomorphida, Ophryoscolecidae) was examined and detected for the first time. The buccal infraciliature of M. medium was composed of three polybrachykineties, a kinety loop, and paralabial kineties. A large dorso-adoral polybrachykinety, a gentle S-shaped curved vestibular polybrachykinety, and a kinety loop between the dorso-adoral polybrachykinety and adoral polybrachykinety were characteristics. Because of these features, M. medium-type buccal infraciliature was between the Ostracodinium gracile-type buccal infraciliature and the Ostracodinium mammosum-type buccal infraciliature.",

The new species is characterized by the posterior part of the adoral zone composed of three membranelles, which has never been seen in all other known congeners. Other morphologic features include: (i) body oval-shaped, with conspicuous right anterior spur-like protrusion; (ii)size in vivo 60–90 × 40–68 μm; (iii) two macronuclear nodules; (iv) four frontal, two ventral, five transverse, three left marginal and three caudal cirri.

The small subunit rRNA gene of the new species (GenBank accession number: KX147287) comprises 1723 bp and 44.63% GC content, and differs by 0.12–1.81% from those of congeners.

However, it is not clear whether pseudodiaptomids (e.g., Schmackeria), one of the dominant calanoid copepods in Chinese lakes, effectively impacts natural ciliate communities. The impacts of small-bodied cladocerans (e.g., Bosmina) on ciliates are also controversial. We performed an incubation experiment using winter lake water from Lake Chaohu to assess the structuring effects that crustacean zooplankton have on natural ciliate populations. The presence and absence of cladocerans (Bosmina sp.) and copepods (Schmackeria inopinus) were alternated in four treatments. Both Bosmina sp. and Schmackeria inopinus had substantial impacts on ciliate abundance, biomass, and community structure. The response of ciliates was different in the presence of Bosmina sp. compared with Schmackeria inopinus and varied among categories such as the ciliate population, relative body size and functional feeding group. Our results also highlight the importance of interference and exploitative competition among metazooplankton groups.",

Testate amoebae are a relatively well studied group or free-living protists that build morphologically characteristic shells on which the taxonomy of this group is mainly based. Among testate amoebae, the Hyalospheniformes are especially well documented and are a model group for microbial biogeography. Here we describe a new species of genus Certesella from Sphagnum mosses and forest litter samples collected in the Dominican Republic and Chile. We name this species Certesella larai to honour our esteemed colleague Enrique Lara. This species bears two large pores connected by tube, which are characteristic of the genera Porosia and Certesella. The new species fits best in the latter genus given the presence of a distinct, sometimes denticulated, neck with a bulge that is absent in genus Porosia but occurs in Certesella. Its elongated shape (length/breadth ratio 2.03–2.58) only overlaps with C. certesi, which is distinguishable by the presence of a distinct longitudinal groove in the neck region that is absent from the new species. Interestingly most specimens lacked the internal teeth which are usually present in members of genus Certesella. As such, while the morphology of C. larai strongly suggests a belonging to genus Certesella, molecular analyses are still required to confirm its phylogenetic position, clarify the relationships among all species in genera Porosia and Certesella and the definition and validity of these two genera. The presence of this new species in two rather distant regions – Caribbean and central Chile – suggests it is likely widespread, but possibly rare. However, this perception may be due to a sampling bias in favour of Sphagnum mosses and wet and organic-rich habitats. This illustrates the need for a more systematic sampling effort to document the full and mostly unknown taxonomic diversity of soil protists.",

There is little biogeographical information for this minute protist despite its significant role in aquatic food webs. In addition, the phylogenetic relationship of P. vestita to other taxa is unclear as P. vestita may be polyphyletic or a cryptic species complex. In this study, a clonal isolate from a freshwater sample of Laguna de Bay, Philippines was subjected to morphological study by electron microscopy and its small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene was sequenced. Morphological studies showed that the isolate possesses two unequal flagella emerging from the anterior part of the cell. Negative staining revealed the structure of the scales which consist of a baseplate with slightly thickened rim. The narrowing spine arises from the center of the baseplate. These results agree with previously studied isolates of P. vestita. The 18S rRNA gene sequence of the isolate had a very high similarity (99%) to P. vestita strain PV10. Phylogenetic analysis also showed that the isolate clustered with other Paraphysomonas sequences with high bootstrap support. Phylogenetic studies confirmed that P. vestita may be polyphyletic. No studies on the ultrastructure and phylogeny of a silica-scaled chrysophyte isolated in the Philippines have been reported so far. Results from this study may contribute to further ultrastructural and phylogenetic studies on aquatic flagellates and specifically to a revision of this potentially polyphyletic species.",

All 3’ sequences studied here were characteristically short – generally having around 20 to 30 nucleotides between the stop codon and the first nucleotide of the polyA tail. The stop codon used in all sequences studied was UAA, which although one of the “universal” stop codons, is often used to encode glutamine in other ciliates such as Tetrahymena. The polyadenylation signal used in N. ovalis could not be determined from the sequence information, but it is clearly not the ‘universal’ AAUAAA signal. Furthermore, in messages encoding cathepsin B the 3’UTRs were of variable length, with the position where polyadenylati on was initiated varying - despite a high conservation of the coding part of the message.",

    "abstract": "Summary. During early micronuclear mitosis of a wild type Tetrahymena thermophila, basal body proliferation and cortical growth are localized in the equatorial region of the pre-dividing cell. These processes are arrested prior to cytokinesis when the fission line gaps appear in ciliary rows. Then a putative marker of cellular polarity, the fenestrin antigen, appears in the apical zone of the dividing cell and around the old oral apparatus (OA1) and in the cortex localized posterior to the fission line gaps and around the new oral apparatus (OA2) i.e. in the apical cortex of the prospective posterior daughter cell. Prior to cytokinesis, the membranelles within OA1 and OA2 oral apparatuses are strongly labeled with the MPM2 antibody against mitotic phosphoproteins. The transition to cytokinesis is correlated with disappearance of both the polar fenestrin staining and of the phosphoprotein antigens in OA1 and OA2. cdaA1 (cell division arrest) mutant cells grown at the restrictive temperature do not produce a fission line and they do not undergo cytokinesis thereby generating irregular chains. The cdaA1 phenotypes continue elongation of their ciliary rows in equatorial regions, mostly without formation of the fission line gaps, accompanied with repetitive micronuclear mitoses and repetitive formation of the defective oral structures. In cdaA1 cells at restrictive temperature, the fenestrin antigen was recruited and then permanently found in the apical regions and around all oral apparatuses, and was always absent in equatorial regions, in spite of variability of immunostaining patterns, sizes and advancement of organization of OAs in different specimens of the same sample. The MPM2- tagged phosphoproteins were retained in all oral apparatuses in different cdaA 1 phenotypes. We suggest that the cdaA1 phenotypes produced at restrictive temperature behave as cells trapped in a metastable phase with a syndrome of an arrest of the mechanism required to regain the morphostatic stage of a non-dividing cell.",

    "abstract": "Summary. Paramecium jenningsi Diller et Earl, 1958 is classified in the so-called “aurelia” subgroup. The original assumption of the monomorphic status of P. jenningsi (Sonneborn 1970) has been repeatedly challenged over the years with the application of increasingly sophisticated methods and knowledge of the geographic distribution of particular strains of this species. Investigations concer ning genetic polymorphism suggested the existence of two sibling species in P. jenningsi, comprised of strains inhabiting India, Saudi Arabia, China and Japan. In order to confirm the existence of these sibling species, here we apply the PCR-RFLP method for analysis of a fragment of the hsp70 gene coding for the Hsp70 cytosol heat shock protein. PCR-RFLP with enzymes Alu1I and EcoRI did not reveal size polymorphism of restriction fragments. Band patterns obtained with enzyme Tru1I showed variation corresponding to genetic polymorphism and were subject to comparative analysis using the BIO1D program which applies Nei and Li’s and Jaccard’s similarity coefficients. The r esults of these analyses are homology trees showing the genetic similarity between West-Central Asian and Japanese groups, the intra-grou p similarity coefficients had a value of 1, i.e. the strains were 100% homologous. The similarity between both of these groups was calculate d as 32% and 20% depending on which coefficient was used. West-Central Asian and Japanese groups detected in this study on the basis of PCRRFLP result can be considered separate species after interpretation of inter-strain crosses, which have shown the existence of reproductive isolation barriers between West-Central Asian and Japanese strains on the basis of the percentage of surviving clones.",

Cryptobia helicis Leidy, 1846, the type species of the genus, is redescribed on the basis of material from the seminal receptacle of Neohelix albolabris albolabris, the first of three host pulmonate snails mentioned by Leidy. The flagellate from Triodopsis tridentata, the second host mentioned by Leidy, is very different, and is described as C. innominata sp. n. The Cryptobia in Anguispira alternata, the third host designated by Leidy, is also distinct, but cannot properly be described until more material is available. The extens ively studied cryptobias in Helix pomatia and H. aspersa aspersa, long considered to be C. helicis, are very different from true C. helicis and C. innominata. The name C. helicogenae, originally proposed as Trypanoplasma helicogenae Kuhn, 1911, is applicable to the flagellate in H. pomatia, and tentatively also to the one in H. aspersa aspersa.",

    "abstract": "The carnivorous gymnostome ciliate Homalozoon vermiculare feeds on other ciliates, e.g. Paramecium and Colpidium. The gulper ingests the complete prey organism within one minute and encloses the food in a single, relatively large food vacuole. During the next 20 min, this big food vacuole becomes vesiculated into numerous small vacuoles of 15-20 μm in diameter, after which a condensation of their contents takes place. The different food components are separated more or less simultaneously. Finally, about one hour after phagocytosis, the different food vacuoles contain almost exclusively, e.g., mitochondria or extrusomes (from predator-discharged toxicysts and/or from prey discharged trichocysts) or mainly food vacuoles of the prey filled with bacteria. At this time the contents are greatly condensed and degradation of the food starts with the appearance of dictyosomes. After 4-24 h the digestion is completed and numerous vacuoles with indigestible prey remnants are found in the caudal region of the predator, where they are defecated. This type of digestive cycle-vesiculation of the food vacuole, segregation of their contents, differential degradation of the separated ingesta-is in contrast to the digestive cycle known for filter feeders like Paramecium, in which the different food particles are not segregated and not differentially digested. Food uptake and subsequent food vacuole vesiculation is inhibited by cytochalasin B but not by colchicine, indicating that microfilaments such as actin are involved in phagocytosis and digestion. Polymerization of microtubules does not play a crucial role in food uptake and digestion.",

    "abstract": "Histamine is a significant biological compound because of its role in mediating the human allergic and inflammatory pathways. Antihistamines are often administered to control the irritating symptoms of allergic reactions. We evaluated phagocytosis in the protist Tetrahymena thermophil a for use in screening for potential therapeutic compounds that mimic histamine and antihistamines. Tetrahymena has been frequently used as an experimental model to study compounds for biological effects or to study biological processes. Histamine and the antihistamine diphenhydramine were administered at concentrations ranging from 10–6 μM to 1000 μM, and the corresponding changes in phagocytosis were detected by flow cytometry. Treatment with histamine had no measurable effect on phagocytosis while diphenhydramine decreased phagocytic levels at concentrations above 50 μM. In a competition experiment between histamine and diphenhydramine, histamine did not reverse the dosage-dependent decrease in phagocytosis elicited by diphenhydramine. BLAST searches revealed no significant homologs of the human histamine receptors in T. thermophila . These results suggest that T. thermophila has a receptor for diphenhydramine that is linked to the phagocytic process, but not a histamine receptor. Further study is necessary to elucidate the nature of this previously uninvestigated receptor. The experimental protocol developed as a part of this study may serve as an inexpensive, high throughput, flow cytometric method to screen natural and synthetic compounds for pharmacologically significant properties.",

Phleobum globuloepimeritum n. sp. is described from Oxya hyla hyla (Insecta: Orthoptera: Acrididae) and Phleobum elliptica n. sp. from Atractomorpha crenulata (Insecta: Orthoptera: Pyrgomorphidae). In P. globuloepimeritum, the trophozoites are solitary, orangecoloured, have a maximum length of 352 µm with a hyaline globular epimerite and the protomerite in satellite is characteristically flanged. The gametocyst is orange, orbicular, averaging 300 × 250 µm in size, dehiscing through a pore after 50 h. The oocysts are uniformly smooth, ellipsoidal, measuring 9 × 5 µm. In P. elliptica trophozoites are also solitary, orange-coloured, having a maximum length of 157 µm with triangular epimeri tes. The protomerite flange is typically a bowel-shaped collar. The gametocyst is yellow-orange, ellipsoidal, averaging 240 × 165 µm and dehisces through a pore after 72 h, releasing smooth-walled, ellipsoidal, uniformly shaped oocysts measuring 5 × 3 µm. The two new species share traits, which define the genus such as: gamonts in association, satellites with characteristic flange and gametocysts dehiscence through a single pore. The epimerite of P. globuloepimeritu m is hyaline and globular, which is unique among members of the genus. The gametocyst of P. elliptica is notably ellipsoidal. Basing on observation on all the described and present two species, generic characters of the genus Phleobum have been redefined. The genus is also transferred from the family Didymophyidae to the family Hirmocystidae as the gametocysts in all the species of Phleobum dehisce through a pore.",

    "abstract": "Lichens are widely recognized as important examples of a fungal-algal or fungal-cyanophyte symbiosis; and in some cases they are a major food source for some animal grazers such as caribou ( Rangifer tarandus ), especially in the Arctic during winter. However, relatively little is known about the ecology of their co-associated bacterial and protistan communities. This is one of the first reports of an analysis of microbial communities associated with rock-dwelling foliose lichens ( Flavoparmelia sp.), including a more detailed analysis of the microbial communities associated with segments of the shield-like, radially arranged lobes. Samples were taken from lichens on granite boulders beneath an oak and maple tree stand on the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Campus, Palisades, N.Y. The bacteria and protist members of the lichen associated microbial communities are comparable to recently reported associations for foliose lichens growing on tree bark at the same locale, including the presence of large myxomycete plasmodial amebas, heterotrophic nanoflagellates, and naked and testate amebas. To obtain evidence of possible differences in the microecology of different portions of each radial lobe, three segments of the radial lobe in the shield-like lichen were sampled: 1) inner, more mature, central segment; 2) middle section linking the central and peripheral segments; and 3) outer, peripheral, usually broader, less closely attached segment. The mean densities (number/g) and biomasses (µg/g) of bacteria and heterotrophic nanoflagellates were highest in the older central segment and lowest in the peripheral segment of the radial lobes, especially when expressed on moist weight basis. Large myxomycete plasmodial amebas were typically located in the outermost segment of the radial lobe. The proportion of vannellid amebas ( Vannella spp. and Cochliopodium spp.) were significantly more abundant in the samples of the inner lobes compared to non-vannellid amebas that were more prevalent in the outer lobes. The outer segment of the thallus lobe was typically more spongiose and absorbed more water per unit weight (based on a wet/dry-weight ratio) than the innermost segment. In general, patterns of densities and taxonomic composition of bacteria and eukaryotic microbes intergraded from the inner most segment to the outer part of each lobe – indicating a possible microecological gradient, coincident with the age-related and morphological radial gradations of the lobe. Overall, the evidence shows that the radial variation in the morphology and age-related variables of the three lobe segments may affect the microenvironment of the lobe segments and hence influence the organization of the microbial communities within each segment.",

In the present experiments EGF, a potent mitogen of epithelial cells were studied. In a 24 h experiment 1 h treatment with different concentrations of EGF (0.1-10 µg) significantly decreased the growth of Tetrahymena. Five microgram EGF treatment 24 h after 5 µg EGF pretreatment (imprinting) also significantly reduced the amount of cells, and this was moderately, however significantly less, than without the repeated treatment. After 48 h there was not difference between the amount of single or double treated cells. EGF was chemorepellent in chemotaxis experiments and 4 h EGF pretreatment abolished this effect, possibly by down regulation. The experiments call attention to the effect of EGF at a very low phylogenetic level, however the direction of the effect was the opposite of the effect in higher animals.",

Using Fernandez-Galiano silver impregnation technique and scanning electron microscopy of artificially deciliated specimens the divisional morphogenesis of the cyrtophorid ciliate Chlamydodon mnemosyne was investigated. Morphogenesis in this ciliate is of the merotelokinetal type with four postoral kineties and two left somatic kineties involved in the formation of the oral ciliature in the future opisthe. Like in other cyrtophorid ciliates ( Trithigmostoma, Chilodonella and Brooklynella) the stomatogenic kinetofragments perform a complex morphogenetic migration to yield the inverted preoral kinety and the inner and outer circumoral kineties. The different iation of an oral rosette made of 9-11 large and two smaller nematodesmal rods covered by a prominent collar of cytostomal corrugations is described. Oral reorganisation in the proter, involving dedifferentiation of the entire parental cytostome and the de novo formation of a new cytostome in front of the old one is best seen in deciliated dividers. Replication of kinetosomes in particular the transformation of som atic monokinetids into oral dikinetids as judged from light microscopy seems similar to the events in Trithigmostoma. Details observed in Chlamydodon are discussed in comparison with other cyrtophorid ciliates.",

The population from the River Ipeľ, Slovakia is designated as a neotype because (i) no type material is available from the species described by Kahl (1928); (ii) the neotype is consistent with Z. transversus as described by Kahl (1928); (iii) the neotype is from the same biogeographic region as Kahl’s (1928) populations; and (iv) there are several similar species (e.g., Z. agamalievi) whose identity is threatened by the species to be neotypified. The main features of Z. transversus are: (i) a body size of 120–240 × 50–115 μm in vivo; (ii) a broadly to narrowly obovate or elliptical body; (iii) a spherical to very narrowly ellipsoidal macronucleus with a single globular micronucleus nearby; (iv) several scattered contractile vacuoles; (v) an average of 82 ciliary rows, most of which are interrupted by a synhymenium incompletely encircling the body; and (vi) an average of 14 nematodesmal rods strengthening walls of the cyrtos. In the well-growing neotype population, a single cell of a mirror-image type was found. Most of the structures of this monster specimen are similar to those from ordinary cells, except for the double cytostome and cyrtos.",

This provided the ideal opportunity to study asexual and sexual reproduction, for the first time in different African Mantoscyphidia Jankowski, 1985 populations. Descriptions of the reproductive processes found in scyphidiid peritrichs were until now, mostly based on line drawings. Scanning electronand light microscopy contributed uniquely, in providing detail information regarding binary fission, telotroch formation and conjugation. Mantoscyphidia spadiceae Botes, Basson and Van As, 2001 shed the most light on binary fission. Micronuclear division occurred first with the plane of fission already evident and macronuclear cleavage ended just before final separation took place. Fission is not complete until a small string of pellicle that joins the daughter cells finally separates. Information on telotroch development was gathered from M. branchi Van As, Basson and Van As, 1998 and M. spadiceae populations. Telotrochs were between 36.7 and 38.6% shorter than live, extended mantoscyphidians and their swimming action resembled mobiline peritrichs. Mantoscyphidia branchi populations also proved to be most useful for conjugation studies. Conjugation included three progamic nuclear divisions and preceded synkaryon formation and two metagamic nuclear divisions. The process required 24 hours to be completed.",

DNA sequences representing ITS-1 and ITS-4 regions of the 5.8S rDNA gene from the two isolates were amplified and compared. In addition to the two isolates showing similar morphological characteristics, they also had identical nucleotide sequences for the ITS-1 and ITS-4 regions of the 5.8S ribosomal gene.",

    "abstract": "Summary. In case of hormonal (chemical) imprinting, the first encounter of a mixed cell population with a bioactive molecule provokes changes in the receptor-signal transduction system. In case of chemotactic selection, from the mixed cell culture the chemotactically most affine cells are selected and maintained. In the present experiments chemotactic effects elicited by three lectins (Concanavalin-A = Con A, lens, Helix) were studied in Tetrahymena pyriformis GL unicellular model, for comparing the effect of imprinting and selection. Tetrahymena (without selection or imprinting) showed a molecule-dependent (positive) chemotactic reaction to lectins. Subpopulations gained by chemotactic selection were inducible in a ligand-specific scale with preference of [α -Man-α -Glu] or N-Ac-Gal specificity lectins, producing a significant affinity to Helix and non-significant affinity to Con A, and negative chemotaxis to lens. Similar results were shown in case of selection and imprinting with Con-A (except the significant affinity of mixed population), nevertheless in case of Helix and lens lectins (having similar, however not identical sugar specificity) differences had been observed between selection and imprinting. These accordances and deviations of results in imprinting and selection studies suggest that chemotaxis receptors share functional moieties with lectin receptors of unicellular organisms. The experiments call attention to the possible role of selection in the development of imprinting however, this is dependent on the nature of the imprinter molecule.",

The observed light-dependent changes in the phosphorylation levels of both proteins were entirely reversible. In contrast, no alteration in protein phosphorylation was detected in cells treated by external potassium, which depolarizes the cell membrane. These observations suggest that both the 28 kDa and 46 kDa proteins might be involved in the light transducing mechanism, which results in the photophobic response of Blepharisma.",

Arcuospathidium pachyoplites sp. n. was discovered in saline coastal soil from the Henry Pittier National Park in Venezuela, South America. Spathidium faurefremieti, originally described by Tucolesco (1962) from Rumanian cave water, was rediscovered in savannah soil from the Shimba Hills National Reserve in Kenya (Africa) and in floodplain soils of Brazil (South America) and Australia. The morphology of these species was investigated using live observation and protargol impregnation. The South American A. pachyoplites differs from the African A. vlassaki, possibly the nearest relative, mainly by the extrusomes and dorsal brush. Spathidium faurei Tucolesco, 1962 is an objective homonym of Spathidium faurei Kahl, 1930 and thus re-named: Spathidium faurefremieti nom. n. This species is remarkable in having a second contractile vacuole in anterior body half. However, conspecificity of the European and Kenyan populations is questionable; likewise, the Kenyan and Brazilian populations differ considerably, suggesting that further research might prove that all are different subspecies or even species. The present study shows that (i) an increased number of contractile vacuoles likely evolved independently three times, viz., in Spathidium, Arcuospathidium, and Supraspathidium, and (ii) the bivacuolate species should be separated from the polyvacuolate species, which can be referred to the genus Supraspathidium.",

Testate amoeba Arcella excavata Cunningham, 1919, isolated from the aeration tanks of the Sofia’s Wastewater Treatment Plant and its morphology, biometry and ecology have been investigated. Based on the rich live material (120 specimens), a detailed morphological description of A. excavata and new data about the cytoplasm and the nuclei of the species are supplied. It was found out that A. excavata is a multinuclear species and the nuclei are usually 3 or 4, rarely 5-6 (1-2% only). These new data, as well as the characteristic shape of the shell and its bigger depth, show clearly that A. excavata is a separate, well distinguishing species. The size frequency distribution analysis indicates that A. excavata is a size-monomorphic species, characterized by a main-size class and a small-size range (all measured individuals have a shell length of 60-70 µm and 98% have a shell breadth of 55-66 µm). The present study shows that A. excavata inhabits polluted waters also and this fact does not confirm the conclusion of Snegovaya that it can be used as a bioindicator of the waters with the saprobity β-α . Probably, it is also a freshwater eurybiont as well as the majority of the known species of family Arcellidae.",

Previous studies have shown that, removing these important regions drastically affects the promoter activity and Pfs25 protein expression. We for the first time, report that though promoter regions of Pfs25 gene is AT rich, it doesn’t show any polymorphism or point mutation in sequences important for its activity in 155 natural isolates of Plasmodium falciparum from hyper endemic malaria transmission regions. Since, Pfs25 expression is vital for the survival of the parasite in the mosquito vector, a stable promoter sequence of Pfs25 in all the strains may have fair chances of survival in the mosquito vector. Our finding of a stable promoter sequence in combination with previous reports of limited polymorphism in the coding regions of Pfs25 indicates that Pfs25 might be a strong candidate for vaccine.",

In Trial 1, samples of mixed rumen contents were diluted and cultured at 38, 15 and 5°C for 2, 4 and 6 h, respectively. Viability of Isotrichidae was not affected by either the length of incubation or the temperature (P < 0.10). Incubation at low temperatures negatively affected the viability of Entodinium, Diplodiniinae and Ophryoscolex. Differences between 15 and 5°C were not significant except for Entodinium spp. (P = 0.07). The reduction of viability increased with time, this effect being noticeable (P < 0.10) for Entodinium (after 4 and 6 h), Diplodiniinae (at 6 h) and Ophryoscolex (at 2 and 6 h). Preservation of mixed rumen protozoa for at least 4 h at 15 or 5°C did not markedly affect viability, suggesting that cultures can be recovered after short-term refrigeration. In Trial 2, monocultures of Entodinium caudatum and Diploplastron (Metadinium) affine were cultured at 5°C for 4, 8 and 24 h with or without milk powder/egg yolk solution as a membrane protector. For both species, viability was not affected after 4 h at 5°C, but decreased from 8 h onwards (P < 0.01). The use of a membrane protector improved viability of D. affine at all time periods (P < 0.05), but only at 24 h for E. caudatum (P = 0.07), showing that the use of membrane protector may be positive at medium or long exposure to low temperatures, depending on the species.",

Fumigation plays a significant role in the management of insect pests in stored-products. However, the use of fumigants is problematic because of their effects on the environment and high costs. Entomopathogenic organisms are environmentally friendly control agents and suppress pest populations under natural conditions. In this study, distribution and occurrence of a microsporidian pathogen, Vairimorpha plodiae (Opisthokonta: Microspora) in the populations of P. interpunctella from 12 localities representing Turkey between 2019 and 2020 are presented for the first time by confirming its effectiveness on natural populations. The presence of the microsporidian pathogen was found in 11 of 12 (91.7%) populations. In total, 863 of 3,044 samples were infected by the pathogen. Infection mean was 28.4% for all populations. Our results showed that V. plodiae infection reached to a considerably high prevalence (88.77%) in P. interpunctella populations and varied from 5.1 to 88.7% between the populations. In addition, microsporidia infections have been identified throughout Turkey. We found that V. plodiae can infect all life stages of P. interpunctella. Totally, 623 (28.5%) of 2187 larvae, 14 (37.8%) of 37 pupae, 226 (27%) of 820 adults were found to be infected by the pathogen. There were considerable differences between the dead and living larvae. The microsporidian infection was found in 26 (11.6%) of 225 living larvae, whereas it was found in 595 (30.5%) of 1,952 dead larvae. These results confirm that the microsporidia pathogen has a high spreading potential in P. interpunctella populations and can be a natural biological suppression factor on pest populations.",

    "abstract": "Although there are strong recommendations to mix micoalgal cultures, to improve productivity, there is only anecdotal evidence to encourage protozoologists to mix cultures, to maintain constant quality ot microalgae. Isochrysis galbana is extensively used in laboratory experiments associated with applied and pure protozoan studies; thus, there is a need to assess how routine mixing may bias experiments. Although, mixing of cultures harms some microalgae, there is no indication of how mixing affects I. galbana. We address this problem by assessing mixing effects on key experimental variables: specific growth rate, cell volume, nutritional quality (as carbon and nitrogen content and ratio), and production (the product of growth rate and carbon or nitrogen content). Treatments, quantified as dissipation (e) m 3 s -1 were: mixed once per day (e=0), rotated on a plankton wheel (e=5.3 × 10 -5 ), and shaken on agitating tables (e=8.2 × 10 -3 , 2.32 × 10 -2 ). Mixing levels regularly used in experimental work (no-mixing, plankton wheel, and low agitation) did not alter I. galbana specific growth rate and thus need not be carefully controlled for, but exceptionally high-mixing did significantly reduce growth rate. Cell volume decreased at exceptionally high-mixing, but otherwise there was no size-bias caused by mixing. Carbon and nitrogen levels were highest at low-mixing but were otherwise generally unaffected by mixing. The nutritional quality of I. galbana (i.e. carbon:nitrogen) remained unaltered by mixing. Production was doubled at low-mixing, compared to all other treatments (which did not differ). Overall, I. galbana is a relatively robust species that withstands mixing levels well within those experienced in the laboratory and still grows at exceptionally high-mixing levels. Thus, within reason, protozoologists using I. galbana do not need to be rigorous in their monitor of mixing. Furthermore, meta-analyses that examine this species need not be too concerned with variation in mixing methods as a confounding factor. However, the data suggest that gentle mixing, using a plankton wheel, is preferable to no-mixing.",

    "abstract": "Tachysoma pellionellum Stokes, 1887, a freshwater ciliate isolated from Stone Mountain State Park, North Carolina, was studied in vivo and after staining with protargol. The population was characterized mainly by having the typical 18 frontal-ventral-transverse cirri; posterior ends of left and right marginal rows not confluent; five dorsal kineties and one dorsomarginal kinety; two macronuclear nodules near left cell margin with one or two micronuclei between them; contractile vacuole located at mid-body near left margin. Morphogenesis is characterized as follows: (1) in the proter, the parental adoral zone of membranelles is retained completely; (2) 18 frontal-ventral-transverse cirri are derived from the anlage of the undulating membrane and the five streaks of the frontal-ventral-transverse anlagen; (3) marginal rows develop intrakinetally; (4) anlagen of dorsal kineties 1, 2 and 4 develop in the parental structure and anlagen of dorsal kineties 2 and 4 fragment in the posterior region forming anlagen of dorsal kineties 3 and 5; (5) only one dorsomarginal kinety formed; (6) the two macronuclear nodules fuse into a single mass, which then divides. Phylogenetic analyses based on sequences of the gene coding for SSU RNA revealed a close relationship between T. pellionellum and the Oxytricha clade, both of which grouped with Kleinstyla dorsicirrata and Heterourosomoida lanceolata.",

Tetrahymena was not able to differentiate qualitatively between oxytocin and vasopressin, however it sharply discriminated the real hormones from the analogues. Considering that in earlier experiments oxytocin and vasopressin also equally influenced the function of the contractile vacuole, it is supposed that the uniformity of the effe ct of these hormones is not a chance event and they had to be diverged (in function) later, during the evolution.",

The molecules tested did not influence phagocytosis in the random populations. However, populations selected to isotocin have a higher phagocytotic activity (without further stimuli) and also reacted to oxytocin or isotocin with an increased phagocytosis. Also isotocin was the only molecule the selection of which resulted in a isize-alteredi population (smaller cells), and produced minimal number of non-phagocytizing i0i cells. Populations selected to tocinoic acid or Tyr reacted with a decrease of phagocytosis to oxytocin treatment. The experiments calls attention to the possible evolutionary role of (chemotactic) selection to signal molecules, to the differentiating ability of Tetrahymena between signal molecules and to the advantage of phylogenetically older molecules from this point of view.",

However, the mutations affecting pfmdr-1 were not associated with chloroquine resistance (kappa [K] < 0). On the contrary, the mutant K-76T pfcrt codon, present in 54% (45 samples) of DNA fragments analyzed, was associated with therapeutic failure to chloroquine (K = 0.78). Indeed, T76 allele was present in 100% (37 samples) of P.falciparum isolates from children with therapeutic failure to chloroquine. In conclusion, chloroquine resistance appears to be a real problem in Cote d'lvoire, as elsewhere in West Africa. The evidence is provided by the high prevalence of pfcrt K76T mutation. It is hoped that the present study will serve as useful data for policy makers of the national malaria control program.",

In promastigote forms, this compound produced significant alterations as revealed by light and scanning electron microscopy. Also, parasites incubated in the presence of parthenolide showed significant ultrastructural alterations. In treated cells, among the first alterations were the appearance of abnormal condensation of chromatin, the presence of two nuclei, and two or three flagella. Furthermore, intense exocytic activity was observed in the region of the flagellar pocket; concentric membranes (myelin-like figures), multiple cytoplasmic vacuolisation, and swelling of the mitochondrion were also seen. On the basis of our observations and data reported in the literature on the effect of other drugs on trypanosomatids, we suggest that parthenolide may be acting via two mechanisms: a) depletion of endogenous sterols, and b) alterations of the nuclear structure and/or cytokinesis.",

In the current work, this species was identified from black-goggled tanagers Trichothraupis melanops (Vieillot, 1818) in the Itatiaia National Park, which is a protected area with a high degree of vulnerability in the interior of the State of Rio de Janeiro, distant in more than 100 km of the type- locality. Its oocysts are sub-spherical to elongate ovoidal, 25.9 ´20.7 µm with smooth, bi-layered wall, ~ 1.3 µm and length/width ratio of 1.1–1.4 (1.26). Micropyle and oocyst residuum absent, but one or two polar granules are present. Sporocysts are ellipsoidal, 16.8 ´10.3 µm, with both Stieda and sub-Stieda bodies. Sporocyst residuum present and sporozoites with refractile body and nucleus. Molecular analysis was conducted at the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene. This new isolate exhibited similarity greater than 98% with Isospora spp. isolates from other Neotropical passerines and with an Isospora sp. pseudoparasite of voles of Eurasia.

Although the rapid contraction of the axopodia at nearly a video rate (30 frames/s) is induced by mechanical stimuli, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon in R. contractilis has not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we described for the first time an adequate immunocytochemical fixation procedure for R. contractilis and the cellular distribution of α-tubulin before and after rapid axopodial contraction. We developed a flow-through chamber equipped with a micro-syringe pump that allowed the test solution to be injected at a flow rate below the threshold required to induce rapid axopodial contraction. Next, we used this injection method for evaluating the effects of different combinations of two fixatives (paraformaldehyde or glutaraldehyde) and two buffers (phosphate buffer or PHEM) on the morphological structure of the axopodia. A low concentration of glutaraldehyde in PHEM was identified as an adequate fixative for immunocytochemistry. The distribution of α-tubulin before and after rapid axopodial contraction was examined using immunocytochemistry and confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy. Positive signals were initially detected along the extended axopodia from the tips to the bases and were distributed in a non-uniform manner within the axopodia. Conversely, after the induction of a rapid axopodial contraction, these positive signals accumulated in the peripheral region of the cell. These results indicated that axopodial microtubules disassemble into fragments and/ or tubulin subunits during rapid axopodial contraction. Therefore, we hypothesize that the mechanism of extremely rapid axopodial contraction accompanied by cytoskeletal microtubule degradati",

This genus contains currently seven named species: P. marinus, P. olseni (P. atlanticus), P. chesapeaki (P. andrewsi), P. mediterraneus, P. honshuensis, P. beihaiensis and P. qugwadi. Meanwhile, some unnamed Perkinsus sp. have been described in wide variety of mollusc species. Ultrastructural features of Perkinsus sp. trophozites and the host reaction are described. The different developmental stages of trophozoites appeared as single or grouped cells surrounded by amorphous material that constituted cysts or nodules randomly distributed throughout the connective tissue of the mantle. The early trophozoites were generally spherical to ellipsoidal with a circular nucleus containing a prominent central nucleolus. The cytoplasm had several small vacuoles which coalesce to form a great vacuole in the later trophozoites and the nucleus becomes eccentric. Some lomosomes were observed between the wall and the plasmalemma of trophozoites. A large number of degraded and pyknotic cell and several cellular structure with lysed aspects were encountered in the surrounding area near the cysts. Ultrastructural data showed that the lysed granular cells and the coalescence of the granules result in the cyst that encapsulates various trophozoites. In the current study, we describe for the first time the presence of Perkinsus sp. as well as the host reaction in clams from the Saudi Arabian coasts.",

The lack of recent reports of this species, despite exhaustive surveys of the testate amoebae fauna of the major continents of the world, suggested that N. kivuense was a rare species perhaps endemic to a small, local equatorial region of the African continent. This paper reports its rediscovery from two wetland-conifer forest ecosystems in southern Ontario, Canada (at 44° N Latitude), thus changing dramatically our previous perception of its very restricted global distribution. This has implications for the idea held by many students of biogeography that there is a special category of microscopic protists that contains truly rare species and their rarity, perhaps together with specific habitat requirements and tolerances, limits opportunities for dispersal around the world. The N. kivuense story is a clear example of the dangers of inferring endemism from rarity.",

In the early 1980's Papulifères were equated with cysts of tintinnid ciliates. The most conspicuous forms, the large Fusopsis, have been widely found, and are now known to resemble the cyst of a certain species of oligotrich ciliate (i.e., Cyrtostrombidium boreale). Thus today, Papulifère forms are often assumed to be cysts of oligotrich ciliates. Here we report on 26 Papulifère forms, of more or less distinct morphologies, found in the plankton of the Chukchi Sea. We found forms resembling some of those described by Meunier, and recorded here for the first time since Meunier's reports, and others that do not resemble any of Meunier's Papulifères. Here, we first review the literature on Papulifères, then we present the surprising variety of forms we found in Chukchi Sea, and for some, we provide for the first time data on morphological variability. With this report we have expanded the catalogue of observed Papulifère forms and documented variability in the dimensions of some morphotypes. However, we urge caution in assigning a ciliate species name to any given Papulifère form in the absence of corroborating data. There is a need for observational and/or sequence-based data to elucidate the identity of Papulifère forms.",

LAMP OptiGene® and LAMP WarmStart® performances were identical and better than the performance of Us PCR TARE 2 and Us-PCR var-ATS for P. falciparum, achieving 93.75% sensitivity, 100% specificity and 97.17% accuracy versus 87.5% sensitivity, 100% specificity and 94.29% accuracy for the Us PCR TARE 2 and 81.25% sensitivity, 94.74% specificity and 88.57% accuracy for the Us PCR var-ATS respectively.

Although centriole satellites are involved in centrosome and ciliumrelated protein trafficking, their functions related to ciliary assembly and maintenance of ciliary microtubule stability remain unclear. In this study, the function of the FOP gene in Euplotes amieti was investigated by interfering with its expression using RNAi. As a result, expression levels of the ciliary assembly-related proteins BBS8 and IFT88 were down-regulated. Swimming speeds also decreased and the Euplotes were only able to spin in circles, which suggested that the FOP protein is an important protein involved in ciliary motion. Further observations of Euplotes amieti microstructure and ultrastructure via immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy revealed that FOP not only participated in the formation of the ventral ciliary basal body but also played an important role in the maintenance of cortical microtubules, which is fundamental for the morphological structure of Euplotes amieti.",

    "abstract": "Summary. Sampling of mayfly nymphs belonging to Caenis luctuosa (Ephemeroptera, Caenidae) revealed that 5% were infected by an enormous number of ciliates of the genus Ophryoglena. Free moving ciliates were recognisable by observing the host animals in vivo under a stereomicroscope. The ciliates lived in the hemolymph and penetrated the wing pads and trochanteral junctions of the legs. Af ter their removal from the host body, some specimens were reared in Petri dishes. Ophryoglena sp. formed cysts and failed to survive more than two days. In order to test the effect of the parasites on the host tissues, the ovarioles of some healthy and parasitised speci mens were examined under TEM. Parasitic castration depends upon an early degeneration of the follicle cells, which were unable to envelop e the egg within a firm epithelium. Eggs were blocked in their early phase of maturation since the integrity and activity of the follicul ar epithelium is essential for the ensuing synthesis of the egg envelopes (vitelline and chorionic layers). The low rate of parasitized mayfl ies hampers a full understanding of the life cycle of this ciliate and of its modality of spreading.",

Eimeria portovelhensis n. sp. were found in 16/23 animals examined. Oocysts were spheroidal, 19.5 × 19.1 (16–21) μm, and had 9.0 × 7.8 μm spherical oocyst residuum present. The spindle-shaped sporocysts were 11.0 × 4.0 (8–13 × 2–5) μm and had two apparent Stieda bodies, one at each pole and with one filament curved at each pole. Sporocyst residuum was present, with four or five small refractile granules.

The organic nature of the spiny structures of both species has been confirmed by their dissolution in 6% sodium hypochlorite solution. Median cell diameters of B. tubistella and B. quadrangularis were 10.5 µm and 7 µm, respectively. As revealed by transmission electron microscopy, the spine bases in B. tubistella consisted of a complex structure of four curved ribs interconnected by a membranous sheet replete with closely-appressed, large circular to elliptical pores, while in B. quadrangularis the spine bases consisted of a simple four-cornered “pyramid” of struts that supported the main shaft of the spine. These findings strengthen the status of the genus Belonocystis and it placement outside the realm of the Centrohelida and Rotosphaerida.",

    "abstract": "Summary. Ostrinia nubilalis populations from Slovakia, Romania, Austria, Serbia and Germany were collected in the autumn when the insects were in the larval stage. These insects were then established as laboratory populations. The number of pupae and adults that developed was always higher in the Nosema pyrausta non-inoculated (uninfected) populations than in the populations treated by the pathogen N. pyrausta (infected). Signifi cant differences were also found among the populations from different countries. Infected females laid signifi cantly fewer eggs compared to uninfected females. The average time for pupal eclosion or adult emergence was not signifi cantly different between the uninfected and infected populations of O. nubilalis. However, it was found that the infected females laid their eggs signifi cantly sooner as compared to the uninfected females (37.383 days compared to 40.089 days). Under the same conditions, populations from colder regions developed faster than those from warmer regions. The place of origin of the population did not signifi cantly infl uence larval weight, larval length or pupal weight. However, larvae infected with N. pyrausta spores had signifi cantly lower weight (average 0.0797 g) than uninfected larvae (0.0901 g). With regard to pupal weight, the difference between the infected and uninfected individuals was not signifi cant. It was confi rmed that N. pyrausta from one European country can infect and infl uence host larvae originating in other countries. Although there have been several statistically signifi cant interactions with regard to the country of origin and N. pyrausta infection, it was not believed that N. pyrausta from one country would have specifi c effects on the mortality, developmental rate and larval or pupal weight of O. nubilalis populations from different countries.",

    "abstract": "Summary. This paper deals with the morphology and life history of two new species of septate greganines (Apicomplexa: Conoidasida: Gregarinidae) of the genus Unilobus Theodorides, Desportes & Jolivet, 1984, obtained from two tenebrionid beetles of West Bengal, India. These are Unilobus gonocephali n. sp. from Gonocephalum sp. (Insecta: Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) and Unilobus scleroni n. sp. from Scleron irregulate (Insecta: Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). Total length of U. gonocephali varies from 200–467 μm. Gametocysts spherical, 410 μm in average diameter, dehisces through 7–9 sporoducts. U. scleroni is comparatively smaller, total length varies from 61–232 μm. Gametocyst spherical with average diameter 350 μm, dehices through 10 to 12 sporoducts. The two new species share traits which defi ne the genus such as the absence of epimerite, expanded protomerite and late association. These two described species are not only different from the previously described species, but also oocysts (= spores) entirely different from each other in characters like measurements, number of sporoduct and in host range. This communication also confi rmed the validity of the genus Unilobus Theodorides, Desportes & Jolivet, 1984 and its placement under the family Gregarinidae Labbe, 1899.",

Each hormone elavated significantly the digoxin concentration at the end of the 30 min treatment. As Tetrahymena was maintained in a tryptone-yeast extract medium during the treatment, it seems to be likely that steroid synthesis was enhanced. The most effective was histamine, the effect of which was significantly more expressed than that of the others and the less effective (however significant), was serotonin. The results call attention to hormonal interactions inside the unicellular organism and on the possibility of mutual intercellular influences, considering the low effective hormone concentration which was needed for the striking effect.",

A. site taken during the onset of winter 2002-2003, when the soil temperature was 5°C. The temperature of one of the microcosms, maintained in constant temperature chambers, was increased from 5°C to 25°C at 5 intervals of two weeks each for a period of 10 weeks. Another microcosm was maintained for the 10 weeks at 5°C to serve as a control for the lapse of time and to assess the effects of prolonged treatment at 5°C simulating winter conditions. Small subsamples (0.01 g) of the microcosm soil were taken using a modified 1 cm 3 syringe with the tip cut off to make a cylindrical corer. Based on a culture enrichment technique, the morphospecies richness, heterogeneity of distribution within the samples (morphospecies uniqueness) and community patchiness were determined by microscopic observation of the morphospecies that grew out in the cultures of each 0.01 g sample. The data showed that with increasing temperatures up to 20°C, the richness and patchiness of morphospecies increased while the uniqueness did not change within statistical significance. Two-weeks treatment at 25°C simulating summer conditions, produced a marked decline in richness of morphospecies and a substantial increase in the percent that were encysted suggesting less favorable conditions for growth, perhaps resulting from thermal stress and depletion of nutrients and other resources. Overall, the evidence from this study indicated that release from cold stress during the transition from winter to spring produced increased richness of morphospecies and greater patchiness of the gymnamoeba communities. This “bloom,” however, was followed by a period of less productivity and retrenchment with increasing numbers of encysted gymnamoebae as the temperature was increased above 20°C.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic studies of the genus Macropodinium were conducted using two methods; phenetics and cladistics. The phenetic study of morphometrics suggested that the genus could be divided into 3 groups attributable mostly to cell size and shape. The cladistic study also split the genus into 3 groups related to cell size but groups were further distinguished by patterns of ornamentation. Reconciliation of both approaches revealed considerable congruence, however, it also suggested the existence of convergences in the phenetic study and a lack of resolution in the cladistic study. The morphological diversity of Macropodinium is probably due to evolutionary trends such as increasing body size, allometry and polymerisation of structures. None of these trends, however, was uniformly directional and differential effects were observed in different regions of the phylogenetic tree. Comparison of the phylogeny of Macropodinium to a consensus phylogeny of the macropodids revealed limited incongruence between the 2 trees. The ciliate groups could be related to 2 host groups; the wallaby genera and the kangaroo and wallaroo subgenera. The association with these host groups may be the result of phyletic codescent, ecological resource tracking or a combination of both. Further studies of both host and ciliate phylogeny are necessary to resolve these effects.",

    "abstract": "We found that vegetative cells of Colpoda cucullus Nag-1 accumulated in shaded areas of a container when grown in the laboratory and then formed resting cysts. The photodispersal (negative photoaccumulation) of C. cucullus was mediated, at least in part, by a difference in forward swimming velocity between the illuminated region and the shaded area of the Petri dish (motion slowed or stopped in the shaded area). When C. cucullus was stimulated by continuous light irradiation, the forward swimming velocity increased and reached a steady state within 10 s. When the light intensity decreased, the forward swimming velocity gradually decreased, and eventually returned to its original level for approximately 1 min. The action spectrum of the photokinetic response (steady-state swimming acceleration driven by continuous light stimulation) implies the involvement of blue light receptors.",

This method is not acceptable in urban forests because of their proximity to people. Entomopathogenic organisms are environmentally friendly control agents and suppress the pest populations under natural conditions. In the present study, the occurrence and distribution of a new entomopathogenic protist, a neogregarine, Ophryocystis anatoliensis (Apicomplexa) in C. populi populations and a member of the family Chrysomelidae is presented for the first time. In total, 90 of 2185 C. populi adults and larvae collected from 16 localities during three years (from 2013 to 2015) were found to be infected by this pathogen. Neogregarine infection was observed in 14 of 16 investigated C. populi populations. The infection was variable between the populations and years. These results confirm that the neogregarine pathogen has a high dispersal potential through the C. populi populations and can be an effective natural biological suppressing factor on the pest populations.",

The sporogony of this microsporidian ends with 16 oval spores closed in sporophorous vesicles. The isofilar polar filament coiled in 13 coils, the arched anchoring disc and the polaroplast with tightly packed lamellae are typical for the ultrastructures of uninucleate spores. The sporophorous vesicle is persistent. The microsporidian infects cyst-like lobes of the fat body hanging free in the body cavity. Relations to other related genera are discussed.",

P. elphinstonae possesses most of the features of the genus: 4 anterior flagella, prominent costa and recurrent flagellum forming an undulating membrane and simple bean-shaped parabasal body. The mastigont complex is of similar composition and arrangement to other trichomonads but the pelto-axostylar complex is greatly simplified being composed of a single layer of microtubules which do not over lap and cannot be distinguished into separate structures. The undulating membrane is much smaller than in related species; the costa is smaller and simpler and there are no microtubular bundles connecting it to the recurrent flagellum. Comparison of the ultrastructure of P. elphinstonae sp. n. with that of P. giganteum demonstrated that P. elphinstonae sp. n. in addition to being much smaller in size had a correspondingly simper ultrastructural organisation lacking several organelles which characterise the latter species.",

Two sporoplasms were arranged asymmetrically in the spore cavity. Trophozoites are highly variable in shape and size, having 1-4 long pseudopods bearing small filopodial projections. Different-sized swellings form along the main pseudopod. Masses of young aggregated trophozoites are frequent. Pseudoplasmodium was proliferated by exogenous budding. Divisions of generative cells without pansporoblast formation give rise to two or more spores within the primary cell.

    "abstract": "Summary. The kinetoplastid glucose transporters belong to the glucose transporter superfamily, exemplified by the mammalian transporter s, especially GLUT1. Some species, which undergo a life cycle in which parasitic stages are exposed to different glucose concentra tions in several hosts, have evolved two different transporters to deal with this difference. While all of the trypanosome transporters also carry D-fructose, GLUTs (excluding GLUT2 and GLUT5) do not. Mammalian glucose transporters are very much more susceptible to cytochalasin B and phloretin, inhibitors of GLUTs, than are the trypanosome transporters. These properties suggest that the glu cose transporter may be a good target for anti-trypanosomal drugs. The trypanosome hexose transporter might also be a vaccine candid ate if it is accessible to antibodies. Genes encoding proteins involved in glucose transport have been cloned from several kinetoplast id species. Typically, the expression of hexose transporter genes is stage-regulated. The putative hexose transporter genes are highly cons erved among Kinetoplastidae.",

    "abstract": "Giardia duodenalis is one of the six Giardia species and it is the most common, cosmopolitan flagellate that infects humans and many species of animals.This species exhibits considerable genetic diversity; to date, eight assemblages (A-H) have been defined.These assemblages differ in host specificity: assemblages A and B have been found in both humans and in many animal species.Mixed infections with Giardia (A and B) assemblages have been reported in humans and in animals.Many molecular techniques are effective and rapid for the detection of G. duodenalis and also for the determination of genetic variability of isolates in clinical and environmental samples.In this context, the aim of this study was to design new assemblage-specific primers for rapid detection and identification of G. duodenalis assemblages A and B and both of these assemblages simultaneously using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).Fragments of glutamate dehydrogenase and triose phosphate isomerase were used as targets in the design of primers.In conclusion, the use of G. duodenalis assemblage-specific primers designed in this study allows quick identification of human infectious G. duodenalis assemblages A and B as well as mixed AB assemblages in a sample without further sequencing of the amplification products, which reduces the cost of study and the waiting time for the results.",

    "abstract": "Before the furrow formation the non-polar general contraction resulting in cell de-adhesion and spherulation, and the following relaxation leading to re-adhesion, flattening and spreading, are both necessary prerequisitesof a successful cytokinesis in A. proteus. The bipartition begins by sudden generation of two divergent cytoplasmic streamings at the late anaphase, always before the formation of furrow. All these facts fit better with the polar relaxation model than with the equatorial contraction model of initiating the fission of amoeba. After formation of the furrow the contractile ring gradually constricts the cytoplasmic connection between daughter cells. Endopasm flow in the connection bridge is no more bipolar but irregularly reversing; it compensates hydrostatic pressure differences between daughter cells. The final break of the connection is explained by its stretching because of the disparate locomotor activities on both sides of the furrow and owing to the cytoskeleton disassembly inside the connecting bridge.",

Crithidia deanei, a protozoan of the family Trypanosomatidae harboring an endosymbiont bacterium in its cytoplasm and cured strain (endosymbiont-free) were compared as to glycoprotein composition. The wild strain of C. deanei showed a double band with molecular mass of 70/74 kDa. These bands were absent from symbiont-free cells. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using specific anti bodies against the 70/74 kDa glycoprotein isolated from the symbiont-containing cells revealed intense labeling of the cell surface in the symbiontharboring C. deanei. However, no such labeling was observed in symbiont-free cells. These observations suggest that the endosymbiont influences the composition of the glycoprotein on the cell surface of C. deanei.",

Interestingly, codon usage in A. proteus resembled that of human and Escherichia coli. The presence of tRNAs for all possible codons indicates that all heterologous genes may be expressed in these giant cells.

    "abstract": "The life cycle and pathogenicity of Eimeria fulva were studied. Eighteen, 10-day-old, artificially-reared coccidia-free goslings (Anser cygnoides var. domestica) were inoculated orally with 7.0×10^5-1.5×10^6 sporulated oocysts of Eimeria fulva and killed at intervals from 24 to 288 h post-inoculation (PI). Parts of the visceral organs including intestines, kidney, liver, gallbladder, and spleen from inoculated goslings were fixed, sectioned, and observed microscopically. The results revealed that at least 2 generations of meronts occurred in the life cycle of E. fulva. The first generation completed maturation at about 72 h PI, and the second at about 144 h PI. Each meront contained about 15 merozoites. Development of gamonts began at about 144 h PI. The prepatent period was 7.5 days and patency continued for 2.5 days. Sporulation of oocysts occurred in 60-84 h at 25°C. Developmental stages were present in the epithelial cells of the villi and crypts, and in the lamina propria of the whole intestine and cloaca, resulting in local desquamation and necrosis of the epithelium (including crypt epithelium), edema, hemorrhages, and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Histological lesions were pronounced in the jejunum and the ileum. The infected goslings mainly showed diarrhoea, slight bloody feces, but no death. The results suggest that E. fulva may be mildly pathogenic for goslings.",

After EDAC fixation the measurable hormone content was 2.5x, 4x, 6x more, respectively, related to Pf fixation (significance: p<0.001). This means that EDAC, which causes crosslinking between COOH and amino groups inside a molecule and between molecules could inhibit the escape of hormones during the procedure. However, FITC-insulin binding was also threefold after EDAC fixation which means that some other effects must be considered. The results show that 1) EDAC fixation is more suitable to watch the whole hormone content in a cell (in Tetrahymena, at present); 2) more vertebrate-like hormone is present in Tetrahymena, than it was believed before and 3) triiodothyronine is also present in Tetrahymena (first observation).",

Naegleria was isolated on non-nutrient agar plates seeded with heat killed E. coli and confirmed by morphological properties of the both stages of cyst or trophozoites. Furthermore, PCR was conducted along with direct sequencing of the PCR product for molecular identification. PCR and sequencing data verified the amplification of Naegleria sp. (07) and Vahlkampfia sp. (01) from both water and soil samples. Interestingly two species were successfully isolated and cultured on both 30 and 45°C. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report demonstrating the Naegleria isolation and molecular characterization from environmental sources of Rawlakot, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan. The author is anxious for further evaluation of the pathogenic potential of the identified species and explores drinking water across Pakistan to investigate its quality and frequency of FLA, which might be a possible human hazard in future.",

This phosphoprotein exists in a highly phosphorylated form in ciliates adapted to darkness and its dephosphorylation occurs in illuminated cells. An immunoblot assay of the precipitated phosducin-related protein with a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against β-subunit of G-protein showed one major protein band of molecular weight of about 34 kDa in lysate obtained from ciliates exposed to light.

Plasmodia are located in the lumen of hepatic ducts and they are not in close contact with the epithelial cells. The surface of the plasmodium is delimited by a single unit membrane. Numerous microvillous projections extend from the surface of the plasmodium. Pinocytic vesicles are situated beneath the cell membrane. The sporogenesis proceeds with the pansporoblast formation. The sporogonic cell undergoes a series of divisions until ten undifferentiated cells are present within the enveloping cell. Ten cells differentiate and divide into two sporoblasts; each has five cells including two capsulogenic cells, two valvogenic cells and one sporoplasm. Two spores are produced from one pansporoblast at the end of sporogenesis.",

Ruthenium red staining revealed a thicker surface coat in  E. histolytica  trophozoites, whereas trophozoites of  E. dispar  showed a higher concentration of cationized ferritin particles on its surface. Mannose or glucose residues were found at the plasma membrane of both parasites treated with Concanavalin A (Con A)-peroxidase; the surface reaction product was more evident in  E. dispar,  compared with  E. histolytica.  Con A rapidly produced surface caps in  E. histolytica  trophozoites, whereas  E. dispar  showed a much less efficient mobilization of surface Con A receptors. Agglutination with Con A produced much larger clumps in  E. histolytica  in comparison with  E. dispar . In turn, biotinylation assays revealed striking differences in the composition of surface membrane proteins in both amebic species. Overall, these results further emphasize the phenotypic differences between these two common parasites of the human intestinal tract, once considered to be the same protozoan.",

Drepanomonas minuta nov. spec. is characterized by a small size ( in vivo about 22 × 11 µm) and a curious distribution pattern of the extrusomes, viz., only one trichocyst each in mid of dorsal margin and near posterior end of ventral side. Body size and shape of D. minuta highly resemble D. revoluta – for which a new morphometric characterization is provided – which, however, has a deep, broad furrow on the left side and more than 10 extrusomes. Drepanomonas multidentata nov. spec. was discovered in ephemeral grassland puddles on the north coast of Venezuela. It is a comparatively large species (in vivo 45 × 25 µm) with a total of nine spines, of which those on the left posterior half form a highly characteristic tridentate pattern. Curiously, this species lacks extrusomes. Leptopharynx lajacola nov. spec. was discovered in an ephemeral puddle on a granitic outcropping (Laja) in Venezuela. This species resembles L. costatus but is unique in having a quadrangular outline and a strongly curved oral basket with the opening directed posteriorly. In the past four years, we have described 10 new microthoracids, showing that their diversity is far from being exhausted.",

Regarding Naegleria fowleri , the trophozoites did not produce a defi ned cap, and only small patches of lectin-bound surface receptor complexes were observed at one pole of the cell body.

The trichodinid prevailed on the new host S. vulgaris all the year with high intensity during winter. Comparison with the original description revealed that the present trichodinid morphometry coincides with the minimal ranges of the original population and might be attributed to the new host and habitat. Scanning electron observations showed firm junctions of denticles through the fairly developed central parts. A new described character of this genus was clearly visible in the ray structure. Rays were semi-squared in form and ended with vermiform thin projections that were folded at right angles underneath the semi-square parts. The study provides a possible explanation for the present new locality and host in the saline inland lake of Qarun.",

More than 18,000 spores of C. appendiculata were examined, classified and quantified. Of this, 98.31% were bivalvular normal spores, the rest were abnormal spores (1.63% were trivalvular spores and 0.06% were tetravalvular spores). The monthly evolution of these spores was followed for ten months. Differences among the proportions of trivalvular spores in different months were significant. Percentage of trivalvular spores ranged from 9.90% (May) to 0.00% (December). The highest percentage of tetravalvular spores was reached in november (0.39%).

    "abstract": "Shell ultra-structure and morphometrical variability of Nebela tenella were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). N. tenella was isolated from two widely separated populations, one from Switzerland and another from Canada. The shell’s structural elements were similar to those of the other nebelids, but N. tenella has a characteristic peculiarity – always present depressions on the shell surface, which makes an uneven outline of the shell. Moreover, light microscopy and SEM study showed that the collar of the N. tenella represents a turned-over continuation of the neck, which is covered by the same idiosomes as on the shell body. The biometrical analysis showed that the majority of the basic characters of N. tenella vary moderately and give continuous series of transition forms. According to the shell depth and the ratio depth/width both populations were significantly different of each other. Variation coefficients showed that the variability of the characters differs in both populations and the Swiss population is more stable than the Canadian one. All new obtained data for N. tenella raise the question whether the shell’s size, cross section and ultramorphology are reliable enough as characters for the differentiation of N. tenella and N. griseola, and whether they are two distinct species or should just be considered as ecophenotypic variation within one species?",

Sporulated oocysts are ovoidal, 34.6 × 22.8(31-37 × 22-25) μm, with a single wall with a smooth inner surface but a dimpled outer surface similar to the surface of a golf ball. The average shape index is 1.52. No micropyle but one large, globular oocyst residuum present composed of scattered coarse, non-uniform granules. Sporocysts are ovoidal, 14 × 6(13-14 × 5.5-7) μm, with a triangular shaped Stieda body and no apparent substieda body; shape index 2.3. Sporozoites are ovoidal with a prominent posterior refractile body and obliquely positioned within each sporocyst with a centrally located sporocyst residuum. Oocysts of Eimeria cerberi sp. n. were found in 54/190 (28%) of the fecal samples. Sporulated oocysts are spherical to subspherical, 18.4 × 16.7 (15-24 × 13-20) μm, with a single wall, the inner surface smooth but the outer surface is rough and pitted; shape index is 1.10. Micropyle absent but a large, globular oocyst residuum present composed of loosely arranged coarse granules. Sporocysts are ovoidal, 15 × (13-15.5 × 5.5-6) pm, with a triangular shaped Stieda body and no apparent substieda body; shape index 2.5. Sporocyst contains a residuum composed of scattered coarse granules and two ovoidal sporozoites with prominent posterior retractile bodies and placed in tandom within the sporocyst. Twenty one percent (39/190) fecal samples had both coccidian species.",

The strains were analyzed by some morphological and biological features, and by biochemical and molecular techniques. The mean total length (TL) of the bloodstream trypomastigotes of T. rangeli varied between 31.3–33.0 µm, and those of T. lewisi (adult forms) was 28.2 µm, values within the variation known for each species. In T. rangeli KP1(+) and T. lewisi, the nucleus was located in the anterior portion of the body, with nuclear indexes (NI) ≥ 1.2, as typically described for both species. Differently, most trypomastigotes of the KP1(–) stocks presented NI ≤ 1.0. Another striking feature of the KP1(–) strains was their very fastidiously growth in axenic cultures when compared with the KP1(+) stocks and T. lewisi. Three isoenzyme loci (MDH, IDH and PGM) clearly distinguished T. rangeli and T. lewisi, and the distinction between the KP1(+) and KP1(–) strains was possible at MDH, PGM and GPI loci. All T. rangeli strains presented the typical 760 bp amplicon derived from their KP2 minicircles. However, the KP3 products of the KP1(+) strains were a single large band (~330bp), whereas those of the KP1(–) had two distinct bands (350 and 300 bp). T. lewisi presented 700 and 400 bp amplicons, as previously reported. The peculiarities of T. rangeli isolates from P. dasythrix corroborate a possible speciation process within this taxon.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the assembly characteristics of ciliature and cortical microtubules and the localization of tubulins in different depths and regions of the cortex. The hypotrichous ciliates have closely arranged cilia and a highly complex microtubular system. Direct fluorescence and immunofluorescence labeling were used to observe ciliary organelles and cortical microtubular cytoskeleton in Euplotes eurystomus. An immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that α-tubulin localized to the ventral and dorsal ciliary organelles and their associated microtubules, while γ-tubulin localized to the basal bodies of ciliary organelles, macronuclear membrane, and excretory pore of a contractile vacuole in the interphase. A direct fluorescence analysis showed that the ciliature and cortical microtubules in the deep cortex were more clearly marked by fluorescent taxoid (FLUTAX). Interestingly, α- and γ-tubulins also colocalized to the ringlike ciliary base–associated microtubules of dorsal kineties. The short microtubular bundles between the bases of transverse cirri could be marked by FLUTAX and γ-tubulin rather than α-tubulin, suggesting that tubulins in cortical microtubules in E. eurystomus varied, and the differentiation of cortical microtubules in the hypotrichous ciliate tended to be versatile. Also, during morphogenesis, γ-tubulin also localized to the base of ciliary primordium, where new basal bodies were formed, suggesting that the endocellular position of γ-tubulin in ciliates was related to basal bodies and regulated by the cell cycle. This study might help understand the assembly characteristics and tubulin composition of microtubules in different depths and regions of the cortex in hypotrichous ciliate E. eurystomus.",

In these protists actinomycin D can induce an unusual type of hereditary variation, which we refer to as the inheritable destabilization of characters. A number of features indicate that this variation is epigenetic, that is, not caused by mutations in the DNA. Therefore, actinomycin D may be considered as an inducer of epigenetic inheritable changes, in other words, as an epimutagen.",

Cells were exposed to three treatments: PAB (PAR+UV-A+UV-B), PA (PAR+UV-A), and P (PAR-only) from a solar simulator. The actual quantum yield (Φ PSΙΙ ) was determined from chlorophyll fluorescence measurements and used as photosynthesis indicator. The inhibition kinetics were consistent with a dynamic balance between damage and repair. Experimental data fit well to the equation (Φ PSII ) 1 /(Φ PSII ) 0 =[r/ (k + r)] + [k/(k + r)] x e -(k+r) , where t is time, and k and r are the damage and repair rates, respectively. Statistical analysis pointed out Cg as the most sensitive alga, as shown by higher k, while differences were not significant between the other algae. Higher k and r values were computed in nutrient-deficient cells (LN) than in nutrient-sufficient cells (HN). Partial inhibition with 25-75 μM chloramphenicol (CPC) supported the hypothesis of protein synthesis dependence of repair as shown by higher damage rates. A comparable k was obtained in the P-LN and PAB-HN cells, on one hand, and in the PA-LN and PAB-LN cells on the other. Recovery under reduced PAR-only was effective in all the treatments but with lower time constants in PA-LN and PAB-LN than in P-LN and PAB-HN. More significant differences were found between algae in HN-cells than in LN-cells. From the results, it is hypothesized that low nitrogen availability may not affect the repair rate due to impairment of nitrogen uptake mechanisms, whereas it may reduce the recovery capacity under benign conditions.",

    "abstract": "In African trypanosomiasis the host-derived cytokine interferon-y (IFN-y) has been identified as a potent growth promoter of the causative agent Trypanosoma brucei brucei (T.b.b.). The mechanism of growth promotion involves activation of tyrosine protein kinases (TPKs). In the present study, it is shown that in contrast to the situation in multicellular eukaryotic organisms, IFN-γ-stimulated TPKs in T.b.b. do not activate transcription factors (TFs) of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) family, but they activate the TF AP-1, and transcription regulating factors, which bind to E74 (ETS-like proteins) and to hSIE (STAT-like proteins), respectively. Prolonged activation of the transcription regulating factors was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) of IFN-y stimulated T.b.b. In addition, c-fos, a component of the transcription factor AP-1, was detected immunocytochemically and by SDS-PAGE with subsequent Western blotting after IFN-y stimulation of the trypanosomes. The findings support the reported growth enhancing properties of IFN-y on trypanosomes and for the first time identify transcription regulating factors, which may be selectively involved in IFN-γ- dependent responses of protozoa.",

    "abstract": "Summary. Myosin VI is an unusual actin-based motor protein moving, unlike other known myosins, towards minus end of actin filaments. This implies a unique role of this protein in cell migration and intracellular transport. There are serious concerns whether my osin VI heavy chains may dimerize as its amino acid sequence contains heptad repeats responsible for dimerization but both native and recombi nant myosins VI were found to be monomeric proteins. Recently, we have detected 130-kDa myosin VI immunoanalogue in Amoeba proteus that also exhibits many features characteristic for mammalian myosins VI (Dominik et al. 2005). It seemed interesting to check whether it is a monomeric or dimeric protein. Using a zero-length crosslinker, N-ethyl-N’-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC), we have s hown that under our experimental conditions the 130-kDa band corresponding to myosin VI immunoanalogue disappeared with the concomit ant accumulation of about 260-kDa protein band. Similar results have been obtained when the coiled-coil skeletal muscle myosin rod was subjected to the EDC-crosslinking. These data indicate that the heavy chains of A. proteus myosin VI immunoanalogue may form dimers. These results also suggest that in vivo myosin VI immunoanalogue may play a role of an active transporter that requires dimerization and processivity.",

Recently, we have shown that blocking amoeba endogenous Rac-and Rho-like proteins led to the distinct and irreversible changes in the behaviour of these large locomoting cells and to a significant inhibition of their locomotion. To further elucidate the mechanism of Rho pathway, we tested the effect of introduction of active recombinant human RhoA and Rac1 proteins on amoebae cells. While the degree of the inhibition of migration of cells treated with both proteins seems to be similar to cells microinjected with anti-RhoA and anti-Rac1 antibodies, there are distinct differences in cell behaviour and morphology when compared with the blocked phenotypes. The results indicate the important and complex role of Rho-family proteins in amoebae migration.",

    "abstract": "Here we summarize the results from 10 cruises in the Chukchi Sea, in August, each year from 2011 to 2020.Samples for the qualitative analysis of the microzooplankton were obtained from stations located across the Chukchi Sea using a 20µm plankton net.Conditions encountered, in terms of sea ice coverage and chlorophyll concentrations, varied widely from year to year without any obvious relationship with the composition of the microzooplankton assemblage.Examining a total of 242 samples gathered, we found a total of 44 tintinnid species (morphologically distinct forms).Plotting cumulative number of tintinnid species encountered vs cumulative number of samplings gave a typical species accumulation curve showing no sign of saturation suggesting that continued sampling in the Chukchi Sea will likely yield increases in the tintinnid species catalogue.The tintinnid species found ranged widely in lorica opening diameters (LOD) from about 11 µm to 80 µm in diameter.However, the median size of the LOD of the tintinnid assemblages varied little from year to year ranging only from about 30 µm to 40 µm.Most of the forms encountered were found in samples from only 1 or 2 cruises.Very few forms were found every year throughout the 10 years of sampling.These were 5 species of tintinnids (Acanthostomella norvegica, Leprotintinnus pellucidus, Pytchocylis obtusa, Salpingella acuminata, Salpingella faurei) and the nasselarian radiolarian Amphimelissa setosa.Examples of the morphological variability observed among individuals of Acanthostomella norvegica and Pytchocylis obtusa within single samples are shown with some individuals easily confused with forms described as other species are shown.To our knowledge, our data are the most extensive data set on Chukchi Sea microplankton.We provide all of the data recorded, which may serve as a baseline from which to assess changes projected in Arctic Sea systems, in a supplementary data file.",

    "abstract": "Marshes bordering rivers and estuaries are productive ecosystems that interact dynamically with the adjacent water mass. This is a multi-year study (2019–2022) of seasonal changes in the density of naked amoebae in monthly samples from the surface water of the Hudson estuary near Piermont, N. Y. with relationships to key environmental variables (surface water temperature, salinity, Secchi depth representing turbidity, and enterococcus bacterial counts). During the colder months (November to March), when decayed leaves and litter from the deciduous marsh grass produced organic matter in the sediment surface, the mean abundance of active amoebae ± standard error of the mean (SEM) was higher (3.07 ± 0.99 × 10⁴/ L, N = 7). In warmer months (May to September) the abundance of amoebae was lower (1.35 ± 0.29 × 10⁴ / L, N = 10). A multivariate linear regression analysis was performed relating amoeba abundance to four major water mass variables, resulting in the following statistically significant equation (p = 0.03): AD = 0.121 × T + 0.301 × L – 0.047 × S + 0.359 × C, where: AD = active amoebae density (× 10 /L), T = temperature ( C), L = tide level (m), S = Secchi disc depth (cm) and C = bacterial enterococcus concentration (number/ml). In general, given the increasing evidence of the potential importance of amoeboid protists in aquatic ecosystems, further research is warranted on their role in food webs and the carbon biogeochemical cycle within heterotrophic estuarine and coastal waters.",

Canonical elements required for selenoprotein production have been identified in members of the kinetoplastid group supporting the existence of a complete selenocysteine synthesis pathway in these organisms. Currently, nothing is known regarding the selenocysteine pathway in Trypanosoma evansi. In this study, we identified the expression of the elements selB, selC, selD, PSTK and selTRYP at the mRNA level in T. evansi. All translated proteins (selD, PSTK, selTRYP and selB) have the domains predicted and higher identity with Trypanosoma brucei. gambiense. The selenophosphate synthetase protein was localized in the cytoplasm. Our results support the existence of an active selenocysteine pathway in T. evansi.",
