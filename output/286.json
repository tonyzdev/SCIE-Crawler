    "abstract": "Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease is a small-vessel vasculitis involving the kidneys (∼90%) and the lungs (∼60%). Antibodies against the glomerular basement membrane are directly pathogenic in anti-glomerular basement membrane disease; however, recent research has highlighted the critical role of T cells. Novel autoantigens within the glomerular basement membrane are also now recognized. Atypical forms of the disease are reported along with preceding triggers, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, and vaccines. Kidney outcomes in anti-glomerular basement membrane disease remain poor despite significant improvement in patient survival in the last 2 to 3 decades. Treatment typically relies on combined plasmapheresis with intensive immunosuppression. Dialysis dependency at presentation is a dominant predictor of kidney outcome. Histologically, a low (<10%) percentage of normal glomeruli, 100% crescents, together with dialysis dependency at presentation, is associated with poor kidney outcomes. In such cases, an individualized approach weighing the risks and benefits of treatment is recommended. There is a need for better ways to stop the toxic inflammatory activity associated with this disease. In this narrative review, we discuss recent updates on the pathogenesis and management of anti-glomerular basement membrane disease relevant to patients of all ages.",

    "abstract": "Acid-base homeostasis is critical to the maintenance of normal health. The kidneys have a central role in bicarbonate generation, which occurs through the process of net acid excretion. Renal ammonia excretion is the predominant component of renal net acid excretion under basal conditions and in response to acid-base disturbances. Ammonia produced in the kidney is selectively transported into the urine or the renal vein. The amount of ammonia produced by the kidney that is excreted in the urine varies dramatically in response to physiological stimuli. Recent studies have advanced our understanding of ammonia metabolism's molecular mechanisms and regulation. Ammonia transport has been advanced by recognizing that the specific transport of NH3 and NH4+ by specific membrane proteins is critical to ammonia transport. Other studies show that proximal tubule protein, NBCe1, specifically the A variant, significantly regulates renal ammonia metabolism. This review discusses these critical aspects of the emerging features of ammonia metabolism and transport.",

While pediatricians have long approached care delivery with a family-centered lens, PFE may be a less familiar concept to situate among related concepts such as shared decision-making, self-efficacy, patient activation, and family-centered care. Children with CKD and their families indicate a need and desire for enhanced PFE efforts in pediatric nephrology. Improving PFE offers the opportunity to provide our patients and families with skills that will positively impact their health and wellness throughout their lives. In this review, we define PFE, describe the components of and levels at which PFE occurs across the health care system, examine PFE interventions of promise, and finally suggest future directions to support PFE in pediatric nephrology.",

    "abstract": "The concept of structural kidney damage and renal dysfunction as a result of jaundice attracted attention in the medical community in the early and mid-20th century. The postulated doctrine of the time was that the excretion of elevated concentrations of bile results in bile-stained casts occupying collecting and distal convoluted tubules, degeneration of tubular epithelium, and decreased renal function. Compared to the hepatorenal syndrome, the poster child of hepatology and nephrology collaboration, the notion of structural kidney damage and renal dysfunction as a result of cholemia lost its traction and has almost disappeared from modern textbooks. Today, cholemic nephropathy is experiencing a renaissance, with multiple case reports and case series of jaundiced patients with kidney dysfunction and evidence of bile acid casts upon histologic examination. Published cases include acute hepatitis, chronic liver injury, cirrhosis, and obstructive etiologies. Diagnosis of cholemic nephropathy is based on histological examination, typically showing intraluminal bile casts predominantly located in the distal tubules. In common bile duct-ligated mice, the histomorphological and functional alterations of cholemic nephropathy mimic those seen in humans. Some argue against the concept of cholemic nephropathy and postulate that bile casts are a secondary phenomenon. What we need are carefully designed trials to establish diagnostic criteria and subsequently translate this knowledge into evidence-based therapies.",

    "abstract": "Omics applications in nephrology may have relevance in the future to improve clinical care of kidney disease patients. In a short term, patients will benefit from specific measurement and computational analyses around biomarkers identified at various omics-levels. In mid term and long term, these approaches will need to be integrated into a holistic representation of the kidney and all its influencing factors for individualized patient care. Research demonstrates robust data to justify the application of omics for better understanding, risk stratification, and individualized treatment of kidney disease patients. Despite these advances in the research setting, there is still a lack of evidence showing the combination of omics technologies with artificial intelligence and its application in clinical diagnostics and care of patients with kidney disease.",

    "abstract": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common inherited kidney disease. It has been associated with a significant physical and psychological burden, leading to a reduced quality of life. The purpose of this literature review is to summarize the patient perspective on ADPKD based on the current published literature. A systematic literature review was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Publications reporting a patient or caregiver/relative perspective of ADPKD were included. Sources searched included Medline (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from inception to April 2022. This was followed by a subsequent reference and citation search. A total of 1011 articles were identified by the search process, with 28 studies included in the review. An inductive thematic analysis identified six key themes: diagnosis, monitoring, and screening; symptoms; lifestyle and dietary interventions; psychological, physical, and social impact; future planning; and interaction with the health care system. The findings of this review highlight the burden and uncertainty associated with ADPKD from a patient's perspective. This impacts patients and their caregivers/relatives at each stage of the patient's journey from screening to initiation of renal replacement therapy and future planning.",

Conventionally done manually, the process may sometimes be time-consuming and prone to interobserver variability. Image classification and segmentation by deep learning strategies, predominantly convolutional neural networks, may provide a significant advance in the diagnostic process. In renal medicine, most evidence has been generated around the radiological assessment of renal abnormalities and histological analysis of renal biopsy specimens' segmentation. In this article, the basic principles of image analysis by convolutional neural networks, brief descriptions of convolutional neural networks, and their system architecture for image analysis are discussed, in combination with examples regarding their use in image analysis in nephrology.",

    "abstract": "Kidney failure, defined as end-stage kidney disease requiring kidney replacement therapy, is a public health concern that disproportionately affects indigenous peoples around the world. Despite advancements in medical technologies and preventive public health interventions in kidney care, indigenous peoples continue to face significant barriers that limit their access to care. These barriers include limited availability of kidney care services in remote areas, cultural and language obstacles, systemic racism, low health literacy, geographic isolation, and mistrust in health care systems. Such challenges contribute to notable disparities in kidney disease outcomes and kidney replacement therapy access. Previous research in countries such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States demonstrates a disproportionate burden of risk factors, chronic kidney disease, and the consequences of kidney failure and other complications among indigenous peoples. In this review, we explore the global landscape of kidney failure among indigenous populations, examining epidemiological data, barriers to care, and outcomes of kidney replacement therapy. The key objective is to provide a comprehensive overview of disparities in the burden of kidney failure and care inequities experienced by this high-risk population group. We propose culturally sensitive, community-driven solutions to mitigate various inequities. Addressing these issues requires acknowledging and overcoming the unique challenges faced by indigenous communities, including enhancing access to home dialysis and transplantation services and implementing culturally appropriate health care practices.",

    "abstract": "Receipt of dialysis for acute kidney injury is common and increasing. For patients still actively receiving dialysis, it is possible that the dialysis procedure itself decreases the likelihood of kidney recovery or confounds recognition that recovery has occurred. Accordingly, 2 ongoing trials are testing hypotheses that dialysis prescriptions to minimize dialysis-induced ischemia and/or standardize dialysis discontinuation will increase the likelihood of renal recovery compared to usual care. These will be some of the first clinical trials to focus on hospitalized patients during the recovery phase of their acute illness. Meanwhile, clinical trials in the postdischarge population have found that less than 30% of patients choose to enroll when interventions require in-person nephrology follow-up, suggesting more flexible and pragmatic follow-up pathways are needed. Key considerations for future trials in dialysis for acute kidney injury will include recruiting patients at the right time in their clinical course during the window between acute kidney injury development and recovery or death, as well as providing interventions/follow-up over great distances and in multiple care settings. Testing different care strategies in this rigorous manner may eventually help reduce variation in care across centers and identify evidence-based practices that promote kidney recovery in dialysis for acute kidney injury.",

Postdischarge follow-up for AKI survivors is recommended within 90 days of an AKI episode to promote kidney recovery and potentially prevent progression of kidney disease. However, timely postdischarge care is often lacking or fragmented and poses a missed opportunity to prevent long-term complications of this condition. Suggested elements of follow-up care begin with a scheduled appointment with a physician and involve a bundled approach to care with health care providers' communicating across sites, remote patient monitoring devices, review of medications, education, access, kidney care evaluation, and interdisciplinary collaboration to achieve these patient care goals. This article provides an overview of guidance documents for post-AKI care and the roles of the nurse and pharmacist as part of an interdisciplinary team in postdischarge care after a patient incurs an episode of AKI.",

    "abstract": "A case study explores patterns of kidney function decline using unsupervised learning methods first and then associating patterns with clinical outcomes using supervised learning methods. Predicting short-term risk of hospitalization and death prior to renal dialysis initiation may help target high-risk patients for more aggressive management. This study combined clinical data from patients presenting for renal dialysis at Fresenius Medical Care with laboratory data from Quest Diagnostics to identify disease trajectory patterns associated with the 90-day risk of hospitalization and death after beginning renal dialysis. Patients were clustered into 4 groups with varying rates of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline during the 2-year period prior to dialysis. Overall rates of hospitalization and death were 24.9% (582/2341) and 4.6% (108/2341), respectively. Groups with the steepest declines had the highest rates of hospitalization and death within 90 days of dialysis initiation. The rate of eGFR decline is a valuable and readily available tool to stratify short-term (90 days) risk of hospitalization and death after the initiation of renal dialysis. More intense approaches are needed that apply models that identify high risks to potentially avert or reduce short-term hospitalization and death of patients with a severe and rapidly progressive chronic kidney disease.",
