    "abstract": "This is the first quantitative attempt at a global areal definition of 'alpine' and 'montane' terrain by combining geographical information systems for topography with bioclimatic criteria (temperature) subdividing the life zones along elevational gradients. The mountain definition adopted here refrains from any truncation by low elevation thresholds, and defines the world's mountains by a common ruggedness threshold (>200 m difference in elevation within a 2.5′ cell, 0.5′ resolution), arriving at 16.5 Mio km2 or 12.3% of all terrestrial land area outside Antartica being mountains. The model employed accounts for criteria of \"mountainous terrain\" for biological analysis, and thus arrives at a smaller land area fraction than hydrologically oriented approaches, and by its 2.5′ resolution, it includes less unstructured terrain (such as large plateaus, very wide valleys or basins) than earlier approaches. The thermal delineation of the alpine and nival biogeographic region by the climatic tree limit (the lower boundary of the alpine belt) arrives at 2.6% or 3.55 Mio km2 of the global land area outside Antarctica (21.5% of all mountain terrain). Seven climate-defined life zones in mountains facilitate large-scale (global) comparisons of biodiversity information as used in the new electronic 'Mountain Biodiversity Portal' of the Global Mountain Biodiversity Assessment (GMBA).",

    "abstract": "Flower longevity is an adaptive trait, optimized to balance reproductive success against the costs of flower maintenance. The trait is highly plastic in response to pollination success, and numerous studies report increased flower longevity in high elevation environments, where diversity, abundance, and activity of pollinators are low. However, few studies have experimentally investigated how flower longevity varies with pollination intensity within and among populations. We studied flower longevity of six alpine species under three pollination intensity treatments (hand-pollination, natural pollination, pollinator exclusion) at 1600 m vs. 2600 m a.s.l. at the Furka Pass, Central Swiss Alps. We hypothesized, (1) that flower longevity is generally increased in population at high elevation, and (2) that the increase in flower longevity when pollination fails is stronger in populations at high elevation compared to low elevation. Hand-pollination did not decrease flower longevity in any of the studied populations and rarely increased natural seed production suggesting no pollination limitation at both elevations. This was supported by similar pollinator visitation rates, pollinator efficiency, and pollination effectivity. Pollinator exclusion significantly increased flower longevity, but only in populations of three species at low elevation, whereby in all populations of the six species at high elevation, indicating a higher plasticity of flowers in populations at high elevation compared to populations from lower elevation. We suggest that the higher plasticity of flower longevity in alpine populations is of advantage in their unpredictable pollination environment: Increased flower longevity compensates for low pollination in unsuitable periods guaranteeing a minimum reproduction, while the capacity to senescence rapidly after successful pollination saves redundant floral costs in suitable periods.",

    "abstract": "Due to global warming, the worldwide retreat of glaciers is causing changes in species diversity, community composition, and species interactions. However, the impact of glacier retreat on interaction diversity and ecological networks remains poorly understood. An integrative understanding of network dynamics may inform conservation actions that support biodiversity and ecosystem functioning after glacier extinction. Here, we address how glacier retreat affects the frequency, diversity, and complexity of plant–pollinator interactions, both directly and indirectly through biodiversity change. We surveyed flower visitors (pollinators) and analyzed pollination networks across a gradient of 170 years of glacier retreat (Mont Miné glacier, Valais, Switzerland) which ranges from patchy grasslands to closed forests. We reported a strong impact of glacier retreat on both plant and pollinator communities. Notably, the diversity of plant–pollinator interactions was sharply affected by glacier retreat: interaction diversity increased few years after glacier retreat, but it ultimately decreased in late stages dominated by forests. In contrast, we found that plant–pollinator network complexity did not change with glacier retreat. Our results indicate that the development of plant–pollinator networks is a two-phases process. In the first phase, glacier retreat makes space to plant colonization. This initial increase in plant diversity drives the increase in pollinator and interaction diversity. The second phase is characterized by turnover as woody species encroaches and dominates the community, decreasing the diversity of plant species in ultimate instance. The local decrease of plant diversity leads to a local decrease in pollinator and interaction diversity. Slowing down woody encroachment and enhancing flower diversity, which is initially supported by the glacial landscape, may be key strategies for halting the erosion of ecological networks while increasing biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Our research thus can help resolve the overarching question of how to conserve ecosystems once glaciers are extinct, pointing toward a composite role of both habitat structure and biological functions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract There is wide consensus that climate change will seriously impact flowering plants and their pollinators. Shifts in flowering phenology and insect emergence as well as changes in the functional traits involved can cause alterations in plant-pollinator interactions, pollination success and plant reproductive output. Effects of rising temperatures, advanced snowmelt and altered precipitation patterns are expected to be particularly severe in alpine habitats due to the constrained season and upper range margins. Yet, our understanding of the magnitude and consequences of such changes in life history events and functional diversity in high elevation environments is incomplete. This special issue collects novel insights into the effects of climate change on plant-pollinator interactions in individual plant species and on network structure of entire plant and pollinator communities in alpine ecosystems. Using simulated changes of earlier snowmelt, natural gradients of variation in temperature, precipitation and snowmelt, or a long-term monitoring approach, these studies illustrate how plant species, plant communities, and pollinators respond to variation in environmental conditions associated with scenarios of ongoing climate change. The collection of papers presented here clearly demonstrates how spatial or temporal variation in the environmental climatic context affects flower abundances and plant community composition, and the consequences of these changes for pollinator visitation, pollination network structure, pollen transfer dynamics, or seed production. As changes in the availability of flowers, fruits, and seeds are likely to impact on other trophic levels, the time is ripe and pressing for a holistic multitrophic view of the effects of climate change on biotic interactions in alpine ecological communities.",

A lack of rainfall (ca. 550 mm at high elevations) cannot explain the absence of trees. Hence, it is an open question, which parts of these mountains belong to the alpine belt. Here we use bioclimatic data to estimate the position of the potential climatic treeline, and thus, define bioclimatologically, what is alpine and what is not. We employed the same miniature data loggers and protocol that had been applied in a Europe-wide assessment of alpine climates and a global survey of treeline temperatures. The data suggest a potential treeline position at ca. 3300 m a.s.l., that is ca. 900 m above the upper edge of the current oak forest, or 450 m above its highest outposts. The alpine terrain above the climatic treeline position shows a temperature regime comparable to sites in the European Alps. At the upper limit of angiosperm life, at 4850 m a.s.l., the growing season lasted 63 days with a seasonal mean root zone temperature of 4.5 °C. We conclude that (1) the absence of trees below 2850 m a.s.l. is clearly due to millennia of land use. The absence of trees between 2850 and 3300 m a.s.l. is either due to the absence of suitable tree taxa, or the only potential regional taxon for those elevations, Juniperus excelsa, had been eradicated by land use as well. (2) These continental mountains provide thermal life conditions in the alpine belt similar to other temperate mountains. (3) Topography and snow melt regimes play a significant role for the structure of the alpine vegetation mosaics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Climate change impacts are of a particular concern in small mountain ranges, where cold-adapted plant species have their optimum zone in the upper bioclimatic belts. This is commonly the case in Mediterranean mountains, which often harbour high numbers of endemic species, enhancing the risk of biodiversity losses. This study deals with shifts in vascular plant diversity in the upper zones of the Sierra Nevada, Spain, in relation with climatic parameters during the past two decades. We used vegetation data from permanent plots of three surveys of two GLORIA study regions, spanning a period of 18 years (2001–2019); ERA5 temperature and precipitation data; and snow cover durations, derived from on-site soil temperature data. Relationships between diversity patterns and climate factors were analysed using GLMMs. Species richness showed a decline between 2001 and 2008, and increased thereafter. Species cover increased slightly but significantly, although not for endemic species. While endemics underwent cover losses proportional to non-endemics, more widespread shrub species increased. Precipitation tended to increase during the last decade, after a downward trend since 1960. Precipitation was positively related to species richness, colonisation events, and cover, and negatively to disappearance events. Longer snow cover duration and rising temperatures were also related to increasing species numbers, but not to cover changes. The rapid biotic responses of Mediterranean alpine plants indicate a tight synchronisation with climate fluctuations, especially with water availability. Thus, it rather confirms concerns about biodiversity losses, if projections of increasing temperature in combination with decreasing precipitation hold true.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Alpine plants complete their seasonal phenological cycle during two to three snow-free months. Under climate change, snowmelt advances and the risk of summer droughts increases. Yet, photoperiodism may prevent alpine plants from benefiting from an earlier start of the growing season. To identify the drivers of flowering phenology in the seven main species of an alpine grassland, we experimentally shifted the snowmelt date through snow manipulations, and excluded precipitation during summer. With “time-to-event” models, we analysed the beginning of main flowering with respect to temperature sums, time after snowmelt, and calendar day (photoperiod). We identified two phenology types: four species tracking snowmelt dates directly or with a certain lag set by temperature sums, including the dominant sedge Carex curvula , Anthoxanthum alpinum Helictotrichon versicolor , and Trifolium alpinum , and three species tracking photoperiod: Geum montanum , Leontodon helveticus and Potentilla aurea . Photoperiodism did not act as daylength threshold but rather modulated the thermal sums at flowering. Hence, photoperiod delayed flowering after earlier snowmelt. The grass A. alpinum was the only one of seven species that clearly responded to drought by earlier and longer flowering. The remarkably high importance of snowmelt dates for both phenology types suggests an earlier onset of flowering in a warmer climate, particularly for non-photoperiod-sensitive species, with an increasing risk for freezing damages and potential disruptions of biotic interactions in the most frequent type of alpine grassland across the Alps. Consequentially, the distinct microclimate and species-specific responses to photoperiod challenge temperature-only based projections of climate warming effects on alpine plant species.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The monumental work of Olov Hedberg provided deep insights into the spectacular and fragmented tropical alpine flora of the African sky islands. Here we review recent molecular and niche modelling studies and re-examine Hedberg’s hypotheses and conclusions. Colonisation started when mountain uplift established the harsh diurnal climate with nightly frosts, accelerated throughout the last 5 Myr (Plio-Pleistocene), and resulted in a flora rich in local endemics. Recruitment was dominated by long-distance dispersals (LDDs) from seasonally cold, remote areas, mainly in Eurasia. Colonisation was only rarely followed by substantial diversification. Instead, most of the larger genera and even species colonised the afroalpine habitat multiple times independently. Conspicuous parallel evolution occurred among mountains, e.g., of gigantism in Lobelia and Dendrosenecio and dwarf shrubs in Alchemilla . Although the alpine habitat was ~ 8 times larger and the treeline was ~ 1000 m lower than today during the Last Glacial Maximum, genetic data suggest that the flora was shaped by strong intermountain isolation interrupted by rare LDDs rather than ecological connectivity. The new evidence points to a much younger and more dynamic island scenario than envisioned by Hedberg: the afroalpine flora is unsaturated and fragile, it was repeatedly disrupted by the Pleistocene climate oscillations, and it harbours taxonomic and genetic diversity that is unique but severely depauperated by frequent bottlenecks and cycles of colonisation, extinction, and recolonisation. The level of intrapopulation genetic variation is alarmingly low, and many afroalpine species may be vulnerable to extinction because of climate warming and increasing human impact.",

It has long been noticed that the distribution of endemics across the Alps is very uneven. While most endemics are found along the southern edge of the Alps, with some also on its western, eastern, and northeastern edges, the northern edge of the Alps more or less between Lake Geneva in the west and Lake Traun in the east harbours almost no endemics. The distribution of endemics in the Alps has often been related to the location of glacial refugia. Accordingly, the virtual absence of endemics from the northern edge of the Alps has been explained with the unsuitability of climatic conditions for glacial survival of alpine plants there. After discussing evidence for the existence of glacial refugia for alpine species along the northern edge of the Alps and north of the Alps, I will examine how these refugia differed from refugia along the southern edge of the Alps. I conclude that the uneven distribution of endemics in the Alps is best explained by the different climate through time north and south of the Alps. These climatic differences affected the spatial structure and extent of refugia, the length of isolation of refugial populations, and selective conditions in refugia.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The largest alpine–nival vegetation permanent plot site in the Alps, the GLORIA mastersite Schrankogel (Tirol, Austria), provided evidence of warming-driven vegetation changes already 10 years after its establishment in 1994. Another decade later, in 2014, substantial compositional changes with increasing ratios of warmth-demanding to cold-adapted species have been found. The current study deals with species-specific responses involved in an ongoing vegetation transformation across the alpine–nival ecotone on Schrankogel by using presence/absence as well as cover data from permanent plots, situated between 2900 and 3400 masl. The number of occupied plots per species remained constant or even increased during the first decade, whereas disappearance events became more frequent during the second one, especially for cold-adapted specialists (subnival–nival species). Remarkably, the latter was accompanied by continued strong losses in cover of all subnival–nival species. These losses were more frequent in plots with a more thermophilous species composition, suggesting an increasing maladaptation of subnival–nival species to warmer habitat conditions and a successive trailing-edge decline. Several species with a distribution centre at lower elevations (alpine–subnival) markedly increased in cover, comparatively more so in colder plots, indicating a leading-edge expansion. Moreover, our findings show an increase in occupied plots and cover of almost all snowbed species, suggesting that areas previously with a too long snowpack period are now becoming suitable snowbed habitats. Vegetation gaps arising from population dieback of cold-adapted species, however, could only be partly filled by advancing species, indicating that species declines have occurred already before the onset of strong competition pressure.",

Most research has focused on FFD whereas LFD, FD and second flowering events were neglected although they are crucial events. To assess whether flowering patterns change species-specifically with changing abiotic conditions and whether these are related to leaf persistence, reproduction and pollination syndrome, we monitored flowering phenology (including also second flowering events) of 29 herbaceous species along two elevational gradients ranging from 700 to 1800 m a.s.l. in two consecutive years. FFD was delayed with increasing elevation. LFD followed two alternative strategies: species which ceased flowering early in the season delayed LFD with increasing elevation, species which ceased flowering late did not change LFD. FD decreased with increasing elevation in most species. The timing of flowering phenology had strong influences on the intensity of change along the elevational gradient and other stages of flowering phenology. Many species showed a second flowering event which occurred irrespective of elevation, suggesting a link to unsuccessful pollination rather than temperature. Life history strategies helped explain patterns of flowering phenology and a species’ ability to track changes in abiotic conditions, e.g. evergreen species started to flower earlier than summer green species and insect-pollinated species were able to expand FD most. These findings give insight into species-specific changes in phenological patterns and thus plant performance with changing environment. They should be considered when assessing the consequences of environmental change at both the community and ecosystem level.",

Moderate shrub encroachment is perceived beneficial for plant diversity by adding new species without outcompeting existing ones, yet systematic evidence is missing. We surveyed vegetation along 24 transects from open pasture into shrubland across the Swiss Alps using a new protocol distinguishing different spatial scales, shrub cover of each plot (2 × 2 m) and larger-scale zonal cover along the transect. Data were analysed using generalized linear models of shrub cover, shrub species and environmental conditions, such as geology, aspect or soil. Most shrub communities were dominated by Alnus viridis (62% of transects) and Pinus mugo (25%), and the rest by other shrub species (13%). These dominant shrub species explained vegetation response to shrub cover well, without need of environmental variables in the model. Compared to open pasture, A. viridis resulted in an immediate linear decline in plant species richness and a marginal increase in beta-diversity (maximally + 10% at 35% cover). Dense A. viridis hosted 62% less species than open pasture. In P. mugo, species richness remained stable until 40% shrub cover and dropped thereafter; beta-diversity peaked at 35% cover. Hence, scattered P. mugo increases beta-diversity without impairing species richness. In transects dominated by other shrubs, species richness and beta-diversity peaked at 40–60% shrub cover (+ 23% both). A. viridis reduced species richness in a larger area around the shrubs than P. mugo . Therefore, effects of shrub encroachment on plant diversity cannot be generalized and depend on dominant shrub species.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The main, continuous mountain range of the European Alpine System (i.e., the Alps) hosts a diversified pool of species whose evolution has long been investigated. The legacy of past climate changes on the distribution of high-elevation plants as well as taxa differentially adapted to the mosaic of edaphic conditions (i.e., surmised ecotypes on calcareous, siliceous, serpentine bedrocks) and the origin of new species are here discussed based on available evidence from endemic taxa across the Alps. The integration of main spatial and ecological patterns within and among species supports speciation driven by spatial isolation in main glacial refugia where plant populations survived during cold phases and hindered by intense gene flow along main expansion pathways during warm phases. Despite patterns of genetic differentiation matching environmental heterogeneity, processes underlying the dynamics of distribution ranges likely promoted recurrent homogenization of incipient divergence and generally hindered the completion of speciation (except for cases of hybrid speciation). Even intense selective pressures on toxic bedrocks such as serpentine seemingly fail to support the completion of speciation. Accordingly, typical scenarios of ecological speciation whereby local adaptation to environmental heterogeneity initiates and supports long-term reduction of gene flow may rarely be at the origin of stable species in the Alps. Although consistent with neutral processes whereby spatial isolation driven by past climate changes promoted reproductive isolation and yielded limited diversification, mechanisms at the origin of new species across heterogeneous landscapes of the Alps remain insufficiently known. Necessary advances to reliably understand the evolution of biodiversity in the Alps and identify possible museums or cradles of variation in face of climate changes are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Understanding alpine plants’ growth dynamics and responses to warming is essential for predicting climate change impacts on mountain ecosystems. Here, we examine growth determinants in the alpine cushion plant Silene acaulis in the Swiss Alps, exploring ontogeny, elevation, and climate influences. We collected 40 Silene individuals and 159 individuals from 38 co-occurring alpine species across 2200–3130 m elevations in the Swiss Alps, analyzing age and growth histories through annual growth rings. While comparing growth rates, we found that Silene was relatively slow-growing. However, Silene exhibited a dual growth strategy, initially rapid and then slowing after ~ 20 years, challenging perceptions of its longevity. Similar ontogenetic trends were observed in other alpine species, albeit with variations based on species and elevation. The consistent unimodal growth-elevation pattern in Silene and other alpine plants, peaking at ~ 2400 m, underscores shared environmental constraints on alpine plant growth. Additionally, cross-dating growth ring series and correlating with daily climate data enabled the precise assessment of warming impacts on growth. Silene ’s growth is influenced by year-to-year climate variability, with warming-induced moisture stress and overheating during spring and summer adversely affecting its growth. Despite being low-statured, Silene is not completely decoupled from atmospheric influences. The heat-trapping function of Silene , effective in mature and well-formed cushions, makes it susceptible to adverse effects as temperatures rise. This sensitivity raises concerns about the potential dieback of Silene cushions, as witnessed during recent heatwaves, and emphasizes the broader ecological implications for alpine ecosystems, given Silene ’s role as a crucial nurse plant.",

We found that the pollen was dispersed over short distances (mean = 3.16 m), with a dispersal kernel following a Weibull distribution. Nonetheless, spatial genetic structure was weak in the population ( Sp statistic = 0.013), pointing to effective seed dispersal and/or high inbreeding depression. The pollen dispersal distance was independent of the gender of the flower of origin but depended positively on floral stalk height and negatively on flowering date and tepal length. Although male siring success did not correlate with pollen dispersal distance, selection may favour traits that increase the pollen dispersal distance as a result of reduced bi-parental inbreeding. Our study not only provides new insights into the nature of pollen dispersal of alpine plants, but also reveals the effects of floral traits on a component of male reproductive success.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Due to habitat fragmentation and climate change, many plant populations become smaller and more isolated and thus more prone to local extinction. Whereas it is well established for lowland species that plants of small populations have lower individual fitness, alpine species have not been sufficiently studied in this respect. It is also not clear whether relationships between population size and fitness vary between naturally rare and common species. We assessed how population size and rarity affect seed set, seed mass, seed number, total seed mass per fruit, germination, time to germination, offspring survival and offspring size in four congeneric alpine plant species pairs ( Androsace chamaejasme Wulfen, A. puberula Jord. &amp; Fourr., Primulaceae ; Gentiana acaulis L., G. alpina Vill., Gentianaceae ; Potentilla crantzii (Crantz) Fritsch, P. nivea L., Rosaceae ; Viola calcarata L., V. lutea Huds., Violaceae ). Across all eight species, plants from smaller populations produced fewer seeds and had lower total seed mass per fruit than plants from larger populations. This demonstrates that population size also affects fitness in alpine species. Rare species did not have lower individual fitness than common species. Therefore, naturally rare species might be well adapted to their environment. Relationships between population size and fitness were equally pronounced in rare and common species. We conclude that plant fitness is reduced in small populations in alpine species, also in common species.",

    "abstract": "Alpine plant communities are being subject to climate change, resulting in the need for plants to adapt to new conditions. In this study, we investigated changes in vascular plant diversity along a coast-inland gradient in central Norway. At four different mountains, species were registered in 100 m2 plots, laid out from the forest line to the summit. In addition, plots were grouped into snow cover duration (short, medium, and long) and aspect (North, South, East, and West). We documented richness and spatial turnover of species and functional groups (trees and tall shrubs, dwarf shrubs, herbs, graminoids, and seedless plants) along the different gradients using glm and RDA. Thereafter, we included variables from climate scenario models in the derived glm's to estimate how species richness and the distribution of these groups could be impacted by future climate change. Our results show that there are significant changes in species and functional groups along the regional gradient. Further, also local variation due to altitude and snow cover duration influenced species distribution and composition. Predictions of future vegetation showed an increase in species richness compared to present, with most changes occurring in areas of long and medium snow cover duration. We predicted the main changes to occur at lower altitudes. Here, dwarf shrubs and graminoids were expected to increase the most in number of species, whereas species of trees and tall shrubs were expected to increase the most in proportion.",

    "abstract": "The functional diversity and composition of plant traits within communities are tightly linked to important ecosystem functions and processes. Whereas vegetative traits reflecting adaptations to environmental conditions are commonly assessed in community ecology, floral traits are often neglected despite their importance for the plants' life cycle. The consideration of floral traits covers important aspects such as sexual plant reproduction and pollinator diversity, which remain unobserved in studies focussing on vegetative traits only. To test whether vegetative and floral traits differ in their responses to elevation, we measured morphological and chemical traits of plant species occurring in pastures at seven elevations in the Austrian Alps. Variation in functional composition was examined using the concept of n-dimensional hypervolumes and vector analysis. Our data show that vegetative and floral traits vary differently with the elevational gradient. Whereas vegetative traits changed in a predictable manner with elevation, floral traits did not specifically respond to elevation. Overall variation in vegetative traits mainly resulted from phenotypical differences between plants in different elevations, whereas total variation in floral traits was a result from a high variation within communities. The assessment of functional changes in vegetative and floral traits along mountain slopes thus reveals different patterns in plant responses to elevation and may help to generate testable hypotheses on functional responses to current climate warming.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The inner-alpine dry valleys of the Swiss Alps are characterized by subcontinental climate, leading to many peculiarities in dry grassland species composition. Despite their well-known uniqueness, comprehensive studies on biodiversity patterns of the dry grasslands in these valleys were still missing. To close this gap, we sampled 161 10-m 2 vegetation plots in the Rhône, Rhine and Inn valleys, recording vascular plants, terricolous bryophyte and lichen species, as well as environmental data. Additionally, we tested the scale-dependence of environmental drivers using 34 nested-plot series with seven grain sizes (0.0001–100 m 2 ). We analysed the effects of environmental drivers related to productivity/stress, disturbance and within-plot heterogeneity on species richness. Mean species richness ranged from 2.3 species in 0.0001 m 2 to 58.8 species in 100 m 2 . For all taxa combined, the most relevant drivers at the grain size of 10 m 2 were southing (negative), litter (negative), mean annual precipitation (unimodal), gravel cover (negative), inclination (unimodal) and mean annual precipitation (unimodal). For vascular plants the pattern was similar, while bryophyte and lichen richness differed by the opposite relationship to mean annual precipitation as well as negative influences of mean herb layer height, grazing and mowing. The explained variance of the multiple regression model increased with grain size, with very low values for the smallest two grain sizes. While southing and litter had high importance for the fiver larger grain sizes, pH and gravel cover were particularly important at the intermediate grain sizes, and inclination and mean annual precipitation for the two largest grain sizes. The findings emphasize the importance of taxonomic group and grain size for patterns and drivers of species richness in vegetation, consistent with ecological theory. Differences in the diversity–environment relationships among the three taxonomic groups can partly be explained by asymmetric competition that leads to low bryophyte and lichen diversity where vascular plants do well and vice versa. The relatively low alpha diversity of vascular plants in dry grasslands in Swiss inner-alpine valleys compared to similar communities in other parts of the Palaearctic remains puzzling, especially because Swiss stands are often large and well-preserved.",

The micro-coring-based analysis of seasonal tree ring formation included double-staining microtome cross sections for lignification, but these data had not been included in the publication. In this short communication, we complement these data, collected in 2009 at the Swiss treeline, and we show that a 3 K cooling that corresponds to a 500–600 m higher elevation, had no influence on lignification. However, when a frost event occurred during the early part of ring formation, the 3 K cooling produced a blue (non-lignified) layer of cells, followed by normally lignified cells for the rest of the season. Hence, the event did not affect the cambium, but interrupted cell wall maturation in cells that were in a critical developmental stage. We conclude, that chronic cooling does not affect lignification at treeline, but it increases the risk of frost damage in premature xylem tissue.",

    "abstract": "Abstract While climatic research about treeline has a long history, the climatic conditions corresponding to the upper limit of closed alpine grasslands remain poorly understood. Here, we propose a climatic definition for this limit, the ‘grassline’, in analogy to the treeline, which is based on the growing season length and the soil temperature. Eighty-seven mountain summits across ten European mountain ranges, covering three biomes (boreal, temperate, Mediterranean), were inventoried as part of the GLORIA project. Vascular plant cover was estimated visually in 326 plots of 1 × 1 m. Soil temperatures were measured in situ for 2–7 years, from which the length of the growing season and mean temperature were derived. The climatic conditions corresponding to 40% plant cover were defined as the thresholds for alpine grassland. Closed vegetation was present in locations with a mean growing season soil temperature warmer than 4.9 °C, or a minimal growing season length of 85 days, with the growing season defined as encompassing days with daily mean ≥ 1 °C. Hence, the upper limit of closed grasslands was associated with a mean soil temperature close to that previously observed at the treeline, and in accordance with physiological thresholds to growth in vascular plants. In contrast to trees, whose canopy temperature is coupled with air temperature, small-stature alpine plants benefit from the soil warmed by solar radiation and consequently, they can grow at higher elevations. Since substrate stability is necessary for grasslands to occur at their climatic limit, the grassline rarely appears as a distinct linear feature.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Elevational gradients in alpine ecosystems are well suited to study how plant and pollinator communities respond to climate change. In the Austrian Alps, we tested how the taxonomic and functional diversity of plants and their pollinators change with increasing elevation and how this affects plant–pollinator network structure. We measured the phenotypes of flowering plants and their pollinators and observed their interactions in 24 communities along an elevational gradient. To assess variation in floral and pollinator traits, we then quantified trait spaces ( n -dimensional hypervolumes) occupied by flowers and pollinators in each community. To assess plant–pollinator network structure, we quantified the levels of complementary specialization (H 2 ’), modularity and nestedness (weighted NODF) for each community. As elevation increased, most measures of diversity and network specialization either declined linearly or in an oscillating manner. Communities that exhibited higher pollinator functional diversity exhibited larger degrees of complementary specialization and modularity; and communities with greater floral and pollinator functional diversity and higher phylogenetic diversity were less nested. Altogether, the degree to which elevation, species diversity, functional diversity and network structure changed in conjunction suggests environmental effects on the functional and phylogenetic diversity of plants and pollinators and consequently network structure. Our results suggest that the effects of climate change on plant and pollinator community composition will impact plant–pollinator network structure and potentially pollination services at the community scale.",

    "abstract": "Alpine plants growing along wide elevational gradients experience very different abiotic and biotic conditions across elevations. As a result of genetic differentiation and/or plastic response, conspecific plants growing in high elevations, as compared to low elevations, generally have shorter stems and lower number of flowers, but larger flower size. However, most often, detailed models of elevational variations were not examined. To reveal the pattern of elevational changes in a set of fitness-related morphological traits, tests of linear and unimodal models were performed based on measurements of 1047 Solidago minuta plants collected from 47 sites distributed along a 1000 m elevational gradient in the Tatra Mountains. Nearly all of the investigated floral traits, i.e. inflorescence and flower heads size, and number and size of individual flowers, expressed unimodal relationships with elevation having their maxima in the centre of the elevation range. This pattern suggests the existence of a local optimum with respect to sexual reproduction at the centre of the elevational range. Possible explanations of observed elevational variations are discussed in the context of pollinator selection and the 'resource-cost compromise' hypothesis. Best floral performance in the centre of the elevational range of S. minuta may also support the idea that the favourability of habitat conditions declines from the centre to the margin of the distribution, and species are expected to be more abundant, increase reproduction and perform better in the centre of the range.",

Some refugial areas for the high elevation species have been proposed in the Alps, but whether they could survive on nunataks, is still controversial. Here, the spatial genetic structure in Salix serpillifolia revealed by chloroplast (cpSSR) and nuclear (nSSR) microsatellites was compared with the MaxEnt-modelled geographic distributions under current and past (Last Glacial Maximum) climate conditions. Our results suggest that the genetic pattern of differentiation detected in S. serpillifolia may be explained by the existence of Pleistocene refugia, including nunataks. The geographical patterns of variation obtained from the chloroplast and nuclear markers were not fully congruent. The spatial genetic structure that was based on nSSRs was more homogenous, while the cpSSR-based pattern pointed at strong genetic structure along the Alps. Five populations from the Central Alps had a combination of local and unique cpSSR clusters and admixture of those occurring in the Western and Eastern Alps. These findings may indicate the local survival of small populations of S. serpillifolia that were subsequently populated by new colonists in the postglacial period.",

(Asteraceae) along a 950-m elevation gradient in the Tatra Mountains, Central Europe, with emphasis on floral allocation patterns. Fifteen morphological traits were measured in 200 plants collected in the field from 20 sites then the findings were modelled by elevation using linear mixed-effects models. Plant aboveground biomass and height decreased steadily with increasing elevation; however, the most distinctive feature was the elevational shift in floral allocation patterns. Low-elevation plants had greater numbers of smaller flower heads with a lower overall number of flowers, while high-elevation plants had smaller numbers of bigger flower heads and a greater overall number of flowers. Accordingly, the mean individual flower mass increased significantly with increasing elevation. Interestingly, the width of the outer ligulate flowers also increased considerably with increasing elevation, increasing the fill of the overall circumference of the flower head. Results of this study confirmed that elevation is an important ecological gradient driving variation in vegetative and floral traits of S. subalpinus . Possible causes of the observed variations are subsequently discussed, including the varying effects of both abiotic and biotic factors with elevation gradients.",

This is also the case for the Irano-Anatolian global biodiversity hotspot in South-West Asia, which is a mountainous area harbouring a high amount of endemic species. Using two quantitative approaches, Endemicity Analysis and Network-Clustering, we want to identify areas of concordant species distribution patterns in the alpine zone of this region as well as to test the hypothesis that, given the high proportion of endemics among alpine species, delimitation of these areas is determined mainly by endemic alpine species, i.e., areas of concordant species distribution patterns are congruent with areas of endemism. Endemicity Analysis identified six areas of concordant species distribution patterns irrespective of dataset (total alpine species versus endemic alpine species), whereas the Network-Clustering approach identified five and four Bioregions from total alpine species and endemic alpine species, respectively. Most of these areas have been previously identified using the endemic flora of different elevational zones. The identified units using both methods and both datasets are strongly congruent, proposing that they reveal meaningful distribution patterns. Bioregionalization in the Irano-Anatolian biodiversity hotspot appears to be strongly influenced by the endemic alpine species, a pattern likely to hold in alpine regions outside the Irano-Anatolian hotspot.",

    "abstract": "Climate warming in mountain areas is increasing faster than the global average, threatening alpine plants. Climate affects many traits including seeds, the longevity of which is important for conservation, facilitating genebank storage. Seeds of alpine species are considered short-lived in storage, but their longevity increases when produced under a warmer parental environment. Consequently, with climate warming, seeds of alpine species may have increased fitness and be longer-lived in genebank storage. We assessed seed longevity under artificial ageing in 10 accessions of the arctic-alpine species Viscaria alpina stored under genebank conditions for different time periods over the last 20 years. The seed collection site was in the northern Apennines, where above average warming and variable precipitation has been recorded. The time taken for viability to fall to 50% (p 50) was estimated using probit analysis; correlation and general linear regression were used to investigate the effects of length of time in storage, seed mass and climate under which seeds were produced on seed longevity. p 50 varied between 7.77 and 18.49 days. There was no relationship between length of time in storage or seed mass on seed longevity. p 50 was higher in years with increased temperature and lower precipitation during the growing season, with precipitation having more impact than temperature. The results suggest that seeds of alpine species are suitable for genebank storage, and inter-annual variation in precipitation induces a plastic response in seed longevity. Using genebank stored seeds provides insights into how alpine species may respond to future climate changes and could have implications for genebank storage.",

While cytotype diversity has been extensively studied in angiosperms and ferns, knowledge in homosporous lycophytes remains very limited. Our study addresses this gap, focusing on the homosporous lycophyte Huperzia selago in Central Europe. The genome size of 1330 individuals from 208 populations were assessed via flow cytometry, revealing five distinct cytotypes (2 x , 3 x , 4 x , 5 x , 6 x ). Challenging chromosome counting using gemmae roots yielded average counts of 140 (2 x ), 204 (3 x ), and 262 (4 x ) chromosomes. The hexaploid genome size (29 pg) approached the upper limits reported for lycophytes. Tetraploids were the most abundant (72.7%), while triploids (21.3%) were less common, while the remaining cytotypes comprised less than 5% of the dataset. Geographical separation of cytotypes was not observed. However, uncommon cytotypes were associated with the Alps and triploids also occured in the highest parts of Western Carpathians. Around 27.3% of populations exhibited multiple cytotypes. Except for atypical diploids, spore abortion differed between even (21.8%) and odd ploidies (65.2%). Microcharacter (stoma, spore) proportions did not linearly correspond with increasing ploidy levels. The high ploidy-level diversity and cytotype coexistence in Central European H. selago match the well documented patterns in ferns and angiosperms. These findings provide valuable insights into lycophyte polyploidy, underscoring the necessity for broader geographical sampling and application of molecular studies to elucidate phylogenetic relationships and taxonomic classifications within the genus Huperzia .",

    "abstract": "Abstract Climate change is altering interactions among plants and pollinators. In alpine ecosystems, where snowmelt timing is a key driver of phenology, earlier snowmelt may generate shifts in plant and pollinator phenology that vary across the landscape, potentially disrupting interactions. Here we ask how experimental advancement of snowmelt timing in a topographically heterogeneous alpine-subalpine landscape impacts flowering, insect pollinator visitation, and pathways connecting key predictors of plant-pollinator interaction. Snowmelt was advanced by an average of 13.5 days in three sites via the application of black sand over snow in manipulated plots, which were paired with control plots. For each forb species, we documented flowering onset and counted flowers throughout the season. We also performed pollinator observations to measure visitation rates. The majority (79.3%) of flower visits were made by dipteran insects. We found that plants flowered earlier in advanced snowmelt plots, with the largest advances in later-flowering species, but flowering duration and visitation rate did not differ between advanced snowmelt and control plots. Using piecewise structural equation models, we assessed the interactive effects of topography on snowmelt timing, flowering phenology, floral abundance, and pollinator visitation. We found that these factors interacted to predict visitation rate in control plots. However, in plots with experimentally advanced snowmelt, none of these predictors explained a significant amount of variation in visitation rate, indicating that different predictors are needed to understand the processes that directly influence pollinator visitation to flowers under future climate conditions. Our findings demonstrate that climate change-induced early snowmelt may fundamentally disrupt the predictive relationships among abiotic and biotic drivers of plant-pollinator interactions in subalpine-alpine environments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Plant reproduction in alpine environments is affected by climate both directly through climate impacts on growth and phenology, and indirectly through impacts on the biotic interactions affecting pollination success. These effects can be highly variable in time and space. In this study we investigated how different abiotic and biotic factors influence reproductive investment and success in populations of Ranunculus acris across an alpine landscape over a two-year period. In an alpine area at Finse, southern Norway, we measured reproductive investment (total seed mass) and reproductive success (seed-set rate) in 38 sites differing in temperature (related to elevation) and length of the growing season (related to time of snowmelt). To assess biotic interactions, we measured floral density and pollinator visits and conducted a supplemental pollen experiment. Reproductive investment and success increased with temperature, but only when floral density and/or number of pollinator visits was high, and only in the warmer year (2016). Reproduction in R. acris was pollen-limited in both years, especially at warmer temperature and in sites with early snowmelt. Pollinator visits increased with temperature and with higher floral density, suggesting a shift in relative importance of the biotic factors (from plants to pollinators) in limiting reproduction with increasing temperature. Our study shows that reproductive investment and success in R. acris is affected by climate through the interactive effects of abiotic and biotic processes. These effects vary between years and across the landscape, suggesting a potential for larger-scale buffering of climate change effects in heterogeneous landscapes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Mountains are reservoirs for a tremendous biodiversity which was fostered by a suite of factors acting in concert throughout evolutionary times. These factors can be climatic, geological, or biotic, but the way they combine through time to generate diversity remains unknown. Here, we investigate these factors as correlates of diversification of three closely related sections of Gentiana in the European Alpine System. Based upon phylogenetic approaches coupled with divergence dating and ancestral state reconstructions, we attempted to identify the role of bedrock preferences, chromosome numbers coupled with relative genome sizes estimates, as well as morphological features through time. We also investigated extant climatic preferences using a heavily curated set of occurrence records individually selected for superior precision, and quantified rates of climatic niche evolution in each section. We found that a number of phylogenetic incongruences derail the identification of correlates of diversification, yet a number of patterns persist regardless of the topology considered. All the studied correlates are likely to have contributed to the diversification of Gentiana in Europe, however, their respective importance varied through time and across clades. Chromosomal variation and divergence of climatic preferences appear to correlate with diversification throughout the evolution of European Gentiana (Oligocene to present), whereas shifts in bedrock preferences appear to have been more defining during recent diversification (Pliocene). Overall, a complex interaction among climatic, geological and biotic attributes appear to have supported the diversification of Gentiana across the mountains of Europe, which based upon phylogenetic as well as other evidence, was probably also bolstered by hybridization.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Mesoscale heterogeneity of alpine landscapes generates snowmelt gradients resulting in a distinct vegetation zonation from almost snow-free fellfields to long-lasting snowbeds. Although the vegetative trait variation along such gradients has been intensively studied, little is known about whether and how seed germination is adapted to the variable snowpack duration. Here, we compare the seed germination niches of 18 characteristic plant species occurring in four distinct plant communities (alpine lichen heath— Festuca varia grassland— Geranium - Hedysarum meadow—snowbed) along an alpine snowmelt gradient in the North Caucasus (Russia). In a fully factorial experiment, we tested seed germination responses to temperature (10/2, 14/6, 18/10, 22/14, 26/18 and 30/22 °C) and water potential (0, − 0.2, − 0.4, − 0.6 and − 0.8 MPa) gradients, reflecting the full spectrum of seedling establishment conditions in the study system. Community-specific germination niches were identified by generalised mixed model with Bayesian estimation. Our study revealed that the species from the four focal communities significantly differed in their temperature requirements for germination, whereas soil moisture was found to be a limiting factor for seedling establishment along the entire gradient. The snowbed germination was constrained to comparatively high temperatures above 10 °C, whereas seed germination in alpine lichen heaths occurred under a wide range of experimental conditions. The seed germination patterns of species from Festuca varia grasslands and Geranium - Hedysarum meadows reflected their intermediate position along the snowmelt gradient. We conclude that seed germination niche is affected by the environmental filtering along the snowmelt gradient thus departing from the general alpine germination syndrome.",

    "abstract": "The Alpine landscape is characterized by high spatiotemporal heterogeneity in environmental variables, such as climate and soil characteristics. This may lead to divergent selection pressures across plant populations and to local adaptation. Geum reptans, a widespread high-alpine clonal herb, has been the subject of several studies investigating phenotypic variation in populations across the Swiss Alps, yet so far, there is only little knowledge about local adaptation in this species from reciprocal transplantations across original field sites. Here, we reciprocally transplanted three populations of Geum reptans in the Central Swiss Alps, growing at close or far geographical distance from each other, and compared growth- and reproduction-related traits to investigate patterns of local adaptation. We further measured leaf morphological traits to assess potential selection at field sites, and quantified the relative importance of genetic vs. environmental variation (i.e., phenotypic plasticity) for all traits. Additionally, among and within population genetic differentiation was analyzed using microsatellite markers. Molecular diversity was high within populations, and molecular differentiation increased with geographic distance among populations, suggesting that gene flow is maintained at close range, but decreased with distance. Although extensive phenotypic variation was found across site × population transplant combinations, our study revealed little evidence for local adaptation in G. reptans populations. Plant traits also showed strong plasticity, as revealed by pronounced site effects, yet no direct linear selection was detected on leaf trait values within field sites. We suggest that the glacier forelands studied here, which are representative of the habitat of large G. reptans populations, are too similar in environmental conditions to lead to among population intraspecific differentiation in line with local adaptation. As G. reptans showed a great capacity to respond plastically to environmental conditions, we cautiously advocate that the evolution of phenotypic plasticity might have prevailed over genetic differentiation for the adaptation to the relatively narrow niche of this species.",

Here we report the results of a comparative study on seedling frost-tolerance of nine congeneric species pairs with lowland (0–900 m a.s.l.) and alpine (1800–2700 m a.s.l.) distribution. Similarly to adult alpine plants, we expected seedlings of alpine species to be more frost-tolerant than their lowland counterparts. Frost-tolerance was estimated under laboratory conditions by exposing seedlings to frost events from − 1 to − 9 °C, calculated as the temperature at which 50% of the seedlings were lethally damaged by frost (LT50). The LT50 values varied between − 1.95 and − 6.11 °C suggesting that seedling of all tested species could potentially survive mild and/or short frosts, but might be lethally damaged by severe and/or continuous frost events. The LT50 values for lowland and alpine species did not differ statistically and were on average − 3.96 ± 0.18 °C and − 4.16 ± 0.43 °C, respectively. These findings did not confirm our hypothesis that seedlings of alpine species have higher frost-tolerance than seedlings of lowland species. Four possible reasons could explain this pattern. They include (1) comparable levels of negative-stress in both lowland and alpine habitats, (2) opportunistic seed germination strategy in alpine plants, (3) peculiarities of our experimental set up and (4) potentially stronger effects of drought on alpine seedling survival than frost.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Polyploids with odd-ploidy levels may play an important evolutionary role as they enable backcrosses with their parental cytotypes. We chose the ploidy-variable Senecio carniolicus species group to address the overarching question if pentaploid individuals, which occur at high frequencies in immediate contact zones of parental tetraploids and hexaploids, mediate effective interploidy gene flow. We employed a set of approaches including relative genome size (RGS) determination and viability tests of pollen, RGS of the embryo, viability tests and germination experiments of seeds, and RGS and survival experiments of seedlings to tackle the following specific questions. Is pollen of pentaploid individuals viable suggesting regular meiosis in spite of the odd-ploidy level? Are the five sets of chromosomes split into 2.5 compliments, or rather into two and three compliments? Do crossings between pentaploid individuals produce viable seeds and seedlings, suggesting that pentaploids are an independent evolutionary unit? We found that pollen stainability is not strongly reduced in pentaploids and that the five chromosome complements are most often split into 2.5 complements. Seeds originating from homoploid crossings of pentaploids show a very low viability whereas backcrosses with tetraploids or hexaploids were more successful. No significant difference in seedling survival was observed among the different crossings but seedlings emerging from 5 x 5 x crosses were significantly smaller than both, seedlings from backcrosses and from homoploid parental crosses. Altogether, our results indicate that pentaploids may play an important evolutionary role as mediators of gene flow but that they rather do not form an independent evolutionary unit.",

To better understand the potential of treeline ecotones to show infilling or upward shifts, we assessed microsite preferences of the conifers Larix decidua , Pinus uncinata , and Pinus cembra in upper treeline ecotones with different bedrock chemistry in the French Alps. At each of two sites on calcareous and two on siliceous bedrock, we compared microsites of 50 tree individuals to 50 randomly-selected reference microsites, considering substrate, ground cover, topography, and shelter proximity. In addition, we related these characteristics with the health of the individuals. We found that the three species were established in similar microsites, usually with some shelter. The occupied microsites reflected the available microsites in the area, but certain extreme microsite types remained unoccupied. Most individuals had a krummholz form or were bent, while only a small proportion presented signs of recent mechanical damage, desiccation, snow mold or herbivory, independent of microsite characteristics. Our study shows that the availability of safe sites unlikely limits the establishment of these conifers in the studied sites, suggesting that, instead, seed availability may be a major limitation for tree establishment in these alpine-treeline ecotones. Even in safe sites, the harsh alpine conditions limit the development of tree-species individuals into tree stature, but the strong recent length growth observed suggests favorable conditions for eventual tree expansion in and above current treeline ecotones.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Mountain plant species are changing their ranges in response to global warming. However, these shifts vary tremendously in rate, extent and direction. The reasons for this variation are yet poorly understood. A process potentially important for mountain plant re-distribution is a competition between colonizing species and the resident vegetation. Here, we focus on the impact of this process using the recent elevational shift of the sedge Carex humilis in the northern Italian Alps as a model system. We repeated and extended historical sampling (conducted in 1976) of the species in the study region. We used the historical distribution data and historical climatic maps to parameterize a species distribution model (SDM) and projected the potential distribution of the species under current conditions. We compared the historical and the current re-survey for the species in terms of the cover of important potential competitor species as well as in terms of the productivity of the resident vegetation indicated by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We found that Carex humilis has shifted its leading range margin upward rapidly (51.2 m per decade) but left many sites that have become climatically suitable since 1976 according to the SDM uncolonized. These suitable but uncolonized sites show significantly higher coverage of all dwarf shrub species and higher NDVI than the sites occupied by the sedge. These results suggest that resistance of the resident vegetation against colonization of migrating species can indeed play an important role in controlling the re-distribution of mountain plants under climate change.",

Both processes are under environmental control and influenced by site conditions and plant–plant interactions. Here, we present the results of a seed-sowing experiment performed along an elevation gradient (2000–2900 m a.s.l.) in the European eastern Alps. We monitored the germination of seeds and seedling recruitment for 2 years. Three effects were investigated: effects of sites and home sites (seed origin), effects of gaps, and plant–plant interactions. Seeds of eight species originating from two home sites were transplanted to four sites (home site and ± in elevation). Seed sowing was performed in experimentally created gaps. These gap types (‘gap + roots’, ‘neighbor + roots’, and ‘no-comp’) provided different plant–plant interactions and competition intensities. We observed decreasing germination with increasing elevation, independent of the species home sites. Competition-released gaps favored recruitment, pointing out the important role of belowground competition and soil components in recruitment. In gaps with one neighboring species, neutral plant–plant interactions occurred (with one exception). However, considering the relative vegetation cover of each experimental site, high vegetation cover resulted in positive effects on recruitment at higher sites and neutral effects at lower sites. All tested species showed intraspecific variability when responding to the experimental conditions. We discuss our findings considering novel site and climatic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Plants along mountain slopes experience strong environmental variation, particularly declining air temperature with increasing elevation. Investigating intraspecific variation in morphological traits and biomass allocation across elevational gradients can reveal how plants adjust their life-history strategies to climatic conditions, improving our understanding of their resilience to climate change. We analysed variation in overall morphology and biomass allocation in two high-elevation species: Campanula alpina and Doronicum stiriacum , both centred in the alpine belt. Their elevational responses were compared with three species exhibiting wider elevational occurrence: Soldanella carpatica (lower montane to subnival belt), Bellidiastrum michelii (lower montane to alpine belt), and Senecio subalpinus (lower montane to subalpine belt). All five species showed decreasing plant height with increasing elevation. However, high-elevation species maintained stable aboveground biomass and reproductive allocation, while species with wider elevational occurrence exhibited more than 50% reduction in aboveground biomass, and two of them showed significant decline in flower biomass with elevation. Our findings confirm that species with wider or lower elevational ranges exhibit greater trait variation than high-elevation specialists. These patterns suggest that mountain generalist species, with lower elevational preferences and wider elevational occurrence, may respond more strongly to rising temperatures, potentially increasing aboveground biomass and plant height under future climate change. In contrast, high-elevation species demonstrated the ability to persist across a wide temperature range while maintaining stable biomass, indicating physiological tolerance and potential to withstand warming in alpine environments. Further research is needed to understand how high-elevation specialists maintain stable growth and reproductive output, particularly their eco-physiological adaptations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Many species of river riparia are threatened by habitat loss due to altered flood and sediment regime, and associated shifts in vegetation structure. However, their ecological niche is often obscure, especially in inconspicuous organisms such as lichens, hindering their conservation and use as indicator species in river restoration. We studied if variation in sediment size distribution, gravel bank elevation and vegetation structure drive presence-absence and fertility (fruit body production) in the endangered, soil-dwelling lichen S tereocaulon incrustatum along two Swiss braided rivers, using binomial generalized linear mixed effect models in a Bayesian framework. Data was sampled on 811 plots randomly placed along 41 transects perpendicular to the main channels. Presence probability was highest on the most elevated plots, at 30% vascular plant cover in the herb layer, and 30–40% cobble cover, and increased with moss cover. Fruit body production probability was highest under closed canopies of woody plants &gt; 3m. We show that in braided rivers, S. incrustatum is most likely found on elevated, coarse-grained sediments with increased moss but moderate vascular plant cover. This indicates a niche comprising relatively stable riparian environments, where a dry, cryptogam-dominated vegetation establishes on raw soils and competition with vascular plants is moderate. Fertile thalli are mostly found under closed canopies and high densities, suggesting a shift to sexual reproduction with increasing habitat age. While rare but strong disturbances are therefore necessary for habitat creation, older, densely populated habitat patches may harbor important source populations for colonization, thereby representing focal areas for conservation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Flower preformation is a widespread phenomenon in perennial plants from temperate and cold regions. An advanced preformation status reduces the prefloration period and thus increases the chance to mature seeds in time. Despite the particular importance of this strategy for high-mountain plants, studies are rare. Here we investigated how the length of the growing season impacts floral development, and to what extent floral development is synchronized with reproductive phenophases in the arctic-alpine species Ranunculus glacialis L. The study was carried out in the alpine-nival ecotone in the European Central Alps at sites with different snowmelt dates. Individuals were sampled at regular intervals throughout the growing season, and shoot architecture and changes in floral structures were analysed in detail using different microscopic techniques. R. glacialis individuals consist of a cluster of independent ramets, comprising 3 sympodia each. Floral initiation terminates the vegetative growth of each sympodium 2–3 years before flowers become functional. A specific feature is that basal and distal leaves on a sympodium mature in different years. The date of snowmelt did not affect the speed of development but flower size and the number of lateral flowers within an inflorescence. Belowground floral preformation is closely linked to aboveground reproductive processes, however, continues below the snow in case winter conditions set in too early. The staggered preformation of architectural units creates a permanent belowground reserve pool of floral structures which might be advantageous in the climatically harsh and unpredictable high-mountain environment.",

By integrating distributional data with spatially explicit demographic modeling and subsequent coalescent simulations, the history of alpine species can be inferred and long-standing hypotheses, such as species-specific responses to climate change or survival on nunataks during the last glacial maximum, can be efficiently tested as exemplified by available case studies. We also discuss future prospects and improvements of iDDC.",

    "abstract": "Páramo, the most species-rich tropical mountain ecosystem, is relatively well-researched in terms of the diversity and evolutionary sources of its flora, yet we know very little about the diversification within this environment. This study aims to unravel the evolutionary history of Oritrophium, an endemic genus of alpine habitats in North and South America, with a disjunct and bi-modal distribution of its species diversity. We aim to disentangle the center of origin and radiation of the genus, and mechanisms structuring its genetic diversity at inter- and intra-specific level. We sampled 19 species (85% from the total) and extended the sampling at population level for the two widely distributed species, O. limnophilum and O. peruvianum, comprising 19 and 24 populations, respectively. Using nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and trnL-trnF chloroplast DNA region, we reconstructed dated phylogenies to test the monophyly of the genus and unravel possible historical forces underlying its diversification. We also performed an ancestral area estimation to reconstruct the biogeographic history of the genus. At the population level, we constructed haplotype networks and run spatial analyses of molecular variance to explore possible mechanisms that operate on structuring the diversity at intraspecific level. Oritrophium resulted polyphyletic, with two species being closely related to Erigeron and three other species ambiguously related to Erigeron, Diplostephium, Linochilus, and/or Hinterhubera. The remaining 14 species formed a clade, Oritrophium s.s., that likely originated during the Early Pliocene in the Andes of northwestern Bolivia to southern Ecuador, the center of the genus' diversity. The group likely diversified with the emergence of the Páramo during the Late Pliocene and further dispersed mainly from South-to-North in the Pleistocene. This migration involved both, long-distance dispersal from the Central Andes to Mexico and gradual migration of the species along the Andes. Accordingly, Oritrophium s.s. appears as the first record of a long-distance dispersal from the Páramo of South America to North America. The dispersal pattern within South America was mirrored by the intraspecific population diversity and structure of the investigated species.",

In addition, changing environmental conditions might lead to vegetation shifts even when traditional land use is maintained, as observed in grasslands in Switzerland during the last decades. Maintaining and restoring the diversity of such grasslands might therefore require modified management methods. We conducted a six-year experiment to assess the responses of plant species richness, mean ecological indicator values, and vegetation composition to five management treatments, including scraping as additional management measure: haymaking (in autumn), haymaking complemented by scraping (i.e. manual raking) in autumn, haymaking complemented by scraping in spring, only scraping in spring, and abandonment of land use. We hypothesized that haymaking complemented by scraping in either season would remove additional biomass and increase species richness by creating open patches that can reduce inter-specific competition and promote species establishment. We found positive effects of haymaking complemented by scraping on plant species richness and habitat quality, indicated by the increased mean indicator value for light. Abandonment showed the opposite effects and increased mean indicator values for nutrients. Interestingly, haymaking combined with scraping in autumn promoted the development of the vegetation towards the composition similar to the resident vegetation type. Our findings show that extensive land use is essential to maintain species-rich alpine to subalpine grasslands. Further, they imply that modified land use can compensate for the negative developments such as reduced habitat quality and species richness caused by environmental changes and help restore the vegetation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Climatic oscillations of the Quaternary rapidly compelled plant species to shift their geographical range. How alpine plant species responded to climate change, however, remains elusive and remnants of the cold-adapted flora that currently strive in restricted ranges as small, isolated populations have been particularly overlooked. To address the evolutionary history of such a ‘glacial relict’, we here sampled and genotyped all known native populations of a narrow endemic species from the northwestern Alps, Papaver occidentale, as well as closely related taxa with double digest restriction-site Associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing. Spatial patterns of genetic variation across populations coupled with insights from climatic niche modelling through time address underpinings of the long-term persistence of the species in face of climate changes. Evidence from population genetics and ecological modelling indicates that P. occidentale likely persisted through the last glacial maximum outside of the Western Prealps and that a major lineage recolonized the area from lower elevation, external regions. Differentiated lineages at the Northern margins of the species distribution range highlight highly divergent and geographically restricted populations that include considerable share of private markers and may indicate local glacial survival in isolated conditions. Our data thus imply that processes having shaped intraspecific spatial genetic structure within the Alps can be complex and lead to mosaic of populations with a mixed-history of local survival and immigration. A better understanding of spatio-temporal aspects of range contraction–expansion is crucial to shed light on processes underlying the evolution of remnant populations of such endemic species and set conservation priorities considering current climate changes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Although the Balkan Peninsula belongs to the most mountainous regions of Europe, phylogeographic structure of its alpine flora remains insufficiently understood, especially for species distributed both in the western and eastern parts of the Peninsula. We analyzed Campanula orbelica , a Balkan endemic typical of high-mountain siliceous grasslands, based on the population genetic structure, climatic niche modeling at the species- and intraspecific level, and niche hindcasting back to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 20 kya). Our data reveal a clear phylogeographic pattern with three geographically coherent genetic groups: (i) the most divergent and spatially restricted lineage of the Pirin mountains (east), (ii) neighboring Rila mountains and other eastern Balkan massifs (Rhodopes, Stara Planina, Vitoša), and (iii) the most geographically disjunct mountains of the Scardo-Pindhic range (Šar Planina and Korab) in the west. This pattern indicates multiple refugia and isolated evolutionary centers within the Balkan Peninsula mountains, with the eastern part of the range as likely ancestral area, and an early dispersion into the western region, which formed the main geographical disjunction. The genetic divergence was only partly correlated with geographical isolation, clear dispersal barriers, or climatic niche shifts, suggesting contrasting isolation/dispersal dynamics in various parts of the range. Climatic niche overlap was low among eastern vs. western groups, which correlates with the longest spatial distance and significant genetic divergence, while niche characteristic of the Pirin lineage was a subset of the adjacent Rila lineage niche. High genetic divergence of the Pirin populations was also not correlated with persistent gaps in potential distributions but hypothetically may have been triggered by diversified (limestone/silicate) bedrock conditions. Our results highlight the need for high-mountain phylogeographic surveys in the eastern part of the Balkan Peninsula, to assess the biogeographical relevance of isolation patterns and definition of evolutionarily important units in the high-mountain flora.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic changes conferred by polyploidisation likely alter the ecological niche of polyploids, coming along with differences in performance compared to their diploid ancestors. However, it is largely unknown whether these performance differences remain constant during the life history of plants. Diploid Senecio noricus, tetraploid S. disjunctus, and hexaploid Senecio carniolicus s. str. of the autopolyploid species complex of S. carniolicus (Asteraceae) from the easternmost Alps were reciprocally transplanted to address the following questions: Are there differences in species performances indicating niche differentiation? If so, does the resident or the higher ploid species—which is taller growing and possibly more tolerant against challenging abiotic and biotic conditions—show higher performance? Are performance differences consistent between the early and late life-history stages? Our data suggest that the hierarchy of species performance depends on the life-history stage. For early life-history stages (seeds and seedlings), we mainly observed superior performance of S. carniolicus s. str. even on resident sites of the two other species. In contrast, vital rates of adults were predominantly highest for the resident species. The resident site of S. carniolicus s. str., which was expected to be environmentally least stressful (i.e., longest growing period, least affected by frost), turned out to be the most selective one, with high mortality and (nearly) no reproduction of the foreign species most likely due to top soil desiccation. Our study illustrates that there may be no clear-cut answer to the question if the resident or the higher ploid species shows superior performance in polyploid complexes, but rather suggests that relative performance may depend on life-history stage.",

    "abstract": "Polyploidisation—and, additionally, agmatoploidy (concerted fission of chromosomes) in some plant groups—have significantly contributed to the diversification of alpine plant species. Both processes have driven the diversification of Luzula sect. Luzula, leading to a number of different karyotypes, rendering it one of the most intricate plant groups in the Alps. For the Eastern Alps eight species with six karyotypes were reported, but their distribution is insufficiently known. A herbarium revision of 1044 specimens revealed that L. alpina, L. campestris, L. exspectata, L. multiflora and L. sudetica are widespread across the Eastern Alps; L. exspectata is thus new for the Northern Alps and new for Germany, France and possibly Croatia. Luzula divulgata is distributed in the easternmost Alps and adjacent areas, with only a few indications for the western Eastern Alps. Luzula divulgatiformis is new for the Alps where it was recorded in the Southern Alps and southerly adjacent areas. Luzula campestris, L. divulgata and L. divulgatiformis are distributed from lowlands to the montane belt, L. alpina, L. exspectata and L. sudetica are high-elevation species and L. multiflora occurs from lowlands to the alpine belt. Additionally, we estimated genome size (GS) and karyotypes for 20 populations and revealed four karyotypes corresponding to three ploidy levels. The GS of diploid L. exspectata and L. sudetica was 0.83 pg DNA, tetraploid L. alpina had a double (1.63 pg) and hexaploid L. multiflora a triple (2.48 pg) GS. Our study underlines the importance of large-scale herbarium revisions of intricate taxa, combined with cytological methods, even in well-studied mountain areas such as the Alps and poses new hypotheses regarding the evolution of this polyploid–agmatoploid group.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Studies on the origin and evolutionary history of closely related plants help to understand patterns of diversity of the mountain flora in addition to providing the basis for their identification. The genus Tephroseris includes three endemic taxa with small and disjoint distributions in the high mountains of the Iberian Peninsula and on the Maritime Alps. Tephroseris balbisiana is native to the Southwestern Alps, Tephroseris elodes to Sierra Nevada, and Tephroseris coincyi to Sierra de Gredos. These taxa have been treated under different combinations of species or subspecies due to limited morphological differentiation, but comprehensive studies have not been published so far. By combining information from phylogeny, molecular dating and genome size, we demonstrated the taxonomic distinctiveness between T. balbisiana and the two Iberian taxa. Although the lack of variability in plastid DNA hampered the precise estimation of the diversification events, some of the recovered patterns suggested a recent divergence of T. balbisiana , T. elodes and T. coincyi dating back to the Pleistocene (0.5–2.8 Mya). However, niche modeling supported a geographical overlap between the three taxa during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Moreover, the fragmentation of their ancient larger distribution range, particularly in the lower elevations of the Iberian Peninsula, and migration to glacial refuges in the south-western Alps, provide the most plausible explanations for the current disjoint distribution within the Mediterranean mountains. Furthermore, based on the evidence we gathered, we inferred that the alpine T. balbisiana , as well as the Iberian taxa, should be considered as three distinct subspecies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Throughout the last centuries, the structure and genetic composition of forests have been strongly affected by forest management. Over 30% of European forests are artificially regenerated, very often using translocated forest reproductive material, among these species the Swiss stone pine ( Pinus cembra L.). In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the species was largely used for artificial afforestation in the northern Alps. However, only a few planted trees have survived. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate if the historical afforestation of P. cembra in the northwestern Swiss Alps relied on allochthonous material. We sampled 12 sites, genotyping 11 nuclear microsatellites, to infer the spatial genetic structure of regional populations, to test for genetic differences between natural and planted stands, and to infer potential source regions of planted stands using reference samples covering the entire Alps. Population genetic structure analysis allowed us to distinguish planted from natural stands and to determine that forest reproductive material used for plantations was not of regional origin. We found similar levels of genetic diversity between natural and planted stands. Assignment tests revealed that reproductive material for planting was translocated to the study area from two source regions, i.e., near the border of Switzerland and Austria, and further to the East, between Austria and Italy. Our study shows how genetic tools may inform about historical transfer of forest reproductive material, which still may affect the population genetic make-up of regional occurrences, e.g., because of reduced natural regeneration.",

Kindb. in the European Alps are studied based on information from the nuclear internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 and a portion of the gene region for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase for 364 European specimens. Seventy-three Alps specimens were sampled from W Switzerland to W Austria, and were divided into four regional populations along a West-South-West (WSW) to East-North-East (ENE) gradient. These populations were compared with similar ones previously studied in other parts of Europe. The ENE-most Alps population, located ENE of the Adige break zone, deviates genetically from the other three. The two WSW-most populations of the Alps appear to be relatively isolated from most of the European populations outside the Alps, whereas the two ENE ones are similar to populations of northern Scandinavia. Populations in between the Alps and the Scandinavian mountain range deviate from those to the north and south, possibly due to low effective population sizes, earlier bottleneck events, or colonization from different source populations. Haplotype diversity and number of private haplotypes are marginally higher in the Alps than in Scandinavia. It is suggested that European Rhytidium originated from late glacial maximum refugia in (1) E-NE Europe, (2) in between the Late Glacial Maximum ice shields of Scandinavia and the Alps, and (3) S, SW, and W of the Swiss Alps. Those of the E Alps potentially originated mainly in E-NE Europe and those of the W Alps in the S, SW, and W.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the Bale Mountains, the ericaceous belt ranges between 3200 and 3800 m asl. Studies indicate an expansion on the Sanetti Plateau at the end of the Late Glacial and during the early Holocene. Currently, only patches of Erica growing between boulders are found on the Plateau, while most of the landscape above 3800 m asl is covered by afro-alpine plants. Driving factors for Erica patches above the upper ericaceous ecotone is a matter of debate. This study evaluates site variables and biogeochemical properties of soils under Erica patches and nearby Erica -free control to understand the environmental conditions responsible for the patchy occurrence of Erica on the Sanetti Plateau. Except for the boulder richness, Erica and control plots have comparable topography, soil texture, and electrical conductivity. However, soils below Erica patches have higher total organic carbon, nitrogen, carbon-to-nitrogen ratios, and black carbon contents than the control plots indicating fresh organic matter input and availability of combustible fuel. This implies that Erica did not fully cover the control plots in former times. Carbon and nitrogen stocks were slightly higher in control plots due to the lower stone contents of the profiles. In addition, soils of the Erica plots showed more positive δ 13 C values than the control soils, possibly attributed to water stress. In general, the relief and soil conditions of control plots may support the growth of Erica . However, Erica growing between boulders seems to benefit from the favorable microclimate and physical protection against grazing and fire.",

    "abstract": "Deciphering how plants interact with each other across environmental gradients is important to understand plant community assembly, as well as potential future plant responses to environmental change. Plant-plant interactions are expected to shift from predominantly negative (i.e. competition) to predominantly positive (i.e. facilitation) along gradients of environmental severity. However, most experiments examine the net effects of interactions by growing plants in either the presence or absence of neighbours, thereby neglecting the interplay of both negative and positive effects acting simultaneously within communities. To partially unravel these effects, we tested how the seedling establishment of 10 mountain grassland plants varied in the presence versus absence of plant communities at two sites along an elevation gradient. We created a third experimental treatment (using plastic plant mats to mimic surrounding vegetation) that retained the main hypothesised benefits of plant neighbours (microsite amelioration), while reducing a key negative effect (competition for soil resources). In contrast to our expectations, we found evidence for net positive effects of vegetation at the low elevation site, and net negative effects at the high elevation site. Interestingly, the negative effects of plant neighbours at high elevation were driven by high establishment rates of low elevation grasses in bare soil plots. At both sites, establishment rates were highest in artificial vegetation (after excluding two low elevation grasses at the high elevation site), indicating that positive effects of above-ground vegetation are partially offset by their negative effects. Our results demonstrate that both competition and facilitation act jointly to affect community structure across environmental gradients, while emphasising that competition can be strong also at higher elevations in temperate mountain regions. Consequently, plant-plant interactions are likely to influence the establishment of new, and persistence of resident, species in mountain plant communities as environments change.

    "abstract": "Abstract Bacterial communities in the phyllosphere are shaped by host genotype and phenotype and spatio-temporal variation of the environment. In turn, bacteria have the potential for altering the plant phenotype. Field experiments can help to estimate bacterial effects on plant functional traits under natural conditions. We used a transplantation approach of culturable bacterial communities to explore how manipulation of leaf-associated microbial communities in two different successional stages within a glacier foreland can influence microbial composition and functional plant traits. Our study documents successional stage-specific variations in the composition of foliar bacterial communities and shifts therein throughout a season and between years. We show that cultured bacteria transferred between plant communities can alter diversity and composition of the microbiome on plant community level as well as species-specific functional plant traits of two selected plant species within one growing season. Furthermore, our results demonstrate a strong resilience of plant-associated bacterial communities and of plants in response to bacterial invaders. Our study illustrates that inoculation experiments in the field with naturally occurring microbial communities of wild plants are suited to investigate complex interactions between microbial communities, the environment, and plant traits.",

In a recent paper in this journal (Körner C, Lenz A, Hoch G (2023) Chronic in situ tissue cooling does not reduce lignification at the Swiss treeline but enhances the risk of 'blue' frost rings. Alpine Botany https://doi.org/10.1007/s00035-023-00293-6 ) we presented results of an in situ stem-cooling experiment at a Swiss treeline site. The experiment provided answers to two entirely different questions, related to xylogenesis at treeline: (a) the absence of chronic effects of low temperature on lignification, and (b) a high time resolution insight into the rare occurrence of damages in young, still undifferentiated, and thus, non-lignified cells at the occasion of an exceptional early season frost event. In the last issue of Alpine Botany (August 7, 2023), our data had been re-interpreted by (Büntgen, Alpine Botany, 2023) by confusing (b) with (a). Cell death before secondary wall formation interrupts all metabolism, and thus, cannot exert a specific limitation of lignification. For the xylem to lignify, it requires a secondary cell wall in the first place. A frost damage in young tracheid cells is unsuitable for a dendrological treeline hypothesis based on a low-temperature threshold for lignification. Generally, the global pattern of treeline position is not associated with local freezing conditions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Snowpatch plant communities, which occur in parts of alpine landscapes where snow accumulates and persists well into the summer, are highly sensitive to climate change. The formation of persistent soil seed banks is recognised as a critical component of a plant community’s resilience to a changing environment. However, our understanding of the ecology of snowpatch soil seed banks and their potential role in the persistence of these threatened communities remains limited. To address this knowledge gap, we (1) characterised the density, diversity and composition of snowpatch soil seed banks along a snowmelt gradient (with early, mid, and late melt zones defined); and (2) contrasted their similarity with long-term vegetation surveys (2020, 2013, 2007) to assess the relationship between soil seed banks and standing vegetation over time. We found persistent soil seed banks in all snowmelt zones and that the snowmelt gradient significantly influenced their density, diversity and composition. Species density and diversity in soil seed banks were higher in the early and mid zones compared to the late zone. However, seedlings from the late zone emerged faster and more synchronously than those emerging from the early and mid zones. The species similarity between seed banks and standing vegetation was relatively high in the two most recent surveys (2020, 2013) compared to the initial survey (2007). However, the composition of life forms and regeneration strategies (i.e. sexual or vegetative reproduction) of seedlings that emerged from the soil seed banks was more similar to the composition of the initial standing vegetation survey (2007) than to the more recent surveys (2020, 2013). Our results suggest that although soil seed banks may be changing as the standing vegetation changes, they still have a compositional similarity to historical plant assemblages, contributing to the resilience of these endangered communities to climate change.",
