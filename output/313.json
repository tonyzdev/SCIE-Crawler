Objective This study aimed to evaluate the effect of covering the soil with 5 Mg ha-1 of maize straw on the germination and growth of Digitaria insularis, Conyza spp., Bidens pilosa, Amaranthus hybridus, Euphorbia heterophylla, and Eleusine indica. Methods For this purpose, completely randomized design was used with [...]",

    "abstract": "Background Eragrostis plana is the main invasive plant in the Pampa Biome of southern Brazil. This plant is highly competitive, tolerant to abiotic stresses, and very difficult to manage. Plants exposed to abiotic stresses and herbicides develop mechanisms that help alleviate or reduce damage caused by stressors and transmit this ability to the progenies. Objective The study’s objectives were to ascertain whether acclimatization to stress due to drought and sub-lethal doses of glyphosate may decrease plant sensitivity to glyphosate [...]",

The study of weeds leaves morphoanatomy is important to understand environmental adaptation and could be used to explain herbicide absorption. Leaf surfaces of Gomphrena species were previously described for phylogenetic studies, and morphoanatomy of two Gomphrena perennis populations was characterized for glyphosate tolerance. There are no reports on comparative studies of Gpe and Gpu. [...]",
