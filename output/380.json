    "abstract": "In an effort to improve customization for today's highly competitive global marketplace, many companies are utilizing product families and platform-based product development to increase variety, shorten lead times, and reduce costs. The key to a successful product family is the product platform from which it is derived either by adding, removing, or substituting one or more modules to the platform or by scaling the platform in one or more dimensions to target specific market niches. This nascent field of engineering design has matured rapidly in the past decade, and this paper provides a comprehensive review of the flurry of research activity that has occurred during that time to facilitate product family design and platform-based product development for mass customization. Techniques for identifying platform leveraging strategies within a product family are reviewed along with metrics for assessing the effectiveness of product platforms and product families. Special emphasis is placed on optimization approaches and artificial intelligence techniques to assist in the process of product family design and platform-based product development. Web-based systems for product platform customization are also discussed. Examples from both industry and academia are presented throughout the paper to highlight the benefits of product families and product platforms. The paper concludes with a discussion of potential areas of research to help bridge the gap between planning and managing families of products and designing and manufacturing them.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The relative significance of conceptual design to basic design or detail design is widely recognized, due to its influential roles in determining the product's fundamental features and development costs. Although there are some general methodologies dealing with functions in design, virtually no commercial CAD systems can support functional design, in particular so-called synthetic phase of design. Supporting the synthetic phase of conceptual design is one of the crucial issues of CAD systems with function modeling capabilities. In this paper, we propose a computer tool called a Function-Behavior-State (FBS) Modeler to support functional design not only in the analytical phase but also in the synthetic phase. To do so, the functional decomposition knowledge and physical features in the knowledge base of the modeler, and a subsystem Qualitative Process Abduction System (QPAS) play crucial roles. Modeling scheme of function in relation with behavior and structure and design process for conceptual design in the FBS Modeler are described. The advantages of the FBS Modeler are demonstrated by presenting two examples; namely, an experiment in which designers used this tool and the design of functionally redundant machines, which is a new design methodology for highly reliable machines, as its application.",

Systems in natural and artificial worlds and their functionality are seen as rich sources of inspiration for idea generation. However, unlike in the artificial domain where existing systems are often used for inspiration, those from the natural domain are rarely used in a systematic way for this purpose. Analogy is long regarded as a powerful means for inspiring novel idea generation. One aim of the work reported here is to initiate similar work in the area of systematic biomimetics for product development, so that inspiration from both natural and artificial worlds can be used systematically to help develop novel, analogical ideas for solving design problems. A generic model for representing causality of natural and artificial systems has been developed, and used to structure information in a database of systems from both the domains. These are implemented in a piece of software for automated analogical search of relevant ideas from the databases to solve a given problem. Preliminary experiments at validating the software indicate substantial potential for the approach.",

We discuss several approaches of lifting modeling information that is based on the express family of languages for data modeling onto a logically rigid and semantically enhanced ontological level encoded in the W3C Ontology Web Language. We exemplify the added value of such formal notation of building models by providing several examples where generic query and reasoning algorithms can be applied to problems that otherwise have to be manually hard-wired into applications for processing building information. Furthermore, we show how the underlying resource description framework and the set of technologies evolving around it can be tailored to the need of distributed collaborative work in the building and construction industry.",

Among the implications of the model are the following: (a) CAD tools should be extended to represent the state of the design at more abstract levels, (b) CAD tools should help the designer manage constraints, and (c) CAD tools should be designed to give cognitive support to the designer.",

Thus, in knowledge-based design, how we represent the cross-domain knowledge becomes a key issue. In this paper, we present a formalism for design knowledge representation. By analyzing function representation in different design domains, from graphic design and industrial design to architectural and engineering device designs, we find that although the focus of each kind of design is different, the function representation can be generalized into a small number of categories. This formalism can be used in an explorative model of design by analogy, where designs from different design domains are sources to help produce a new design.",

The ontology presented consists of a set of concepts for representing the knowledge on a configuration and the restrictions on possible configurations. The ontology is based on a synthesis of the main approaches to configuration. Earlier approaches are extended with new concepts arising from our practical experience on configurable products. The concepts include components, attributes, resources, ports, contexts, functions, constraints, and relations between these. The main contributions of this work are in the detailed conceptualization of knowledge on product structures and in extending the resource concept with contexts for limiting the availability and use of resources. In addition, constraint sets representing different views on the product are introduced. The ontology is compared with the previous work on configuration. It covers all the principal approaches, that is, connection-based, structure-based, resource-based, and function-based approaches to configuration. The dependencies between the concepts arising from different conceptualizations are briefly analyzed. Several ways in which the ontology could be extended are pointed out.",

We need tools to support people's ability to find and use analogies. A deeper understanding of the cognitive mechanisms underlying design and analogy is a crucial step in developing these tools. This paper presents an experiment that explores the effects of representation within the modality of sketching, the effects of functional models, and the retrieval and use of analogies. We find that the level of abstraction for the representation of prior knowledge and the representation of a current design problem both affect people's ability to retrieve and use analogous solutions. A general semantic description in memory facilitates retrieval of that prior knowledge. The ability to find and use an analogy is also facilitated by having an appropriate functional model of the problem. These studies result in a number of important implications for the development of tools to support design by analogy. Foremost among these implications is the ability to provide multiple representations of design problems by which designers may reason across, where the verb construct in the English language is a preferred mode for these representations.",

    "abstract": "Biomimetic, or biologically inspired, design uses analogous biological phenomena to develop solutions for engineering problems. Several instances of biomimetic design result from personal observations of biological phenomena. However, many engineers' knowledge of biology may be limited, thus reducing the potential of biologically inspired solutions. Our approach to biomimetic design takes advantage of the large amount of biological knowledge already available in books, journals, and so forth, by performing keyword searches on these existing natural-language sources. Because of the ambiguity and imprecision of natural language, challenges inherent to natural language processing were encountered. One challenge of retrieving relevant cross-domain information involves differences in domain vocabularies, or lexicons. A keyword meaningful to biologists may not occur to engineers. For an example problem that involved cleaning, that is, removing dirt, a biochemist suggested the keyword “defend.” Defend is not an obvious keyword to most engineers for this problem, nor are the words defend and “clean/remove” directly related within lexical references. However, previous work showed that biological phenomena retrieved by the keyword defend provided useful stimuli and produced successful concepts for the clean/remove problem. In this paper, we describe a method to systematically bridge the disparate biology and engineering domains using natural language analysis. For the clean/remove example, we were able to algorithmically generate several biologically meaningful keywords, including defend, that are not obviously related to the engineering problem. We developed a method to organize and rank the set of biologically meaningful keywords identified, and confirmed that we could achieve similar results for two other examples in encapsulation and microassembly. Although we specifically address cross-domain information retrieval from biology, the bridging process presented in this paper is not limited to biology, and can be used for any other domain given the availability of appropriate domain-specific knowledge sources and references.",

Another example is the engineering phase of a configuration knowledge base where the underlying constraints can become inconsistent with a set of test cases. In such situations we are in the need of techniques that support the identification of minimal sets of faulty constraints that have to be deleted in order to restore consistency. In this paper we introduce a divide and conquer-based diagnosis algorithm (F ast D iag ) that identifies minimal sets of faulty constraints in an overconstrained problem. This algorithm is specifically applicable in scenarios where the efficient identification of leading (preferred) diagnoses is crucial. We compare the performance of F ast D iag with the conflict-directed calculation of hitting sets and present an in-depth performance analysis that shows the advantages of our approach.",

The studio is a learning by doing environment, and the crit is the setting in which students acquire design skills and knowledge, under the guidance of the teacher. Design teachers are usually practitioners who receive no pedagogical training, and the effectiveness of their teaching depends on experience, awareness, and talent. Here we offer a detailed qualitative and quantitative representation of the crit through analyses of three case studies, which were collected in second-year architectural studios. We use two types of protocol analysis methods: coding of verbalizations and linkography, which looks at links among verbalizations. We show the diversity in teachers' performance and point to common trends. We propose that analyses of this kind may serve as a major feedback instrument in the framework of a badly needed pedagogical basis for design education.",

In this paper, we argue that interdisciplinary interest in design fixation has led to increasingly broad definitions of the phenomenon that may be undermining empirical research efforts, educational efforts to minimize fixation, and the acquisition and dissemination of transdisciplinary knowledge about fixation effects. To address these issues, we recommend that researchers consider categorizing fixation phenomena into one of three classifications: unconscious adherence to the influence of prior designs, conscious blocks to change, and intentional resistance to new ideas. Next, we distinguish between concept-based design fixation, fixation to a specific class of known design concepts, and knowledge-based design fixation, fixation to a problem-specific knowledge base. With these distinctions in place, we propose a system of orders of design fixation, recommend methods for reducing fixation in inventive design, and recommend areas that are in need of further research within the field of design science.",

Consequently, prompt repair before their failure is necessary to ensure the dependability of mechanical equipment. The prognostic and health management (PHM) technology could track the system’s health state and timely detect faults. Therefore, the remaining useful life (RUL) prediction as one of the key components of PHM is rather important. Accurate RUL prediction results could be the data support for condition-based equipment maintenance plans. Also, it could increase the dependability and safety of mechanical equipment while reducing the loss of human and financial resources and meet the requirements of sustainable manufacturing in the Industry 4.0 era. However, with the widespread use of deep learning in the field of intelligent manufacturing, there is a lack of review on RUL prediction based on deep learning. In this paper, different deep learning-based RUL prediction methods for mechanical components are summarized and classified, along with their pros and cons. Then, the case study on the C-MAPSS dataset is mainly conducted and different methods are compared. And finally, the difficulties and future directions of the RUL prediction in practical scenarios are discussed.",

We have already proposed a new manufacturing paradigm called the “Post Mass Production Paradigm (PMPP)” that advocates sustainable production by decoupling economic growth from material and energy consumption. To realize PMPP, appropriate planning of a product life cycle (design of life cycle) is indispensable in addition to the traditional environmental conscious design methodologies. For supporting the design of a life cycle, this paper proposes a life-cycle simulation system that consists of a life-cycle simulator, an optimizer, a model editor, and knowledge bases. The simulation system evaluates product life cycles from an integrated view of environmental consciousness and economic profitability and optimizes the life cycles. A case study with the simulation system illustrates that the environmental impacts can be reduced drastically without decreasing corporate profits by appropriately combining maintenance, reuse and recycling, and by taking into consideration that optimized modular structures differ according to life-cycle options.",

This paper attempts to address this challenging problem with intelligence-oriented techniques, specifically dynamic wavelet neural networks (DWNNs). DWNNs incorporate temporal information and storage capacity into their functionality so that they can predict into the future, carrying out fault prognostic tasks. Such fundamental issues as the network structure, learning algorithms, stability analysis, uncertainty management, and performance assessment are studied in a theoretical framework.

    "abstract": "One of the main difficulties with configuration problem solving lies in the representation of the domain knowledge because many different aspects, such as taxonomy, topology, constraints, resource balancing, component generation, etc., have to be captured in a single model. This model must be expressive, declarative, and structured enough to be easy to maintain and to be easily used by many different kind of reasoning algorithms. This paper presents a new framework where a configuration problem is considered both as a classification problem and as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). Our approach deeply blends concepts from the CSP and object-oriented paradigms to adopt the strengths of both. We expose how we have integrated taxonomic reasoning in the constraint programming schema. We also introduce new constrained variables with nonfinite domains to deal with the fact that the set of components is previously unknown and is constructed during the search for solution. Our work strongly focuses on the representation and the structuring of the domain knowledge, because the most common drawback of previous works is the difficulty to maintain the knowledge base that is due to a lack of structure and expressiveness of the knowledge representation model. The main contribution of our work is to provide an object-oriented model completely integrated in the CSP schema, with inheritance and classification mechanisms, and with specific arc consistency algorithms.",

However, there are still some fundamental ambiguities and confusions over their representation, which have greatly hindered the interchange of research ideas and the development of design synthesis strategies. For conceptual design of mechanical products specifically, this paper attempts to clarify these ambiguities. It classifies function as purpose function and action function and relates them to the different levels of design hierarchy and abstraction. It distinguishes between semantic and syntactic representations of function and behavior and summarizes basic representation schemes. It also proposes an input–output action transformation scheme for semantic function representation and an input–output flow of action scheme for semantic behavior representation. Based on these discoveries, a refined framework is proposed for conceptual mechanical product design, where a function–decomposition–mapping process is elaborated to demonstrate the necessities and usefulness of the presented work.",

The focus of this paper is a knowledge-based design environment called Schemebuilder, which is a comprehensive and integrated suite of software tools aimed at supporting the designer in the rapid development of product design models in the conceptual, through embodiment stages of design. Illustrated is the use of the software tools in the qualitative generation of alternative schemes, by application of stored working and decomposition principles in the development of a function-means tree-like information structure. With mechatronic product development as the main theme, this paper describes a closely integrated methodology that incorporates a bond graph approach to continuous-time energetic systems and high-level Petri nets for the rigorous description of discrete-time information systems. Additionally, a technique is suggested for the decomposition of free format statements of need into the rigorously defined design context and required functions, which form the starting point of the function-means development process.",

Biological organisms, phenomena, and strategies, which we refer to as biological systems, provide a rich set of analogies. These systems provide insight into sustainable and adaptable design and offer engineers billions of years of valuable experience, which can be used to inspire engineering innovation. This research presents a general method for functionally representing biological systems through systematic design techniques, leading to the conceptualization of biologically inspired engineering designs. Functional representation and abstraction techniques are used to translate biological systems into an engineering context. The goal is to make the biological information accessible to engineering designers who possess varying levels of biological knowledge but have a common understanding of engineering design. Creative or novel engineering designs may then be discovered through connections made between biology and engineering. To assist with making connections between the two domains concept generation techniques that use biological information, engineering knowledge, and automatic concept generation software are employed. Two concept generation approaches are presented that use a biological model to discover corresponding engineering components that mimic the biological system and use a repository of engineering and biological information to discover which biological components inspire functional solutions to fulfill engineering requirements. Discussion includes general guidelines for modeling biological systems at varying levels of fidelity, advantages, limitations, and applications of this research. The modeling methodology and the first approach for concept generation are illustrated by a continuous example of lichen.",

    "abstract": "Because of the increasing complexity of products and the design process, as well as the popularity of computer-aided documentation tools, the number of electronic and textual design documents being generated has exploded. The availability of such extensive document resources has created new challenges and opportunities for research. These include improving design information retrieval to achieve a more coherent environment for design exploration, learning, and reuse. One critical issue is related to the construction of a structured representation for indexing design documents that record engineers' ideas and reasoning processes for a specific design. This representation should explicitly and accurately capture the important design concepts as well as the relationships between these concepts so that engineers can locate their documents of interest with less effort. For design information retrieval, we propose to use shallow natural language processing and domain-specific design ontology to automatically construct a structured and semantics-based representation from unstructured design documents. The design concepts and relationships of the representation are recognized from the document based on the identified linguistic patterns. The recognized concepts and relationships are joined to form a concept graph. The integration of these concept graphs builds an application-specific design ontology, which can be seen as the structured representation of the content of the corporate document repository, as well as an automatically populated knowledge base from previous designs. To improve the performance of design information retrieval, we have developed ontology-based query processing, where users' requests are interpreted based on their domain-specific meanings. Our approach contrasts with the traditionally used keyword-based search. An experiment to test the retrieval performance is conducted by using the design documents from a product design scenario. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms the keyword-based search techniques. This research contributes to the development and use of engineering ontology for design information retrieval.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper explores the use of heuristics as cognitive strategies invoked during the process of design. Heuristics are reasoning processes that do not guarantee the best solution, but often lead to potential solutions by providing a simple cognitive “shortcut.” We propose that designers use specific design heuristics to explore the problem space of potential designs, leading to the generation of creative solutions. We test whether design heuristics can be taught to novices, and suggest their use will facilitate the design process at multiple levels of instruction. In the present empirical study, we evaluate a set of six instructional heuristics and validate their effectiveness with product concepts generated by novice designers. Six hundred seventy-three drawings were created by 120 first-year college students under four instructional conditions. Drawings were coded according to their content, use of heuristics, creativity, and practicality. The most creative concepts emerged from the experimental conditions where heuristics were introduced. Heuristics appeared to help the participants “jump” to a new problem space, resulting in more varied designs, and a greater frequency of designs judged as more creative. Our findings suggest that simple demonstration of design heuristics may, at times, be sufficient to stimulate divergent thinking, perhaps because these heuristics are readily grasped and contextual application is not required. Based on these findings, a conceptual model for design education emphasizing the importance of using a variety of heuristics is proposed. This model suggests that learning can be enhanced through exposure to a variety of design heuristics, and can supplement formal education and foster personal development in design learning.",

What are the essential steps in a biomimetic process? What is transferred? How can the transferred knowledge be structured in a way useful for biologists and engineers? Which guidelines can be given to support transfer in biomimetic design processes? In order to identify the essential steps involved in carrying out biomimetics, several procedures found in the literature were summarized, and four essential steps that are common across these procedures were identified. For identification of mechanisms for transfer, 20 biomimetic examples were collected and modeled according to a model of causality called the SAPPhIRE model. These examples were then analyzed for identifying the underlying similarity between each biological and corresponding analogue technical system. Based on the SAPPhIRE model, four levels of abstraction at which transfer takes place were identified. Taking into account similarity, the biomimetic examples were assigned to the appropriate levels of abstraction of transfer. Based on the essential steps and the levels of transfer, guidelines for supporting transfer in biomimetic design were proposed and evaluated using design experiments. The 20 biological and analogue technical systems that were analyzed were similar in the physical effects used and at the most abstract levels of description of their functionality, but they were the least similar at the lowest levels of abstraction: the parts involved. Transfer most often was carried out at the physical effect level of abstraction. Compared to a generic set of guidelines based on the literature, the proposed guidelines improved design performance by about 60%. Further, the SAPPhIRE model turned out to be a useful representation for modeling complex biological systems and their functionality. Databases of biological systems, which are structured using the SAPPhIRE model, have the potential to aid biomimetic concept generation.",

We studied the effect of representation of triggers on ideas generated by six design engineers while trying to solve a given problem. A variety of representations (video/animation and audio, text, explanation, and others) that are potentially useful to designers for five prespecified triggers were administered to each designer, who generated ideas in response to each trigger–representation combination individually.

    "abstract": "Abstract How can we prepare engineering students to work collectively on innovative design issues, involving ill-defined, “wicked” problems? Recent works have emphasized the need for students to learn to combine divergent and convergent thinking in a collaborative, controlled manner. From this perspective, teaching must help them overcome four types of obstacles or “fixation effects” (FEs) that are found in the generation of alternatives, knowledge acquisition, collaborative creativity, and creativity processes. We begin by showing that teaching based on concept–knowledge (C-K) theory can help to manage FEs because it helps to clarify them and then to overcome them by providing means of action. We show that C-K theory can provide scaffolding to improve project-based learning (PBL), in what we call project-based critical learning (PBCL). PBCL helps students be critical and give due thought to the main issues in innovative design education: FEs. We illustrate the PBCL process with several cases and show precisely where the FEs appear and how students are able to overcome them. We conclude by discussing two main criteria of any teaching method, both of which are usually difficult to address in situations of innovative design teaching. First, can the method be evaluated? Second, is the chosen case “realistic” enough? We show that C-K-based PBCL can be rigorously evaluated by teachers, and we discuss the circumstances in which a C-K-based PBCL may or may not be realistic.",

Therefore, it would be interesting to use the most appropriate dispatching rule for each instance. To achieve this goal, a scheduling approach that uses machine learning can be used. Analyzing the previous performance of the system (training examples) by means of this technique, knowledge is obtained that can be used to decide which is the most appropriate dispatching rule at each moment in time.

    "abstract": "Abstract Climate change, resource depletion, and worldwide urbanization feed the demand for more energy and resource-efficient buildings. Increasingly, architectural designers and consultants analyze building designs with easy-to-use simulation tools. To identify design alternatives with good performance, designers often turn to optimization methods. Randomized, metaheuristic methods such as genetic algorithms are popular in the architectural design field. However, are metaheuristics the best approach for architectural design problems that often are complex and ill defined? Metaheuristics may find solutions for well-defined problems, but they do not contribute to a better understanding of a complex design problem. This paper proposes surrogate-based optimization as a method that promotes understanding of the design problem. The surrogate method interpolates a mathematical model from data that relate design parameters to performance criteria. Designers can interact with this model to explore the approximate impact of changing design variables. We apply the radial basis function method, a specific type of surrogate model, to two architectural daylight optimization problems. These case studies, along with results from computational experiments, serve to discuss several advantages of surrogate models. First, surrogate models not only propose good solutions but also allow designers to address issues outside of the formulation of the optimization problem. Instead of accepting a solution presented by the optimization process, designers can improve their understanding of the design problem by interacting with the model. Second, a related advantage is that designers can quickly construct surrogate models from existing simulation results and other knowledge they might possess about the design problem. Designers can thus explore the impact of different evaluation criteria by constructing several models from the same set of data. They also can create models from approximate data and later refine them with more precise simulations. Third, surrogate-based methods typically find global optima orders of magnitude faster than genetic algorithms, especially when the evaluation of design variants requires time-intensive simulations.",

Rejecting the different meanings is described as the straightforward response to resolving the ambiguity of functional descriptions, yet in engineering research and design methodology it rather seems to be accepted that engineers do use the coexisting meanings side by side. In this paper, explanations are given of why this practice is beneficial to engineering.

The study outcomes are at least twofold: a common framework of metrics and approaches to overcome design fixation in a wide range of design problems and nonintuitive results for DbA approaches in design fixation and other related creativity metrics. The application of WordTree and SCAMPER shows that both methods yield increased novelty compared to a control, where the SCAMPER results are significantly higher than WordTree. It is also found that WordTree mitigates design fixation whereas SCAMPER appears to be ineffective for this purpose but effective to generate an increased quantity of novel ideas. These results demonstrate that both DbA methods provide de-fixation capabilities and enhance designers’ creativity during idea generation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Design is inherently affected by human-related factors and it is of no surprise that the fine-tuning of instruments capable of measuring aspects of human behavior has attracted interest in the design field. The recalled instruments include a variety of devices that capture and quantitatively assess people's unintentional and unconscious reactions and that are generally referred as neurophysiological or biometric. The number of experimental applications of these instruments in design was extremely limited as of 2016, when Lohmeyer and Meboldt published a first report on relevant measures and their interpretation in design. In the last few years, the number of relevant publications has increased dramatically and this determines the opportunity to carry out a comprehensive review in the field. The reviewed contributions are analyzed and classified according to, among others, instruments used, the kind of stakeholders involved and the supported design research activities. The role of biometric measures with respect to traditional research methods is emphasized too. The discussed instruments can represent supports or substitutes for traditional approaches, as well as they are capable of exploring phenomena that could not be addressed hitherto. The intensity of research concerning experiments with biometric measurements is discussed too; a particular focus of the final discussion is the individuation of obstacles that prevent them from becoming commonplace in design research.",

These perspectives of design rationale use different representations, which influence their ability to capture and to retrieve and use information. We propose an integrated approach to design rationale where design communication is captured and, over time, incrementally structured into argumentation and other formalisms to enable improved retrieval and use of this information. Two systems, PHIDIAS and the Hyper-Object Substrate, are used to demonstrate: (1) how to capture and integrate a variety of design information, (2) how to support the structuring of unstructured information, and (3) how to use design information to actively support design.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Conceptual design is an early stage in the design process that involves the generation of solution concepts to satisfy the functional requirements of a design problem. Usually, there are many solutions to a design problem; therefore, there is scope for producing improved designs if one could explore a solution space larger than is presently possible. An approach would be to use the computer to synthesize a wide variety of concepts for a given problem, and allow designers to explore these before developing the most promising ones. Adopting a research approach based on developing basic representations, knowledge base, and reasoning procedures adequate for synthesizing concepts of existing devices and mechanisms, a computer program for synthesis of solutions to a class of mechanical design problems has been developed. For a given design problem, the program can produce an exhaustive set of solution concepts, in terms of their topological and spatial configurations, which can then be explored by designers. The program has been tested in two ways: (1) by comparing the candidate solutions produced by the program with those produced by designers in two real design case studies, and (2) by using three experienced designers to evaluate the solutions, generated by the program, for their novelty and usefulness. This paper presents the theoretical basis, research method, the theory and implementation of the synthesis approach. Also, the results of the above case studies and evaluations, and a discussion of further issues highlighted by the evaluations are presented.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes OARPLAN, a prototype planning system that generates construction project plans from a description of the objects that comprise the completed facility. OARPLAN is based upon the notion that activities in a project plan can be viewed as intersections of their constituents: objects, actions and resources . Planning knowledge in OARPLAN is represented as constraints based on activity constituents and their interrelationships; the planner functions as a constraint satisfaction engine that attempts to satisfy these constraints. The goal of the OARPLAN project is to develop a planning shell for construction projects that (i) provides a natural and powerful constraint language for expressing knowledge about construction planning, and (ii) generates a facility construction plan by satisfying constraints expressed in this language. To generate its construction plan, OARPLAN must be supplied with extensive knowledge about construction objects, actions and resources, and about spatial, topological, temporal and other relations that may exist between them. We suggest that much of the knowledge required to plan the construction of a given facility can be drawn directly from a three-dimensional CAD model of the facility, and from a variety of databases currently used in design and project management software. In the prototype OARPLAN system, facility data must be input directly as frames. However, we are collaborating with database researchers to develop intelligent interfaces to such sources of planning data, so that OARPLAN will eventually be able to send high level queries to an intelligent database access system without regard for the particular CAD system in which the project was designed. We begin by explaining why classical AI planners and domain specific expert system approaches are both inadequate for the task of generating construction project plans. We describe the activity representation developed in OARPLAN and demonstrate its use in producing a plan of about 50 activities for a steel-frame building, based on spatial and topological constraints that express structural support, weather protection and safety concerns in construction planning. We conclude with a discussion of the research issues raised by our experiments with OARPLAN to date.",

These results formalize and clarify a set of contending intuitions about function that researchers have had. The paper relates the approaches, results, and goals of this stream of research, called functional representation (FR), with the functional modeling (FM) stream in engineering. Despite the occurrence of the term function in the two streams, often the results and techniques in the two streams appear not to have much to do with each other. I argue that, in fact, the two streams are performing research that is mutually complementary. FR research provides the basic layer for device ontology in a formal framework that helps to clarify the meanings of terms such as function and structure, and also to support representation of device knowledge for automated reasoning. FM research provides another layer in device ontology, by attempting to identify behavior primitives that are applicable to subsets of devices, with the hope that functions can be described in those domains with an economy of terms. This can lead to useful catalogs of functions and devices in specific areas of engineering. With increased attention to formalization, the work in FM can provide domain-specific terms for FR research in knowledge representation and automated reasoning.",

    "abstract": "Extending product life is one of the hopeful approaches to reduce the environmental issue, which is one of the most critical issues of today. However, many products are thrown away because of obsolescence of functions and their performance. Therefore, we should design products to be functionally upgradable. Moreover, such upgradable products may create business chances at later stages of product life cycles. The objective of this research is to propose a design methodology for upgradability. This methodology employs a functional modeling scheme, FBS modeling, because upgrade design is a distinctive application of functional design that aims at maximizing functional flexibility with minimal structural changes after the product is manufactured. Here, the functional flexibility refers to an ability of a product to adapt its functions to changes of user needs. This paper proposes and models design processes and design operations in the upgrade design. Especially, the methodology supports finding out candidates of modifications of the function structure and configuration of a platform, which is common structure of a product among several generations, and upgrade modules. One of its central issues of upgrade design is treatment of future uncertainty. For this purpose, we propose two design strategies: delayed selection of components, and expanding and shrinking platform. A prototype system and a case study of upgrade design for a vacuum cleaner are also illustrated. The case study indicates that the system succeeded in systematically supporting a designer to execute the design methodology. Regarding the functional design, as an extension of FBS modeling, this paper proposes a method to relate abstract entity concepts in FBS modeling to concrete components through a quantitative behavior model and range calculation, in addition to deployment of FBS modeling for the design methodology.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Tangible interaction is a growing area of human–computer interaction research that has become popular in recent years. Yet designers and researchers are still trying to comprehend and clarify its nature, characteristics, and implications. One approach has been to create frameworks that help us look back at and categorize past tangible interaction systems, and look forward at the possibilities and opportunities for developing new systems. To date, a number of different frameworks have been proposed that each provide different perspectives on the tangible interaction design space, and which can guide designers of new systems in different ways. In this paper, we map the space of tangible interaction frameworks. We order existing frameworks by their general type, and by the facets of tangible interaction design they address. One of our main conclusions is that most frameworks focus predominantly on the conceptual design of tangible systems, whereas fewer frameworks abstract the knowledge gained from previous systems, and hardly any framework provides concrete steps or tools for building new tangible systems. In addition, the facets most represented in existing frameworks are those that address the interactions with or the physicality of the designed systems. Other facets, such as domain-specific technology and experience, are rare. This focus on design, interaction, and physicality is interesting, as the origins of the field are rooted in engineering methods and have only recently started to incorporate more design-inspired approaches. As such, we expected more frameworks to focus on technologies and to provide concrete building suggestions for new tangible interaction systems.",

The research in this article is an attempt to understand how novelty of a design resulting from a design process is related to the kind of outcomes, described here as constructs, involved in the design process. A model of causality, the SAPPhIRE model, is used as the basis of the analysis. The analysis is based on previous research that shows that designing involves development and exploration of the seven basic constructs of the SAPPhIRE model that constitute the causal connection between the various levels of abstraction at which a design can be described. The constructs are s tate change, a ction, p arts, ph enomenon, i nput, o r gans, and e ffect. The following two questions are asked. Is there a relationship between novelty and the constructs? If there is a relationship, what is the degree of this relationship? A hypothesis is developed to answer the questions: an increase in the number and variety of ideas explored while designing should enhance the variety of concept space, leading to an increase in the novelty of the concept space. Eight existing observational studies of designing sessions are used to empirically validate the hypothesis. Each designing session involves an individual designer, experienced or novice, solving a design problem by producing concepts and following a think-aloud protocol. The results indicate dependence of novelty of concept space on variety of concept space and dependence of variety of concept space on variety of idea space, thereby validating the hypothesis. The results also reveal a strong correlation between novelty and the constructs; correlation value decreases as the abstraction level of the constructs reduces, signifying the importance of using constructs at higher abstraction levels for enhancing novelty.",

The use of neural networks makes the creation of such a system possible. The proposed method uses a system of three blocks of neural networks, and involves the creation of neural networks to be used for the selection of machines, tools, and machining parameters. These networks are built for each process operation separately; that is, a set of neural networks is created for each selection. For the construction of models, different types of neural networks (multilayer networks with error backpropagation, radial basis function, and Kohonen) with different structures were employed, and the networks that made the best selections were identified. A method was also developed for the elimination of defects occurring during the production process. When a defect comes to light, this method suggests changes to the technological process, thus improving the quality of that process. Guidelines for the elimination of defects are produced in the form of decision rules. Such a computer-aided process planning system will be especially useful for process engineers who do not yet have sufficient experience in the design of technological processes, or who have only recently joined a particular manufacturing enterprise and are not fully familiar with its machines and other means of production (tools and instrumentation). It should be emphasized that such a system performs an advisory role, and it is always the process engineer who makes the final decision. The neural network models were tested on real data from an enterprise. A computer-aided process planning system based on rules and neural network models enables the intelligent design of technological processes.",

Users can generate a familiar connection between their bodies and the virtual world by being embodied in virtual hands, and hand representations can induce users’ embodiment in VR. The sense of embodiment represents the cognitive awareness of one's manifestation and includes three subcomponents: the sense of body ownership, agency and self-location. There is insufficient evidence in the literature about the effects of hand designs on the embodiment, especially based on studying its three subcomponents. This study investigates how virtual hand designs with five realism levels influence the three subcomponents of embodiment in VR. This research employs a self-report questionnaire commonly used in the literature to assess embodiment and evaluates agency and self-location by introducing implicit methods (intentional binding and proprioceptive measurement) derived from psychology. Besides, the objective data of eye tracking is used to explore the connection between embodiment and hand designs, and classifying participants’ eye tracking data to help analyze the link between embodiment and user attention. Overall, this research makes a major contribution through a systematic exploration of users’ embodied experience in VR and offers important evidence of the effects of virtual hand designs on body ownership, agency, and self-location, respectively. In addition, this study provides a valuable reference for further investigation of embodiment through implicit and objective methods, and practical design recommendations for virtual hand design in VR applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Personas are hypothetical representations of real-world people used as storytelling tools to help designers identify the goals, constraints, and scenarios of particular user groups. A well-constructed persona can provide enough detail to trigger recognition and empathy while leaving room for varying interpretations of users. While a traditional persona is a static representation of a potential user group, a chatbot representation of a persona is dynamic, in that it allows designers to “converse with” the representation. Such representations are further augmented by the use of large language models (LLMs), displaying more human-like characteristics such as emotions, priorities, and values. In this paper, we introduce the term “Synthetic User” to describe such representations of personas that are informed by traditional data and augmented by synthetic data. We study the effect of one example of such a Synthetic User – embodied as a chatbot – on the designers’ process, outcome, and their perception of the persona using a between-subjects study comparing it to a traditional persona summary. While designers showed comparable diversity in the ideas that emerged from both conditions, we find in the Synthetic User condition a greater variation in how designers perceive the persona’s attributes. We also find that the Synthetic User allows novel interactions such as seeking feedback and testing assumptions. We make suggestions for balancing consistency and variation in Synthetic User performance and propose guidelines for future development.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article presents a novel conversational artificial intelligence (CAI)-enabled active ideation system as a creative idea generation tool to assist novice product designers in mitigating the initial latency and ideation bottlenecks that are commonly observed. It is a dynamic, interactive, and contextually responsive approach, actively involving a large language model (LLM) from the domain of natural language processing (NLP) in artificial intelligence (AI) to produce multiple statements of potential ideas for different design problems. Integrating such AI models with ideation creates what we refer to as an active ideation scenario , which helps foster continuous dialog-based interaction, context-sensitive conversation, and prolific idea generation. An empirical study was conducted with 30 novice product designers to generate multiple ideas for given problems using traditional methods and the new CAI-based interface. The ideas generated by both methods were qualitatively evaluated by a panel of experts. The findings demonstrated the relative superiority of the proposed tool for generating prolific, meaningful, novel, and diverse ideas. The interface was enhanced by incorporating a prompt-engineered structured dialog style for each ideation stage to make it uniform and more convenient for the product designers. A pilot study was conducted and the resulting responses of such a structured CAI interface were found to be more succinct and aligned toward the subsequent design stage. The article thus established the rich potential of using generative AI (Gen-AI) for the early ill-structured phase of the creative product design process.",

The problem of this method is that the performance of these rules depends on the state the system is in at each moment, and no single rule exists that is better than the rest in all the possible states that the system may be in. It would therefore be interesting to use the most appropriate dispatching rule at each moment. To achieve this goal, a scheduling approach which uses machine learning can be used. Analyzing the previous performance of the system (training examples) by means of this technique, knowledge is obtained that can be used to decide which is the most appropriate dispatching rule at each moment in time. In this paper, a review of the main machine learning-based scheduling approaches described in the literature is presented.",

Traditionally, representation methods for technical configuration have focused either on reasoning about structure of systems or quantity of components, which is not satisfactory in many target areas that need both. Starting from general requirements on configuration systems, we have developed an extension of the standard CSP model. The constraint-based approach allows a simple system architecture, and a declarative description of the different types of configuration knowledge. Knowledge bases are described in terms of a component-centered knowledge base written in an object-oriented representation language with semantics directly based on the underlying constraint model. The approach combines a simple, declarative representation with the ability to configure large-scale systems and is in use for actual production applications.",

Five proposals for approaches to correct this deficiency are offered: opportunities for clinical practice throughout all the undergraduate years; the use of distributed interactive simulation technology in semester-long projects; courses or course material on the phenomenology and behavior of systems; use of project management tools in engineering clinics; and encouraging engineering faculty to spend some part of their sabbaticals engaged in system design or operation.

    "abstract": "Abstract Shape annealing, a computational design method applied to structural design, has been extended to the design of traditional and innovative three-dimensional domes that incorporate the design goals of efficiency, economy, utility, and elegance. In contrast to deterministic structural optimization methods, shape annealing, a stochastic method, uses lateral exploration to generate multiple designs of similar quality that form a structural language of solutions. Structural languages can serve to enhance designer creativity by presenting multiple, spatially innovative, yet functional design solutions while also providing insight into the interaction between structural form and the trade-offs involved in multi-objective design. The style of the structures within a language is a product of the shape grammar that defines the allowable structural forms and the optimization model that provides a functional measure of the generated forms to determine the desirable designs. This paper presents an application of geodesic dome patterns that have been embodied in a shape grammar to define a structural language of domes. Within this language of domes, different dome styles are generated by changing the optimization model for dome design to include the design goals of maximum enclosure space, minimum surface area, minimum number of distinct cross-sectional areas, and visual uniformity. The strengths of the method that will be shown are 1) the generation of both conventional domes similar to shape optimization results and spatially innovative domes, 2) the generation of design alternatives within a defined design style, and 3) the generation of different design styles by modifying the language semantics provided by the optimization model.",

The principal barrier to the general use of EAs for those problems is the huge number of function evaluations that is often required. This makes EAs an impractical approach when the function evaluation depends on numerically heavy design analysis tools, for example, finite elements methods. This paper presents the use of kriging interpolation as a function approximation method for the construction of an internal model of the fitness landscape.

Our primary foundation is based upon the concept that engineering analysis models are knowledge-based abstractions of physical systems, and therefore knowledge sharing is the key to exchanging, adapting, and interoperating EAMs within or across organizations. To enable robust knowledge sharing, we propose a formal set of ontologies for classifying analysis modeling knowledge. To this end, the fundamental concepts that form the basis of all engineering analysis models are identified, described, and typed for implementation into a computational environment. This generic engineering analysis modeling ontology is extended to include distinct analysis subclasses. We discuss extension of the generic engineering analysis modeling class for two common analysis subclasses: continuum-based finite element models and lumped parameter or discrete analysis models. To illustrate how formal ontologies of engineering analysis modeling knowledge might facilitate knowledge exchange and improve reuse, adaptability, and interoperability of analysis models, we have developed a prototype engineering analysis modeling knowledge base, called ON-TEAM, based on our proposed ontologies. An industrial application is used to instantiate the ON-TEAM knowledge base and illustrate how such a system might improve the ability of organizations to efficiently exchange, adapt, and interoperate analysis models within a computer-based engineering environment. We have chosen Java as our implementation language for ON-TEAM so that we can fully exploit object-oriented technology, such as object inspection and the use of metaclasses and metaobjects, to operate on the knowledge base to perform a variety of tasks, such as knowledge inspection, editing, maintenance, model diagnosis, customized report generation of analysis models, model selection, automated customization of the knowledge interface based on the user expertise level, and interoperability assessment of distinct analysis models.",

    "abstract": "Abstract When engineering content is created and applied during the product life cycle, it is often stored and forgotten. Current information retrieval approaches based on statistical methods and keyword matching are not effective in understanding the context of engineering content. They are not designed to be directly applicable to the engineering domain. Therefore, engineers have very limited means to harness and reuse past designs. The overall objective of our research is to develop an engineering ontology (EO)-based computational framework to structure unstructured engineering documents and achieve more effective information retrieval. This paper focuses on the method and process to acquire and validate the EO. The main contributions include a new, systematic, and more structured ontology development method assisted by a semiautomatic acquisition tool. This tool is integrated with Protégé ontology editing environment; an engineering lexicon (EL) that represents the associated lexical knowledge of the EO to bridge the gap between the concept space of the ontology and the word space of engineering documents and queries; the first large-scale EO and EL acquired from established knowledge resources for engineering information retrieval; and a comprehensive validation strategy and its implementations to justify the quality of the acquired EO. A search system based on the EO and EL has been developed and tested. The retrieval performance test further justifies the effectiveness of the EO and EL as well as the ontology development method.",

Because language has been shown to be important to the reasoning process in general as well as to specific reasoning processes that are central to the design process, we are investigating the relationship between language and conceptual design. The use of language to facilitate different stages of the design process has been investigated in the past. Our previous work, and the work of others, showed that ideas produced can be expressed through related hierarchical lexical relationships, so we investigated the use of verbs within these hierarchical relationships as stimuli for ideas. Participants were provided with four problems and related verb stimuli, and asked to develop concepts using the stimuli provided. The stimuli sets were generated by exploring verb hierarchies based on functional words from the problem statements. We found that participants were most successful when using lower level (more specific) verbs as stimuli, and often higher level general verbs were only used successfully in conjunction with lower level verbs. We also observed that intransitive verbs (verbs that cannot take a direct object) were less likely to be used successfully in the development of concepts. Overall, we found that the verb chosen as stimulus by the participant directly affects the success and the type of concept developed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Engineering design reviews, which take place at predetermined phases of the product development process, are fundamental elements for the evaluation and control of engineering activities. These meetings are also acknowledged as unique opportunities for all the parties involved to share information about the product and related engineering processes. For product development teams, the knowledge generated during a design review is not as secondary as it may seem; key design decisions, design experiences, and associated rationale are frequently made explicit. Useful work has been carried out on the design review process itself, but little work has been undertaken about the detailed content of the meeting activity; it is argued that understanding the transactions that take place during a meeting is critical to building an effective knowledge-oriented recording strategy. To this effect, an extensive research program based on case studies in the aerospace engineering domain has been carried out. The work reported in this paper focuses on a set of tools and methods developed to characterize and analyze in depth the transactions observed during a number of case studies. The first methodology developed, the transcript coding scheme, uses an intelligent segmentation of meeting discourse transcriptions. The second approach, which bypasses the time consuming transcribing operation, is based on a meeting capture template developed to enable a meeting observer to record the transactions as the meeting takes place. A third method, the information mapping technique, has also been developed to interpret the case study data in terms of decisions, actions, rationale, and lessons learned, effectively generating qualitative measures of the information lost in the formal records of design reviews. Overall, the results generated by the set of tools presented in this paper have fostered a practical strategy for the knowledge intensive capture of the contents of design reviews. The concluding remarks also discuss possible enhancements to the meeting analysis tools presented in this paper and future work aimed at the development of a computer supported capture software for design reviews.",

Although cognitive processes are at the center in developing new ideas, they are rarely taken into account in research and development of design support methods and systems. It is conceivable that if one understands how cognitive processes are stimulated to generate design ideas, then more effective methods and tools can be developed to support conceptual design. In this article, a cognitive model of conceptual design is developed to capture the relationships among design entities, design operations, and cognitive processes. A protocol analysis is performed to evaluate the model, and a cognitive experiment carried out to study the creative patterns and stimulating relationships. The results show that designers exhibit patterns of creative design behavior, and that these patterns can be captured and instilled into the design process to promote creativity.",

We capture the meanings that engineers attach to these concepts by formalizing, within the formal ontology DOLCE, the five meanings of artifact behavior and the two meanings of function that Chandrasekaran and Josephson identified in 2000 within the functional representation approach. We begin our formalization by reserving the term “behavior” of a technical artifact as “the specific way in which the artifact occurs in an event.” This general notion is characterized formally, and used to provide definitions of actual behaviors of artifacts, and the physically possible and physically impossible behaviors that rational agents believe that artifacts have. We also define several other notions, for example, input and output behaviors of artifacts, and then show that these ontologically characterized concepts give a general framework in which Chandrasekaran and Josephson's meanings of behavior can be explicitly formalized. Finally we show how Chandrasekaran and Josephson's two meanings of artifact functions, namely, device-centric and environment-centric functions, can be captured in DOLCE via the concepts of behavioral constraint and mode of deployment of an artifact. A more general goal of this work is to show that foundational ontologies are suited to the engineering domain: they can facilitate information sharing and exchange in the various engineering domains by providing concept structures and clarifications that make explicit and precise important engineering notions. The meanings of the terms “behavior” and “function” in domains like designing, redesigning, reverse engineering, product architecture, and engineering knowledge bases are often ambiguous or overloaded. Our results show that foundational ontologies can accommodate the variety of denotations these terms have and can explain their relationships.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Gestures play an important role in communication. They support the listener, who is trying to understand the speaker. However, they also support the speaker by facilitating the conceptualization and verbalization of messages and reducing cognitive load. Gestures thus play an important role in collaboration and also in problem-solving tasks. In human–computer interaction, gestures are also used to facilitate communication with digital applications, because their expressive nature can enable less constraining and more intuitive digital interactions than conventional user interfaces. Although gesture research in the social sciences typically considers empty-handed gestures, digital gesture interactions often make use of hand-held objects or touch surfaces to capture gestures that would be difficult to track in free space. In most cases, the physical objects used to make these gestures serve primarily as a means of sensing or input. In contrast, tangible interaction makes use of physical objects as embodiments of digital information. The physical objects in a tangible interface thus serve as representations as well as controls for the digital information they are associated with. Building on this concept, gesture interaction has the potential to make use of the physical properties of hand-held objects to enhance or change the functionality of the gestures made. In this paper, we look at the design opportunities that arise at the intersection of gesture and tangible interaction. We believe that gesturing while holding physical artifacts opens up a new interaction design space for collaborative digital applications that is largely unexplored. We provide a survey of gesture interaction work as it relates to tangible and touch interaction. Based on this survey, we define the design space of tangible gesture interaction as the use of physical devices for facilitating, supporting, enhancing, or tracking gestures people make for digital interaction purposes, and outline the design opportunities in this space.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Functional modeling is a very significant part of many different well-known design methodologies. This paper investigates the questions of what functional modeling approaches people use in industry and how they conceptualize functions. Using interviews and the findings from an experiment where 20 individual designers were asked to generate a functional model of a product, the paper highlights the different notions designers associate with the word function . Difficulties associated with functional modeling arise from varied and inconsistent notions of functions as well as wider challenges associated with modeling and the introduction of methods in industry.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper presents a preliminary comparison between the role of computer-aided design (CAD) and sketching in engineering through a case study of a senior design project and interviews with industry and academia. The design team consisted of four senior level mechanical engineering students each with less than 1 year of professional experience are observed while completing an industry sponsored mechanical engineering capstone design project across a 17 week semester. Factors investigated include what CAD tools are used, when in the design process they are implemented, the justification for their use from the students' perspectives, the actual knowledge gained from their use, the impact on the final designed artifact, and the contributions of any sketches generated. At each design step, comparisons are made between CAD and sketching. The students implemented CAD tools at the onset of the project, generally failing to realize gains in design efficiency or effectiveness in the early conceptual phases of the design process. As the design became more concrete, the team was able to recognize clear gains in both efficiency and effectiveness through the use of computer assisted design programs. This study is augmented by interviews with novice and experienced industry users and academic instructors to align the trends observed in the case study with industry practice and educational emphasis. A disconnect in the perceived capability of CAD tools was found between novice and experienced user groups. Opinions on the importance of sketching skills differed between novice educators and novice industry professionals, suggesting that there is a change of opinion as to the importance of sketching formed when recent graduates transition from academia to industry. The results suggest that there is a need to emphasize the importance of sketching and a deeper understanding as to the true utility of CAD tools at each stage of the design process.",

This work on conceptual design uses a family of representations called structure–behavior–function (SBF) models. The SBF family ranges from behavior–function models of abstract design patterns to drawing–shape–SBF models that couple SBF models with visuospatial knowledge of technological systems. Development of SBF modeling is an instance of cognitively oriented artificial intelligence research that seeks to understand human cognition and build intelligent agents for addressing complex tasks such as design. This paper first traces the development of SBF modeling as our perspective on design evolved from that of problem solving to that of memory and learning. Next, the development of SBF modeling as a case study is used to abstract some of the core principles of an artificial intelligence methodology for functional modeling. Finally, some implications of the artificial intelligence methodology for different meanings of function are examined.",

However, due to the complexity embedded in biological systems, adding to the lack of structured, detailed, and searchable knowledge bases, engineering designers find it hard to access the knowledge in the biological domain, which therefore poses challenges in understanding the biological concepts in order to apply these concepts to engineering design problems. In order to assist the engineering designers in problem-solving, we report, in this paper, a web-based tool called Idea-Inspire 4.0 that supports analogical design using two broad features. First, the tool provides access to a number of biological systems using a searchable knowledge base. Second, it explains each one of these biological systems using a multi-modal representation: that is, using function decomposition model, text, function model, image, video, and audio. In this paper, we report two experiments that test how well the multi-modal representation in Idea-Inspire 4.0 supports understanding and application of biological concepts in engineering design problems. In one experiment, we use Bloom's method to test “ analysis ” and “ synthesis ” levels of understanding of a biological system. In the next experiment, we provide an engineering design problem along with a biological-analogous system and examine the novelty and requirement-satisfaction (two major indicators of creativity) of resulting design solutions. In both the experiments, the biological system (analogue) was provided using Idea-Inspire 4.0 as well as using a conventional text-image representation so that the efficacy of Idea-Inspire 4.0 is tested using a benchmark.",

Based on the characteristics of the product design process, we divided design problem statements into open-ended (OE), decision-making (DM), and constrained (CO) statements and attempted to investigate the influences of different problem statements on designers’ cognitive behaviors from three perspectives, namely divergent thinking, convergent thinking, and mental workload. Then we provided quantification description to these influences based on electroencephalography (EEG) technology. We conducted experiments on 19 participants and used the BrainProduct™ actiChamp-32 to record the EEG data. Results are as follows: (1) The higher task-related α power was found in the temporal and occipital regions in the OE task compared with that in the DM and CO tasks. The OE statement also would help designers get novel ideas by strengthening their divergent thinking. (2) In the DM and CO tasks, there was no significant difference in the impact of the brain region on convergent thinking, but activities in the left hemisphere were stronger than that in the right hemisphere. The DM and CO tasks have better performance in convergent thinking than the OE task. (3) In the CO task, the designer's mental workload is the highest and mainly related to the activation of the centroparietal and occipital regions. These findings help designers understand the design problem-solving process from the perspective of cognitive science and monitor their thinking modes in the design process so as to improve their design performance.",

Typically, a single surrogate model is selected based on the previous experience. We observe, based on an analysis of the published literature, that fitting an ensemble of surrogates (EoS) based on cross-validation errors is more accurate but requires more computational time. In this paper, we propose a method to build an EoS that is both accurate and less computationally expensive. In the proposed method, the EoS is a weighted average surrogate of response surface models, kriging, and radial basis functions based on overall cross-validation error. We demonstrate that created EoS is accurate than individual surrogates even when fewer data points are used, so computationally efficient with relatively insensitive predictions. We demonstrate the use of an EoS using hot rod rolling as an example. Finally, we include a rule-based template which can be used for other problems with similar requirements, for example, the computational time, required accuracy, and the size of the data.",

Keywords derived from these research questions led to 975 records initially retrieved from 7 scientific search engines. Finally, 86 articles were selected for inclusion in the review. As the primary research finding, we identified 15 ML-based requirement elicitation tasks and classified them into four categories. Twelve different data sources for building a data-driven model are identified and classified in this literature review. In addition, we categorized the techniques for constructing ML-based requirement elicitation methods into five parts, which are Data Cleansing and Preprocessing , Textual Feature Extraction, Learning, Evaluation, and Tools . More specifically, 3 categories of preprocessing methods, 3 different feature extraction strategies, 12 different families of learning methods, 2 different evaluation strategies, and various off-the-shelf publicly available tools were identified. Furthermore, we discussed the limitations of the current studies and proposed eight potential directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Surface roughness (SR) is one of the major parameters used to govern the quality of the fused deposition modeling (FDM)-printed products, and the FDM process parameters can be easily regulated in order to obtain a good surface finish. The surface quality of the product produced by the FDM is generally affected by the staircase effect that needs to be managed. Also, the production time (PT) to fabricate the product and volume percentage error (VPE) should be minimized to make the FDM process more efficient. The aim of this paper is to accomplish these three objectives with the use of the parametric optimization technique integrating the artificial neural network (ANN) and the whale optimization algorithm (WOA). The FDM parameters which have been taken into consideration are layer thickness, nozzle temperature, printing speed, and raster width. Experimentation has been conducted on printed samples to examine the impact of the input parameters on SR, VPE, and PT according to Taguchi's L27 orthogonal array. The ANN model has been built up using the experimental data, which was further used as an objective function in the WOA with an aim to minimize output responses. The robustness of the proposed method has been validated on the optimal combinations of FDM process parameters.",

In this study, we propose using this technology to facilitate design conversations in large-scale urban development projects by creating chatbot systems that can automate and streamline information exchange between stakeholders and designers. To this end, we developed and evaluated a proof-of-concept chatbot system that can perform design conversations on a specific construction project and convert those conversations into a list of requirements. Next, in an experiment with 56 participants, we compared the chatbot system to a regular online survey, focusing on user satisfaction and the quality and quantity of collected information. The results revealed that, with regard to user satisfaction, the participants preferred the chatbot experience to a regular survey. However, we found that chatbot conversations produced more data than the survey, with a similar rate of novel ideas but fewer themes. Our findings provide robust evidence that chatbots can be effectively used for design discussions in large-scale design projects and offer a user-friendly experience that can help to engage people in the design process. Based on this evidence, by providing a space for meaningful conversations between stakeholders and expanding the reach of design projects, the use of chatbot systems in interactive design systems can potentially improve design processes and their outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Today's economy exhibits a growing trend toward highly specialized solution providers cooperatively offering configurable products and services to their customers. This paradigm shift requires the extension of current standalone configuration technology with capabilities of knowledge sharing and distributed problem solving. In this context a standardized configuration knowledge representation language with formal semantics is needed in order to support knowledge interchange between different configuration environments. Languages such as Ontology Inference Layer (OIL) and DARPA Agent Markup Language (DAML+OIL) are based on such formal semantics (description logic) and are very popular for knowledge representation in the Semantic Web. In this paper we analyze the applicability of those languages with respect to configuration knowledge representation and discuss additional demands on expressivity. For joint configuration problem solving it is necessary to agree on a common problem definition. Therefore, we give a description logic based definition of a configuration problem and show its equivalence with existing consistency-based definitions, thus joining the two major streams in knowledge-based configuration (description logics and predicate logic/constraint based configuration).",

Key issues include the development of an architecture that supports collaboration among specialists, the development of hierarchical representations that capture different characteristics of the design, and the decomposition of tasks to achieve a trade-off between efficiency and robustness. An architecture is presented in which the main design tasks are supported by agents – asynchronous and semiautonomous modules that automate routine design tasks and provide specialized interfaces for working on particular aspects of the design. The agent communication and coordination mechanisms permit members of an engineering team to work concurrently, at different levels of detail and on different versions of the design. The design is represented hierarchically, with detailed models maintained by the participating agents. Abstractions of the detailed models, called “agent model images,” are shared with other agents. In conjunction with the architecture and design representations, issues pertaining to the exchange of information among different views of the design, management of dependencies and constraints, and propagation of design changes are discussed.",

The methodology consists of four steps: redundancy creation, state prediction, sensor measurement validation and fusion, and fault detection through residue change detection. Through these four steps we use the information that can be obtained by looking at: information from a sensor individually, information from the sensor as part of a group of sensors, and the immediate history of the process that is being monitored. The advantage of this methodology is that it can detect multiple sensor failures, both abrupt as well as incipient. It can also detect subtle sensor failures such as drift in calibration and degradation of the sensor. The four-step methodology is applied to data from a gas turbine power plant.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Contributions of general design theory (GDT) proposed by Yoshikawa for the development of advanced CAD (computer-aided design) and for innovative design from the research results of a group at the University of Tokyo are illustrated. First, the GDT that formalizes design knowledge based on axiomatic set theory is reviewed. Second, this theoretical result is tested against experimental work on design processes. Although in principle the theoretical results agree with the experimental findings, some problems can be pointed out. From these problems a new design process model, called the refinement model, is established, which has better agreement with the experimental findings. This model implies three guiding principles in developing a future CAD system. One is that future CAD requires a mechanism for physics-centered modeling and multiple model management. Second, a mechanism for function modeling is also required, and the FBS (function-behavior-state) modeling is proposed. Third, intention modeling is also proposed for recording decision-making processes in design. These advanced modeling techniques enable creative, innovative designs. As an example, the design of self-maintenance machines is illustrated. This design example utilizes design knowledge intensively on a knowledge-intensive CAD. This is a new way of engineering and can be called knowledge-intensive engineering. The design of self-maintenance machines is, therefore, an example of knowledge-intensive design of knowledge-intensive products, which demonstrates the power of the design methodology derived from the GDT.",

Given a design problem, the model defines a computational economy to allocate basic resources to agents participating in the design. The result of running these “design economies” constitutes the market solution to the original problem. After defining the configuration design framework, the mapping to computational economies and the results to date are described. For some simple examples, the system can produce good designs relatively quickly. However, analysis shows that the design economies are not guaranteed to find optimal designs, and some of the major pitfalls are identified and discussed. Despite known shortcomings and limited explorations thus far, the market model offers a useful conceptual viewpoint for analyzing distributed design problems.",

    "abstract": "In this paper a unique design methodology known as 1stPRINCE (FIRST PRINciple Computational Evalualor) is developed to perform innovative design of mechanical structures from first principle knowledge. The method is based on the assumption that the creation of innovative designs of physical significance, concerning geometric and material properties, requires reasoning from first principles . The innovative designs discovered by 1stPRINCE differ from routine designs in that new primitives are created. Monotonicity analysis and computer algebra are utilized to direct design variables in a globally optimal direction relative to the goals specified. In contrast to strict constraint propagation approaches, formal qualitative optimization techniques efficiently search the solution space in an optimizing direction, eliminate infeasible and suboptimal designs, and reason with both equality and inequality constraints. Modification of the design configuration space and the creation of new primitives, in order to meet the constraints or improve the design, are achieved by manipulating mathematical quantities such as the integral. The result is a design system which requires a knowledge base only of fundamental equations of deformation with physical constraints on variables, constitutive relations, and fundamental engineering assumptions; no pre-compiled knowledge of mechanical behavior is needed. Application of this theory to the design of a beam under torsion leads to designs of a hollow tube and a composite rod exhibiting globally optimal behavior. Further, these optimally-behaved designs are described symbolically as a function of the material properties and system parameters. This method is implemented in a LISP environment as a module in a larger intelligent CAD system that integrates qualitative, functional and numerical computation for engineering applications.",

Design researchers are viewed as a single communicating community searching for scientific theories of engineering design; that is, theories that can be tested by formal methods of hypothesis testing. In the paper, the scientific method for validating theories is reviewed, and the need for operational definitions and for experiments to identify variables and meaningful abstractions is stressed. The development of a design problem taxonomy is advocated. Generating theories is viewed as guided search. Three types of design theories are described: prescriptive, cognitive descriptive, and computational. It is argued that to seek prescriptions is premature and that, unless the human and institutional variables are reduced to knowledge and control, cognitive descriptive theories will be impossibly complex. A case is made for a computational approach, though it also shown that computational and cognitive research approaches can be mutually supportive.",

The support offered to these engineers by existing modeling tools such as the function tree and the function structure is limited because they are not intuitive and do not scale well to deal with real-world engineering problems. A research collaboration between two universities and a major power system company in the aerospace domain has allowed the authors to further develop a method for function analysis known as function analysis diagram that was already in use by line engineers. The capability to generate and edit these diagrams was implemented in the Decision Rationale editor, a software tool for capturing design rationale. This article presents the intended benefits of the method and justifies them using an engineering case study. The results of the research have shown that the function analysis diagram method has a simple notation, permits the modeling of product functions together with structure, allows the generation of rich and accurate descriptions of product functionality, is useful to work with variant and adaptive design tasks, and can coexist with other functional modeling methods.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Spatial grammars are rule based, generative systems for the specification of formal languages. Set and shape grammar formulations of spatial grammars enable the definition of spatial design languages and the creation of alternative designs. Since the introduction of the underlying formalism, they have been successfully applied to different domains including visual arts, architecture, and engineering. Although many spatial grammars exist on paper, only a few, limited spatial grammar systems have been computationally implemented to date; this is especially true for three-dimensional (3-D) systems. Most spatial grammars are hard-coded, that is, once implemented, the vocabulary and rules cannot be changed without reprogramming. This article presents a new approach and prototype implementation for a 3-D spatial grammar interpreter that enables interactive, visual development and application of grammar rules. The method is based on a set grammar that uses a set of parameterized primitives and includes the definition of nonparametric and parametric rules, as well as their automatic application. A method for the automatic matching of the left hand side of a rule in a current working shape, including defining parametric relations, is outlined. A prototype implementation is presented and used to illustrate the approach through three examples: the “kindergarten grammar,” vehicle wheel rims, and cylinder cooling fins. This approach puts the creation and use of 3-D spatial grammars on a more general level and supports designers with facilitated definition and application of their own rules in a familiar computer-aided design environment without requiring programming.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this article, two methods to develop and optimize accompanying building spatial and structural designs are compared. The first, a coevolutionary method, applies deterministic procedures, inspired by realistic design processes, to cyclically add a suitable structural design to the input of a spatial design, evaluate and improve the structural design via the finite element method and topology optimization, adjust the spatial design according to the improved structural design, and modify the spatial design such that the initial spatial requirements are fulfilled. The second method uses a genetic algorithm that works on a population of accompanying building spatial and structural designs, using the finite element method for evaluation. If specific performance indicators and spatial requirements are used (i.e., total strain energy, spatial volume, and number of spaces), both methods provide optimized building designs; however, the coevolutionary method yields even better designs in a faster and more direct manner, whereas the genetic algorithm based method provides more design variants. Both methods show that collaborative design, for example, via design modification in one domain (here spatial) to optimize the design in another domain (here structural) can be as effective as monodisciplinary optimization; however, it may need adjustments to avoid the designs becoming progressively unrealistic. Designers are informed of the merits and disadvantages of design process simulation and design instance exploration, whereas scientists learn from a first fully operational and automated method for design process simulation, which is verified with a genetic algorithm and subject to future improvements and extensions in the community.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Is biologically inspired design only an analogical transfer from biology to engineering? Actually, nature does not always bring “hands-on” solutions that can be analogically applied in classic engineering. Then, what are the different operations that are involved in the bioinspiration process and what are the conditions allowing this process to produce a bioinspired design? In this paper, we model the whole design process in which bioinspiration is only one element. To build this model, we use a general design theory, concept–knowledge theory, because it allows one to capture analogy as well as all other knowledge changes that lead to the design of a bioinspired solution. We ground this model on well-described examples of biologically inspired designs available in the scientific literature. These examples include Flectofin ® , a hingeless flapping mechanism conceived for façade shading, and WhalePower technology, the introduction of bumps on the leading edge of airfoils to improve aerodynamic properties. Our modeling disentangles the analogical aspects of the biologically inspired design process, and highlights the expansions occurring in both knowledge bases, scientific (nonbiological) and biological, as well as the impact of these expansions in the generation of new concepts (concept partitioning). This model also shows that bioinspired design requires a special form of collaboration between engineers and biologists. Contrasting with the classic one-way transfer between biology and engineering that is assumed in the literature, the concept–knowledge framework shows that these collaborations must be “mutually inspirational” because both biological and engineering knowledge expansions are needed to reach a novel solution.",

The article in question and the ASME Conference Proceedings paper were submitted for review with AI EDAM and the ASME at similar times, but copyright was assigned to ASME before the paper was accepted in AI EDAM and therefore the article in AI EDAM is being retracted. (In recent years, industrial nations around the globe have invested heavily in new technologies, software, and services to advance digital design and manufacturing using cyber-physical systems, data analytics, and high-performance computing. Many of these initiatives, such as cloud-based design and manufacturing, fall under the umbrella of what has become known as Industry 4.0 or Industrial Internet and are often hailed as pillars of a new industrial revolution. While an increasing number of companies are developing or already offer commercial cloud-based software packages and services for digital design and manufacturing, little work has been reported on providing a review of the state of the art of these commercial software and services as well as identifying research gaps in this field. The objective of this paper is to present a state-of-the-art review of digital design and manufacturing software and services that are currently available on the cloud. The focus of this paper is on assessing to what extent engineering design, engineering analysis, manufacturing, and production across all phases of the product development lifecycles can already be performed based on the software and services accessed through the cloud. In addition, the key capabilities and benefits of these software packages and services are discussed. Based on the assessment of the core features of commercial software and services, it can be concluded that almost all phases of product realization can be conducted through digital design and manufacturing software and services on the cloud. Finally, existing research gaps and related challenges to overcome are identified. The state-of-the-art review serves to provide a technology guide for decision makers in their efforts to select suitable cloud-based software and services as alternatives to existing in-house resources as well as to recommend new research areas.)",

This pilot study reports on an initial quantification of such uncertainty associated with building energy performance and develops a method for informing decision makers of the risks in early design decisions under this uncertainty. Two case studies of building design decision situations under this uncertainty are explored along with using two different energy modeling tools: a reduced-order model and a high-order model. The intended contribution is to identify if a decision can be made with confidence in early design given a high level of uncertainty in the evolution of a design and what models can support decisions of this sort. Integration of the proposed decision support approach with a computer-aided design model is shown as well.",

This system leverages experience from the product aspects in design by analogy tool that identifies candidate products for between-domain design by analogy. SEABIRD is based on two conceptual representations, product and organism aspects, extracted from, respectively, a patent and a biological database, that enable leveraging the ever growing body of natural-language biological texts in the systematic bioinspired design process by eliminating interactive work by humans during corpus expansion. SEABIRD's search is illustrated and validated with three well-known biologically inspired design cases.",

The study involved eight participants who completed a defined architectural design task using Rhino and Grasshopper software: a typical PDE. The method of protocol analysis was employed to study the cognitive behaviors that occurred while these designers were working in the PDE. By analyzing the way in which the designers shifted between “problem” and “solution” spaces in the PDE, characteristics of the coevolutionary design process are identified and discussed. Results of this research include two potentially significant observations. First, the coevolution process occurs frequently within the design knowledge level (i.e., when using Rhino) and within the rule algorithm level (i.e., when using Grasshopper) of the parametric design process. Second, the designers’ coevolution process was focused on the design knowledge level at the beginning of the design session, while they focused more on the rule algorithm level toward the end of the design session. These results support an improved understanding of the design process that occurs in PDEs.",

From this simple observation we derive the obscure features hypothesis: every innovative solution is built upon at least one commonly overlooked or new (i.e., obscure) feature of the problem. By using a new definition of a feature as an effect of an interaction, we are able to accomplish five things. First, we are able to determine where features come from and how to search for new ones. Second, we are able to construct mathematical arguments that the set of features of an object is not computably enumerable. Third, we are able to characterize innovative problem solving as looking for a series of interactions that produce the desired effects (i.e., the goal). Fourth, we are able to construct a precise problem-solving grammar that is both human and machine friendly. Fifth, we are able to devise a visual and verbal problem-solving representation that both humans and computers can contribute to as they help counteract each other's problem-solving weaknesses. We show how computers can counter some of the known cognitive obstacles to innovation that humans have. We also briefly discuss ways in which humans can return the favor. We conclude that a promising process for innovative problem solving is a human–computer collaboration in which each partner assists the other in unearthing the obscure features of a problem.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Functional modeling is an analytical approach to design problems that is widely taught in certain academic communities but not often used by practitioners. This approach can be applied in multiple ways to formalize the understanding of the systems, to support the synthesis of the design in the development of a new product, or to support the analysis and improvement of existing systems incrementally. The type of usage depends on the objectives that are targeted. The objectives can be categorized into two key groups: discovering a totally new solution, or improving an existing one. This article proposes to use the functional modeling approach to achieve three goals: to support the representation of physics-based reasoning, to use this physics-based reasoning to assess design options, and finally to support innovative ideation. The exemplification of the function-based approach is presented via a case study of a glue gun proposed for this Special Issue. A reverse engineering approach is applied, and the authors seek an incremental improvement of the solution. As the physics-based reasoning model presented in this article is heavily dependent on the quality of the functional model, the authors propose a general approach to limit the interpretability of the functional representations by mapping the functional vocabulary with elementary structural blocks derived from bond graph theory. The physics-based reasoning approach is supported by a mathematical framework that is summarized in the article. The physics-based reasoning model is used for discovering the limitations of solutions in the form of internal contradictions and guiding the design ideation effort.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Sketching is a natural and intuitive communication tool used for expressing concepts or ideas which are difficult to communicate through text or speech alone. Sketching is therefore used for a variety of purposes, from the expression of ideas on two-dimensional (2D) physical media, to object creation, manipulation, or deformation in three-dimensional (3D) immersive environments. This variety in sketching activities brings about a range of technologies which, while having similar scope, namely that of recording and interpreting the sketch gesture to effect some interaction, adopt different interpretation approaches according to the environment in which the sketch is drawn. In fields such as product design, sketches are drawn at various stages of the design process, and therefore, designers would benefit from sketch interpretation technologies which support these differing interactions. However, research typically focuses on one aspect of sketch interpretation and modeling such that literature on available technologies is fragmented and dispersed. In this paper, we bring together the relevant literature describing technologies which can support the product design industry, namely technologies which support the interpretation of sketches drawn on 2D media, sketch-based search interactions, as well as sketch gestures drawn in 3D media. This paper, therefore, gives a holistic view of the algorithmic support that can be provided in the design process. In so doing, we highlight the research gaps and future research directions required to provide full sketch-based interaction support.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Significant research has been undertaken focusing on the application of evolutionary algorithms for design exploration at conceptual design stages. However, standard evolutionary algorithms are typically not well-suited to supporting such optimization-based design exploration due to the lack of design diversity in the optimization result and the poor search efficiency in discovering high-performing design solutions. In order to address the two weaknesses, this paper proposes a hybrid evolutionary algorithm, called steady-stage island evolutionary algorithm (SSIEA). The implementation of SSIEA integrates an island model approach and a steady-state replacement strategy with an evolutionary algorithm. The combination aims to produce optimization results with rich design diversity while achieving significant fitness progress in a reasonable amount of time. Moreover, the use of the island model approach allows for an implicit clustering of the design population during the optimization process, which helps architects explore different alternative design directions. The performance of SSIEA is compared against other optimization algorithms using two case studies. The result shows that, in contrast to the other algorithms, SSIEA is capable of achieving a good compromise between design diversity and search efficiency. The case studies also demonstrate how SSIEA can support conceptual design exploration. For architects, the optimization results with diverse and high-performing solutions stimulate richer reflection and ideation, rendering SSIEA a helpful tool for conceptual design exploration.",

However, the agile and flexible qualities of the methodology do not directly translate to every context. In this article, we reflect on the design process of an intelligent ecosystem, called ORBIT, and a proposed evaluative study planned with it. This was part of a DED project in collaboration with a medical hospital to study the post-operative behavior in the (remote) context of bariatric patients. The design and preparation of this project and the process towards an eventual study rejection from the medical ethical committee (METC) provide rich insights into (1) what it means to conduct DED research in a clinical context, and (2) where the boundaries of the method might lie in this specific application area. We highlight insights from carefully designing the substantial infrastructure for the study, and how different aspects of DED translated less easily to the clinical context. We analyze the proposed study setup through the lenses of several modifications we made to DED and further reflect on how to expand and scale up the methodology and adapt the process for the clinical context.",

The images generated by DALL⋅E seem to exhibit an appreciable level of combinational creativity close to that of humans in terms of visualizing a combinational idea. Although there are several common metrics which can be applied to assess the quality of the images generated by generative models, such as IS, FID, GIQA, and CLIP, it is unclear whether these metrics are equally applicable to assessing images containing combinational creativity. In this study, we collected the generated image data from machine (DALL⋅E) and human designers, respectively. The results of group ranking in the Consensual Assessment Technique (CAT) and the Turing Test (TT) were used as the benchmarks to assess the combinational creativity. Considering the metrics’ mathematical principles and different starting points in evaluating image quality, we introduced coincident rate (CR) and average rank variation (ARV) which are two comparable spaces. An experiment to calculate the consistency of group ranking of each metric by comparing the benchmarks then was conducted. By comparing the consistency results of CR and ARV on group ranking, we summarized the applicability of the existing evaluation metrics in assessing generative images containing combinational creativity. In the four metrics, GIQA performed the closest consistency to the CAT and TT. It shows the potential as an automated assessment for images containing combinational creativity, which can be used to evaluate the images containing combinational creativity in the relevant task of design and engineering such as conceptual sketch, digital design image, and prototyping image.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Manufacturing industries are looking for efficient assembly planners that can swiftly develop a practically feasible assembly sequence while keeping costs and time to a minimum. Most assembly sequence planners rely on part relations in the virtual environment. Nowadays, tools and robotic grippers perform most of the assembly tasks. Ignoring the critical aspect renders solutions practically infeasible. Additionally, it is vital to test the feasibility of positioning and assembling components while employing robotic grippers and tools prior to their implementation. This paper presents a novel concept named by considering both part and tool geometry to propose “tool integrated assembly interference matrices” (TIAIMs) and a “tool integrated axis-aligned bounding box” (TIAABB) to generate practically feasible assembly sequence plans. Furthermore, the part-concatenation technique is used to determine the best assembly sequence plans for an actual mechanical component. The results show that the proposed approach effectively and efficiently deals with real-life industrial problems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Computer-aided design (CAD) plays an essential role in creative idea generation on 2D screens during the design process. In most CAD scenarios, virtual object translation is an essential operation, and it is commonly used when designers simulate their innovative solutions. The degrees of freedom (DoF) of virtual object translation modes have been found to directly impact users’ task performance and psychological aspects in simulated environments. Little is known in the existing literature about the sense of agency (SoA), which is a critical psychological aspect emphasizing the feeling of control, in translation modes on 2D screens during the design process. Hence, this study aims to assess users’ SoA in virtual object translation modes on mouse-based, touch-based, and handheld augmented reality (AR) interfaces through subjective and objective measures, such as self-report, task performance, and electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Based on our findings in this study, users perceived a greater feeling of control in 1DoF translation mode, which may help them come up with more creative ideas, than in 3DoF translation mode in the design process; additionally, the handheld AR interface offers less control feel, which may have a negative impact on design quality and creativity, as compared with mouse- and touch-based interfaces. This research contributes to the current literature by analyzing the association between virtual object translation modes and SoA, as well as the relationship between different 2D interfaces and SoA in CAD. As a result of these findings, we propose several design considerations for virtual object translation on 2D screens, which may enable designers to perceive a desirable feeling of control during the design process.",

Therefore, this thematic collection on “Applications of Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science in Design” brings together state-of-the-art research in artificial intelligence and cognitive science to showcase the emerging trend of applying artificial intelligence techniques and neurophysiological and biometric measures in design research. Three promising future research directions: 1) human-in-the-loop AI for design, 2) multimodal measures for design, and 3) AI for design cognitive data analysis and interpretation, are suggested by analysing the research papers collected. A framework for integration of artificial intelligence and cognitive science in design, incorporating the three research directions, is proposed to inspire and guide design researchers in exploring human-centred design methods, strategies, solutions, tools and systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Human activity recognition (HAR) is a vital component of human–robot collaboration. Recognizing the operational elements involved in an operator’s task is essential for realizing this vision, and HAR plays a key role in achieving this. However, recognizing human activity in an industrial setting differs from recognizing daily living activities. An operator’s activity must be divided into fine elements to ensure efficient task completion. Despite this, there is relatively little related research in the literature. This study aims to develop machine learning models to classify the sequential movement elements of a task. To illustrate this, three logistic operations in an integrated circuit (IC) design house were studied, with participants wearing 13 inertial measurement units manufactured by XSENS to mimic the tasks. The kinematics data were collected to develop the machine learning models. The time series data preprocessing involved applying two normalization methods and three different window lengths. Eleven features were extracted from the processed data to train the classification models. Model validation was carried out using the subject-independent method, with data from three participants excluded from the training dataset. The results indicate that the developed model can efficiently classify operational elements when the operator performs the activity accurately. However, incorrect classifications occurred when the operator missed an operation or awkwardly performed the task. RGB video clips helped identify these misclassifications, which can be used by supervisors for training purposes or by industrial engineers for work improvement.",

The LLM participated by instructing two participants who executed its instructions and provided objective feedback, generated ideas autonomously and made all design decisions without human intervention. The LLM exhibited similar prototyping practices to human participants and finished second among six teams, successfully designing and providing building instructions for functional prototypes. The LLM’s concept generation capabilities were particularly strong. However, the LLM prematurely abandoned promising concepts when facing minor difficulties, added unnecessary complexity to designs, and experienced design fixation. Communication between the LLM and participants was challenging due to vague or unclear descriptions, and the LLM had difficulty maintaining continuity and relevance in answers. Based on these findings, six recommendations for implementing an LLM like ChatGPT in the design process are proposed, including leveraging it for ideation, ensuring human oversight for key decisions, implementing iterative feedback loops, prompting it to consider alternatives, and assigning specific and manageable tasks at a subsystem level.",

Previous studies have relied heavily on designers’ experiences to retrieve analogical knowledge from other domains, lacking a structured method to organize and understand multidomain analogical knowledge. This presents a significant challenge in recommending high-quality analogical sources, which needs to be addressed. To tackle these issues, a knowledge graph-assisted DbA approach via structured analogical knowledge retrieval is proposed. First, an improved function-effect-structure ontology model is constructed to extract functions and effects as potential analogical sources, and six semantic matching rules are established to output entity triplets, and the DbA knowledge graph (DbAKG) is developed. Second, based on the knowledge of semantic relationships in DbAKG, the domain distance and similarity between the design target and the analogical sources are introduced to establish an analogical value model, ensuring the novelty and feasibility of analogical sources. After that, with function as the design target, analogical sources transfer strategy is formed to support innovative solution solving, and TRIZ theory is used to solve design conflicts. Finally, a pipeline inspection robot case study is further employed to verify the proposed approach. Additionally, a knowledge graph-assisted analogical design system has been developed to assist in managing multidomain knowledge and the analogical process, facilitate the adoption of innovative design strategies, and assist companies in providing more competitive products to seize the market.",

This paper explores structural design languages and semantics for the generation of feasible and purposeful discrete structures. In an application of shape annealing, a combination of grammatical design generation and search, to the generation of discrete structures, rule syntax, and semantics are used to model desired relations between structural form and function as well as control design generation. Explicit domain knowledge is placed within the grammar through rule and syntax formulation, resulting in the generation of only forms that make functional sense and adhere to preferred visual styles. Design interpretation, or semantics, is then used to select forms that meet functional and visual goals. The distinction between syntax used in grammar rules to explicitly drive geometric design and semantics used in design interpretation to implicitly guide geometric form is shown. Overall, the designs presented show the validity of applying a grammatical formalism to an engineering design problem and illustrate a range of possibilities for modeling functional and visual design criteria.",

We describe a model-based approach for solving the diagnosis task in the context of adaptive design and redesign. This approach uses functional models that explicitly represent the device functions and use them to organize teleological and causal knowledge about the device. In particular, we describe a specific kind of functional model called structure—behavior—function (SBF) models in which the causal behaviors of the device are specified in terms of flow of substances through components. We illustrate the use of SBF models with three examples from Kritik2, a knowledge system that designs new devices by retrieving, diagnosing, and adapting old device designs.",

    "abstract": "For typical optimization problems, the design space of interest is well defined: It is a subset of R n , where n is the number of (continuous) variables. Constraints are often introduced to eliminate infeasible regions of this space from consideration. Many engineering design problems can be formulated as search in such a design space. For configuration design problems, however, the design space is much more difficult to define precisely, particularly when constraints are present. Configuration design spaces are discrete and combinatorial in nature, but not necessarily purely combinatorial, as certain combinations represent infeasible designs. One of our primary design objectives is to drastically reduce the effort to explore large combinatorial design spaces. We believe it is imperative to develop methods for mathematically defining design spaces for configuration design. The purpose of this paper is to outline our approach to defining configuration design spaces for engineering design, with an emphasis on the mathematics of the spaces and their combinations into larger spaces that more completely capture design requirements. Specifically, we introduce design spaces that model physical connectivity, functionality, and assemblability considerations for a representative product family, a class of coffeemakers. Then, we show how these spaces can be combined into a “common” product variety design space. We demonstrate how constraints can be defined and applied to these spaces so that feasible design regions can be directly modeled. Additionally, we explore the topological and combinatorial properties of these spaces. The application of this design space modeling methodology is illustrated using the coffeemaker product family.",

    "abstract": "Construction cost estimators are confronted with the challenging task of estimating the cost of constructing one of a kind facilities. They must first recognize the design conditions of the facility design that are important (i.e., incur a cost) and then determine how the design conditions affect the cost of construction. Current product models of facility designs explicitly represent components, attributes of components, and relationships between components. These designer-focused product models do not represent many of the cost-driving features of building product models, such as penetrations and component similarity. Previous research efforts identify many of the different features that affect construction costs, but they do not provide a formal and general way for practitioners to represent the features they care about according to their preferences. This paper presents the formal ontology we developed to represent construction knowledge about the cost-driving features of building product models. The ontology formalizes three classes of features, defines the attributes and functions of each feature type, and represents the relationships between the features explicitly. The descriptive semantics of the model allow estimators to represent their varied preferences for naming features, specifying features that result from component intersections and the similarity of components, and grouping features that affect a specific construction domain. A software prototype that implements the ontology enables estimators to transform designer-focused product models into estimator-focused, feature-based product models. Our tests show that estimators are able to generate and maintain cost estimates more accurately, consistently, and expeditiously with feature-based product models than with industry standard product models.",

Reasoning from design cases requires the ability to use cases, or pieces of cases that realize subfunctions of the device being designed. It is, however, difficult to recognize and retrieve relevant cases or case pieces using a given design specification. Because there is no one-to-one correspondence between the desired behavior of a device and the individual component behaviors, it is often not possible to find relevant design cases by using the given overall behavioral specification as an index into case memory. We approach this problem by elaborating the given behavior specification into a description that gives rise to indices with which relevant components can be retrieved. The elaborations are carried out in a behavior-preserving manner using two transformation operators that (a) rely on physical laws if it is known which ones are relevant, or (b) hypothesize behaviors and then search the case memory for ways in which the required behaviors may be achieved. These two approaches are used opportunistically in CADET, a case-based mechanical design system.",

    "abstract": "Functional reasoning (FR) enables people to derive and explain function of artifacts in a goal-oriented manner. FR has been studied and employed in various disciplines, including philosophy, biology, sociology, and engineering design, and enhanced by the techniques borrowed from computer science and artificial intelligence. The outcome of FR research has been applied to engineering design, planning, explanation, and learning. A typical FR system in engineering design usually incorporates representational mechanisms of function concept together with description mechanisms of state, structure, or behavior, and explanations and reasoning mechanisms to derive and explain functions. As for representation, philosophers have long argued whether function of an artifact is a genuine property of it. As for explanation and reasoning, they have produced theories for functional ascription by an external viewer as part of an explanation. To build an FR-based system, the theory based on which the system is built and the underlying assumptions must be explicitly identified. This point is not always clear in the engineering of FR-based systems. Understanding the underlying assumptions, logical formulation, and limitations of FR theories will help developers assessing their systems correctly. The purpose of this paper is to review various FR theories and their underlying assumptions and limitations. This later serves as a benchmark for comparing various FR techniques.",

Although they are usually constructed from a well-understood black-box description of an artifact, there is no clear approach or formal set of rules that guide the creation of function structures. To remedy the unclear formation of such structures and to provide the potential for automated reasoning of such structures, a graph grammar is developed and implemented. The grammar can be used by a designer to explore various solutions to a conceptual design problem. Furthermore, the grammar aids in disseminating engineering functional information and in teaching the function structure concept to untrained engineers. Thirty products are examined as a basis for developing the grammar rules, and the rules are implemented in an interactive user environment. Experiments with student engineers and with the automated creation of function structures validate the effectiveness of the grammar rules.",

    "abstract": "Language plays at least two roles in design. First, language serves as representations of ideas and concepts through linguistic behaviors that represent the structure of thought during the design process. Second, language also performs actions and creates states of affairs. Based on these two perspectives on language use in design, we apply the computational linguistics tools of latent semantic analysis and lexical chain analysis to characterize how design teams engage in concept formation as the accumulation of knowledge represented by lexicalized concepts. The accumulation is described in a data structure comprised by a set of links between elemental lexicalized concepts. The folding together of these two perspectives on language use in design with the information processing theories of the mind afforded by the computational linguistics tools applied creates a new means to evaluate concept formation in design teams. The method suggests that analysis at a linguistic level can characterize concept formation even where process-oriented critiques were limited in their ability to uncover a formal design method that could explain the phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "A flexible information model for systematic development and deployment of product families during all phases of the product realization process is crucial for product-oriented organizations. In current practice, information captured while designing products in a family is often incomplete, unstructured, and is mostly proprietary in nature, making it difficult to index, search, refine, reuse, distribute, browse, aggregate, and analyze knowledge across heterogeneous organizational information systems. To this end, we propose a flexible knowledge management framework to capture, reorganize, and convert both linguistic and parametric product family design information into a unified network, which is called a networked bill of material (NBOM) using formal concept analysis (FCA); encode the NBOM as a cyclic, labeled graph using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) that designers can use to explore, search, and aggregate design information across different phases of product design as well as across multiple products in a product family; and analyze the set of products in a product family based on both linguistic and parametric information. As part of the knowledge management framework, a PostgreSQL database schema has been formulated to serve as a central design repository of product design knowledge, capable of housing the instances of the NBOM. Ontologies encoding the NBOM are utilized as a metalayer in the database schema to connect the design artifacts as part of a graph structure. Representing product families by preconceived common ontologies shows promise in promoting component sharing, and assisting designers search, explore, and analyze linguistic and parametric product family design information. An example involving a family of seven one-time-use cameras with different functions that satisfy a variety of customer needs is presented to demonstrate the implementation of the proposed framework.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Successful realization of large-scale product development programs is challenging because of complex product and process dependencies and complicated team interactions. Proficient teamwork is underpinned by knowledge of the manner in which tasks performed by different design participants fit together to create an effective whole. Based on an extensive industrial case study with a diesel engine company, this paper first argues that the overview and experience of senior designers play an important part in supporting teamwork by coordinating activities and facilitating proactive communication across large project teams. As experts move on and novices or contractors are hired, problems are likely to occur as tacit overview knowledge is lost. If informal, overview-driven processes break down, the risk of costly oversights will increase, and greater management overhead will be required to realize successful product designs. Existing process models provide a means to express the connectivity between tasks and components thus to compensate partially for the loss of tacit overview. This paper proposes the use of design confidence, a metric that reflects the designer's belief in the maturity of a particular design parameter at a given point in the process, to address the limitations of existing models. The applicability of confidence-based design models in providing overview, as well as their shortcomings, will be demonstrated through the example of a diesel engine design process. Confidence can be used to make overview knowledge explicit and convey additional information about the design artifact, thereby informing communication and negotiation between teams.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Three-dimensional (3-D) geometry can be described in many ways, with both a varying syntax and a varying semantics. As a result, several very diverse schemas and file formats can be deployed to describe geometry, depending on the application domain in question. In a multidisciplinary domain such as the domain of architecture, engineering, and construction, this range of specialized schemas makes file format conversions inevitable. The approach adopted by current conversion tools, however, often results in a loss of information, most often due to a “mistranslation” between different syntaxes and/or semantics, leading to errors and limitations in the design conception stage and to inefficiency due to the required remodeling efforts. An approach based on semantic web technology may reduce the loss of information significantly, leading to an improved processing of 3-D information and hence to an improved design practice in the architecture, engineering, and construction domain. This paper documents our investigation of the nature of this 3-D information conversion problem and how it may be encompassed using semantic web technology. In an exploratory double test case, we show how the specific deployment of semantic rule languages and an appropriate inference engine are to be adopted to improve this 3-D information exchange. It shows how semantic web technology allows the coexistence of diverse descriptions of the same 3-D information, interlinked through explicit conversion rules. Although only a simple example is used to document the process, and a more in-depth investigation is needed, the initial results indicate the suggested approach to be a useful alternative approach to obtain an improved 3-D information exchange.",

The Design Repository is a Web-based archive of function models of consumer products described with the functional basis. This paper presents the theoretical underpinnings of a metric for the information content of function models, the assumptions required to support it, the definitions of key terms associated with it, and its practical interpretation. Finally, the metric is used to study the usefulness of the functional basis through a series of experiments on function models within the Design Repository. The results of the experiment indicate that the secondary level of the functional basis is the most beneficial to designers, both in terms of information content and information density.",

However, identifying and presenting the valuable knowledge from the biological domain to an engineering designer during concept generation is currently a somewhat disorganized process or requires extensive knowledge of the biological system. To circumvent the knowledge requirement problem, we developed a computational approach for discovering biological inspiration during the early stages of design that integrates with established function-based design methods. This research defines and formalizes the information identification and knowledge transfer processes that enable systematic development of biologically inspired designs. The framework that supports our computational design approach is provided along with an example of a smart flooring device to demonstrate the approach.

In the field of virtual reality, presence and immersion are standard measures of an individual's sense of engagement and involvement in an activity. High levels of presence might indicate that the designer is highly focused on the work. The central research question is the following: do designers who are more engaged in design activity, as measured by presence and immersive tendency questionnaires, produce better designs? An experiment was conducted to assess presence and immersive tendencies within the context of a hands-on, open-ended design-and-build activity. The results indicated that the designers' sense of immersion and presence ranged widely as well as their sense of frustration and calmness while performing the design activity. It was found that higher levels of presence correlated with either high design performance or low design performance. Lower levels of presence correlated with average design performance. No correlations were found between immersive tendency and design performance. This study suggests that some level of presence can be linked with better design, and it implies that level of presence might serve as an indicator of performance and learning in similar design-and-build activities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The systems engineering V (SE-V) is an established process model to guide the development of complex engineering projects (INCOSE, 2011). The SE-V process involves decomposition and integration of system elements through a sequence of tasks that produce both a system design and its testing specifications, followed by successive levels of build, integration, and test activities. This paper presents a method to improve SE-V implementation by mapping multilevel data into design structure matrix (DSM) models. DSM is a representation methodology for identifying interactions between either components or tasks associated with a complex engineering project (Eppinger &amp; Browning, 2012). Multilevel refers to SE-V data on complex interactions that are germane either at multiple levels of analysis (e.g., component versus subsystem) conducted either within a single phase or across multiple time phases (e.g., early or late in the SE-V process). This method extends conventional DSM representation schema by incorporating multilevel test coverage data as vectors into the off-diagonal cells. These vectors provide a richer description of potential interactions between product architecture and SE-V integration test tasks than conventional domain mapping matrices. We illustrate this method with data from a complex engineering project in the offshore oil industry. Data analysis identifies potential for unanticipated outcomes based on incomplete coverage of SE-V interactions during integration tests. In addition, assessment of multilevel features using maximum and minimum function queries isolates all the interfaces that are associated with either early or late revelations of integration risks based on the planned suite of SE-V integration tests.",

The map is comprised of various technology domains positioned according to knowledge proximity, which is measured based on a large quantity of patent data. It provides a systematic picture of the total technology space to enable stimulated ideation beyond the designer's knowledge. Designers can browse the map and navigate various technologies to conceive new design opportunities that relate different technologies across the space. We demonstrate the process of using TSM as a rapid ideation aid and then analyze its applications in two experiments to show its effectiveness and limitations. Furthermore, we have developed a cloud-based system for computer-aided ideation, that is, InnoGPS, to integrate interactive map browsing for conceiving high-level design opportunities with domain-specific patent retrieval for stimulating concrete technical concepts, and to potentially embed machine-learning and artificial intelligence in the map-aided ideation process.",

We describe and evaluate two computational models of stylistic composition, called Racchman-Oct2010 (random constrained chain of Markovian nodes, October 2010) and Racchmaninof-Oct2010 (Racchman with inheritance of form). The former is a constrained Markov model, and the latter embeds this model in an analogy-based design system. Racchmaninof-Oct2010 applies a pattern discovery algorithm called SIACT and a perceptually validated formula for rating pattern importance, to guide the generation of a new target design from an existing source design. A listening study is reported concerning human judgments of music excerpts that are, to varying degrees, in the style of mazurkas by Frédéric Chopin (1810–1849). The listening study acts as an evaluation of the two computational models and a third, benchmark system, called Experiments in Musical Intelligence. Judges' responses indicate that some aspects of musical style, such as phrasing and rhythm, are being modeled effectively by our algorithms. Judgments are also used to identify areas for future improvements. We discuss the broader implications of this work for the fields of engineering and design, where there is potential to make use of our models of hierarchical repetitive structure.",

This paper describes a graph spectral approach to calculate the resilience of complex engineered systems. The resilience of the design architecture of complex engineered systems is deduced from graph spectra. This is calculated from adjacency matrix representations of the physical connections between components in complex engineered systems. Furthermore, we propose a new method to identify the most vulnerable components in the design and design architectures that are robust to transmission of failures. Nonlinear dynamical system and epidemic spreading models are used to compare the failure propagation mean time transformation. Using these metrics, we present a case study based on the Advanced Diagnostics and Prognostics Testbed, which is an electrical power system developed at NASA Ames as a subsystem for the ramp system of an infantry fighting vehicle.",

Designers need appropriate measures to handle the numerous design changes in order to realize consistent and completely validated product models so that successful product development is assured. In this paper, a time-based mathematic model is presented to characterize the sequential change propagation process, and then the shortest path algorithm is given to find the most timesaving routes for changes to propagate to other dependent design tasks. An analysis method is introduced to compute the sensitivities of change impacts on the affected design tasks, which indicates that the more time consumed by a change to take its effect, the more sensitive the change impacts on those downstream dependent tasks. A case study of change propagations in motorcycle engine design process was presented to demonstrate the proposed method.",

However, they are very time consuming and require a significant amount of computing power. More time is needed when two techniques work together. This has become the primary impediment in applying design optimization to real-world projects. This study focuses on reducing the computing time in genetic algorithms when building simulation techniques are involved. In this study, we combine two techniques (offline simulation and divide and conquer) to effectively improve the run time in these architectural design optimization problems, utilizing architecture-specific domain knowledge. The improved methods are evaluated with a case study of a nursing unit design to minimize the nurses’ travel distance and maximize daylighting performance in patient rooms. Results show the computing time can be saved significantly during the simulation and optimization process.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper introduces a rigorous framework for function modeling of complex multidisciplinary systems based on the system state flow diagram (SSFD). The work addresses the need for a consistent methodology to support solution-neutral function-based system decomposition analysis, facilitating the design, modeling, and analysis of complex systems architectures. A rigorous basis for the SSFD is established by defining conventions for states and function definitions and a representation scheme, underpinned by a critical review of existing literature. A set of heuristics are introduced to support the function decomposition analysis and to facilitate the deployment of the methodology with strong practitioner guidelines. The SSFD heuristics extend the existing framework of Otto and Wood (2001) by introducing a conditional fork node heuristic, to facilitate analysis and aggregation of function models across multiple modes of operation of the system. The empirical validation of the SSFD function modeling framework is discussed in relation to its application to two case studies: a benchmark problem (glue gun) set for the engineering design community; and an industrial case study of an electric vehicle powertrain. Based on the evidence from the two case studies presented in the paper, a critical evaluation of the SSFD function modeling methodology is discussed based on the function benchmarking framework established by Summers et al. (2013), considering the representation, modeling, cognitive, and reasoning characteristics. The significance of this paper is that it establishes a rigorous reference framework for the SSFD function representation and a consistent methodology to guide the practitioner with its deployment, facilitating its impact to industrial practice.",

Many factors have been proposed in the literature as indicators of creativity, among which outcome-characteristics-based factors are considered the most reliable; among these, the creativity of an outcome is often indicated by two major factors: novelty and usefulness . Only a few studies address as to how creativity assessment methods and their results can be used during the design process. To systematically address the issue of how to influence creativity of design solutions, the following questions have been framed. (1) Which factors should be used as indicators of creativity consistently across different phases of the engineering design process? (2) How can creativity be assessed in terms of these factors during the engineering design process? In this work, we consider novelty and usefulness as the necessary factors for creativity . It is found, however, that it is not possible to directly assess the usefulness of outcomes during the design process. Therefore, requirement satisfaction is used as a proxy for usefulness . We propose a creativity assessment method that uses novelty and requirement satisfaction as indicators for creativity; the method can be used for assessing not only complete products but also ideas or concepts, as they evolve through the phases of the design process. The application of the method in design is explained using a detailed example from a case study.",

A number of authors do this by imposing interpretations on the theory that are incompatible with each other and with the statements of the theory's authors. We agree that it is time to critically reexamine the theory and rethink what implications it has for design. However, rather than imposing an incompatible interpretation, our approach is see what new conclusions can be drawn from a systematic and critical examination of what Rittel and Webber actually said. This reexamination of their specific claims and arguments is what we call untangling wicked problems .

The motivation for this work is to collect observations that can aid in understanding prototyping in the early stages of engineering design projects, and this article investigates if and how digital capture of physical prototypes can be used for this purpose. Early-stage prototypes are usually rough and of low fidelity and are thus often discarded or substantially modified through the projects. Hence, retrospective access to prototypes is a challenge when trying to gather accurate empirical data. To capture the prototypes developed through the early stages of a project, a new research tool has been developed for capturing prototypes through multi-view images, along with metadata describing by whom, why, when, and where the prototypes were captured. Over the course of 17 months, this research tool has been used to capture more than 800 physical prototypes from 76 individual users across many projects. In this article, one project is shown in detail to demonstrate how this capturing system can gather empirical data for enriching engineering design project cases that focus on prototyping for concept generation. The authors also analyze the metadata provided by the system to give understanding into prototyping patterns in the projects. Lastly, through enabling digital capture of large quantities of data, the research tool presents the foundations for training artificial intelligence-based predictors and classifiers that can be used for analysis in engineering design research.",

During the initial stages of these generally human-centric activities, little knowledge pertaining to the problem at hand may be available. The degree of problem definition will depend on information available in terms of appropriate variables, constraints, and both quantitative and qualitative objectives. Typically, the problem space develops with information gained in a dynamical process in which design optimization plays a secondary role, following the establishment of a sufficiently well-defined problem domain. This paper concentrates on background human–computer interaction relating to the machine-based generation of high-quality design information that, when presented in an appropriate manner to the designer, supports a better understanding of a problem domain. Knowledge gained from such information combined with the experiential knowledge of the designer can result in a reformulation of the problem, providing increased definition and greater confidence in the machine-based representation. Conceptual design domains related to gas turbine blade cooling systems and a preliminary air frame configuration are introduced. These are utilized to illustrate the integration of interactive evolutionary strategies that support the extraction of optimal design information, its presentation to the designer, and subsequent human-based modification of the design domain based on knowledge gained from the information received. An experimental iterative designer or evolutionary search process resulting in a better understanding of the problem and improved machine-based representation of the design domain is thus established.",

Next, we propose that hybrid computer systems, using knowledge processing techniques in conjunction with procedural techniques such as decision analysis and network-based scheduling, can provide valuable new kinds of decision support for project objective-setting and project control, respectively. Finally we suggest that knowledge-based interactive graphics, developed for providing graphical explanations and user control in advanced knowledge processing environments, can provide powerful new kinds of decision support for project management. The first claim is supported by a review and analysis of previous work in the area of automated AI planning techniques. Our experience with PLATFORM I, II and III, a series of prototype AI-leveraged project management systems built using the IntelliCorp Knowledge Engineering Environment (KEE™), provides the justification for the latter two claims.",

Here, product family design is viewed as a selection problem with the following stages: product family (design alternatives) generation, product family design evaluation, and selection for customization.

Then, a knowledge support framework and its relevant technologies are developed for module-based product family design for mass customization.

Existing computational models of creative behavior have inherited this emphasis on independent generative processes. However, an increasing multidisciplinary consensus regards creativity as a systems property, and extends the focus of inquiry to include the interaction between generative individuals and evaluative social groups. To acknowledge the complementarity of evaluative processes by social groups, experts, and peers, this paper presents experimentation with a framework of design as a social activity. This model is used to inspect phenomena associated with creativity in the interaction between designers and their societies. In particular, this paper describes the strength of social ties as a mechanism of social organization, and explores its potential relation to creativity in a computational social simulation. These experiments illustrate ways in which the role of designers as change agents of their societies can be largely determined by how the evaluating group self-organizes over time. A key potential implication is that the isolated characteristics of designers may be insufficient to formulate conclusions about the nature and effects of their behavior. Instead, causality could be attributed to situational factors that define the relationship between designers and their evaluators.",

Fractals created by an iterated function system are used for representing art forms in our process. Algorithmic aesthetics are developed based on the aesthetic measure theory, surveys of human preferences, and popular long-lasting symbols. The algorithmic aesthetics is used for evaluating aesthetics of art forms together with subjective nonquantifiable aspects, and placed in the fitness function. The GA basically creates two-dimensional art forms. However, any two-dimensional image can be included through the property of a condensation set of fractals. The proposed GA can increase design productivity by about 80%. Examples of jewelry designs and physical prototypes created by the proposed system are included.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Public perception of engineering recognizes its importance to national and international competitiveness, economy, quality of life, security, and other fundamental areas of impact; but uncertainty about engineering among the general public remains. Federal funding trends for education underscore many of the concerns regarding teaching and learning in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics subjects in primary through grade 12 (P-12) education. Conflicting perspectives on the essential attributes that comprise the engineering design process results in a lack of coherent criteria against which teachers and administrators can measure the validity of a resource, or assess its strengths and weaknesses, or grasp incongruities among competing process models. The literature suggests two basic approaches for representing engineering design: a phase-based, life cycle-oriented approach; and an activity-based, cognitive approach. Although these approaches serve various teaching and functional goals in undergraduate and graduate engineering education, as well as in practice, they tend to exacerbate the gaps in P-12 engineering efforts, where appropriate learning objectives that connect meaningfully to engineering are poorly articulated or understood. In this article, we examine some fundamental problems that must be resolved if preengineering is to enter the P-12 curriculum with meaningful standards and is to be connected through learning outcomes, shared understanding of engineering design, and other vestiges to vertically link P-12 engineering with higher education and the practice of engineering. We also examine historical aspects, various pedagogies, and current issues pertaining to undergraduate and graduate engineering programs. As a case study, we hope to shed light on various kinds of interventions and outreach efforts to inform these efforts or at least provide some insight into major factors that shape and define the environment and cultures of the two institutions (including epistemic perspectives, institutional objectives, and political constraints) that are very different and can compromise collaborative efforts between the institutions of P-12 and higher education.",

Therefore, making every round of configuring process productive and hence reducing the number of inputs from customers are of substantial interest to academic and industry alike. In this paper, we present an efficient product configuration approach by incorporating Shapley value, which is a concept used in game theory, to estimate the usefulness of each attribute in the configurator design. This new method iteratively selects the most relevant attribute that can contribute most in terms of information content from the remaining pool of unspecified attributes. As a result from product providers' perspective, each round of configuration can best narrow down the choices with given amount of time. The selection of the next round query is based on the customer's decision on the previous rounds. The interactive process thus runs in an adaptive manner that different customers will have different query sequences. The probability ranking principle is also exploited to give product recommendation to truncate the configuration process so that customers will not be burdened with trivial selection of attributes. Analytical results and numerical examples are also used to exemplify and demonstrate the viability of the method.",

The findings reported in this paper are based on a computational model that simulates the formation of transactive memory (TM) through social learning from direct and indirect communications. Direct communications are explicit information exchanged between team members whereas indirect communication may be opportunistic and coincidental, resulting in learning and information gained through observations of the actions of others. However, team structure mediates opportunities for communication. Three types of team structures are studied, which are differentiated on the basis of their constraints on and opportunities for direct and indirect communications across the team. The differences across the team structures are investigated through a series of simulations in which team member retention, cognitive busyness of team members, and task complexity are additional moderating variables, and task coordination and formation of TM are the dependent variables. Fewer communications to coordinate the same tasks are taken as the measure of efficient task coordination. Findings suggest that reduction in communication and learning opportunities are more detrimental to the task coordination in flat teams as compared to functional teams. Indirect communications contribute more to the formation of TM than to task coordination. Flat teams facilitate the formation of TM, whereas functional teams are more appropriate for efficient task coordination, indicating that the role of TM in mediating task coordination varies with team structure.",

The generation of layouts takes place using evolutionary algorithms, which are used to optimize the arrangement of elements in terms of overlapping within a given boundary and the topological relations between them. In this paper, the approach is extended by a data structure that facilitates the hierarchical organization of layout elements making it possible to structure and organize larger layout problems into subsets that can be solved in parallel. An important aspect for the applicability of such a system in the design process is an appropriate means of user interaction. This depends largely on the calculation speed of the system and the variety of viable solutions. These properties are evaluated for hierarchical as well as for nonhierarchical structured layout problems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Massive open online courses, online tutoring systems, and other computer homework systems are rapidly changing engineering education by providing increased student feedback and capitalizing upon online systems' scalability. While online homework systems provide great benefits, a growing concern among engineering educators is that students are losing both the critical art of sketching and the ability to take a real system and reduce it to an accurate but simplified free-body diagram (FBD). For example, some online systems allow the drag and drop of forces onto FBDs, but they do not allow the user to sketch the FBDs, which is a vital part of the learning process. In this paper, we discuss Mechanix, a sketch recognition tool that provides an efficient means for engineering students to learn how to draw truss FBDs and solve truss problems. The system allows students to sketch FBDs into a tablet computer or by using a mouse and a standard computer monitor. Using artificial intelligence, Mechanix can determine not only the component shapes and features of the diagram but also the relationships between those shapes and features. Because Mechanix is domain specific, it can use those relationships to determine not only whether a student's work is correct but also why it is incorrect. Mechanix is then able to provide immediate, constructive feedback to students without providing final answers. Within this manuscript, we document the inner workings of Mechanix, including the artificial intelligence behind the scenes, and present studies of the effects on student learning. The evaluations have shown that Mechanix is as effective as paper-and-pencil-based homework for teaching method of joints truss analysis; focus groups with students who used the program have revealed that they believe Mechanix enhances their learning and that they are highly engaged while using it.",

System complexity is increasing with increased use of software to control the physical system. There is a dearth of techniques to evaluate inconsistencies, incompatibility, and fault proneness of the system design in an integrated manner. The early design analysis technique presented in this paper aids a designer to understand the interplay between the multifaceted components and evaluate his/her design in an integrated manner. The technique allows simultaneous propagation of different types of faults from various domains and evaluates their functional impact over a period of time. The structure of the technique is explained using domain-specific conceptual metamodels, whereas the execution is based on the event sequence diagram, which is one of the established reliability and safety analysis techniques. One of the notable features of the proposed technique is the object-oriented nature of the system design representation. The technique is demonstrated with the help of a case study, and the execution results of two scenarios are evaluated to demonstrate the analysis capability of the proposed technique.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Design fixation is a factor that negatively influences the generation of novel design concepts (Jansson &amp; Smith, 1991). When designers fixate, they tend to reproduce example features or features from their initial ideas. In order to mitigate design fixation, it is crucial to identify the factors that influence the extent of design fixation. This paper investigates two such factors: the modality of examples and the familiarity of designers with the example features. To investigate this, an experiment is conducted with mechanical engineering students who were asked to generate ideas to solve a peanut sheller design problem. The students generated ideas in five different experimental conditions: control, where no example was given; the first example given in a sketch form; the first example given as a nonfunctional prototype; a second example in sketch form; and the second example in a working prototype form. The first example was a nonfeasible solution, but it contained several features familiar to the participants. The second example was a feasible solution, but it contained less familiar features. In order to understand the extent of fixation triggered by the examples, three metrics were utilized to compare across the experimental conditions: the quantity of nonredundant ideas generated by the participants, the presence of example features in their solutions, and their fixation to the example's energy source. The results showed that in the case of the familiar example, the example modality did play an important role in the extent of design fixation. Across the examples, it was found that the first example containing several familiar features caused more fixation than the second one. Overall, this paper shows that the modality in which the example was communicated and the presence of familiar features in an example influenced the fixation caused by those examples.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Current limit state surrogate modeling methods for system reliability analysis usually build surrogate models for failure modes individually or build composite limit states. In practical engineering applications, multiple system responses may be obtained from a single setting of inputs. In such cases, building surrogate models individually will ignore the correlation between different system responses and building composite limit states may be computationally expensive because the nonlinearity of composite limit state is usually higher than individual limit states. This paper proposes a new efficient Kriging surrogate modeling approach for system reliability analysis by constructing composite Kriging surrogates through selection of Kriging surrogates constructed individually and Kriging surrogates built based on singular value decomposition. The resulting composite surrogate model will combine the advantages of both types of Kriging surrogate models and thus reduce the number of required training points. A new stopping criterion and a new surrogate model refinement strategy are proposed to further improve the efficiency of this approach. The surrogate models are refined adaptively with high accuracy near the active failure boundary until the proposed new stopping criterion is satisfied. Three numerical examples including a series, a parallel, and a combined system are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Each of these is meant to support designers in their design endeavors. Industrial practice is excessively diversified in terms of contextual requirements, aims, and adopted processes; this automatically begs the question which of the existing models should be selected for application in a specific situation. This paper sets out to contribute to this discourse. It strives to benchmark the fairly novel integrated function modeling (IFM) framework against the well-established function structures modeling approach. The paper comparatively investigates the respective capabilities of the approaches, following the benchmarking protocol used earlier in relation to this Special Issue. Function structures are used as reference as they represent one of the most widespread function modeling approaches in research and practice. Both function structures and the IFM framework are exemplarily applied for modeling a glue gun. The gradual generation and refinement of the models is used to showcase their respective benefits and shortcomings. Eventually, the IFM framework is found to excel over function structures in terms of comprehensiveness and support for different types of function analyses. Finally, future research directions are proposed.",

However, past studies have identified the importance of exploring design problems for creative design outcomes. Previous protocol studies of designers has shown that problems can “co-evolve” with the development of solutions during the design process. But to date, little evidence has been provided about how designers systematically explore presented problems to create better solutions. In this study, we conducted a qualitative analysis of 252 design problems collected from publically available sources, including award-winning product designs and open-source design competitions. This database offers an independent sample of presented problems, designers’ alternative problem descriptions, and innovative solutions. We report the results of this large-scale qualitative analysis aimed at characterizing changes to problems during the design process. Inductive coding was used to identify content patterns in “discovered” problem descriptions, with qualitative codes reliably scored by two independent coders. A total of 32 distinct patterns of problem exploration were identified across designers and presented problems. Each pattern is described in the form of a generalized strategy to guide designers as they explore problem spaces. The exploration patterns identified in this study are the first empirical evidence of problem exploration in independent design problems. Further, the presence of exploration patterns in discovered problems is associated with the selection of the corresponding solution as a challenge finalist. These empirically identified strategies for problem exploration may be useful for computational tools supporting designers.",

To address this question, an experiment is presented that compares various representations' influence on creativity and design fixation. This experiment presents an effective example (analogue) as computer-aided design (CAD), sketch, or photograph representations. We found that all representations induced fixation, and the degree of fixation did not vary significantly. We also found that CAD representations encourage engineering designers to identify and copy the key effective features of the example. CAD and photo representations also produced a higher quality of design concepts. Results from this experiment offer insights into how these various representations may be used in examples during idea generation; CAD representations appear to offer the greatest advantages during the idea generation process. The results from this experiment also indicate that analogical databases of effective design examples should include CAD and photolike images of the analogue rather than sketches.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Complex engineered systems design is a collaborative activity. To design a system, experts from the relevant disciplines must work together to create the best overall system from their individual components. This situation is analogous to a multiagent system in which agents solve individual parts of a larger problem in a coordinated way. Current multiagent models of design teams, however, do not capture this distributed aspect of design teams – instead either representing designers as agents which control all variables, measuring organizational outcomes instead of design outcomes, or representing different aspects of distributed design, such as negotiation. This paper presents a new model which captures the distributed nature of complex systems design by decomposing the ability to control design variables to individual computational designers acting on a problem with shared constraints. These designers are represented as a multiagent learning system which is shown to perform similarly to a centralized optimization algorithm on the same domain. When used as a model, this multiagent system is shown to perform better when the level of designer exploration is not decayed but is instead controlled based on the increase of design knowledge, suggesting that designers in multidisciplinary teams should not simply reduce the scope of design exploration over time, but should adapt based on changes in their collective knowledge of the design space. This multiagent system is further shown to produce better-performing designs when computational designers design collaboratively as opposed to independently, confirming the importance of collaboration in complex systems design.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper reports a systematic literature review with the aim of determining the role of stimuli and other factors, such as timing, the designers’ background, expertise, and experience, in the idea generation phase of conceptual design related to engineering and industrial design and architecture. “Stimulus” is a general expression for a source of information characterized by several features, including the source (internal or external), analogical distance (near or far), and form (textual, visual, or other). Several recent studies have been conducted on this topic involving neurophysiological measurements with significant results. This comprehensive review will help to determine if the neurophysiological results are consistent with those from protocol studies. This allows for determining how the features of stimuli affect – among the related factors – designers’ performance in idea generation. The literature search was carried out using the Snowball and PRISMA methods. A total of 72 contributions were selected from studies adopting protocol analysis or neurophysiological measurements. This study presents a framework to support the selection of stimuli most likely to maximize performance, based on the designer's background and expertise in the different idea generation metrics. The main findings of the framework suggest that visual stimuli enhance the creative performance of designers, regardless of their background, while textual stimuli foster the variety and quality of ideas, but only in engineering and industrial designers. Comparing the findings, the resulting framework reveals aspects of stimuli that require further investigation. These can be considered valuable insights for new directions for design research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFISs) are machine learning techniques that enable modeling and prediction of various properties in the milling process of alloy 2017A, including quality, cost, and energy consumption (QCE). To utilize ANNs or ANFIS for QCE prediction, researchers must gather a dataset consisting of input–output pairs that establish the relationship between QCE and various input variables such as machining parameters, tool properties, and material characteristics. Subsequently, this dataset can be employed to train a machine learning model using techniques like backpropagation or gradient descent. Once the model has been trained, predictions can be made on new input data by providing the desired input variables, resulting in predicted QCE values as output. This study comprehensively examines and identifies the scientific contributions of strategies, machining sequences, and cutting parameters on surface quality, machining cost, and energy consumption using artificial intelligence (ANN and ANFIS). The findings indicate that the optimal neural architecture for ANNs, utilizing the Bayesian regularization (BR) algorithm, is a {3-10-3} architecture with an overall mean square error (MSE) of 2.74 × 10 −3 . Similarly, for ANFIS, the optimal structure yielding better error and correlation for the three output variables (E tot , C tot , and Ra) is a {2, 2, 2} structure. The results demonstrate that using the BR algorithm with a multi-criteria output response yields favorable outcomes compared to the ANFIS.",

It is normally tackled by decomposing goal objects into features, and then sequencing features to obtain a plan. This paper investigates an alternative approach. The capabilities of a manufacturing process are represented by a formal language of shape, in which sentences correspond to manufacturable objects. The language is interpreted to describe process plans corresponding to the shape generation, complete with cost estimates. A macro layer that describes single operations of the machine is implemented on top of the formal language. The space it describes is searched by the generative simulated annealing algorithm, a stochastic search technique based on simulated annealing. Plans that are close to the optimum are generated in reasonable time.",

This paper describes an extension of function logic that assists in systematic identification of design functions, allocations, and their interrelations. Our approach identifies a three-level function/allocation/component information structure to represent the state of the design. We illustrate new types of links that exist between functions and the effect of these on the representation of the interrelated functions. These linkages provide new pathways for design information and function evaluation through allocation arithmetic and supported functions. A computational model of the conceptual design process is proposed based on the extended function logic design representation. An outline of the inputs, outputs and operations on form and function variables is given as a step prior to the synthesis process. We illustrate, by example, the process of translating functional representations across specialist domains. Finally, a computer-based aid to developing functional models is described.",

Moreover, interactive generative systems can fit naturally into human design thinking and industrial design practice. This discussion is focused on aesthetic design fields like knitwear and graphic design, but is largely applicable to major branches of engineering. Human designers and generative systems have complementary abilities. Humans are extremely good at perceptual evaluation of designs, according to criteria that are extremely hard to program. As a result, they can provide fitness evaluations for evolutionary generative systems. They can also tailor the biases that generation systems use to reach useful solutions quickly. We discuss an application of these approaches: Kelly's evolutionary systems for color scheme design. Automatic design systems can work interactively with human designers by generating complete designs from partial specifications, that can then be used as starting points for designing by modification. We discuss an application of this approach: Eckert's garment shape design system.",

Their growing ubiquity has created new problems in how to effectively manage the many models that are now stored in the digital libraries for large design and manufacturing enterprises. Existing techniques from the engineering literature and industrial practice, such as group technology, rely on human-supervised encodings and classification; techniques from the multimedia database and computer graphics/vision communities often ignore the manufacturing attributes that are most significant in the classification of models. This paper presents our approach to comparing the manufacturing similarity assessments of solid models of mechanical parts based on machining features. Our technical approach is threefold: perform machining feature extraction, construct a model dependency graph (MDG) from the set of machining features, and partition the models in a database using a measure of similarity based on the MDGs. We introduce two heuristic search techniques for comparing MDGs and present empirical experiments to validate our approach using our testbed, the National Design Repository.",

However, making cross-domain analogies is hard and often requires abstractions common to the source and target domains. Recent work in case-based design suggests that generic mechanisms are one type of abstractions useful in adapting past designs. However, one important yet unexplored issue is where these generic mechanisms come from. We hypothesize that they are acquired incrementally from design experiences in familiar domains by abstraction over patterns of regularity. Three important issues in abstraction from experiences are what to abstract from an experience, how far to abstract, and what methods to use. In this short paper, we describe how structure-behavior-function models of designs in a familiar domain provide the content, and together with the problem-solving context in which learning occurs, also provide the constraints for learning generic mechanisms from design experiences. In particular, we describe the model-based learning method with a scenario of learning feedback mechanism.",

However, reuse often fails because knowledge is not captured; it is captured out of context, rendering it not reusable; or there are no formal mechanisms for finding and retrieving reusable knowledge. This paper presents ongoing research on design knowledge reuse that introduces the notion of knowledge in context from a corporate perspective. We argue that in order for knowledge to be reusable, the user should be able to see the rich context in which this knowledge was originally created and interact with it. We call a repository of such knowledge in context the corporate memory. We describe empirical observations of designers reusing knowledge from their personal design experiences. Based on these observations, we formalize two key activities in the process of knowledge reuse from a corporate repository: finding reusable items and understanding these items in context. We formalize six degrees of exploration that lead to understanding. We describe a prototype system, CoMem, that supports these activities. CoMem is distinguished from the document-centric state of practice solutions by its approach of “overview first, zoom and filter, and then details on demand.” In order to accomplish this approach we propose three metaphors: corporate map, fisheye lens, and storyteller. These metaphors and their implementation in CoMem are illustrated using an industry scenario.",

    "abstract": "The need to model and to reason about design alternatives throughout the design process demands robust representation schemes of function, behavior, and structure. Function describes the physical effect imposed on an energy or material flow by a design entity without regard for the working principles or physical solutions used to accomplish this effect. Behaviors are the physical events associated with a physical artifact (or hypothesized concept) over time (or simulated time) as perceived by an observer. Structure, the most tangible concept, partitions an artifact into meaningful constituents such as features, Wirk elements, and interfaces in addition to the widely used assemblies and components. The focus of this work is on defining a model for function-based representations that can be used across various design methodologies and for a variety of design tasks throughout all stages of the design process. In particular, the mapping between function and structure is explored and, to a lesser extent, its impact on behavior is noted. Clearly, the issues of a function-based representation's composition and mappings directly impact certain computational synthesis methods that rely on (digitally) archived product design knowledge. Moreover, functions have already been related to not only form, but also information of user actions, performance parameters in the form of equations, and failure mode data. It is essential to understand the composition and mappings of functions and their relation to design activities because this information is part of the foundation for function-based methods, and consequently dictates the performance of those methods. Toward this end, the important findings of this work include a formalism for two aspects of function-based representations (composition and mappings), the supported design activities of the model for function-based representations, and examples of how computational design methods benefit from this formalism.",

Despite more than 30 years of research there still remains much uncertainty: how useful are the potential benefits and how insurmountable are the barriers? Will the value of the rationale (design and otherwise) justify the cost of collecting it? Although there have been numerous rationale research projects, many, if not most, received little or no empirical evaluation. There also have not been many studies examining what the needs are of the practitioners who would be supported by the rationale. This article discusses the “doom and gloom” predictions of rationale's failure, provides a survey of evaluations of rationale systems, and discusses what we hope is a brighter outlook for rationale research in the future. There are development standards and synergistic research areas that may help with rationale research and its acceptance in the software community with which we should be working. This article also presents the results of a pilot survey of software developers who were asked how they would envision using rationale and what they believe the most important barriers are. Although some results were as expected, there were also some surprises. Research on technology transfer indicates that, among other things, to transition successfully from research into practice we need to understand the need that is being met and demonstrate the value of our approach. Until we have determined how our work is needed by the people we are trying to help we will remain researching under uncertainty.",

Throughout the design process physical prototypes are used to enable exploration, simulation, communication, and specification of designs. Although much is known about prototyping skills and technologies, the reasons why and how such models are employed in design practice are poorly understood. Advanced techniques and design media such as virtual and augmented prototyping are being introduced without insight as to their benefits. We believe that an augmented prototyping system, that is, employing augmented reality technology to combine physical and digital representations, could positively influence the design process. However, we lack knowledge on why and how it might facilitate design. This paper reports on case studies performed in different domains of industrial design. At each of three Dutch design offices, a project was followed with particular attention to physical prototyping and group activities. The projects encompassed information appliance design, automotive design, and interior design. Although the studies vary in many aspects (product domain, stakeholders, duration), the findings can be applied in conceptualizing advanced prototyping systems to support industrial design. Furthermore, the data reveal that the roles of a prototype in current practice are not necessarily utilitarian; for example, the prototype may serve as a conversation piece or as seducer. Based on so-called “hints,” bottlenecks and best practices concerning concept articulation are linked to usage scenarios for augmented tangible prototyping. The results point to modeling and communication scenarios. Detailed study of the cases indicates that communication activities, especially design reviews, would benefit most from interactive augmented prototyping.",

In complex projects, effective oversight of the project personnel and the progress of the project are essential in ensuring that project objectives are met. This is especially true of projects that require contributions from various experts, whose interaction may be limited to a Web-based collaborative tool. Such oversight is typically the job of a project manager who is tasked with avoiding cost overruns, shipment delays, and ensuring product effectiveness. We utilize context-based reasoning and contextual graphs as the tools of choice for implementing an agent that emulates the function of a competent project manager.

It also constitutes a practice for reestablishing intersubjectivity and solving interactional trouble such as misunderstandings or disagreements by virtue of enlisting something as part of the participants’ shared experience. We use this analysis to discuss implications for how such practices might be supported with computer mediation, arguing for a “bricolage” approach to systems development that emphasizes the provision of resources for users to collaboratively negotiate the accomplishment of intersubjectivity rather than systems that try to support pointing as a specific gestural action.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Engineering risk methods and tools account for and make decisions about risk using an expected-value approach. Psychological research has shown that stakeholders and decision makers hold domain-specific risk attitudes that often vary between individuals and between enterprises. Moreover, certain companies and industries (e.g., the nuclear power industry and aerospace corporations) are very risk-averse whereas other organizations and industrial sectors (e.g., IDEO, located in the innovation and design sector) are risk tolerant and actually thrive by making risky decisions. Engineering risk methods such as failure modes and effects analysis, fault tree analysis, and others are not equipped to help stakeholders make decisions under risk-tolerant or risk-averse decision-making conditions. This article presents a novel method for translating engineering risk data from the expected-value domain into a risk appetite corrected domain using utility functions derived from the psychometric Engineering Domain-Specific Risk-Taking test results under a single-criterion decision-based design approach. The method is aspirational rather than predictive in nature through the use of a psychometric test rather than lottery methods to generate utility functions. Using this method, decisions can be made based upon risk appetite corrected risk data. We discuss development and application of the method based upon a simplified space mission design in a collaborative design-center environment. The method is shown to change risk-based decisions in certain situations where a risk-averse or risk-tolerant decision maker would likely choose differently than the expected-value approach dictates.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Traceability of information provides the basis for assessing the credibility of engineering information, better understanding it, and making judgments about the appropriateness of its use for a particular design task. The presented research attempts to answer how the proposed traceability methodology and framework could help designers to improve communication, eventually create new channels of communication, and contribute to the creation of shared understanding in collaborative design processes. The discussion of these issues is based on a literature review, empirical research, observations of industrial practice, and feedback from initial implementation. The research is focused on information objects (IOs), archetypically represented in the engineering domain as technical documents that are often complex structures constituted of textual, numerical, and graphical fragments. The presented approach is based on an abstraction of IOs' relationships organized around specific contexts that are defined by a subset of product development ontology. Each IO could be repeatedly represented in various contexts that may contain different subsets of objects and their relationships. Such a representation also acts as a container in which the ontology concept instances are associated with IOs being developed and traced during the design episode. The usage of the proposed traceability methodology is discussed with examples of implementation and possible utilization situations. The paper is focused on explaining how the developed functionalities could help to resolve manifestations of inadequate information flow, which cause communication barriers in engineering companies. In addition, the proposed traceability methodology offers the possibility to record the detailed history of actions and events associated with IOs in the usage process of the product life cycle management systems. Based on the research findings, this paper argues that such a network of the traceability links and relationships may be viewed as a novel design communication channel.",

A basis adaptation strategy previously introduced by the authors is integrated into a design optimization framework that construes the optimization cost function as the quantity of interest and computes stochastic adapted bases as functions of design space parameters. With these adapted bases, the stochastic integrations at each design point are evaluated as low-dimensional integrals (mostly one dimensional). The proposed approach is demonstrated on a well-placement problem where the uncertainty is in the form of a stochastic process describing the permeability of the subsurface. An analysis of the method is carried out to better understand the effect of design parameters on the smoothness of the adaptation isometry.",

The traditional scheduling models consider performance indicators such as processing time, cost, and quality as optimization objectives. However, most of them do not take into account energy consumption and robustness. We focus our attention in a job-shop scheduling problem where machines can work at different speeds. It represents an extension of the classical job-shop scheduling problem, where each operation has to be executed by one machine and this machine can work at different speeds. The main goal of the paper is focused on the analysis of three important objectives (energy efficiency, robustness, and makespan) and the relationship among them. We present some analytical formulas to estimate the ratio/relationship between these parameters. It can be observed that there exists a clear relationship between robustness and energy efficiency and a clear trade-off between robustness/energy efficiency and makespan. It represents an advance in the state of the art of production scheduling, so obtaining energy-efficient solutions also supposes obtaining robust solutions, and vice versa.",

The sequential segments in a protocol analysis can be related to each other by examining their semantic content producing a design session's linkograph, which defines the design space for a design session. From a linkograph, it is possible to compute the probabilities of the connectivity of each segment for its forelinks and its backlinks, together with the probabilities of distance among links. A linkograph's entropy is a measure of the information in the design session. It is claimed that the entropy of the linkograph measures the potential of the design space being generated as the design proceeds chronologically. We present an approach to the automated construction of linkographs by connecting segments using the lexical database WordNet and measure its entropy. A case study of two design sessions with different characteristics was conducted, one considered more productive and creative, the other more pragmatic. Those segments with high entropy and those associated with high rates of change of entropy are analyzed. The creative session has a higher linkograph entropy. This result indicates the potential of using entropy to characterize a design process.",

    "abstract": "Abstract One problem in incremental product development is that geometric models are limited in their ability to explore radical alternative design variants. In this publication, a function modeling approach is suggested to increase the amount and variety of explored alternatives, since function models (FM) provide greater model flexibility. An enhanced function-means (EF-M) model capable of representing the constraints of the design space as well as alternative designs is created through a reverse engineering process. This model is then used as a basis for the development of a new product variant. This work describes the EF-M model's capabilities for representing the design space and integrating novel solutions into the existing product structure and explains how these capabilities support the exploration of alternative design variants. First-order analyses are executed, and the EF-M model is used to capture and represent already existing design information for further analyses. Based on these findings, a design space exploration approach is developed. It positions the FM as a connection between legacy and novel designs and, through this, allows for the exploration of more diverse product concepts. This approach is based on three steps – decomposition, design, and embodiment – and builds on the capabilities of EF-M to model alternative solutions for different requirements. While the embodiment step of creating the novel product's geometry is still a topic for future research, the design space exploration concept can be used to enable wider, more methodological, and potentially automated design space exploration.",

    "abstract": "Dealing with component interactions and dependencies remains a core and fundamental aspect of engineering, where conflicts and constraints are solved on an almost daily basis. Failure to consider these interactions and dependencies can lead to costly overruns, failure to meet requirements, and lengthy redesigns. Thus, the management and monitoring of these dependencies remains a crucial activity in engineering projects and is becoming ever more challenging with the increase in the number of components, component interactions, and component dependencies, in both a structural and a functional sense. For these reasons, tools and methods to support the identification and monitoring of component interactions and dependencies continues to be an active area of research. In particular, design structure matrices (DSMs) have been extensively applied to identify and visualize product and organizational architectures across a number of engineering disciplines. However, the process of generating these DSMs has primarily used surveys, structured interviews, and/or meetings with engineers. As a consequence, there is a high cost associated with engineers' time alongside the requirement to continually update the DSM structure as a product develops. It follows that the proposition of this paper is to investigate whether an automated and continuously evolving DSM can be generated by monitoring the changes in the digital models that represent the product. This includes models that are generated from computer-aided design, finite element analysis, and computational fluid dynamics systems. The paper shows that a DSM generated from the changes in the product models corroborates with the product architecture as defined by the engineers and results from previous DSM studies. In addition, further levels of product architecture dependency were also identified. A particular affordance of automatically generating DSMs is the ability to continually generate DSMs throughout the project. This paper demonstrates the opportunity for project managers to monitor emerging product dependencies alongside changes in modes of working between the engineers. The application of this technique could be used to support existing product life cycle change management solutions, cross-company product development, and small to medium enterprises who do not have a product life cycle management solution.",

In this paper, we present an ontology that provides decision support from both the “construct” and the “information” perspectives that address the gap that existing research focus on these two perspectives separately and cannot provide effective decision support. The decision support construct in the ontology is the compromise decision support problem (cDSP) that is used to make multiobjective design decisions. The information for decision making is archived as cDSP templates and represented using frame-based ontology for facilitating reuse, consistency maintaining, and rapid execution. In order to facilitate designers’ effective reuse of the populated cDSP templates ontology instances, we identified three types of modification that can be made when design consideration evolves. In our earlier work, part of the utilization (consistency checking) of the ontology has been demonstrated through a thin-walled pressure vessel redesign example. In this paper, we comprehensively present the ontology utilization including consistency checking, trade-off analysis, and design space visualization based on the pressure vessel example.",

Hence, aluminum becomes an unquestionable material choice regarding these challenges. Nevertheless, using only virgin aluminum is not satisfactory because its extraction requires high use of energy and effort, and its manufacturing has high environmental impact. For these reasons, the use of recycled aluminum alloys is recommended considering their properties meet the expected technical and environmental added values. This requires complete reengineering of the classical life cycle of aluminum-based products and the collaboration practices in the global supply chain. The results from several interdependent disciplines all need to be taken into account for a global product/process optimization. Toward achieving this, a method for sustainability assessment integration into product life cycle management and a platform for life cycle simulation integrating environmental concerns are proposed in this paper. The platform may be used as a decision support system in the early product design phase by simulating the life cycle of a product (from material selection to production and recycling phases) and calculating its impact on the environment.",

While in the open design, females showed higher theta, alpha, and beta 2 in the left prefrontal cortex and secondary visual cortex for all frequency bands. Results within gender between tasks indicate higher theta and alpha in the prefrontal cortex in the constrained design for both genders. Whilst for open design, results indicate higher theta and alpha 1 in the right hemisphere and higher alpha 2 and beta bands across hemispheres for both genders.

    "abstract": "Abstract With the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) as a new source of “big” data and value creation, businesses encounter novel opportunities as well as challenges in IoT design. Although recent research argues that digital technology can enable new kinds of development processes that are distinctive from their counterparts in the 20th century, minimal attention has been focused on the IoT design process. In order to contextualize New Product Development (NPD) processes for IoT, this paper comprehensively interrogates existing, and emerging development approaches for products, services, software, and integrated products, and several factors that affect designing IoT. This discussion includes the generic development process, the commonalities and differences of different development approaches, and processes. The paper demonstrates that only a few existing approaches reflect vital characteristics of networked artifacts or the integration of data science within the development model, which is one of the key attributes of IoT design. From these investigations, we propose “ The Mobius Strip Model of IoT Development ProcessI ,” a conceptual process for IoT design, which is distinctive to others. The continuous loops of the IoT design integrate the attributes and phases of different processes and consist of two different development approaches and strategies. Understanding the particular attributes of the IoT NPD process can help novice and experienced researchers in both feeding and drawing insight from the broader design discourse.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the present work, a new hybrid approach combining particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with recurrent dynamic neural network (RDNN), which is described as PSO-RDNN algorithm, is proposed for multi-performance optimization of machining parameters in finish turning of hardened AISI D2. The suggested optimization problem is solved using the weighted sum technique. Process parameters including cutting speed and feed rate are optimized for minimizing operation cost, maximizing tool life, and producing parts with acceptable surface roughness. Based on experimental results, two neural network models were developed for predicting tool flank wear and surface roughness during the machining process. Based on trained neural networks and structured hybrid algorithm, optimum cutting parameters were obtained. The coefficient of determination for trained neural networks was calculated as R 2 = 0.9893 and R 2 = 0.9879 for predicted flank wear and surface roughness, respectively, which proves the efficiency of trained neural models in real industrial applications. Furthermore, the offered methodology returns a Pareto optimality graph, which represents optimized cutting variables for several various cutting conditions.",

New and specific time measurement techniques are required for such companies. This research developed a novel time estimation approach based on several machine learning methods. The set of collected inputs in the manufacturing environment, including a number of products, the number of welding operations, product's surface area factor, difficulty/working environment factors, and the number of metal forming processes. The data were collected from one of the largest bus manufacturing companies in Turkey. Experimental results demonstrate that when model accuracy was measured using performance measures, k-nearest neighbors outperformed other machine learning techniques in terms of prediction accuracy. “The number of welding operations” and “the number of pieces” were found to be the most effective parameters. The findings show that machine learning algorithms can estimate standard time, and the findings can be used for several purposes, including lowering production costs, increasing productivity, and ensuring efficiency in the execution of their operating processes by other companies that manufacture similar products.",

This paper presents a focused literature review of AI-based methods mapped to the different stages of the engineering design process and describes how these methods assist the design process. We surveyed 108 AI-based engineering design papers from peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings and mapped their contribution to five stages of the engineering design process. We categorized seven AI-based methods in our dataset. Our literature study indicated that most AI-based design research works are targeted at the conceptual and preliminary design stages. Given the open-ended, ambiguous nature of these early stages, these results are unexpected. We conjecture that this is likely a result of several factors, including the iterative nature of design tasks in these stages, the availability of open design data repositories, and the inclination to use AI for processing computationally intensive tasks, like those in these stages. Our study also indicated that these methods support designers by synthesizing and/or analyzing design data, concepts, and models in the design stages. This literature review aims to provide readers with an informative mapping of different AI tools to engineering design stages and to potentially motivate engineers, design researchers, and students to understand the current state-of-the-art and identify opportunities for applying AI applications in engineering design.",

AM has enabled the handling and manufacturing of a wide variety of components, and its accessibility has enabled more individuals to make. While smaller than their production-scale counterparts, the objectives of minimizing technician overhead, capital expenditure, and job response time remain the same. The typical First-Come First-Serve (FCFS) operating model, while functional, is not necessarily the most efficient and makes responding to a-typical or urgent demand profiles difficult. This article reports a study that investigated how AM machines configured with Minimally Intelligent agents can support production in these environments. An agent-based model that simulated 5, 10, 15, and 20 AM machines operating a 9 am−5 pm pattern and experiencing a diverse non-repeating demand profile was developed. Machines were configured with minimal intelligence – FCFS, First-Response First-Serve (FRFS), Longest Print Time (LPT), Shortest Print Time (SPT), and Random Selection logics – that governed the selection of jobs from the job pool. A full factorial simulation totaling 15,629 configurations was run until convergence to a ranked list of production performance – min Job Time-in-System. Performance changed as much as 200%. Performant configurations featured a variety of logics, while the least performant were dominated by FCFS and LPT. All FCFS (a proxy for today’s operations) was one of the least performant configurations. The results provide an optimal set of logics and performance bands that can be used to justify capital expenditure and AM operations in Makerspaces.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The increase in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (EEE) usage in various sectors has given rise to repair and maintenance units. Disassembly of parts requires proper planning, which is done by the Disassembly Sequence Planning (DSP) process. Since the manual disassembly process has various time and labor restrictions, it requires proper planning. Effective disassembly planning methods can encourage the reuse and recycling sector, resulting in reduction of raw-materials mining. An efficient DSP can lower the time and cost consumption. To address the challenges in DSP, this research introduces an innovative framework based on Q-Learning (QL) within the domain of Reinforcement Learning (RL). Furthermore, an Enhanced Simulated Annealing (ESA) algorithm is introduced to improve the exploration and exploitation balance in the proposed RL framework. The proposed framework is extensively evaluated against state-of-the-art frameworks and benchmark algorithms using a diverse set of eight products as test cases. The findings reveal that the proposed framework outperforms benchmark algorithms and state-of-the-art frameworks in terms of time consumption, memory consumption, and solution optimality. Specifically, for complex large products, the proposed technique achieves a remarkable minimum reduction of 60% in time consumption and 30% in memory usage compared to other state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, qualitative analysis demonstrates that the proposed approach generates sequences with high fitness values, indicating more stable and less time-consuming disassembles. The utilization of this framework allows for the realization of various real-world disassembly applications, thereby making a significant contribution to sustainable practices in EEE industries.",

In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) improve diagnosis accuracy by extracting excellent fault features. However, CNN lacks an explicit learning mechanism to distinguish between different fault characteristics in the input signal to the diagnosis results. This article presents a new end-to-end depth framework called multi-head self-attention convolution neural network (MSA-CNN) for bearing fault diagnosis. Firstly, we adopt a data pre-processing method that directly converts one-dimensional (1D) original signals into two-dimensional (2D) grayscale images, which is simple to implement and preserves the complete information of the original signal. Secondly, multi-head self-attention (MSA) is first constructed to aggregate the global information and adaptively assign weights to the input signal's features. Thirdly, the CNN with small-scale kernels extracted detailed local features. Finally, the learned high-level representations are fed into the full connect (FC) layer for fault diagnosis. The performance of the MSA-CNN is validated on different datasets. The results show that the proposed MSA-CNN can significantly improve fault diagnosis accuracy compared with the other state-of-the-art methods and has excellent noise immunity performance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The disassembly of power batteries poses significant challenges due to their complex sources, diverse types, variations in design and manufacturing processes, and diverse service conditions. Human memory capacity and robot cognitive and understanding capabilities are limited when faced with different dismantling tasks for end-of-life power batteries. Insufficient human-computer interaction capabilities greatly hinder the efficiency of human-robot collaboration (HRC) operations. The existing HRC relies heavily on the experience of operators, while the existing disassembly system fails to update new disassembly strategies in real time when facing new battery varieties. Therefore, this paper proposes an augmented reality-assisted human-robot collaboration (AR-HRC) power battery dismantling system based on transfer learning. It consists of three modules: AR-HRC knowledge modeling, dismantling subgraph similarity assessment, and strategy transfer update. The AR-HRC knowledge modeling module aims to establish an intelligent mapping from tasks to collaborative strategies based on part features. Based on the evaluation of task similarity, the mobility assessment model divides subtasks into similar and dissimilar classes. For similar subtasks, the original dismantling strategy can be applied to the current task. However, for different subtasks, operators can issue instructions to the AR-HRC system through the human-computer interaction function of AR and develop new collaborative strategies based on actual conditions. Finally, a case study of power battery dismantling is conducted, and the results show that compared to traditional pre-programmed assembly, this system can improve dismantling efficiency and reduce cognitive burden.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Present-day software applications are increasingly required to be “reuse-conscious” in terms of the operating platforms, topology, and evolutionary requirements. Traditionally, there has been much difficulty in communicating specialized knowledge like design intents, design recommendations, and design justifications in the discipline of software engineering. This paper presents a methodology based on the combination of design rationale and design patterns to design reusable software systems. Design rationale is the representation of the reasoning behind the design of an artifact. Design patterns are descriptions of communicating objects and classes that are customized to solve a general design problem in a particular context. The paper details the use of an explicit software development process to capture and disseminate the specialized knowledge (i.e., intents, recommendations, and justifications) that augments the description of the cases in a library (i.e., design patterns) during the development of software applications by heterogeneous groups. The importance of preserving and using this specialized knowledge has become apparent with the growing trend of combining the software development process with the product (i.e., software code). The importance of codifying corporate memory in this regard is also important considering the changing nature of the workplace, where more people are on contract. The information on how and why a software code was developed becomes essential for efficient and smooth continuity of the present software project as well as for reusing the code in future projects. It has become essential to capture the design rationale to develop and design software systems efficiently and reliably. The software prototype developed using the combined methodology will be used as a part of an integrated design environment for reusable software design. This environment supports collaborative development of software applications by a group of software specialists from a library of building block cases represented by design patterns.",

An iiGA in combination with a structural finite element code is used to search for shape variations and material placement to optimize the Specific Energy Density (SED, rotational energy per unit weight) of elastic flywheels while controlling the failure angular velocity. iiGAs seek solutions simultaneously at different levels of refinement of the problem representation (and correspondingly different definitions of the fitness function) in separate subpopulations (islands). Solutions are sought first at low levels of refinement with an axi-symmetric plane stress finite element code for high-speed exploration of the coarse design space. Next, individuals are injected into populations with a higher level of resolution that use an axi-symmetric three-dimensional finite element code to “fine-tune” the structures. A greatly simplified design space (containing two million possible solutions) was enumerated for comparison with various approaches that include: simple GAs, threshold accepting (TA), iiGAs and hybrid iiGAs. For all approaches compared for this simplified problem, all variations of the iiGA were found to be the most efficient. This paper will summarize results obtained studying a constrained optimization problem with a huge design space approached with parallel GAs that had various topological structures and several different types of iiGA, to compare efficiency. For this problem, all variations of the iiGA were found to be extremely efficient in terms of computational time required to final solution of similar fitness when compared to the parallel GAs.",

In this paper we argue that concurrent engineering requires both technical and organizational solutions, and we call the result concurrent design . We believe that the essence of concurrent design is the myriad of interactions that occur at the interfaces among all of the members of a design team and all their tools. Solving either the technical or organizational problems by assuming away the interactions will not solve the problems of concurrent design.

We also present the evolution of concurrent design research at the Carnegie Mellon Engineering Design Research Center. In our research, we have designed, manufactured, and used our own tools as well as observed their use by others—where the tools include mobile computers, design analysis programs, and information organization tools. Through this process, we have learned about design education and design practice, and we have uncovered new issues for design research.

We view generalization over experiences in the absence of any prior knowledge of the target principle as the task of hypothesis formation, a subtask of discovery. Also, we view the use of the hypothesized principles for analogical design as the task of hypothesis testing, another subtask of discovery. In this paper, we focus on discovery of physical principles by generalization over design experiences in the domain of physical devices. Some important issues in generalization from experiences are what to generalize from an experience, how far to generalize, and what methods to use. We represent a reasoner's comprehension of specific designs in the form of structure-behavior-function (SBF) models. An SBF model provides a functional and causal explanation of the working of a device. We represent domain principles as device-independent behavior-function (BF) models. We show that (1) the function of a device determines what to generalize from its SBF model, (2) the SBF model itself suggests how far to generalize, and (3) the typology of functions indicates what method to use.",

These world views are combined with research heuristics or research perspectives and criteria for evaluating research to create a layered model of research methodology.

Hence, configuration problems are often weakly constrained and have many solutions. However, many of those solutions may be discarded by the user as long as more interesting solutions are possible. The user often prefers certain choices to others (e.g., a red color for a car to a blue color) or prefers solutions that minimize or maximize certain criteria such as price and quality. In order to provide satisfactory solutions, a configurator needs to address user preferences and user wishes. Another important problem is to provide high-level features to control different reasoning tasks such as solution search, explanation, consistency checking, and reconfiguration. We address those problems by introducing a preference programming system that provides a new paradigm for expressing user preferences and user wishes and provides search strategies in a declarative and unified way, such that they can be embedded in a constraint and rule language. The preference programming approach is completely open and dynamic. In fact, preferences can be assembled from different sources such as business rules, databases, annotations of the object model, or user input. An advanced topic is to elicit preferences from user interactions, especially from explanations of why a user rejects proposed choices. Our preference programming system has successfully been used in different configuration domains such as loan configuration, service configuration, and other problems.",

    "abstract": "One of the aspects of mass customization is to provide customers with products that are manufactured to their needs and requirements. To provide such support requires better integration of the customer into different stages of design and manufacturing. Expansion of the Internet provides an opportunity for such an integration, which will need to link design and manufacturing of the company with the customer. In current approaches, customers usually specify the options and get the price or simple pictures of the object. In this paper we present a framework in which customer options and size parameters are gathered using the Internet. It is used to automatically generate a 3-dimensional computer-aided design model of the product, estimate the price of the product, and generate assembly sequence information. The framework for mass customization of products necessitates information management among different segments of the company and the customer. The Internet-based system presented in this paper uses a graph grammar and templates to explicitly maintain correspondence among various types of product information from a module perspective. The system is demonstrated using a customizable coffeemaker product family.",

In this procedure, each experiment in Taguchi's orthogonal array (OA) is treated as a decision-making unit (DMU) with the multiresponses as the inputs and outputs for all DMUs. For each factor of OA, the DMUs are divided into groups, each at the same factor level. Then, DMU's efficiency is separately evaluated by the CEBDS approach and the bilateral comparisons approach for each factor. The level efficiency, or the average of the efficiencies obtained by the CEBDS and the bilateral comparisons approaches for that factor level, is then used to determine the optimal factor levels for multiresponses. Three case studies are provided for illustration; in all, the proposed procedure provides the largest total anticipated improvements. Hence, it should be considered the most effective among all approaches applied in the case studies, including principal component analysis, DEA-based ranking approach, and others. In addition, the proposed procedure is more effective and requires less computational effort when the DMU's efficiency is evaluated by the bilateral comparisons approach instead of the CEBDS approach. In conclusion, the proposed procedure will provide great assistance to practitioners for solving the multiresponse problems in manufacturing applications on the Taguchi method.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The two critical issues related to product design exploration are addressed: the balance between stylistic consistency and innovation, and the control of design process under a great diversity of requirements. To address these two issues, the view of understanding product design exploration is first sought. In this view, the exploration of designs is not only categorized as a problem-solving activity but also as a problem-finding activity. A computational framework is developed based on this view, and it encompasses the belief that these two activities go hand in hand to accomplish the design tasks in an interactive design environment. The framework adopts an integration approach of two key computational techniques, shape grammars and evolutionary computing, for addressing the above two critical issues. For the issues of stylistic consistency, this paper focuses on the computational techniques in balancing the conflicts of stylistic consistency and innovation with shape grammars. For the issues of controlling design process, the practical concerns of monitoring the design process through various activities starting from the preparation works to the implementation of shape grammars have been emphasized in the development of this framework. To evaluate the effectiveness of the framework, the experiments have been set up to reflect the practical situations with which the designers have to deal. The system generates a number of models from scratch with numerical analysis that can be evaluated effectively by the designers. This reduces the designers' time and allows the designers to concentrate their efforts on performing higher level of design activities such as evaluation of designs and making design decisions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper presents our research on developing an ontology-based framework that can represent morphological characteristics related to assembly joints. Joints within the physical structure of an assembly are inevitable because of the limitations of component geometries and the associated, required engineering properties. Consequently, a framework is needed that can capture and propagate assembly design and joint information in a robust assembly model throughout the entire product development processes. The framework and model are based on an understanding of the morphological characteristics of an assembly and its different physical effects. The morphological characteristics are consequences of the principal physical processes and of the design intentions. Therefore, the morphological characteristics should be carefully represented while considering the geometry and topology of assembly joints. In this research, assembly joint topology is defined by a mereotopology, which is a region-based theory for the parts and associated concepts. This formal ontology can differentiate often ambiguous assembly and joining relations. Furthermore, the mereotopological definitions for assembly joints are implemented in Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules and Web Ontology Language triples. This process provides universality to the mereotopological definitions. Two geometrically and topologically similar joint pairs are presented to describe how the assembly joints can be defined in mereotopology and be transformed into SWRL rules. Web3D is also employed to support network-enabled sharing of assembly geometry. Finally, the proposed modeling framework is demonstrated using a real fixture assembly. This case study demonstrates the usability of the proposed framework for network-based design collaboration.",

Our test bed consists of tangible, digital, and hybrid design journals collected from four semesters of UC Berkeley's graduate level, multidisciplinary course titled “Managing the New Product Development Process: Design Theory and Methods.” We developed protocols for two categories of analysis: one that codes for the media type of each journal and its content, and another one that characterizes the content within the journal. We found a trend toward hybrid digital–tangible journals for the engineering students over the 4-year period. These hybrid journals exhibited a higher degree of detail over advancing design stages, which has been shown to correlate with improved project performance. We also present several case studies of unusual design journals that illustrate the range of designers' interpretations of design journals as a medium.

The frequency of use of function terms and phrases in 11 graphical and 110 list-based representations in the repository is examined and used to analyze the organization and expressiveness of the functional basis and function models. Within the context of reverse engineering, we determined that the modeling resolution provided by the hierarchical levels, especially the tertiary level, is inadequate for function modeling; the tertiary terms are inappropriate for capturing sufficient details desired by modelers for archiving and reuse, and there is a need for a more expressive flow terms and flow qualifiers in the vocabulary. A critical comparison is also presented of two representations in the design repository: function structures and function lists. The conclusions are used to identify new research opportunities, including the extension of the vocabulary to incorporate flow qualifiers in addition to more expressive terms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The main hypothesis investigated in this paper is based upon the suggestion that the discursive reasoning in architecture supported by an explicit knowledge of spatial configurations can enhance both design productivity and the intelligibility of design solutions. The study consists of an examination of an architect's performance while solving intuitively a well-defined problem followed by an analysis of the spatial structure of their design solutions. One group of architects will attempt to solve the design problem logically, rationalizing their design decisions by implementing their explicit knowledge of spatial configurations. The other group will use an implicit form of such knowledge arising from their architectural education to reason about their design acts. An integrated model of protocol analysis combining linkography and macroscopic coding is used to analyze the design processes. The resulting design outcomes will be evaluated quantitatively in terms of their spatial configurations. The analysis appears to show that an explicit knowledge of the rules of spatial configurations, as possessed by the first group of architects can partially enhance their function-driven judgment producing permeable and well-structured spaces. These findings are particularly significant as they imply that an explicit rather than an implicit knowledge of the fundamental rules that make a layout possible can lead to a considerable improvement in both the design process and product. This suggests that by externalizing the design knowledge and restructuring it in a design model, creative thought can efficiently be evolved and stimulated.",

Informed by theories of embodiment that have recently gained interest in cognitive science, we focus on the role of interactive “traces,” representational artifacts both created and used by participants as scaffolds for creating shared understanding. Our research through design approach resulted in two prototypes that form two concrete proposals of how the environment may scaffold shared understanding in design meetings. In several user studies we observed users working with our systems in natural contexts. Our analysis reveals how an ensemble of ongoing social as well as physical interactions, scaffolded by the interactive environment, grounds the formation of shared understanding in teams.

It is the human communicative ability to display understanding to resolve misunderstandings that plays an important part in the organization of the design inputs to a construction project.

In this setting the coordination of both in situ design activities and the planning of design tasks takes place in real time, in conversation. Exhibited are several ways that design ambiguities and uncertainties can be seen in the interactional details of a multidisciplinary design team's conversation, to then report on how different design expertise featured in the raising of, and attempts at resolving, the misunderstandings that arose. In the course of this meeting, ambiguity and uncertainty were observed not as neat, discrete phenomena but were interwoven in the conversation. This characteristic poses difficulties in the disambiguation of the problem-solving response to each form of misunderstanding and further develops our understanding of design as it is communicated and conducted in social interaction.

The development of advanced search and optimization strategies to guide the computational synthesis process is an active research area with great improvements in the last decades. The development of the grammar rules, however, often resembles an art rather than a science. Poor grammars drive the need for problem specific and sophisticated search and optimization algorithms that guide the synthesis process toward valid and optimized designs in a reasonable amount of time. Instead of tuning search algorithms for inferior grammars, this research focuses on designing better grammars to not unnecessarily burden the search process. It presents a grammar rule analysis method to provide a more systematic development process for grammar rules. The goal of the grammar rule analysis method is to improve the quality of the rules and in turn have a major impact on the quality of the designs generated. Four different grammars for automated gearbox synthesis are used as a case study to validate the developed method and show its potential.",

However, several issues hinder progress with the understanding and usage of functions: lack of a clear and overarching definition of function, lack of overall justifications for the inevitability of the multiple views of function, and scarcity of systematic attempts to relate these views with one another. To help resolve these, the objectives of this research are to propose a common definition of function that underlies the multiple views in literature and to identify and validate the views of function that are logically justified to be present in designing. Function is defined as a change intended by designers between two scenarios: before and after the introduction of the design. A framework is proposed that comprises the above definition of function and an empirically validated model of designing, extended generate, evaluate, modify, and select of state-change, and an action, part, phenomenon, input, organ, and effect model of causality (Known as GEMS of SAPPhIRE), comprising the views of activity, outcome, requirement–solution–information, and system–environment. The framework is used to identify the logically possible views of function in the context of designing and is validated by comparing these with the views of function in the literature. Describing the different views of function using the proposed framework should enable comparisons and determine relationships among the various views, leading to better understanding and usage of functions in designing.",

Shape grammar implementations have the potential to both automate parts of the design process and allow exploration of design alternatives. In many of the existing implementations, the main focus is either on capturing the rationale of a particular existing grammar or on allowing designers to develop a new grammar. However, little attention is typically given to the actual representation of the design space that can be explored in the interface of the implementation. With such representation, a shape grammar implementation could properly support designers who are still in the process of designing and may not yet have a clear shape grammar in mind. In this article, an approach and a proof-of-concept software system is proposed for a shape grammar implementation that provides a visual and interactive way to support design space exploration in a creative design process. We describe the method by which this software system can be used and focus on how designers can interact with the exploration process. In particular, we point out how the proposed approach realizes several important amplification strategies to support design space exploration.",

Verbal protocols are a popular technique used to analyze design activities. However, verbal protocols are known to have some limitations. A recurring problem in design protocol analysis is to segment and code protocol data into logical and semantic units. This is usually a manual step and little work has been done on fully automated segmentation techniques. Physiological signals such as electroencephalograms (EEG) can provide assistance in solving this problem. Such problems are typical inverse problems that occur in the line of research. A thought process needs to be reconstructed from its output, an EEG signal. We propose an EEG-based method for design protocol coding and segmentation. We provide experimental validation of our methods and compare manual segmentation by domain experts to algorithmic segmentation using EEG. The best performing automated segmentation method (when manual segmentation is the baseline) is found to have an average deviation from manual segmentations of 2 s. Furthermore, EEG-based segmentation can identify cognitive structures that simple observation of design protocols cannot. EEG-based segmentation does not replace complex domain expert segmentation but rather complements it. Techniques such as verbal protocols are known to fail in some circumstances. EEG-based segmentation has the added feature that it is fully automated and can be readily integrated in engineering systems and subsystems. It is effectively a window into the mind.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper addresses the fulfillment of requirements related to case-based reasoning (CBR) processes for system design. Considering that CBR processes are well suited for problem solving, the proposed method concerns the definition of an integrated CBR process in line with system engineering principles. After the definition of the requirements that the approach has to fulfill, an ontology is defined to capitalize knowledge about the design within concepts. Based on the ontology, models are provided for requirements and solutions representation. Next, a recursive CBR process, suitable for system design, is provided. Uncertainty and designer preferences as well as ontological guidelines are considered during the requirements definition, the compatible cases retrieval, and the solution definition steps. This approach is designed to give flexibility within the CBR process as well as to provide guidelines to the designer. Such questions as the following are conjointly treated: how to guide the designer to be sure that the requirements are correctly defined and suitable for the retrieval step, how to retrieve cases when there are no available similarity measures, and how to enlarge the research scope during the retrieval step to obtain a sufficient panel of solutions. Finally, an example of system engineering in the aeronautic domain illustrates the proposed method. A testbed has been developed and carried out to evaluate the performance of the retrieval algorithm and a software prototype has been developed in order to test the approach. The outcome of this work is a recursive CBR process suitable to engineering design and compatible with standards. Requirements are modeled by means of flexible constraints, where the designer preferences are used to express the flexibility. Similar solutions can be retrieved even if similarity measures between features are not available. Simultaneously, ontological guidelines are used to guide the process and to aid the designer to express her/his preferences.",

Analogies were coded for “analogical distance” (i.e., within domain or between domain) and “analogical purpose” (i.e., problem identification, function finding, solution generation, and explanation). The results indicated that the presence of either analogizing or mental simulation was related to team cohesion and team collaboration, with mental simulation having an especially marked association with team collaboration. Within-domain analogizing was found to enhance team collaboration, but it did not influence team cohesion. Furthermore, all types of analogical purpose showed a similar association with team cohesion, whereas solution generation and function finding had a stronger association with team collaboration. We propose that analogizing and mental simulations are strategies that serve valuable functions in engendering enhanced cohesion and collaboration, which might be expected to lead to more effective design outcomes, although this remains an empirical question in need of further corroboration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Consumers' psychological perceptions of a product are significantly influenced by its appearance aesthetics, and thus product form plays an essential role in determining the commercial success of a product. The evolution of a product's form during the design process is typically governed by the designer's individual preferences and creative instincts. As a consequence, there is a risk that the product form may fail to satisfy the consumers' expectations or may induce an unanticipated consumer response. This study commences developing an integrated design approach based on the numerical definition of product form. A series of evaluation trials are then performed to establish the correlation between the product form features and the consumers' perceptions of the product image. The results of the evaluation trials are used to construct three different types of mathematical model (a multiple regression analysis model, a backpropagation neural network model, and a multiple regression analysis with a backpropagation neural network model) to predict the likely consumer response to any arbitrary product form. The feasibility of an integrated design approach is demonstrated using a three-dimensional knife form. Although this study takes an example for illustration and verification purposes, the methodology proposed in the present study is equally applicable to any form of consumer product.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Creative conceptual design requires significant previous design knowledge. Case-based reasoning enables learning from previous design experience and has a great potential in supporting creative conceptual design by means of seeking to retrieve, reuse, and revise most appropriate cases to generate inspired solutions. However, traditional case-based reasoning based creative conceptual design models focus on design strategies research, pay little attention to defining a consistent knowledge representation model, and neglect the research to make various types of knowledge retrieval tractable. Faced with such drawbacks, the expected design knowledge cannot be retrieved properly, especially in cases where multidisciplinary knowledge is concerned or exact query terms are absent. In order to solve these issues, this paper presents a combined approach to support creative conceptual design process. First, function–behavior–structure knowledge cell is introduced as a unified consistent design knowledge representation model. Second, a hybrid similarity measure is proposed to increase the overall possibility of obtaining useful design knowledge by considering semantic understanding ability. Third, an intelligent creative conceptual design system has been developed with a case study of a novel insulin pump design to demonstrate its usage, and two experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms other case-based reasoning based creative conceptual design models.",

First is an inference from a desired functional aspect to an idea, concept, or solution principle to satisfy the function. This is followed by a second innovative abduction, from the latest concept to form, structure, or mechanism. The intermediate entity in the logical reasoning, the concept, is thus made explicit, which is significant in following and understanding a specific design process, for educating designers, and to build a logic-based computational model of design. The idea of a two-step abductive reasoning process is developed from the critical examination of several propositions made by others. We use the notion of innovative abduction in design, as opposed to such abduction where the question is about selecting among known alternatives, and we adopt a previously proposed two-step process of abductive reasoning. However, our model is different in that the two abductions used follow the syllogistic pattern of innovative abduction. In addition to using a schematic example from the literature to demonstrate our derivation, we apply the model to an existing, empirically derived method of conceptual design called “parameter analysis” and use two examples of real design processes. The two synthetic steps of the method are shown to follow the proposed double innovative abduction scheme, and the design processes are presented as sequences of double abductions from function to concept and from concept to form, with a subsequent deductive evaluation step.",

The study is conducted by using neural network-based Monte-Carlo analysis on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The computer experiments are designed to obtain the causal relationship between tire design, operational, and aerodynamic performance parameters. The Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations-based Realizable K-ε model has been employed to analyze the variations in flow patterns around an isolated tire. The design parameters are varied over wide range and full factorial design, while considering temperature and velocity is completely explored to draw conclusive results. The multi-layer perceptron type neural network with the back-propagation algorithm is trained to map any non-linearity in causal relationships. The sensitivity analysis is performed to find the relationship between control variables and performance indicators. The importance of control variable is determined by both sensitivity and significance analyses and the paired interaction analysis is performed between selected control variables to find the interactive behavior of corresponding variables. The design parameter of groove width with 6.8% and 41% reduction in drag and lift coefficient, respectively, and conventionally overlooked operational parameter of velocity with 4% and 35% impact on drag and lift coefficient, respectively, are found to be the most significant variables. The air trapped between the longitudinal grooves and the road is found to follow the beam theory. The interaction of the groove depth and width is found to be significant with respect to coefficient of lift based on the air beam concept. The interaction of groove width and velocity is found to be significant with respect to both coefficients of lifts and drag.",

Current validation processes for business models are designed to assess pipeline business models. They cannot grasp the logic of digital platforms, which increasingly integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) to ensure success. This study developed a new validation process for early market validation of digital platform business models by following the Design Science Research methodology. The designed process, the Smart Platform Experiment Cycle (SPEC), is created by combining the Four-Step Iterative Cycle of business experiments, the Customer Development Process, and the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop of the Lean Startup approach and enriching it with the knowledge of digital platforms. It consists of five iterative steps showing the startup how to design their platform business model and corresponding experiments and how to run, measure, analyze, and learn from the outcomes and results. To assess its efficacy, applicability, and validity, SPEC was applied in the German startup GassiAlarm, a service marketplace business model. The application of SPEC revealed shortcomings in the pricing strategy and highlighted to what extent their current business model would be successful. SPEC reduces the risk of building a product or service the market deems redundant and gives insights into its success rate. More applications of the SPEC are needed to validate its robustness further and to extend it to other types of digital platform business models for improved generalization.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Design has always been seen as an inherently human activity and hard to automate. It requires a lot of traits that are seldom attributable to machines or algorithms. Consequently, the act of designing is also hard to assess. In particular in an educational context, the assessment of progress of design tasks performed by individuals or teams is difficult, and often only the outcome of the task is assessed or graded. There is a need to better understand, and potentially quantify, design progress. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is one way of doing so. With the advancement in NLP research, some of its models are adopted into the field of design to quantify a design class performance. To quantify and visualize design progress, the NLP models are often deployed to analyze written documentation collected from the class participants at fixed time intervals through the span of a course. This paper will explore several ways of using NLP in assessing design progress, analyze its advantages and shortcomings, and present a case study to demonstrate its application. The paper concludes with some guidelines and recommendations for future development.",

Is this because engineering design decisions do not need support or is it because techniques have yet to be developed that are usable on a wide basis? In considering this question a wide range of decision problem characteristics need to be addressed. In engineering design some decisions are made by individuals, others by teams – some are about the product and others about the processes that support the product – some are based on complete, consistent, quantitative data and others on sparse, conflicting, qualitative discussions. To address the reasons why so little support is used and the characteristics of potentially useful decision support tools, a taxonomy of decision characteristics is proposed. This taxonomy is used to classify current techniques and to define the requirements for an ideal engineering design decision support system.",

    "abstract": "A grammatical approach to product design is demonstrated. In particular, shape grammars are shown to be especially useful for products that are differentiated primarily on the basis of form yet driven by function; they allow products to be designed as a sequence of well-defined steps. However, it is not always clear how to choose the sequence of rules that should be applied to generate the final shape. In this paper we demonstrate that at each stage during the process, partial designs of the final product can be used to provide feedback to the designer based on specific design objectives and thus suggest possible rule choices. We take advantage of the shape grammar for the generation of coffeemakers introduced by Agarwal and Cagan, and associate with the grammar rules expressions that model manufacturing costs. With each application of a shape grammar rule, an understanding of the overall cost of manufacturing the product is incrementally improved. Thus, at each stage of the design process the designer has an indication of what the overall cost of the product will be and how the selection of one grammar rule over another influences the final cost. Once the complete product is generated, an appraisal of its manufacturing cost is given to the designer. This evaluation methodology helps the designer understand the implications of decisions made early on in the design process. We have also verified the accuracy of this approach through the costs of some commercially available coffeemakers, generated by this method, which are comparable to the costs for those designs listed in the literature.",

In CE, all design concerns (manufacturability, testability, etc.) are applied to an evolving design throughout the design cycle. CE identifies conflicts early on, avoids costly redesign, and leads to better products. Our formulation is based on a distributed dynamic interval constraint-satisfaction problem (DDICSP) model. Persistent catalog agents map onto DDICSP variables and constraint agents map onto DDICSP constraints. These agents use a set of operations and heuristics to navigate the design space to eliminate sets of designs until a solution is found. Experimental results show that an architecture where each catalog agent resides on a separate computer has performance advantages over nondistributed approaches.",

    "abstract": "In their quest to manage the complexity of offering greater product variety, firms in many industries are considering platform-based development of product families. Key in this approach is the sharing of components, modules, and other assets across a family of products. Current research indicates that companies are often choosing physical elements of the product architecture (i.e., components, modules, building blocks) for building platform-based product families. Other sources for platform potential are widely neglected. We argue that for complex products and systems with hierarchic product architectures and considerable freedom in design, a new platform type, the system layout , offers important commonality potential. This layout platform standardizes the arrangement of subsystems within the product family. This paper is based on three industry case studies, where a product family based on a common layout could be defined. In combination with segment-specific variety restrictions, this results in an effective, efficient, and flexible positioning of a company's products. The employment of layout platforms leads to substantial complexity reduction, and is the basis for competitive advantage, as it imposes a dominant design on a product family, improves its configurability, and supports effective market segmentation.",

When creating a new product, designers usually evaluate other existing products to find sources of inspiration or to possibly reuse successful solutions. In the perspective of an optimized styling workflow, great benefit could be derived from the possibility of easily retrieving the related documentation and existing digital models both from internal and external repositories. In fact, the rapid growth of resources on the Web and the widespread adoption of computer-assisted design tools have made available huge amounts of data, the utilization of which could be improved by using more selective retrieval methods. In particular, the retrieval of aesthetic elements may help designers to create digital models conforming to specific styling properties more efficiently. The aim of our research is the definition of a framework that supports (semi)automatic extraction of semantic data from three-dimensional models and other multimedia data to allow car designers to reuse knowledge and design solutions within the styling department. The first objective is then to capture and structure the explicit and implicit elements contributing to the definition of car aesthetics, which can be realistically tackled through computational models and methods.

The source case is represented as a schema that contains its line drawing and its structural model represented at multiple levels of abstraction: the lines and intersections in the drawing, the shapes, the structural components, and connections of the device are depicted in the drawing. Given a target drawing and a relevant source case, our method of compositional analogy first constructs a representation of the lines and the intersections in the target drawing, then uses the mappings at the level of line intersections to transfer the shape representations from the source case to the target; next, it uses the mappings at the level of shapes to transfer the full structural model of the depicted system from the source to the target.",

Constraint satisfaction techniques are useful to solve constraint-based models that are often partial, heterogeneous, and uncertain in ED. This paper proposes new constraint satisfaction techniques to tackle piecewise-defined physics phenomena or skill-based rules and multiple categories of variables arising in design applications. New search heuristics and a global piecewise constraint are introduced in the branch and prune framework. The capabilities of these techniques are illustrated with both academic and real-world problems. Complete models of the latter are presented.",

The Kuaba approach integrates the design rationale representation model with the formal semantics provided by the metamodel of the design method or modeling language used for describing the artifact being designed. This integration makes the design rationale representations more specific according to the design methods and enables a type of software design reuse at the highest abstraction level, where rationales can be integrated and reemployed in designing a new artifact.",

The building systems are intended to be tailored for particular cultures and communities by incorporating vernacular decorative design into the assembly design. Two complementary research areas are brought together in this work: shape grammars and digital fabrication. The visual, aesthetic aspects of the research are explored through shape grammars. The physical design and manufacturing aspects are explored through advanced digital design and fabrication technologies, and in particular, build on recent work on monomaterial assemblies with interlocking components that can be fabricated with computer numerical control machines and assembled easily by hand. The long-term objective of this research is the development of formal, visual–physical grammars with rules that generate complete computer-assisted design/computer-assisted manufacturing data for fabrication of full-scale components for assembly design variations. This paper reports on the first phase of this research: pilot studies for prototype assembly systems that incorporate vernacular languages from different parts of the world. The results of these studies are very promising, and demonstrate a spectrum of strategies for embedding visual properties in structural systems. Important next steps in this research are outlined. If successful, this work will lead to new solutions for low-cost, easily manufactured housing, which is especially critical in developing countries and for postdisaster environments. These new housing solutions will not only provide shelter but also support important cultural values through the integration of familiar visual design features. Beyond the specific context of housing and building assemblies, the research has the potential to impact the design and manufacture of designed artifacts on many scales and in many domains, especially in domains where visual aesthetics need to be considered jointly with physical, structural, or material requirements, and where design customization and variation is important.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Design research informs and supports practice by developing knowledge to improve the chances of producing successful products. Training in design research has been poorly supported. Design research uses human and natural/technical sciences, embracing all facets of design; its methods and tools are adapted from both these traditions. However, design researchers are rarely trained in methods from both the traditions. Research in traditional sciences focuses primarily on understanding phenomena related to human, natural, or technical systems. Design research focuses on supporting improvement of such systems, using understanding as a necessary but not sufficient step, and it must embrace methods for both understanding reality and developing support for its improvement. A one-semester, postgraduate-level, credited course that has been offered since 2002, entitled Methodology for Design Research , is described that teaches a methodology for carrying out research into design. Its steps are to clarify research success; to understand relevant phenomena of design and how these influence success; to use this to envision design improvement and develop proposals for supporting improvement; to evaluate support for its influence on success; and, if unacceptable, to modify, support, or improve the understanding of success and its links to the phenomena of design. This paper highlights some major issues about the status of design research and describes how design research methodology addresses these. The teaching material, model of delivery, and evaluation of the course on methodology for design research are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper presents the use of first-order logic to improve upon currently employed engineering design knowledge management techniques. Specifically, this work uses description logic in unison with Horn logic, to not only guide the knowledge acquisition process but also to offer much needed support in decision making during the engineering design process in a distributed environment. The knowledge management methods introduced are highlighted by the ability to identify modeling knowledge inconsistencies through the recognition of model characteristic limitations, such as those imposed by model idealizations. The adopted implementation languages include the Semantic Web Rule Language, which enables Horn-like rules to be applied to an ontological knowledge base and the Semantic Web's native Web Ontology Language. As part of this work, an ontological tool, OPTEAM, was developed to capture key aspects of the design process through a set of design-related ontologies and to serve as an application platform for facilitating the engineering design process. The design, analysis, and optimization of a classical I-beam problem are presented as a test-bed case study to illustrate the capabilities of these ontologies in OPTEAM. A second, more extensive test-bed example based on an industry-supplied medical device design problem is also introduced. Results indicate that well-defined, networked relationships within an ontological knowledge base can ultimately lead to a refined design process, with guidance provided by the identification of infeasible solutions and the introduction of “best-case” alternatives. These case studies also show how the application of first-order logic to engineering design improves the knowledge acquisition, knowledge management, and knowledge validation processes.",

Given a reconfigurable machine, the ToSP amounts to scheduling a collection of jobs on this machine (each of them requiring a different set of tools to be completed), as well as the tools to be loaded/unloaded at each step to process these jobs, such that the total number of tool switches is minimized. Different exact and heuristic methods have been defined to deal with this problem. In this work, we focus on memetic approaches to this problem. To this end, we have considered a number of variants of three different local search techniques (hill climbing, tabu search, and simulated annealing), and embedded them in a permutational evolutionary algorithm. It is shown that the memetic algorithm endowed with steepest ascent hill climbing search yields the best results, performing synergistically better than its stand-alone constituents, and providing better results than the rest of the algorithms (including those returned by an effective ad hoc beam search heuristic defined in the literature for this problem).",

Research questions examine (a) the type of sketch support and (b) the timing of support. Both concepts try to determine when, what, why and how to augment design processes in a way that is useful to designers. Two experiments (one in architecture and one in product design) based on ergonomics theory are conducted and intend to question some of these assumptions. The Port Zeeland experiment examines how 20 novices perceive and copy a blurred architectural sketch, which provides clues for a sketch interpretation system. The “Tragere” experiment studies how 12 professional product designers, some of whom are “idea generators” and others “idea pursuers,” perceive, recognize, and handle a design sketch. The results take a designer's point of view in assessing the timing and value of sketch assistance in product design. The quantitative data analysis provides rich clues about when, why and how product sketches should be supported. The paper explores the strategies developed by designers to perceive and recognize graphical content and discusses the generation of three-dimensional volumes, the univocity state between sketches and three-dimensional models, and the treatment of features in freehand sketches. The paper concludes with observations on the timing and value of support, as first integrated in NEMo, a tool for early stage architectural design, and then in PEPS 3 , an early stage framework for product design.",

This approach takes advantage of the unique features of unsupervised neural networks combined with spatial statistics to perform analyses into the contributions of the different sensor-based features, carrying large quantities of noise, to achieve a classification of tool wear and a quantitative measure of each feature's suitability. This method does not assume a prior direct correlation between features avoiding misconstructions inherent to common approaches that assume that only obviously correlated features should be considered for condition monitoring. Instead, and taking advantage of neural networks ability to perform non-linear modeling, it has allowed a prior modeling of the process and then analyzed each feature's contribution toward classification. It was found that some of the commonly used features have proven to have a significant contribution to the classification of cutting tool wear, whereas others adversely affect classification performance. Further, it is demonstrated that the proposed combined technique can be used extensively to quantitatively evaluate the contribution of different features toward system monitoring in the presence of noisy data.",

This gives the designer flexibility to choose from a number of high-performing designs based on aesthetic preferences or other priorities. However, there is no single established method for measuring diversity in the context of computational design, especially in the field of architecture. This paper explores different metrics for quantifying diversity in parametric design, which is an increasingly common digital approach to early-stage exploration, and tests how human users perceive these diversity measurements. It first provides a review of existing methodologies for measuring diversity and describes how they can be adapted for parametrically formulated design spaces. This paper then tests how these different metrics align with human perception of design diversity through an online visual survey. Finally, it offers a quantitative comparison between the different methods and a discussion of their attributes and potential applications. In general, the comparison indicates that at the level of diversity difference that becomes visually meaningful to humans, the measurable difference between metrics is small. This paper informs future researchers, developers, and designers about the measurement of diversity in parametric design, and can stimulate further studies into the perception of diversity within sets of design options, as well as new design methodologies that combine architectural novelty and performance.",

Second, a digital library provides on-demand access to the case studies. We describe a web-based library of case studies of biologically inspired design called the Design Study Library (DSL). Third, a compilation of case studies supports analyses of broader patterns and trends. As an example, an analysis of DSL's case studies found that environmental sustainability was a major factor in about a third of the case studies and an explicit design goal in about a fourth. Fourth, a digital library of case studies can support analogical learning. Preliminary results from an exploratory study indicate that DSL may support novice learning about the processes of biologically inspired design.",

To resolve these complications, several solutions were considered in this study. First, fuzzy-valued parameters were defined to determine uncertainty. Subsequently, slack was derived to determine whether to restart an early terminated 3D printing process in the same 3D printing facility. Consequently, two optimization models – a fuzzy mixed-integer linear programming model and a fuzzy mixed-integer quadratic programming model – were developed in this study. Based on the two optimization models, a fuzzy 3D printing-based UM system that considers uncertainty and early termination was developed. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology was tested by conducting a regional experiment. The experimental results revealed that the proposed methodology could shorten the average cycle time by 9% and could enable 3D printing facilities to make real-time, online reprinting decisions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract One mode of creative design is for designers to draw analogies that connect the design domain (e.g., a mechanical device) to some other domain from which inspiration is drawn (e.g., a biological system). The identification and application of analogies can be supported by software tools that store, structure, present, or propose source domain stimuli from which such analogies might be constructed. For these tools to be effective and not impact the design process in negative ways, they must fit well with the information and interaction needs of their users. However, the user requirements for these tools are seldom explicitly discussed. Furthermore, the literature that supports the identification of such requirements is distributed across a number of different domains, including those that address analogical design (especially biomimetics), creativity support tools, and human–computer interaction. The requirements that these literatures propose can be divided into those that relate to the information content that the tools provide (e.g., level of abstraction or mode of representation) and those that relate to the interaction qualities that the tools support (e.g., accessibility or shareability). Examining the relationships between these requirements suggests that tool developers should focus on satisfying the key requirements of open-endedness and accessibility while managing the conflicts between the other requirements. Attention to these requirements and the relationships between them promises to yield analogical design support tools that better permit designers to identify and apply source information in their creative work.",

Less emphasis has been placed on natural processes by which people acquire knowledge about affordances. Consequently, little is known about how design might be optimized to enable users to detect the actions that are available in a given human–machine system. We review scientific research about what people do to obtain information about affordances. We discuss implications of this research for design.",

A cost–tolerance relation has a complex nonlinear correlation among them. The property of a neural network makes it possible to model the complex correlation, and the genetic algorithm (GA) is integrated with the best neural network model to optimize the tolerance values. The proposed method used three types of neural network models (multilayer perceptron, backpropagation network, and radial basis function). These network models were developed separately for prismatic and rotational parts. For the construction of network models, part size and tolerance values were used as input neurons. The reference manufacturing cost was assigned as the output neuron. The qualitative production data set was gathered in a workshop and partitioned into three files for training, testing, and validation, respectively. The architecture of the network model was identified based on the best regression coefficient and the root-mean-square-error value. The best network model was integrated into the GA, and the role of genetic operators was also studied. Finally, two case studies from the literature were demonstrated in order to validate the proposed method. A new methodology based on the neural network model enables the design and process planning engineers to propose an intelligent decision irrespective of their experience.",

This study presents a unique exploration-based approach for the analogical retrieval process using a computational tool called VISION ( V isual I nteraction tool for S eeking I nspiration based O n N onnegative Matrix Factorization). Leveraging the U.S. patent database as a source of inspiration, VISION enables designers to visualize a patent repository and explore for analogical inspiration in a user-driven manner. To achieve this, we perform hierarchical Nonnegative Matrix Factorization to generate a clustered structure of patent data and employ D3.js to visualize the patent structure in a node-link network, in which user interaction capabilities are enabled for data exploration. In this study, we also analyze the effect of data size (ranging from 100 to 3000 patents) on two performance aspects of VISION – the clustering quality of topic modeling results and the frame rate of interactive data visualization. The findings show that the tool exhibits more randomized and inconsistent topic modeling results when the database size is too small. But, increasing the database size lowers the frame rate to the point that it could diminish designers’ ability to retrieve and recall information. The scope of the work here is to present the creation of the DbA visualization tool called VISION and to evaluate its data scale limitations in order to provide a basis for developing a visual interaction tool for the analogical retrieval process during DbA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Automatic generation of high-quality meshes is a base of CAD/CAE systems. The element extraction is a major mesh generation method for its capabilities to generate high-quality meshes around the domain boundary and to control local mesh densities. However, its widespread applications have been inhibited by the difficulties in generating satisfactory meshes in the interior of a domain or even in generating a complete mesh. The element extraction method's primary challenge is to define element extraction rules for achieving high-quality meshes in both the boundary and the interior of a geometric domain with complex shapes. This paper presents a self-learning element extraction system, FreeMesh-S, that can automatically acquire robust and high-quality element extraction rules. Two central components enable the FreeMesh-S: (1) three primitive structures of element extraction rules, which are constructed according to boundary patterns of any geometric boundary shapes; (2) a novel self-learning schema, which is used to automatically define and refine the relationships between the parameters included in the element extraction rules, by combining an Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) reinforcement learning network and a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN). The A2C network learns the mesh generation process through random mesh element extraction actions using element quality as a reward signal and produces high-quality elements over time. The FNN takes the mesh generated from the A2C as samples to train itself for the fast generation of high-quality elements. FreeMesh-S is demonstrated by its application to two-dimensional quad mesh generation. The meshing performance of FreeMesh-S is compared with three existing popular approaches on ten pre-defined domain boundaries. The experimental results show that even with much less domain knowledge required to develop the algorithm, FreeMesh-S outperforms those three approaches in essential indices. FreeMesh-S significantly reduces the time and expertise needed to create high-quality mesh generation algorithms.",

A valuable source for these insights is the product use phase. In practice, product planners are often forced to work with assumptions and speculations as insights from the use phase are insufficiently identified and documented. A new opportunity to address this problem arises from the ongoing digitalization that enables products to generate and collect data during their utilization. Analyzing these data could enable their manufacturers to generate and exploit insights concerning product performance and user behavior, revealing problems and potentials for improvement. However, research on analyzing use phase data in product planning of manufacturing companies is scarce. Therefore, we conducted an exploratory interview study with decision-makers of eight manufacturing companies. The result of this paper is a detailed description of the potentials and challenges that the interviewees associated with analyzing use phase data in product planning. The potentials explain the intended purpose and generic application examples. The challenges concern the products, the data, the customers, the implementation, and the employees. By gathering the potentials and challenges through expert interviews, our study structures the topic from the perspective of the potential users and shows the needs for future research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Modern day building design projects require multidisciplinary expertise from architects and engineers across various phases of the design (conceptual, preliminary, and detailed) and construction processes. The Architecture Engineering and Construction (AEC) community has recently shifted gears toward leveraging design optimization techniques to make well-informed decisions in the design of buildings. However, most of the building design optimization efforts are either multidisciplinary optimization confined to just a specific design phase (conceptual/preliminary/detailed) or single disciplinary optimization (structural/thermal/daylighting/energy) spanning across multiple phases. Complexity in changing the optimization setup as the design progresses through subsequent phases, interoperability issues between modeling and physics-based analysis tools used at later stages, and the lack of an appropriate level of design detail to get meaningful results from these sophisticated analysis tools are few challenges that limit multi-phase multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) in the AEC field. This paper proposes a computational building design platform leveraging concurrent engineering techniques such as interactive problem structuring, simulation-based optimization using meta models for energy and daylighting (machine learning based) and tradespace visualization. The proposed multi-phase concurrent MDO framework is demonstrated by using it to design and optimize a sample office building for energy and daylighting objectives across multiple phases. Furthermore, limitations of the proposed framework and future avenues of research are listed.",

HMM uses a probabilistic approach that describes data (here, fMRI neuroimaging data) as a dynamic sequence of discrete states. Without prior assumptions on the fMRI data's temporal and spatial properties, HMM enables an automatic inference on states in neurocognitive activation data that are highly likely to occur in concept generation. The states with a higher likelihood of occupancy show more activation in the brain regions from the executive control network, the default mode network, and the middle temporal cortex. Different activation patterns and transfers are associated with these states, linking to varying cognitive functions, for example, semantic processing, memory retrieval, executive control, and visual processing, that characterize possible transitions in cognition related to concept generation. HMM offers new insights into cognitive dynamics in design by uncovering the temporal and spatial patterns in neurocognition related to concept generation. Future research can explore new avenues of data analysis methods to investigate design neurocognition and provide a more detailed description of cognitive dynamics in design.",

SEED-Config, a design environment for conceptual building design, was developed to incorporate a case-based reasoning functionality to provide designers with initial potential solutions. The case representation in SEED-Config is the BENT information model, which records design knowledge, supports the hierarchical decomposition of design cases, offers multiple views, and encapsulates the outcome of the design in addition to the problem specification and the design solution. The case library was implemented in an object-oriented database management system to accumulate cases automatically and to provide efficient query facilities. The case retrieval aspect of SEED-Config offers three different methods to find the most useful cases stored in the case library: task-based, lineage-based, and customized. Case retrieval responds to the exploratory nature of the design process and supports versatile case retrieval by providing multiple paths to each case. The case adaptation aspect, which adjusts the selected case to the new problem to provide a complete solution, uses an adaptation method called derivational replay. The case-based design capabilities are completely integrated within the design environment from which the cases originate.",

    "abstract": "Product design and diagnosis are, today, worlds apart. Despite strong areas of overlap at the ontological level, traditional design process theory and practice does not recognize diagnosis as a part of the modeling process chain; neither do diagnosis knowledge engineering processes reference design modeling tasks as a source of knowledge acquisition. This paper presents the DAEDALUS knowledge engineering framework as a methodology for integrating design and diagnosis tasks, models, and modeling environments around a common Domain Ontology and Product Models Library. The approach organizes domain knowledge around the execution of a set of tasks in an enterprise product engineering task workflow. Each task employs a Task Application which uses a customized subset of the Domain Ontology—the Task Ontology—to construct a graphical Product Model. The Ontology is used to populate the models with relevant concepts (variables) and relations (relationships), thus serving as a concept dictionary-style mechanism for knowledge sharing and reuse across the different Task Applications. For inferencing, each task employs a local Problem-solving Method (PSM), and a Model-PSM Mapping, which operate on the local Product Model to produce reasoning outcomes. The use of a common Domain Ontology across tasks and models facilitates semantic consistency of variables and relations in constructing Bayesian networks for design and diagnosis. The approach is motivated by inefficiencies encountered in cleanly exchanging and integrating design FMEA and diagnosis models. Demonstration software under development is intended to illustrate how the DAEDALUS framework can be applied to knowledge sharing and exchange between Bayesian network-based design FMEA and diagnosis modeling tasks. Anticipated limitations of the DAEDALUS methodology are discussed, as is its relationship to Tomiyama's Knowledge Intensive Engineering Framework (KIEF). DAEDALUS is grounded in formal knowledge engineering principles and methodologies established during the past decade. Finally, the framework is presented as one possible approach for improved integration of generalized design and diagnostic modeling and knowledge exchange.",

Iterative techniques can be applied to most problems, but sacrifice optimality. In this paper, we introduce a new technique that extends the set of design problems that can be solved optimally. By first constructing an imprecise value function, the number of nondominated alternatives that must be generated is reduced. We describe an implementation based on combinatorial optimization and constraint satisfaction which achieves additional performance gains by decomposing the value function to identify dominated design-variable assignments. Test results indicate that our approach extends the set of problems that can be solved optimally.",

It represents the structural and behavioral aspects of product families as family graphs and related graph operations, respectively. The derivation of product variants becomes a graph rewriting process, in which family graphs are transformed to variant graphs by applying appropriate graph rewriting rules. The system is developed in the language of programmed graph rewriting systems or PROGRES, which supports the specification of hierarchical graph schema and parametric rewriting rules. A meta model is defined for family graphs to factor out those entities common to all product families. A generic model is defined to describe all specific entities relevant to particular families. An instance model describes all product variants for individual customer orders. A prototype of a graph-based PFD system for office chairs is also developed. The system can provide an interactive environment for customers to make choices among product offerings. It also facilitates design automation of product families and enhances interactions and negotiations among sales, design, and manufacturing.",

The paper describes under which conditions a given configuration problem can be decomposed into a set of noninteracting subproblems and how to exploit such a decomposition, both for improving the performance of the configurator and for supporting interactive configuration. Different kinds of decomposition are considered, but all of them exploit, as much as possible, the explicit representation of the partonomic relations in the language, a KL-One like representation formalism augmented with constraints for expressing complex interrole relations. The paper introduces a notion of boundness among constraints, which is used for formally specifying different types of decomposition. One decomposition strategy aims at singling out the components and subcomponents that are directly related to the constraints put by the user's requirements; the configurator exploits such decomposition by first configuring that portion of the product and then configuring the parts that are not related to the user's requirements. Another decomposition strategy verifies whether the set of constraints for the product to be configured can be split into a set of noninteracting problems. In such a case the configurator solves the configuration problem by splitting the whole search space into a set of smaller search spaces. Different combinations of these two decomposition techniques are considered, and the impact of the decomposition strategies on the performance of the configurator is evaluated via a set of experiments using the configuration of computer systems as a test bed. The results of the experiments show a significant reduction of the computational effort (both in terms of number of backtrackings and in CPU time) when decomposition strategies are used.",

If there are several appropriate physical laws (i.e., operators), we evaluate them using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. The most suitable is then selected with regard to the chosen criteria based on design requirements. When one physical law is not sufficient for the design of a technical system, several laws are linked together using binding variables to form a conceptual chain (i.e., macro-operator). Such a chain does not only contain supporting physical laws; physical laws indirectly introduce basic models of shape, their basic topology, geometry, and basic material properties into the chain. A prototype computer-aided design system is based on the prescriptive conceptual design model presented below.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes our preliminary results in applying constraint satisfaction techniques in a system we call TRANS-FORM for designing automatic automobile power transmissions. The work is being conducted in collaboration with the Ford Motor Company Advanced Transmission Design Department in Livonia, Michigan. Our current focus is on the design of the mechanical subsystem, but we anticipate extending this later to the electrical and hydraulic subsystems also. For simplicity, in the initial work reported here we restrict ourselves to the relatively well-explored class of transmissions having four forward speeds and one reverse speed, built from two planetary gearsets, cross-connected by two permanent links. Moreover, we pursue design of such transmissions only at the ‘kinematic level’. These two restrictions correspond to limiting respectively the breadth (generality) and the depth (detail or granularity) of the search space employed. We find that, at least for the restricted version of the problem pursued here, transmission design is an application very naturally formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem. Our present problem requires only 10 variables, with an average of about seven values each, and 43 constraints—making it similar in difficulty to about the 10-queens problem. So far, two of the classic transmissions, known as Axod and HydraMatic, have been rediscovered (at the kinematic level) by our program. Preliminary results also indicate that the constraint satisfaction framework will continue to remain adequate and natural even when the search space is allowed to be much broader and deeper. We expect that searches of such expanded spaces will soon lead to the discovery of totally new transmissions.",

However, in geometric-based domains such as mechanical engineering, their popularity has been limited. This work proposes the use of shape grammars as the framework for engineering expert systems. Shape grammars are shown to have all the generation and analysis capabilities of traditional production systems, while being able to represent knowledge about both the functionality and the form of a product. Additionally, the parametric nature of shape grammars, their ability to deal with physical form rather than abstract elements, and their ability to recognize emergent shapes give them significant advantages over traditional production systems for geometry-based engineering design.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) applications to design have tended to focus on modeling and automating aspects of single discipline design tasks. Relatively little attention has thus far been devoted to representing the kinds of design ‘metaknowledge’ needed to manage the important interface issues that arise in concurrent design, that is, multidisciplinary design decision-making. This paper provides a view of the process and management of concurrent design and evaluates the potential of two AI approaches—blackboard architectures and co-operative distributed problem-solving (CDPS)—to model and support the concurrent design of complex artifacts. A discussion of the process of multidisciplinary design highlights elements of both sequential and concurrent design decision-making. We identify several kinds of design metaknowledge used by expert managers to: partition the design task for efficient execution by specialists; set appropriate levels of design conservatism for key subsystem specifications; evaluate, limit and selectively communicate design changes across discipline boundaries; and control the sequence and timing of the key (highly constrained and constraining) design decisions for a given type of artifact. We explore the extent to which blackboard and CDPS architectures can provide valid models of and potential decision support for concurrent design by (1) representing design management metaknowledge, and (2) using it to enhance both horizontal (interdisciplinary) and vertical (project life cycle) integration among product design, manufacturing and operations specialists.",

    "abstract": "Product families help companies reach customers in several different markets, lessen the time needed to develop new products, and reduce costs by sharing common components among many products. The product platform can be considered as a set of technologies, components, or functions, and their arrangements, that are utilized for more than one product. Configuration design focuses on the components in a product and their connections and relationships. Discrete, combinatorial design spaces are used to model design requirements regarding physical connections, module partitions, and assembly sequences for the product family. To ensure that products satisfy all design requirements, it is necessary to combine these design spaces into a common configuration space into which all requirements can be mapped. This paper presents computational methods for modeling and combining design spaces so those configurations can be identified that satisfy all constraints. A new representation of assembly sequences facilitates the development of an assembly design space, elements of which can be enumerated readily. Because the size of the combinatorial design spaces can become quite large, computational efficiency is an important consideration. A new designer guided method, called the partitioning method, is presented for decomposing configuration design problems in a hierarchical manner that enables significant reductions in design space sizes. An example of a family of automotive underbodies illustrates the application of the discrete design space approach to develop a common platform.",

    "abstract": "High speed machinery has played and continues to play a vital role in the manufacture and production of consumer goods. In the design of high speed systems there are two key considerations: power transmission and motion control. Although there is considerable computer-based support for the design of systems to achieve requirements of power transmission, there is only limited support for the design of systems to deliver complex motion control. This is particularly the case where mechanism and linkage systems are considered in order to achieve large displacements and intricate paths involving reentrant and reciprocating components. One explanation for this relative lack of supportive tools is the underlying reasoning and analysis techniques implemented within many commercial and research software environments. To overcome these limitations a constraint-based approach has been employed to provide the fundamental elements of a design environment for mechanisms and machine systems. The design environment provides support for the transition from concept to embodiment stages of the design process and the subsequent stages of detailed design and optimization. In contrast to many research approaches the design environment presented in this paper has been created and developed through close collaboration with industry and through extensive application to real design scenarios. First, the underlying representations and methods are presented. The fundamental elements of the design environment are then described and its capabilities discussed with particular reference to the use of constraints in design.",

    "abstract": "Affective engineering is being increasingly used to describe a systematic approach to the analysis of consumer reactions to candidate designs. It has evolved from Kansei engineering, which has reported improvements in products such as cars, electronics, and food. The method includes a semantic differential experiment rating candidate designs against bipolar adjectives (e.g., attractive–not attractive, traditional–not traditional). The results are statistically analyzed to identify correlations between design features and consumer reactions to inform future product developments. A number of key challenges emerge from this process. Clearly, suitable designs must be available to cover all design possibilities. However, it is also paramount that the best adjectives are used to reflect the judgments that participants might want to make. The current adjective selection process is unsystematic, and could potentially miss key concepts. Poor adjective choices can result in problems such as misinterpretation of an experimental question, clustering of results around a particular response, and participants' confusion from unfamiliar adjectives that can be difficult to consider in the required context (e.g., is this wristwatch “oppressive”?). This paper describes an artificial intelligence supported process that ensures adjectives with appropriate levels of precision and recall are developed and presented to participants (and thus addressing problems above) in an affective engineering study in the context of branded consumer goods. We illustrate our description of the entire concept expansion and reduction process by means of an industrial case study in which participants were asked to evaluate different designs of packaging for a laundry product. The paper concludes by describing the important advantages that can be gained by the new approach in comparison with previous approaches to the selection of consumer focused adjectives.",

However, during their formal education, most students attending architecture schools, and engineering schools for that matter, get very little (if any) exposure to decision making in conditions that involve expertise and/or worldviews beyond those reflected and valued by their own discipline. In the past 10 years, a project-based learning initiative was developed between the University of California, Berkeley, and Stanford University in an international context involving several other universities around the world. Throughout this experience, we have identified several issues that have shown to be crucial to these interactions. This paper elaborates on three key issues: improvement of communication skills, empowerment through developing strategies of leadership, and recognition of own and others' worldviews. We also make the case to include experiential educational situations that can introduce these aspects into the academic curricula of architecture and engineering schools.",

We were fortunate to develop our antennas in parallel with another group using traditional design methodologies. This allowed us to demonstrate that our techniques were human-competitive because our automatically designed antenna could be directly compared to a human-designed antenna. The antennas described below were evolved to meet a challenging set of mission requirements, most notably the combination of wide beamwidth for a circularly polarized wave and wide bandwidth. Two evolutionary algorithms were used in the development process: one used a genetic algorithm style representation that did not allow branching in the antenna arms; the second used a genetic programming style tree-structured representation that allowed branching in the antenna arms. The highest performance antennas from both algorithms were fabricated and tested, and both yielded very similar performance. Both antennas were comparable in performance to a hand-designed antenna produced by the antenna contractor for the mission, and so we consider them examples of human-competitive performance by evolutionary algorithms. Our design was approved for flight, and three copies of it were successfully flown on NASA's Space Technology 5 mission between March 22 and June 30, 2006. These evolved antennas represent the first evolved hardware in space and the first evolved antennas to be deployed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Industrial designers make sketches and physical models to start and develop ideas and concept designs. Such representations have advantages that they support fast, intuitive, rich, sensory exploration of solutions. Although existing tools and techniques provide adequate support where the shape of the product is concerned, the exploration of surface qualities such as material and printed graphics is supported to a much lesser extent. Moreover, there are no tools that have the fluency of sketching that allow combined exploration of shape, material, and their interactions. This paper evaluates Skin, an augmented reality tool designed to solve these two shortcomings. By projecting computer-generated images onto the shape model Skin allows for a “sketchy” tangible interaction where designers can explore surface qualities on a three-dimensional physical shape model. The tool was evaluated in three design situations in the domain of ceramics design. In each case, we found that the joint exploration of shape and surface provided creative benefits in the form of new solutions; in addition, a gain in efficiency was found in at least one case. The results show that joint exploration of shape and surface can be effectively supported with tangible augmented reality techniques and suggest that this can be put to practical use in industry today.",

An explicit representation of DR is helpful to designers, allowing them to understand, improve, and reuse previous designs. The argumentation-based representation is the mainstream approach to DR representation. It has a semiformal graphical format to depict the structure of arguments for solving a design problem. This paper argues that because the design is not just a problem-solving process but also a cognitive activity that is continuously iterative and evolving, the conventional argumentation-based representation of DR has some inherent limitations. An improved, intent-driven representation model is proposed to capture and formalize the DR and its evolving history to support DR reuse. The model's knowledge structure, consisting of DR elements and their relationships, is detailed. A preliminary knowledge representation of the model based on Web Ontology Language is introduced. Furthermore, the context of DR is defined to document the complete DR and support effective traceability of design thinking. A graphical DR modeling system is developed, and an example is demonstrated to verify the system's application and the effectiveness of the proposed representation model. The paper provides an effective method to retain and manage a designer's implicit design knowledge, which has the potential to significantly improve the integrated management of product development knowledge.",

This paper identifies three layers of structure in design communication, each of which can be more or less formal: the design process, the interaction between participants, and the representations of design information that are constructed and used. These layers can be formal across a spectrum from explicit rules to habitual conventions. The paper draws on a range of contrasting case studies in mechanical engineering and knitwear design, as well as a larger corpus of cases comparing design domains more generally, to analyze how formality affects design interaction in different situations and process contexts. Mismatches in the understanding of formality can lead to misunderstandings, in particular across expertise boundaries and between designers and their clients or customers. Formality can be modulated in the mannerism of communication, the rhetoric employed, and how representations are constructed, to make communication more effective. The effort and skill put into modulating formality is greater in domains where designers work with end users, like architecture, than it is in companies where designers interact mainly with other professionals.",

Though many studies have been aimed at validating either the technical feasibility or the usefulness of generative design systems, there is, however, a lack of research on the practical implementation and adaptation in industry. To that end, this paper presents two case studies conducted while developing design systems for industrial uses. The first case study focuses on an engineering design application and the other on an industrial design application. In both cases, the focus is on detail-oriented performance-driven generative design systems based on currently available computer-assisted design tools. The development time and communications with the companies were analyzed to identify challenges in the two projects. Overall, the results show that the challenges are not related to whether the design tools are intended for artistic or technical problems, but rather in how to make the design process systematic. The challenges include aspects such as how to fully utilize the potential of generative design tools in a traditional product development process, how to enable designers not familiar with programming to provide design generation logic, and what should be automated and what is better left as a manual task. The paper suggests several strategies for dealing with the identified challenges.",

In particular, the proposed decision model employs a set of possibilistic objective functions defined by fuzzy numbers to handle a set of conflicting criteria. In addition, the model can calculate the compliance of a piece of decision-relevant (imprecise) information with a given objective function. Moreover, the model is capable to aggregate the calculated compliances for the sake of ranking a given set of alternatives against the set of conflicting criteria. The problem of selecting materials for making the body of a vehicle is considered as an example. In this problem, the indices for selecting the materials are unknown because the specifications regarding the vehicle body are not given. In addition, the data relevant to material properties entails a great deal of imprecision. The presented decision model can quantify the above-mentioned epistemic uncertainty in a lucid manner and generate a list of optimal materials.",

We take a demand-based approach for conceptualizing meaning, and propose that it emerges from user needs instead of emerging from already existing creative solutions. Meaning is proposed as a third component of creativity, alongside novelty and usefulness. We test this proposition in a pre-study, and two empirical studies. In the pre-study, designers define creativity and provide examples of solutions that they deem creative. The results of the pre-study yield a 24-item scale for assessing creativity. Then, we conduct two empirical studies, in which we utilize the created scale for measuring creativity, and for examining the components arising thereof. In the first study, we ask creators (design engineering students) to generate ideas for one of two design briefs. Afterwards, creators were asked to rate their own creations, on the 24-item creativity scale. Here, we find a four-factor solution for creative outcomes, consisting of the dimensions novelty, usefulness, cleverness, and meaning. In the second study, we ask independent evaluators (individuals with related and relevant degrees) to assess the creators’ work on the creativity scale. Here, we find a three-factor solution for creative outcomes, consisting of the dimensions novelty, usefulness, and meaning. In both studies, meaning emerged as a separate component of creativity. Additionally, in both studies, it accounted for variance that was unaccounted for by novelty and usefulness, thereby increasing the overall explanatory power of creative solutions.

    "abstract": "Abstract The proposed methodology is based on a (global and multi-criteria) simplified environmental but thorough assessment. In this stage we do not directly give the solution to designers. It will therefore translate the results of evaluation design axes, but in general, the lines proposed are inconsistent or contradictory. Therefore, what we find is a compromise given to the solution. The challenge we are facing in an industrial reality is that one should not go for a compromise solution. TRIZ (Teorija Reshenija Izobretateliskih Zadatch) or the theory of solving inventive problems, in the field, will be reformulated and go through the contradiction matrix and then intervene with the principles of interpretation resolutions to give possible solutions. To assist small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in their product development, the objective of this paper is to propose a methodological approach named Ecatriz , that will allow us to achieve our eco-innovative goal. The applicability of this method is justified by the many contradictions in the choices in a study of the life cycle. As a starting point, a qualitative multi-criteria matrix will allow the prioritization of all impacts on the environment. A customized implementation of the inventive TRIZ ( Teorija Reshenija Izobretateliskih Zadatch , Russian acronym for theory of solving inventive problems) principles will help us choose eco-innovative solutions. To that end, we have created a new approach named Ecatriz (ecological approach TRIZ), based on a new contradiction matrix. It was tested in various contexts, such as the “24 h of Innovation” competition and eco-innovative patents.",

In the sensory experience model, 60 participants were recruited to experience using 27 vehicle samples and to assign scores to eight Kansei keywords. Hayashi's quantification theory type 1 was used to calculate the weight of 12 interior space items and 40 interior design categories. In the perceived value evaluation model, 60 participants completed a questionnaire on the influence levels of the Kansei keywords on their Kansei values from the perspectives of four consumer perceived value dimensions. The questionnaire scores were then evaluated using factor analysis to extract nine primary factors affecting participants’ perceptions. This study determined that the interesting and dynamic perceptions corresponded to five design items under the Excitement Quality factors, vigorous and recreational perceptions corresponded to four items under the Relaxation and Comfort factor, and technological and luxurious perceptions corresponded to six items under the Luxury and Splendor factor and the Esteemed Image factor. These findings can help designers and researchers in the relevant sectors create automotive interior designs that fulfill the expectations of users.",

To avoid wasting time, design efforts generally address the configuration of existing solutions, without producing substantial design modifications. Configuration tools are used to achieve customized products starting from a common platform. Many approaches have been successfully proposed in literature to configure products. However, in the mechanical field they need further investigation in order to be efficiently linked to computer-aided design technologies. Research is focused on tools and methods to automatically produce geometrical models and improve the flexibility of the continuous product updating process. In this context, this paper aims to combine product configuration approaches with design automation techniques in order to support design activities of products to fulfill specific requirements. The approach is based on entities called configurable virtual prototypes. Three different domains are managed and connected via configurable virtual prototypes: product specifications, geometrical data, and product knowledge. In particular, geometry recognition rules are used to identify the parameterization of parts and the assembly mating constraints. The approach is exemplified through an industrial case study where a tool has been developed on the basis of the described method. Advantages of the system are shown in terms of achieved product configuration efficiency.",

However, when designers are asked to perform biomimetic design, they often have difficulty recognizing analogies between design problems and biological phenomena. Therefore, this research aims to investigate designer behaviors that either hinder or promote the use of analogies in biomimetic design. A verbal protocol study was conducted on 30 engineering students working in small teams while participating in biomimetic design sessions. A coding scheme was developed to analyze cognitive processes involved in biomimetic design. We observed that teams were less likely to apply overall biological analogies if they tended to recall existing solutions that could be easily associated with specific superficial or functional characteristics of biological phenomena. We also found that the tendency to evaluate ideas, which reflects critical thinking, correlates with the likelihood of identifying overall biological analogies. Insights from this paper may contribute toward developing generalized methods to facilitate biomimetic design.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Since the introduction of spatial grammars 45 years ago, numerous grammars have been developed in a variety of fields from architecture to engineering design. Their benefits for solution space exploration when computationally implemented and combined with optimization have been demonstrated. However, there has been limited adoption of spatial grammars in engineering applications for various reasons. One main reason is the missing, automated, generalized link between the designs generated by the spatial grammar and their evaluation through finite-element analysis (FEA). However, the combination of spatial grammars with optimization and simulation has the advantage over continuous structural topology optimization in that explicit constraints, for example, modeling style and fabrication processes, can be included in the spatial grammar. This paper discusses the challenges in providing a generalized approach by demonstrating the implementation of a framework that combines a three-dimensional spatial grammar interpreter with automated FEA and stochastic optimization using simulated annealing (SA). Guidelines are provided for users to design spatial grammars in conjunction with FEA and integrate automatic application of boundary conditions. A simulated annealing method for use with spatial grammars is also presented including a new method to select rules through a neighborhood definition. To demonstrate the benefits of the framework, it is applied to the automated design and optimization of spokes for inline skate wheels. This example highlights the advantage of spatial grammars for modeling style and additive manufacturing (AM) constraints within the generative system combined with FEA and optimization to carry out topology and shape optimization. The results verify that the framework can generate structurally optimized designs within the style and AM constraints defined in the spatial grammar, and produce a set of topologically diverse, yet valid design solutions.",

In many engineering applications, only one class of data is available, and then one-class SVM methods are employed. In reliability applications, the one-class data may be failure data since the data are recorded during reliability experiments when only failures occur. Different from the problems handled by existing one-class SVM methods, there is a bias constraint in the SVM model in this work and the constraint comes from the probability of failure estimated from the failure data. In this study, a new one-class SVM regression method is proposed to accommodate the bias constraint. The one class of failure data is maximally separated from a hypersphere whose radius is determined by the known probability of failure. The proposed SVM method generates regression models that directly link the states of failure modes with design variables, and this makes it possible to obtain the joint probability density of all the component states of an engineering system, resulting in a more accurate prediction of system reliability during the design stage. Three examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new one-class SVM method.",

A multi-case study approach is taken to analyze three makerspaces that support migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers in Greece. A maturity grid tool is used to show that humanitarian makerspaces are driving impact in six key areas.

    "abstract": "Abstract A platform for experimenting with population-based design exploration algorithms is presented, called Dexen . The platform has been developed in order to address the needs of two distinct groups of users loosely labeled as researchers and designers . Whereas the researchers group focuses on creating and testing customized toolkits, the designers group focuses on applying these toolkits in the design process. A platform is required that is scalable and extensible: scalable to allow computationally demanding population-based exploration algorithms to be executed on distributed hardware within reasonable time frames, and extensible to allow researchers to easily implement their own customized toolkits consisting of specialized algorithms and user interfaces. In order to address these requirements, a three-tier client–server system architecture has been used that separates data storage, domain logic, and presentation. This separation allows customized toolkits to be created for Dexen without requiring any changes to the data or logic tiers. In the logic tier, Dexen uses a programming model in which tasks only communicate through data objects stored in a key-value database. The paper ends with a case study experiment that uses a multicriteria evolutionary algorithm toolkit to explore alternative configurations for the massing and façade design of a large residential development. The parametric models for developing and evaluating design variants are described in detail. A population of design variants are evolved, a number of which are selected for further analysis. The case study demonstrates how evolutionary exploration methods can be applied to a complex design scenario without requiring any scripting.",

As such, design researchers have been devoted in devising and assessing empathic design activities. While prior research has examined the utility of empathic design experiences on driving creative concept generation, little is known about the role of a designer's empathic tendencies in driving creative concept generation and selection in an engineering design project. Without this knowledge, we cannot be sure if, when, or how empathy influences the design process. Thus, the main goal of this paper was to identify the role of trait empathy in creative concept generation and selection in an engineering design student project. In order to achieve this objective, a study was conducted with 103 first-year engineering students during two design stages of an 8-week design project (concept generation and concept selection). The main findings from this paper highlighted that empathic concern tendencies positively impacted the generation of more ideas while personal distress tendencies negatively impacted the generation of more ideas. During concept selection, perspective-taking tendencies positively impacted participants’ propensity for selecting elegant ideas. This research took the first step in encouraging empirical investigations aimed at understanding the role of trait empathy across different stages of the design process.",

Analyzing user experience (UX) to find the deficiencies of existing products and establishing improved schemes is the key to UX-driven product improvement, especially at the conceptual design stage. Although some tools used in conceptual design, such as requirements analysis and knowledge reasoning, have advanced recently, they lack targeted goals and sufficient efficiency in identifying insufficient product attributes and improving existing functions and structures. The challenge lies in considering the influence imposed on design activities by the original product features (including attributes, functions, and structure). In this study, a knowledge-enabled approach and framework that integrates the conceptual design process, online reviews for UX, and knowledge is proposed to support product improvement. Specifically, a decision-making algorithm based on UX analysis is proposed to identify to-be-improved product attributes. Then, through optimizing the previous knowledge application model from knowledge requirement transformation, knowledge modeling, and knowledge reasoning, a smart knowledge reasoning model is established to push knowledge for functional solving of the to-be-improved attributes. A knowledge configuration method is used to modify product features to generate an improved scheme. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, a case study of improving an agricultural sprayer is conducted. Through discussion, this study can help to regulate design activities for product improvement, enhance data and knowledge application, and promote divergent thinking during scheme modification.",

Including user errors can be helpful because users will always make mistakes and generate errors. We compare three user models: an existing validated model that simulates users’ behavior in the Dismal spreadsheet in Emacs, a newly developed model that interacts with an Excel spreadsheet, and a new model that generates and fixes user errors. These models are implemented using a set of simulated eyes and hands extensions. All the models completed a 14-step task without modifying the system that participants used. These models predict that the task in Excel is approximately 20% faster than in Dismal, including suggesting why, where, and how much Excel is a better design. The Excel model predictions were compared to newly collected human data (N = 23). The model’s predictions of subtask times correlate well with the human data (r2 = .71). We also present a preliminary model of human error and correction based on user keypress errors, including 25 slips. The predictions to data comparison suggest that this interactive model that includes errors moves us closer to having a complete user model that can directly test interface design by predicting human behavior and performing the task on the same interface as users. The errors from the model’s hands also allow further exploration of error detection, error correction, and different knowledge types in user models.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Due to their significant role in creative design ideation, databases of causal ontology-based models for biological and technical systems have been developed. However, creating structured database entries through system models using a causal ontology requires the time and effort of experts. Researchers have worked toward developing methods that can automatically generate representations of systems from documents using causal ontologies by leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques. However, these methods use limited, hand-annotated data for building the ML models and have manual touchpoints that are not documented. While opportunities exist to improve the accuracy of these ML models, more importantly, it is required to understand the complete process of generating structured representations using causal ontology. This research proposes a new method and a set of rules to extract information relevant to the constructs of the SAPPhIRE model of causality from descriptions of technical systems in natural language and report the performance of this process. This process aims to understand the information in the context of the entire description. The method starts by identifying the system interactions involving material, energy and information and then builds the causal description of each system interaction using the SAPPhIRE ontology. This method was developed iteratively, verifying the improvements through user trials in every cycle. The user trials of this new method and rules with specialists and novice users of the SAPPhIRE modeling showed that the method helps in accurately and consistently extracting the information relevant to the constructs of the SAPPhIRE model from a given natural language description.",

The paper focuses on presenting and exploring the possibility of realizing “ learning ” assistance in Int.CAD by introducing a new concept called Shared Learning. Shared Learning is proposed to empower CAD tools with more useful learning capabilities than that currently available and thereby provide a stronger interaction of learning between a designer and a computer. “Controlled” computational learning is proposed as a means whereby the Shared Learning concept can be realized. The viability of this new concept is explored by using a system called PERSPECT. PERSPECT is a preliminary numerical design tool aimed at supporting the effective utilization of numerical experiential knowledge in design. After a detailed discussion of PERSPECT's numerical design support, the paper presents the results of an evaluation that focuses on PERSPECT's implementation of “controlled” computational learning and ability to support a designer's need to learn. The paper then discusses PERSPECT's potential as a tool for supporting the Shared Learning concept by explaining how a designer and PERSPECT can jointly learn. There is still much work to be done before the full potential of Shared Learning can be realized. However, the authors do believe that the concept of Shared Learning may hold the key to truly empowering learning in Int.CAD.",

During the design of precision machines, like any design, it is critical that the best concept is chosen in the early stages of the design process because 80% of the final cost and quality of a product are designed in at this phase. In addition, changes and optimization late in the design process have limited impact on cost and quality. Typically, during the design of precision machines, engineers and skilled machinists develop several machine concepts and down select based on heuristics and past design experience rather than quantitative measures. This paper describes a computation tool, Precision Machine Design Assistant (PMDA), which automates basic machine error simulation and concept evaluation. The tool uses a combination of machine error motion modelling and constraint-based design methods. By combining these methods in a computational environment, multiple machine concepts may be rapidly modeled, analyzed, and compared. The goal of the program is to assist the designer in the selection of a superior concept for detail design. The PMDA methods and implementation are demonstrated in an example.",

Machine learning can improve gradient-based methods by making these choices based on the results of previous optimizations. This paper demonstrates this idea by using machine learning for four parts of the optimization setup problem: selecting a starting prototype from a database of prototypes, synthesizing a new starting prototype, predicting which design goals are achievable, and selecting a formulation of the search space. We use standard tree-induction algorithms (C4.5 and CART). We present results in two realistic engineering domains: racing yachts and supersonic aircraft. Our experimental results show that using inductive learning to make setup decisions improves both the speed and the reliability of design optimization.",

    "abstract": "The value of comprehensive rationale for documenting a design has long been recognized. However, designers rarely produce detailed rationale in practice because of the substantial time investment required. Efforts to support the acquisition of rationale information have focused on languages and tools for structuring the acquisition process, but still require substantial involvement on the part of the designer. This paper describes an experimental system, the Rationale Construction Framework (RCF), that acquires rationale information for the detailed design process without disrupting a designer's normal activities. The underlying approach involves monitoring designer interactions with a commercial computer-assisted design (CAD) tool to produce a rich process history. This history is subsequently structured and interpreted relative to a background theory of design metaphors that enable explanation of certain aspects of the design process. The framework provides an environment that can acquire rich, meaningful rationale information in a time- and cost-effective manner, with minimal disruption to the designer.",

    "abstract": "The exponential growth of the Internet and increasing communication and computational power have created many opportunities for advancing engineering, manufacturing, and business activities. Among them are electronic catalogs. These have become basic information resources to a number of people, ranging from shoppers looking for personal items to engineers selecting electromechanical parts to build a product. Although rich in content, current catalog systems are limited both in search quality and in realizing the full potential of the retrieved information. The active catalog system brings a conceptually new idea to electronic commerce by providing a new, computationally usable, catalog information environment about components and their use in applications. It utilizes a rich body of domain knowledge to facilitate access and retrieval of component information. The utility of retrieved information is enhanced by using it to rapidly construct simulation programs and test alternatives, supporting a “try before you buy” paradigm in which users evaluate candidate components within simulations of their design. We describe services provided in the active catalog system to support engineers in selecting and evaluating electromechanical components and subsystems. The services include mechanisms for creating queries for parts based on their intended use rather than merely parametric specifications, refining those queries to take account of constraints imposed by domain knowledge, providing multimodal information to help engineers assess and compare candidate parts, and generating simulation models for candidate parts and integrating them to provide simulation models for candidate systems.",

Although formal and computational methods for analyzing styles and generating designs provide impressively parsimonious accounts of what some styles are , they do not address many of the factors that influence how humans understand styles. The subtlety of human style judgments raises challenges for computational approaches to style. This paper differentiates between a range of distinct meanings of “style” and explores how designers and ordinary people learn and apply perceptual similarity classes and style concepts in different situations to interpret and create designed artifacts. A range of psychological evidence indicates that style perception is dependent on knowledge and involves the interaction of perceptual recognition of style features and explanatory inference processes that create a coherent understanding of an object as an exemplar of a style. This article concludes by outlining how formal style analyses can be used in combination with psychological research to develop a fuller understanding of style perception and creative design.",

Given a set of previously optimized structures of the same topology, this paper uses inductive learning to replace this optimization process entirely by deriving a function that directly maps any given load to an optimal geometry. A support vector machine is trained to determine the optimal geometry of individual modules of a space frame structure given a specified load condition. Structures produced by learning are compared against those found by a standard gradient descent optimization, both as individual modules and then as a composite structure. The primary motivation for this is speed, and results show the process is highly efficient for cases in which similar optimizations must be performed repeatedly. The function learned by the algorithm can approximate the result of optimization very closely after sufficient training, and has also been found effective at generalizing the underlying optima to produce structures that perform better than those found by standard iterative methods.",

The theory provides mathematical measures of expectations, violations, and explanations, which are argued to be the atomic components of the esthetic experience. The approach employs Bayesian methods to extend information measures proposed in other research. In particular, it is shown that information theory is useful at an entropic level to measure expectations ( E ) of signals and violations ( V ) of expectations, but that Bayesian theory is needed at a semantic level to measure explanations ( E ′) of meaning for the signals.

    "abstract": "Abstract The Designers' Workbench is a system developed by the Advanced Knowledge Technologies Consortium to support designers in large organizations, such as Rolls-Royce, to ensure that the design is consistent with the specification for the particular design as well as with the company's design rule book(s). In the principal application discussed here, the evolving design is described using a jet engine ontology. Design rules are expressed as constraints over the domain ontology. Currently, to capture the constraint information, a domain expert (design engineer) has to work with a knowledge engineer to identify the constraints, and it is then the task of the knowledge engineer to encode these into the Workbench's knowledge base. This is an error-prone and time-consuming task. It is highly desirable to relieve the knowledge engineer of this task, so we have developed a system, ConEditor+, that enables domain experts themselves to capture and maintain these constraints. Further, we hypothesize that to appropriately apply, maintain, and reuse constraints, it is necessary to understand the underlying assumptions and context in which each constraint is applicable. We refer to them as “application conditions,” and these form a part of the rationale associated with the constraint. We propose a methodology to capture the application conditions associated with a constraint and demonstrate that an explicit representation (machine interpretable format) of application conditions (rationales) together with the corresponding constraints and the domain ontology can be used by a machine to support maintenance of constraints. Support for the maintenance of constraints includes detecting inconsistencies, subsumption, redundancy, fusion between constraints, and suggesting appropriate refinements. The proposed methodology provides immediate benefits to the designers, and hence, should encourage them to input the application conditions (rationales).",

This paper presents a new data mining technique, called knowledge cohesion (KC), which takes into account a domain ontology and the user's interest in exploring certain data sets to extract knowledge, in the form of semantic nets, from large data sets. The KC method has been successfully applied to mine causal relations from oil platform accident reports. In a comparison with association rule techniques for the same domain, KC has shown a significant improvement in the extraction of relevant knowledge, using processing complexity and knowledge manageability as the evaluation criteria.",

Knowledge-based and generative systems are combined to construct a method for characterizing existing buildings, in particular, their interior layouts based on exterior features and certain other parameters such as location and real dimensions. The knowledge-based model contains information about spatial use, organization, elements, and contextual information, with the shape grammar principally containing style rules. Buildings are analyzed and layouts are generated through communication and interaction between these two systems. The benefit of using an interactive system is that the complementary properties of the two schemes are employed to strengthen the overall process. Ontologies capture knowledge relating to architectural design principles, building anatomy, structure, and systems. Shape grammar rules embody change through geometric manipulation and transformation. Existing buildings are analyzed using this approach, and three-dimensional models are automatically generated. Two particular building types, the vernacular rowhouse and high-rise apartment building, both from Baltimore, Maryland, are presented to illustrate the process and for comparing the utilized methodologies.",

The use of innovative technology enabled the formalization of design knowledge within international student teams as did the methods that were developed for students to store, share, and reuse information. Coaching methods were used by teaching staff to support distributed teams and evaluation work on relevant classes was carried out regularly to allow ongoing improvement of learning and teaching and show improvements in student learning. Major findings of the 5-year project include the requirement to overcome technological, pedagogical, and cultural issues for successful eLearning implementations. The DIDET Framework encapsulates all the conclusions relating to design engineering in a global context.

    "abstract": "Abstract Critical chains composed of critical flows and functions have been demonstrated as an effective qualitative analogy retrieval approach based on performance metrics. In prior work, engineers used expert knowledge to transform functional models into critical chain models, which are abstractions of the functional model. Automating this transformation process is highly desirable so as to provide for a robust transformation method. Within this paper, two paradigms for functional modeling abstraction are compared. A series of pruning rules provide an automated transformation approach, and this is compared to the results generated previously through an expert knowledge approach. These two approaches are evaluated against a set of published functional models. The similarity of the resulting transformation of the functional models into critical chain models is evaluated using a functional chain similarity metric, developed in previous work. Once critical chain models are identified, additional model evaluation criteria are used to evaluate the utility of the critical chain models for design analogy identification. Since the functional vocabulary acts as a common language among designers and engineers to abstract and represent critical design artifact information, analogous matching can be made about the functional vocabulary. Thus, the transformation of functional models into critical chain models enables engineers to use functional abstraction as a mechanism to identify design analogies. The critical flow rule is the most effective first step when automatically transforming a functional model to a critical chain model. Further research into more complex critical chain model architectures and the interactions between criteria is merited.",

This paper reviews existing shape grammar implementations in terms of their algorithmic complexity, extends the definition of shape grammars with sets of transformations for rule application, categorizes (parametric and non-parametric) sets of transformations, and analyses these categories in terms of the resulting algorithmic complexity. Specifically, it describes how different sets of transformations admit different numbers of targets (i.e., potential inputs) for rule application. In the non-parametric case, this number is quadratic or cubic, while in the parametric case, it can be non-polynomial, depending on the size of the target shape. The analysis thus yields lower bounds for the algorithmic complexity of shape grammar implementations that hold independently of the employed algorithm or data structure. Based on these bounds, we propose novel matching algorithms for non-parametric and parametric shape grammar implementation and analyze their complexity.

    "abstract": "Abstract Recently, interest in integrated assembly sequence planning (ASP) and assembly line balancing (ALB) began to pick up because of its numerous benefits, such as the larger search space that leads to better solution quality, reduced error rate in planning, and expedited product time-to-market. However, existing research is limited to the simple assembly problem that only runs one homogenous product. This paper therefore models and optimizes the integrated mixed-model ASP and ALB using Multi-objective Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (MODPSO) concurrently. This is a new variant of the integrated assembly problem. The integrated mixed-model ASP and ALB is modeled using task-based joint precedence graph. In order to test the performance of MODPSO to optimize the integrated mixed-model ASP and ALB, an experiment using a set of 51 test problems with different difficulty levels was conducted. Besides that, MODPSO coefficient tuning was also conducted to identify the best setting so as to optimize the problem. The results from this experiment indicated that the MODPSO algorithm presents a significant improvement in term of solution quality toward Pareto optimal and demonstrates the ability to explore the extreme solutions in the mixed-model assembly optimization search space. The originality of this research is on the new variant of integrated ASP and ALB problem. This paper is the first published research to model and optimize the integrated ASP and ALB research for mixed-model assembly problem.",

Because many of these aspects may be conflicting, such as time, cost, quality, profit, resource utilization, and so on, the problem is rendered as a multiobjective one. Consequently, we consider a multiobjective optimization problem of MSS in this study, where production profit and machining quality are to be maximized while production cost and production time must be minimized, simultaneously. This paper presents a new discrete method for particle swarm optimization, which can be widely applied in MSS to find out the set of Pareto-optimal solutions for multiobjective optimization. To deal with multiple objectives and enable the decision maker to make decisions according to different demands on each evaluation index, an analytic hierarchy process is implemented to determine the weight value of evaluation indices. Case study is included to demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of the hybrid algorithm. It is shown from the case study that the multiobjective optimization model can simply, effectively, and objectively select the optimal machining scheme according to the different demands on evaluation indices.",

This research addresses this issue by considering the following situation: all the components share the same system load, and system designers know component reliabilities with respect to the component load, but do not know other information, such as component limit-state functions. The strategy is to reconstruct the equivalent component limit-state functions during the system design stage such that they can accurately reproduce component reliabilities. Because the system load is a common factor shared by all the reconstructed component limit-state functions, the component dependence can be captured implicitly. As a result, more accurate system reliability can be produced compared with traditional methods. An engineering example demonstrates the feasibility of the new system reliability method.",

We asked students to generate functions for two different products and examined how students taught functional modeling and function enumeration compare to students who are only taught function enumeration. The student responses were examined using a rubric that we developed and validated for assessing function. This rubric may be used to classify functions by correctness (correct, partially correct, and incorrect) and categories (high level, interface, low level, and ambiguous). On questions where students were not explicitly asked to write a high-level function or low-level function, and so on, students who were taught functional modeling were able to better demonstrate systems thinking in their responses (low-level and interface functions) than those students who were only taught function enumeration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Collision avoidance for robots and vehicles in unpredictable environments is a challenging task. Various control strategies have been developed for the agent (i.e., robots or vehicles) to sense the environment, assess the situation, and select the optimal actions to avoid collision and accomplish its mission. In our research on autonomous ships, we take a machine learning approach to collision avoidance. The lack of available ship steering data of human ship masters has made it necessary to acquire collision avoidance knowledge through reinforcement learning (RL). Given that the learned neural network tends to be a black box, it is desirable that a method is available which can be used to design an agent's behavior so that the desired knowledge can be captured. Furthermore, RL with complex tasks can be either time consuming or unfeasible. A multi-stage learning method is needed in which agents can learn from simple tasks and then transfer their learned knowledge to closely related but more complex tasks. In this paper, we explore the ways of designing agent behaviors through tuning reward functions and devise a transfer RL method for multi-stage knowledge acquisition. The computer simulation-based agent training results have shown that it is important to understand the roles of each component in a reward function and the various design parameters in transfer RL. The settings of these parameters are all dependent on the complexity of the tasks and the similarities between them.",

Therefore, it is widely used in aerospace, medical, and automotive industries where machining is an essential process for these industries. However, machining of Ti–6Al–4V is a material with extremely low machinability characteristics; thus, conventional machining methods are not appropriate to machine such materials. Ultrasonic-assisted machining (UAM) is a novel hybrid machining method which has numerous advantages over conventional machining processes. In addition, minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) is an alternative type of metal cutting fluid application that is being used instead of conventional lubrication in machining. One of the parameters which could be used to measure the performance of the machining process is the amount of cutting force. Nevertheless, there is a number of limited studies to compare the changes in cutting forces by using UAM and MQL together which are time-consuming and not cost-effective. Artificial neural network (ANN) is an alternative method that may eliminate the limitations mentioned above by estimating the outputs with the limited number of data. In this study, a model was developed and coded in Python programming environment in order to predict cutting forces using ANN. The results showed that experimental cutting forces were estimated with a successful prediction rate of 0.99 with mean absolute percentage error and mean squared error of 1.85% and 13.1, respectively. Moreover, considering too limited experimental data, ANN provided acceptable results in a cost- and time-effective way.",

The appraisal assigns meaning, by which the surprise is resolved, and is computed as a posterior probability using Bayesian theory. This model is tested by obtaining human ratings of surprise, meaning, and creativeness for artifacts in a domain of advertising design. The empirical results show that humans do judge creativeness as a product of surprise and meaning, consistent with the computational model of arousal and appraisal.

To generate the description of the system, a two-field based model is proposed in which agents are assigned parameterized responses to two “fields,” a task field encompassing environmental features and task objects, and a social field arising from agent interactions. The aggregate effect of these two fields, sensed by agents individually, governs the behavior of each agent, while the system-level behavior emerges from the actions of and interactions among the agents. Task requirements together with performance preferences are used to compose system fitness functions for evolving functional and efficient self-organizing mechanisms. Case studies on the evolutionary synthesis of self-organizing systems are presented and discussed. These case studies focus on achieving system-level behavior with minimal explicit coordination among agents. Agents were able to collectively display flocking, exploration, and foraging through self-organization. The proposed two-field model was able to capture important features of self-organizing systems, and the genetic algorithm was able to generate self-organizing mechanisms by which agents could form task-based structures to fulfill functional requirements.",

We review existing research in analogical thinking, with a focus on scientific discourse and education. Then we explore the role of analogies in design education in making concepts more relatable by asking six participants in a graduate-level design course to generate analogies for course topics. We describe criteria developed to evaluate the analogies and present these evaluations. We then asked participants to perform divergent thinking tests, but we found no significant correlation between these and analogy scores. The participants were also asked to reflect on what constitutes an effective analog, describe their process of identifying analogies, and provide their definitions of analogies. We describe possible links between these comments and the ratings of their analogies. We then draw on results in using analogies in pedagogy to inform and reflect on obstacles we encountered in the use of analogies to inspire. Specifically, we related them to our experience with biomimetic or biologically inspired design, where we used a natural-language search approach to identify relevant analogies. Three aspects discussed are familiarity of source analogies, boundaries of parallels between source analogies and target concepts, and concreteness of source analogies. Finally, we discuss possible pedagogical benefits of eliciting analogies on course topics from students, namely, using the elicited analogies as tools for improved student engagement as well as more prompt instructor feedback.",

A system simulation using qualitative descriptions of component behaviors and a functional reasoning tool are used to identify the functional impact of a large set of potential single and multiple fault scenarios. The impact of each scenario is collected as the set of categorical function “health” states for each component-level function in the system. This data represents the space of potential system states. The clustering and statistical tools presented in this paper are used to identify patterns in this system state space. These patterns reflect the underlying emergent failure behavior of the system. Specifically, two data analysis tools are presented and compared. First, a modified k -means clustering algorithm is used with a distance metric of functional effect similarity. Second, a statistical approach known as latent class analysis is used to find an underlying probability model of potential system failure states. These tools are used to reason about how the system responds to complex fault scenarios and assists in identifying potential design changes for fault mitigation. As computational power increases, the ability to reason with large sets of data becomes as critical as the analysis methods used to collect that data. The goal of this work is to provide complex system designers with a means of using early design simulation data to identify and mitigate potential emergent failure behavior.",

It first proposes an ontology-based approach for representing desired material-flow processing functions in a formal and unambiguous manner. Then a rule-based approach is proposed to represent the functional knowledge of a known solution principle in a general and flexible manner. Thereafter, a simulation-based retrieval approach is developed, which can search for suitable solution principles for desired material-flow processing functions. The proposed approaches have been implemented as a computer-aided conceptual design system for test.

    "abstract": "Abstract Inspirational stimuli are known to be effective in supporting ideation during early-stage design. However, prior work has predominantly constrained designers to using text-only queries when searching for stimuli, which is not consistent with real-world design behavior where fluidity across modalities (e.g., visual, semantic, etc.) is standard practice. In the current work, we introduce a multi-modal search platform that retrieves inspirational stimuli in the form of 3D-model parts using text, appearance, and function-based search inputs. Computational methods leveraging a deep-learning approach are presented for designing and supporting this platform, which relies on deep-neural networks trained on a large dataset of 3D-model parts. This work further presents the results of a cognitive study ( n = 21) where the aforementioned search platform was used to find parts to inspire solutions to a design challenge. Participants engaged with three different search modalities: by keywords, 3D parts, and user-assembled 3D parts in their workspace. When searching by parts that are selected or in their workspace, participants had additional control over the similarity of appearance and function of results relative to the input. The results of this study demonstrate that the modality used impacts search behavior, such as in search frequency, how retrieved search results are engaged with, and how broadly the search space is covered. Specific results link interactions with the interface to search strategies participants may have used during the task. Findings suggest that when searching for inspirational stimuli, desired results can be achieved both by direct search inputs (e.g., by keyword) as well as by more randomly discovered examples, where a specific goal was not defined. Both search processes are found to be important to enable when designing search platforms for inspirational stimuli retrieval.",

By synthesizing the elements and principles of design, learning and games, the authors propose a framework for a learning tool for school students to fulfil a number of learning objectives; the framework includes a design thinking process called “IISC Design Thinking” and its gamified version called “IISC DBox”. The effectiveness of the framework as a learning tool has been evaluated by conducting workshops that involved 77 school students. The results suggest that the gamification used had a positive effect on the design outcomes, fulfilment of learning objectives, and learners' achievements, indicating the potential of the framework for offering an effective, gamified tool for promoting design thinking in school education. In addition to presenting results from empirical studies for fulfilment of the objectives, this paper also proposes an approach that can be used for identifying appropriate learning objectives, selecting appropriate game elements to fulfil these objectives, and integrating appropriate game elements with design and learning elements. The paper also proposes a general approach for assessing the effectiveness of a gamified version for attaining a given set of learning objectives. The methodology used in this paper thus can be used as a reference for developing and evaluating a gamified version of design thinking course suitable not only for school education but also for other domains (e.g., engineering, management) with minimal changes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Engineering design requires humans to make complex, multi-objective decisions involving trade-offs where it is challenging to identify the best solution. AI-embedded computational support tools are increasingly used to aid in such scenarios, enhancing the design decision-making process. However, over- or under-reliance on imperfect “blackbox” models may prevent optimal outcomes. To investigate AI-assisted decision-making in engineering design, two complementary experiments ( N = 90) were conducted. Participants chose between pairs of aircraft jet engine brackets and were tasked with selecting the better design based on two (Experiment 1) or three (Experiment 2) competing objectives. Participants received simulated AI suggestions, which correctly suggested a better design, incorrectly suggested a worse design, or arbitrarily suggested an approximately equivalent design. At times, these suggestions were accompanied by an example-based explanation. Results demonstrate that participants follow suggestions less than expected when the model can objectively determine the better-performing alternative, often underutilizing the model’s advice to their detriment. When the “better” choice is uncertain, the tendency to follow an arbitrary suggestion differs, with overutilization occurring only in the bi-objective case. There is no evidence that providing an explanation of the model’s suggestion impacts decision-making. The results provide valuable insights into how engineering designers’ multi-objective decisions may be affected – positively, negatively, or not at all – by computational tools meant to assist them.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The utilization of creative design methodologies plays a pivotal role in nurturing innovation within the contemporary competitive market landscape. Although Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) has been recognized as a potent methodology for engendering innovative concepts, its intricate nature and time-consuming learning and application processes pose significant challenges. Furthermore, TRIZ has faced criticism for its limitations in processing design problems and facilitating designers in knowledge acquisition. Conversely, Environment-Based Design (EBD), a question-driven design methodology, provides robust methods and approaches for formulating design problems and identifying design conflicts. Large Language Models (LLMs) have also demonstrated the ability to streamline the design process and enhance design productivity. This study aims to propose an iteration of TRIZ integrated by EBD and supported by an LLM. This LLM-based conceptual design model assists designers through the conceptual design process. It begins by using question-asking and answering methods from EBD to gather relevant information. It then follows the EBD methodology to formulate the information into an interaction-dependence network, leading to the identification of functions and conflicts required by TRIZ. Lastly, TRIZ is used to generate inventive solutions. An evaluation is carried out to measure the effectiveness of the integrated approach. The results indicate that this approach successfully generates questions, processes designers’ responses, produces functional analysis elements, and generates ideas to resolve contradictions.",

To construct a high-precision segmentation model for sheet metal engineering drawings, this paper proposes a U-net jump structure with an attention mechanism based on the Convolutional Attention Module (CBAM) attention mechanism. At the same time, this paper also designs an encoder jump structure with vertical double pooling convolution, which fuses the features after maximum pooling+convolution of the high-dimensional encoder with the features after average pooling+convolution of the low-dimensional encoder. The method in this paper not only improves the global semantic feature extraction ability of the model but also reduces the dimensionality difference between the low-dimensional encoder and the high-dimensional decoder. Using Vgg16 as the backbone network, experiments verify that the IoU, mAP, and Accu indices of this paper’s method in the welding engineering drawing dataset segmentation task are 84.72%, 86.84%, and 99.42%, respectively, which are 22.10, 19.09 and 0.05 percentage points higher compared to the traditional U-net model, and it has a relatively excellent value in engineering applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Morphological matrices (MMs) have traditionally been used to generate concepts by combining different means. However, exploring the vast design space resulting from the combinatorial explosion of large MMs is challenging. Additionally, all alternative means are not necessarily compatible with each other. At the same time, for a system to achieve long-term success, it is necessary for it to be flexible such that it can easily be changed. Attaining high system flexibility necessitates an elevated compatibility with alternative means of achieving system functions, which further complicates the design space exploration process. To that end, we present an approach that we refer to as multi-objective technology assortment combinatorics. It uses a shortest-path algorithm to rapidly converge to a set of promising design candidates. While this approach can take flexibility into account, it can also consider other quantifiable objectives such as the cost and performance of the system. The efficiency of this approach is demonstrated with a case study from the automotive industry.",

A three-phase methodology was implemented: (1) Plan generation using text-to-image diffusion models (ChatGPT, Copilot, and LookX); (2) digital reconstruction in AutoCAD; and (3) daylight simulation via Velux Daylight Visualizer. Climate-adaptive prompts were formulated to guide the AI tools in producing context-specific floor plans with passive strategies. Out of 31 initial plans, eight valid outputs (five from ChatGPT and three from Copilot) were reconstructed in AutoCAD and simulated. Quantitative simulations were conducted on equinox and solstice dates, and average illuminance values were analyzed for key interior spaces (living room, kitchen, and bedroom). ChatGPT-generated plans demonstrated higher spatial clarity and more balanced daylight performance, whereas Copilot outputs varied significantly, and LookX was excluded due to insufficient architectural legibility. Results revealed that none of the models consistently integrated solar orientation or seasonal lighting considerations, indicating a gap between generative representation and environmental logic. The research contributes a replicable workflow that bridges generative AI and performance-based evaluation, offering critical insight into the current limitations and future potential of AI-assisted architectural design. The findings underscore the need for next-generation AI systems capable of semantic, spatial, and climatic reasoning to support environmentally responsive design practices.",

Two LLM-based agents, IntelliStorm and EvoluTRIZ, were developed for the study, with 32 participants randomly assigned to either the HHC or human–agent collaboration (HAC) groups. Brain activity was measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy, while outputs were assessed through expert evaluations. Results showed that designers exhibited lower cognitive load, better cognitive resource coordination, and enhanced fluency and flexibility in thinking in HAC than in HHC. Moreover, distinct patterns were revealed in different CGTs: brainstorming activated the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) as the core connectivity region, enhancing ideational fluency, whereas TRIZ activated the left dorsolateral PFC, facilitating refined thinking. Although HAC demonstrated stronger overall performance, HHC retained unique advantages in originality. This research offers novel neuroscientific insights and provides evidence-based guidance for developing more effective LLM-based design agents.",

However, designers currently lack a comprehensive methodology for engaging in co-ideation with LLMs, and there is a limited framework that describes the process of co-ideation between a designer and ChatGPT. This research thus aimed to explore how LLMs can act as codesigners and influence creative ideation processes of industrial designers and whether the ideation performance of a designer could be improved by employing the proposed framework for co-ideation with custom GPT. A survey was first conducted to detect how LLMs influenced the creative ideation processes of industrial designers and to understand the problems that designers face when using ChatGPT to ideate. Then, a framework which based on mapping content to guide the co-ideation between humans and custom GPT (named as Co-Ideator) was promoted. Finally, a design case study followed by a survey and an interview was conducted to evaluate the ideation performance of the custom GPT and framework compared with traditional ideation methods. Also, the effect of custom GPT on co-ideation was compared with a non-artificial intelligence (AI)-used condition. The findings indicated that if users employed co-ideation with custom GPT, the novelty and quality of ideation outperformed by using traditional ideation.",

The initial populations are generated at random, and design candidates for subsequent generations are produced by user-specified selection techniques. Crossovers are applied by using cut and splice operators at the random points of the chromosomes; random mutations are applied to modify the graph with a certain low probability. This cycle continues until a suitable design is found. The research contributions in this work include the development of a new GA encoding scheme for mechanical assemblies (Legos), as well as the creation of selection criteria for this domain. Our eventual goal is to introduce a simulation of electromechanical devices into our evaluation functions.

The computing core creates the model of the car based on a tree structure, which contains all car subsystems (e.g., suspension and chassis). Different part–subpart relationships define the tree model and link an object (e.g., suspension) to its components (e.g., wishbones and wheel). The definition of independent parameters (including design variables) and relationships definition allows the model to configure itself by evaluating all properties related to dimension, position, mass, etc. The graphic user interface allows the end user to interact with the car model by editing independent design parameters. It visualizes the main outputs of the model, which consist in numeric data (mass, center of mass of both the car and its subsystems) and graphic elements (car and subsystems 3D representation).",

An example of a constructed sheet metal component is shown along with the method for invoking the sheet metal grammar to create this component.",

The ability to represent and process these constraints in a computer is important for the verification of the output produced by computer-aided design programs. Constraints need not only check designs but can also be used to derive design solution s that satisfy constraints. The paper discusses how to represent the dual nature of constraints so that design consistency is maintained as the design evolves. Assumptions and rules of thumb are used frequently in design to propose initial solutions. We represent the logic behind the derivation of these assumptions as heuristic procedures and maintain the dependencies between these assumptions and their consequents as an aid to the management of design consistency. We also propose a simple scheme, involving the partitioning of the design modules, to effect design changes when constraint violations occur. An example from structural design illustrates the methodology.",

    "abstract": "Customers can directly express their preferences on many options when ordering products today. Mass customization manufacturing thus has emerged as a new trend for its aiming to satisfy the needs of individual customers. This process of offering a wide product variety often induces an exponential growth in the volume of information and redundancy for data storage. Thus, a technique for managing product configuration is necessary, on the one hand, to provide customers faster configured and lower priced products, and on the other hand, to translate customers' needs into the product information needed for tendering and manufacturing. This paper presents a decision-making scheme through constructing a product family model (PFM) first, in which the relationship between product, modules, and components are defined. The PFM is then transformed into a product configuration network. A product configuration problem assuming that customers would like to have a minimum-cost and customized product can be easily solved by finding the shortest path in the corresponding product configuration network. Genetic algorithms (GAs), mathematical programming, and tree-searching methods such as uniform-cost search and iterative deepening A* are applied to obtain solutions to this problem. An empirical case is studied in this work as an example. Computational results show that the solution quality of GAs retains 93.89% for a complicated configuration problem. However, the running time of GAs outperforms the running time of other methods with a minimum speed factor of 25. This feature is very useful for a real-time system.",

Several methods exist to analyze the risk in a system, but all require a mature design. However, by applying the concept of “common interfaces” to a functional model and utilizing a historical knowledge base, it is possible to analyze chains of failures during the conceptual phase of product design. This paper presents a method based on these common interfaces to be used in conjunction with other methods such as risk in early design to allow a more complete risk analysis during the conceptual design phase. Finally, application of this method is demonstrated in a design setting by applying it to a thermal control subsystem.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Designers who are experts in a given design domain are well known to be able to Immediately focus on “good designs,” suggesting that they may have learned additional constraints while exploring the design space based on some functional aspects. These constraints, which are often implicit, result in a redefinition of the design space, and may be crucial for discovering chunks or interrelations among the design variables. Here we propose a machine-learning approach for discovering such constraints in supervised design tasks. We develop models for specifying design function in situations where the design has a given structure or embodiment, in terms of a set of performance metrics that evaluate a given design. The functionally feasible regions, which are those parts of the design space that demonstrate high levels of performance, can now be learned using any general purpose function approximator. We demonstrate this process using examples from the design of simple locking mechanisms, and as in human experience, we show that the quality of the constraints learned improves with greater exposure in the design space. Next, we consider changing the embodiment and suggest that similar embodiments may have similar abstractions. To explore convergence, we also investigate the variability in time and error rates where the experiential patterns are significantly different. In the process, we also consider the situation where certain functionally feasible regions may encode lower dimensional manifolds and how this may relate to cognitive chunking.",

However, research has not reached a consensus about the influence of such instructions, leading to difficulties in understanding how the examples and the instructions each affect idea generation. We conducted an experiment in which 303 participants designed for the same design problem, while given different examples and instructions, which ranged from strongly encouraging copying the examples to strongly discouraging copying. Exposure to the examples affected the number and type of ideas generated, whereas exposure to the instructions did not. However, instructions did affect how participants incorporated features of the examples in their ideas. Encouraged groups incorporated many features of the examples, while also incorporating structural features more than conceptual ones. Surprisingly, the incorporation of features in discouraged groups was not different from that of groups given no instructions or even no stimulus. This indicates that concrete features may be easier to recognize and reproduce than abstract ones, and that encouraging instructions are more effective than discouraging ones, despite how strict or lenient those instructions are. The manipulation of different features also allowed us to observe how similar approaches to solving a design problem can compete for attention and how the calculation of feature repetition can be misleading depending on how common or obvious the features might be. These findings have implications for the interpretation of results from fixation studies, and for the development of design tools that present stimuli to assist idea generation.",

To this end, this paper explores the value of a representation by comparing the ability of a representation to support reasoning based on varying amounts of information stored in the representational components of a function structure: vocabulary, grammar, and topology. This is done by classifying the previously developed functional pruning rules into vocabulary, grammatical, and topological classes and applying them to function structures available from an external design repository. The original and pruned function structures of electromechanical devices are then evaluated for how accurately market values can be predicted using the graph complexity connectivity method. The accuracy is found to be inversely related to the amount of information and level of detail. Applying the topological rule does not significantly impact the predictive power of the models, while applying the vocabulary rules and the grammar rules reduces the accuracy of the predictions. Finally, the least predictive model set is that which had all rules applied. In this manner, the value of a representation to predict or answer questions is quantified.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite alefforts for a sustainable production system, many companies are still struggling to implement environmental aspects in their daily product development processes. Among the evaluation and improvement methods, life cycle assessment (LCA) is one of the most popular tools to achieve this goal. Up to date, LCA has been applied to many products, services, and industrial systems to evaluate their environmental impact aspects. However, there is a wide range of indicators available to be applied for LCA, and choosing an inappropriate indicator may lead the product designer to achieve wrong and weak results. Therefore, this paper proposes to overcome this difficulty by developing a method that can be used as a knowledge transfer to product designers and LCA practitioners in order to help them to make the most appropriate choice of LCA indicators. This method should have some characteristics, such as (a) to be adaptable to a given context and (b) to be dynamic, scalable, and easy to learn. The purpose of this paper is to present the Evaluation Method for Choosing Indicator (EMCI) developed to facilitate the learning process of LCA methods and to quickly select their most appropriate indicators. To validate the EMCI method, a case study on a French textile industry has been implemented. The focus was to evaluate how LCA indicators and methods were chosen to be integrated into the suitable eco-design LCA tool.",

This nontraditional learning environment has found an immense increase in popularity and investment in the last decade. Further, makerspaces have been shown to be highly gendered, privileging men's and masculine understandings of making. The spike in popularity warrants deeper analysis, examining the value of these spaces for women and if learning is occurring in these spaces, specifically at higher education institutions. We implemented a phenomenologically based interviewing process to capture the making experiences of 20 women students, recruited through purposive and snowball sampling. By eliciting the narratives of women students, we captured how making, designing, and creating evolved through gendered experiences in the university makerspace. Each interview was transcribed and resulted in around 868 pages of single-spaced text transcriptions. The data were analyzed through multiple cycles of open and axial coding for common themes and patterns, where makerspaces create a culture of learning, facilitate students’ design journey, and form a laboratory for creativity. These themes forwarded the creation of a learning model that showcases how design and learning interact in the makerspace. This work demonstrates that women students are engaging learning and inspiration; developing confidence and resilience; and learning how to work with others and collaborate.",

One is the valuation approach that is based on utility and cost of design changes in response to modified requirements. The valuation approach is theoretically sound because it is based on utility and decision theory, but it may be difficult to use in the real world. The second approach is based on examining product architecture characteristics that facilitate changes that include modularity, hierarchy, interfaces, performance sensitivity, and design margins. This approach is heuristic in nature but more practical to use. If calibrated, it could serve as a surrogate for real adaptability.

The reference framework is established through an extensive review of existing literature, and as such consolidates an extensive theoretical base. The review of literature shows a broadening of the understanding of the configuration task. The definition of the configuration task is somewhat ambiguous because different research groups define configuration tasks differently. This paper proposes a reference framework for configuration that permits a more precise understanding of a configuration task, a definition of the basic concepts in product configuration, and a total configuration system view that describes how operators come together to perform the configuration task in the configuration process. We will define the product, the product model, the configuration task, and the configuration system, and put the whole thing into perspective with the theory of technical systems, where we describe the configuration process and the different abstraction level of configurations. We will also use our resulting framework to describe sales configuration, technical configuration, and reconfiguration. We do this to synthesize previous work, to clarify and make coherent definitions of relevant terms, to extent the definition of product configuration to include “softer” products like information and service, and finally, to give a comparative framework to analyze work done in the field of product configuration. The total configuration system, together with the definition of key concepts, comprises a strong reference framework when working with, developing, and analyzing configuration systems.",

In the literature, several successful applications have been reported for graph-based optimization problems, such as scheduling problems. This paper provides one definition of periodic vehicle routing problem for single and multidepots conforming to a wide range of real-world problems and also develops a novel hybrid genetic algorithm to solve it. The proposed hybrid genetic algorithm applies a modified approach to generate a population of initial chromosomes and also uses an improved heuristic called the iterated swap procedure to improve the initial solutions. Moreover, during the implementation a hybrid algorithm, cyclic transfers, an effective class of neighborhood search is applied. The author uses three genetic operators to produce good new offspring. The objective function consists of two terms: total traveled distance at each depot and total waiting time of all customers to take service. Distances are assumed Euclidean or straight line. These conditions are exactly consistent with the real-world situations and have received little attention in the literature. Finally, the experimental results have revealed that the proposed hybrid method can be competitive with the best existing methods as asynchronous parallel heuristic and variable neighborhood search in terms of solution quality to solve the vehicle routing problem.",

In this paper, an understanding of the use of internal analogies in conceptual design is developed by studying: the types of internal analogies; the roles of internal analogies; the influence of design problems on the creation of internal analogies; the role of experience of designers on the use of internal analogies; the levels of abstraction at which internal analogies are searched in target domain, identified in source domain, and realized in the target domain; and the effect of internal analogies from the natural and artificial domains on the solution space created using these analogies. To facilitate this understanding, empirical studies of design sessions from earlier research, each involving a designer solving a design problem by identifying requirements and developing conceptual solutions, without using any support, are used. The following are the important findings: designers use analogies from the natural and artificial domains; analogies are used for generating requirements and solutions; the nature of the design problem influences the use of analogies; the role of experience of designers on the use of analogies is not clearly ascertained; analogical transfer is observed only at few levels of abstraction while many levels remain unexplored; and analogies from the natural domain seem to have more positive influence than the artificial domain on the number of ideas and variety of idea space.",

The proposed method uses the generative abilities of graph grammars with simulation and analysis power of conventional computational fluid dynamics methods. The graph grammar interpreter GraphSynth is used to carry out graph transformations, which define different topologies for a given multiple-inlet multiple-outlet problem. After evaluating and optimizing the generated graphs, they are first transformed into meaningful three-dimensional shapes. These solutions are then analyzed by a computational fluid dynamics solver for final evaluation of the possible solutions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is checked by solving a variety of available test problems and comparing them with those found in the literature. Furthermore, by solving very complex large-scale problems, the robustness and effectiveness of the method is tested. To extend the work, future research directions are presented.",

Most of the existing shape grammars are developed on paper and have not been implemented computationally thus far. Nevertheless, the computer implementation of shape grammar is an important research question, not only to automate design analysis and generation, but also to extend the impact of shape grammars toward design practice and computer-aided design tools. In this paper, we investigate the implementation of shape grammars on a computer system, using a graph-theoretic representation. In particular, we describe and evaluate the implementation of the existing Rabo-de-Bacalhau transformation grammar. A practical step-by-step approach is presented, together with a discussion of important findings noticed during the implementation and evaluation. The proposed approach is shown to be both feasible and valuable in several aspects: we show how the attempt to implement a grammar on a computer system leads to a deeper understanding of that grammar, and might result in the further development of the grammar; we show how the proposed approach is embedded within a commercial computer-aided design environment to make the shape grammar formalism more accessible to students and practitioners, thereby increasing the impact of grammars on design practice; and the proposed step-by-step implementation approach has shown to be feasible for the implementation of the Rabo-de-Bacalhau transformation grammar, but can also be generalized using different ontologies for the implementation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Prior research has identified set-based design as a method that accounts for the high level of uncertainty that is associated with the design of innovative products or systems. Rather than precisely specifying a system architecture in the early design stages, set-based design builds on designing a system and its architecture in an evolutionary way. The literature on set-based design has studied how a system's design evolves by moving from a number of optional design ideas to the final system through gradually eliminating unfeasible design ideas and continually developing design ideas for which engineers increasingly establish feasibility. However, little is known about how firms set up the design process and the organization to successfully create new products with set-based design. Our research contributes to closing this gap. First, we study how firms determine the number (i.e., portfolio) of design ideas to pursue, an important step of the early design process. Second, we study how firms organize for set-based design by assigning teams to develop design ideas and eventually design a system's architecture. Our research uses an exploratory case study approach, investigating five cases in three different firms. First, we find that the early design process is characterized by the absence of formal idea evaluation and selection. Instead, firms start to pursue all initially created design ideas, evaluating and selecting them in an evolutionary manner as the design project progresses. Second, we identify two organizational approaches associated with set-based design: assign one team to pursue all ideas or assign one team per design idea.",

The resulting interface configuration – the Control Carousel – demonstrates how the appropriate use of familiar mechanisms can increase VR accessibility. Three case studies using the Carousel in commercial design projects are described, and the subsequent interface refinements outlined. Finally, the development of an experience map describing the logistical, interactive, and emotive factors affecting the Carousel's implementation is documented.

With the growing popularity of large-scale virtual 3D environments for architectural visualization and the game industry, the manual interior design of virtual scenes becomes prohibitively expensive in terms of time and resources. In our approach, the machine learning model automatically generates layout suggestions. The proposed procedural kitchen generation (PKG) model is a pipeline of six Machine Learning (ML) classifiers that are trained and tested on a kitchen layout dataset created by interior designers. The performances of the model are evaluated for the following classifiers: Random forest, Decision tree, AdaBoost, Naive Bayes, MLP, SVM, and L2 Logistic regression. Random forest, as the best performing classifier is used in the final PKG model, and integrated into Unity Engine for automatic 3D kitchen generation and presentation. The PKG model is evaluated in the quantitative and perceptual study, showing better performance than the prior rule-based method. The perceptual study results demonstrate that our tool can be used to speed up designer's work, improve communication with clients, and educate interior design students.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The generation of floor plan layouts has been extensively studied in recent years, driven by the need for efficient and functional architectural designs. Despite significant advancements, existing methods often face limitations when dealing with specific input adjacency graphs or room shapes and boundary layouts. When adjacency graphs contain separating triangles, the floor plan must include rectilinear rooms (non-rectangular rooms with concave corners). From a design perspective, minimizing corners or bends in rooms is crucial for functionality and aesthetics. In this article, we present a Python-based application called G-Drawer for automatically generating floor plans with a minimum number of bends. G-Drawer takes any plane triangulated graph as an input and outputs a floor plan layout with minimum bends. It prioritizes generating a rectangular floor plan (RFP); if an RFP is not feasible, it then generates an orthogonal floor plan or an irregular floor plan. G-Drawer modifies orthogonal drawing techniques based on flow networks and applies them on the dual graph of a given PTG to generate the required floor plans. The results of this article demonstrate the efficacy of G-Drawer in creating efficient floor plans. However, in future, we need to work on generating multiple dimensioned floor plans having non-rectangular rooms as well as non-rectangular boundary. These enhancements will address both mathematical and architectural challenges, advancing the automated generation of floor plans toward more practical and versatile applications.",

The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the relationship between a brand’s corporate identity and its architectural structures through a holistic approach, leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) as a design tool. To achieve this, this study conducts an interdisciplinary literature review, synthesizing existing works in both architecture and branding. The research methodology follows a qualitative, exploratory framework, focusing on the formal and aesthetic evaluations of AI-driven visual outputs. In this context, the central aim of this study is to explore the use of contemporary technologies as a design instrument within the architectural domain. Another key objective is to examine the application of AI as a methodological tool for architectural design within the context of corporate identity. To this end, architectural forms were visually generated using text-to-image and image-to-image, with the resulting products assessed in terms of architectural presentation techniques, visual quality, and aesthetic strategies. For the study’s empirical component, brands ranked at the top of the 2023 Best Global Brands report were selected as the sample, and AI-driven architectural productions were created based on their logos. The findings suggest that AI, with its diverse styles and capabilities, can serve as a design parameter within architectural practice. This study contributes to the discourse on the evolving intersection of AI, branding, and architectural design, proposing new perspectives on the integration of these domains in the design process.",

    "abstract": "Abstract By the reason that mathematical analysis is not feasible for practical control of buildings, decentralized control (DC) and fuzzy control (FC) technologies were introduced to optimize the control problem of high-rise building (HRB) structures. For the control problem of HRB structures, magnetorheological fluid dampers (MRFDs) were introduced to optimize the lateral stress problem of each floor, and the influence of different output variables on FC was compared. In the analysis of fuzzy DC experiments, there were significant differences in the impact of different structural controls (SCs) on building acceleration. In the comparison of the interstory displacement (ISD) time history of the lower concrete structure, the maximum ISD value without control was -12 cm in the nineth second, −7 cm in the nineth second of LQR (linear quadratic regularization) control, and -6 cm in the FC. The proposed biomedical evolutionary technology had better SC effects in practical scenarios, with better safety and stability. The research was mainly based on FC controller technology, and in the future, updated IT2FL (interval type2 fuzzy logic) control technology can be adopted. At the same time, machine learning models are used to optimize parameter problems and improve the control effect of concrete structures. Therefore, fluid dampers help reduce vibrations caused by external earthquakes and other dynamic loads. By dampening devices, fluid dampers enhance the overall stability of the building by improving comfort levels. By allowing for lighter structural designs, fluid dampers can reduce the amount of material needed for construction, leading to cost savings. With reduced vibrations and stresses, there may be fewer maintenance issues over time. Fluid dampers can be designed for various types of structures and can be used in conjunction with other damping systems, making them flexible solutions for different engineering challenges. The future study can be effectively combined with base isolation systems to further improve a building’s resilience against seismic forces.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Various factors are considered when designing a floorplan layout, including the plan’s outer boundary, room shape and size, adjacency, privacy, and circulation space, among others. While graph-theoretic approaches have proven effective for floorplan generation, existing algorithms generally focus on defining the boundary of the plan or different room shapes, lacking the investigation of designing circulation space within a floorplan. However, the circulation design in architectural planning is a crucial factor that affects the functionality and efficiency of areas within a building. This paper presents a graph-theoretic approach for integrating circulation within a floorplan. In this study, we use plane graphs to represent floorplans and develop graph algorithms to incorporate various types of circulation within a floorplan as follows: i. The first phase generates a spanning circulation, that is, a corridor leading to each room using a circulation graph. ii. Subsequently, using an approximation algorithm, the circulation space is minimized, that is, generation of minimum circulation space covering all the rooms, thereby enhancing space utilization in the floorplan. iii. Furthermore, customized circulations are generated to cater to user preferences, distinguishing between public and private spaces within the floorplan. In addition to the theoretical framework, we have implemented our algorithms in Python and developed a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI), enabling seamless integration of our algorithms into architectural design processes.",

Three case studies corresponding to as many representative jobs related to reciprocating compressor cylinders have been analyzed. The results indicate that the proposed method performs well within its training boundaries, delivering optimal solutions and providing reasonably accurate predictions for target configurations beyond these boundaries. However, in cases requiring a creative redesign using artificial neural networks may lead to errors that exceed acceptable tolerance levels.

    "abstract": "Abstract Vibration control in structures is essential to mitigate undesired dynamic responses, thereby enhancing stability, safety, and performance under varying loading conditions. Mechanical metamaterials have emerged as effective solutions, enabling tailored dynamic properties for vibration attenuation. This study introduces a convolutional autoencoder framework for the inverse design of local resonators embedded in mechanical metamaterials. The model learns from the dynamic behaviour of primary structures coupled with ideal absorbers to predict the geometric parameters of resonators that achieve desired vibration control performance. Unlike conventional approaches requiring full numerical models, the proposed method operates as a data-driven tool, where the target frequency to be mitigated is provided as input, and the model directly outputs the resonator geometry. A large dataset, generated through physics-informed simulations of ideal absorber dynamics, supports training while incorporating both spectral and geometric variability. Within the architecture, the encoder maps input receptance spectra to resonator geometries, while the decoder reconstructs the target receptance response, ensuring dynamic consistency. Once trained, the framework predicts resonator configurations that satisfy predefined frequency targets with high accuracy, enabling efficient design of passive controllers of the syntonized mass type. This study specifically demonstrates the application of the methodology to resonators embedded in wind turbine metastructures, a critical context for mitigating structural vibrations and improving operational efficiency. Results confirm strong agreement between predicted and target responses, underscoring the potential of deep learning techniques to support on-demand inverse design of mechanical metamaterials for smart vibration control in wind energy and related engineering applications.",

Data from forty participants reveal a consistent and meaningful interaction between brain activity, behavior, and self-reported stress, highlighting that educational background significantly modulates cognitive and neural patterns during ideation. Importantly, perceived stress shows strong negative correlations with neural power across all frequency bands, suggesting a close alignment between subjective experience and physiological measures. By integrating neural, behavioral, and psychological data, this study advances the understanding of the neurocognitive mechanisms driving design ideation and establishes a methodological foundation for bridging Design and Cognitive Neuroscience.

    "abstract": "MarCon (Market-based Constraints) applies market-based control to distributed constraint problems. It offers a new approach to distributing constraint problems that avoids challenges faced by current approaches in some problem domains, and it provides a systematic method for applying markets to a wide array of problems. Constraint agents interact with one another via the variable agents in which they have a common interest, using expressions of their preferences over sets of assignments. Each variable integrates this information from the constraints interested in it and provides feedback that enables the constraints to shrink their sets of assignments until they converge on a solution. MarCon originated in a system for supporting human product designers, and its mechanisms are particularly useful for applications integrating human and machine intelligence to explore implicit constraints. MarCon has been tested in the domain of mechanical design, in which its set-narrowing process is particularly useful.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The spatial synthesis problem addressed in this paper is the configuration of rectangles in 2D space, where the sides of the rectangles are parallel to an orthogonal coordinate system. Variables are the locations of the edges of the rectangles and their orientations. Algebraic constraints on these variables define a layout and constitute a constraint satisfaction problem. We give a new O ( n 2 ) algorithm for incremental path-consistency, which is applied after adding each algebraic constraint. Problem requirements are formulated as spatial relations between the rectangles, for example, adjacency, minimum distance, and nonoverlap. Spatial relations are expressed by Boolean combinations of the algebraic constraints; called disjunctive constraints. Solutions are generated by backtracking search, which selects a disjunctive constraint and instantiates its disjuncts. The selected disjuncts describe an equivalence class of configurations that is a significantly different solution. This method generates the set of significantly different solutions that satisfy all the requirements. The order of instantiating disjunctive constraints is critical for search efficiency. It is determined dynamically at each search state, using functions of heuristic measures called textures. Textures implement fail-first and prune-early strategies. Extensions to the model, that is, 3D configurations, configurations of nonrectangular shapes, constraint relaxation, optimization, and adding new rectangles during search are discussed.",

It shows that many of the currently proposed schemes for selecting network architecture for such nets are deficient. It demonstrates in numerous examples that overdetermined neural networks tend to give good approximations over a region of interest, while underdetermined networks give approximations which can satisfy the training pairs but may give poor approximations over that region of interest. A scheme is presented that adjusts the number of hidden layer nodes in a neural network so as to give an overdetermined approximation. The advantages and disadvantages of using multiple output nodes are discussed. Guidelines for selecting the number of output nodes are presented.",

    "abstract": "A fixed set of components with a fixed set of properties is often regarded as a defining characteristic of configuration design problems. In configuration design for larger and more complex systems (e.g., street cars), however, this often is not really true. The reason is that sometimes the component library offers no component that meets the actual requirements, so that a new component has to be added to the library. In general, configuration design for larger products must be interactive: interactive in the sense that the user controls the configuration process and in the sense that the phases of knowledge acquisition and configuration are partly mixed. This paper describes a method and a corresponding software tool (SyDeR, System Design for Reusability) that support the interactive configuration design of complex products, especially in the tendering phase. It combines three different technologies: [bull ] structural modeling of technical systems; [bull ] a library for technical solutions, which is based upon taxonomies and allows the reuse of the technical solutions; [bull ] constraint techniques to propagate design decisions and check designs for consistency to support interactive configuration design. This paper gives an overview of the functionality of the SyDeR tool and describes the main ideas behind the modeling language, which is especially oriented towards the requirements of system design problems. It also explains how we integrated structural modeling, taxonomies, and advanced constraint reasoning techniques into real-world applications.",

We first analyze the CBR process to abstract the steps involved in the development of a CBR system.

The salient features of this framework, called CASETOOL (CASE-based reasoning TOOL-kit), are then described. The highlight of this approach is the use of a concept called design criticism in the CBR process.

    "abstract": "The problem addressed in this paper is that design decisions can have a propagation effect spanning multiple life-phases influencing life-cycle metrics such as cost, time, and quality. It introduces a computational framework of a “Knowledge of life-cycle Consequences (KC) approach” aimed at allowing designers to foresee and explore effectively unintended, solution specific life-cycle consequences (LCCs) during solution synthesis. The paper presents a phenomena model describing how LCCs are generated from two fundamentally different conditions: noninteracting and interacting synthesis decision commitments. Based on this understanding, the KC approach framework has been developed and implemented as a Knowledge-Intensive CAD (KICAD) tool named FORESEE. The framework consists of three frames: an artefact life modelling frame, an operational frame, and an LCC knowledge modelling frame. This paper focuses on the knowledge modelling frame, composed basically of synthesis elements, consequence inference knowledge, and consequence action knowledge. To evaluate the influence of design decision consequences on artefact life-phases, cost, time and quality performance measures are used within the frame. Using these metrics, the life-cycle implications of a decision can be instantly updated and fully appreciated. An evaluation of the approach was carried out by applying FORESEE to thermoplastic component design. The results provide a degree of evidence that the approach integrates the activity of component design synthesis with the activity of foreseeing artefact life issues including fluctuations in life-cycle metrics. This makes the approach fundamentally different from the conventional approach in which first a candidate design solution is generated and then, at a penalty of extra time, an analysis of the solution for conflicts with artefact life issues is carried out. The framework thus provides a significant step towards the realization of a “Design Synthesis for Multi-X” approach to component design, although further work is required to exploit practically its utilization.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes a new method for generating the turning-gait of a six-legged robot using a combined genetic algorithm (GA)-Fuzzy approach. The main drawback of the traditional methods of gait generation is their high computational load. Thus, there is still a need for the development of a computationally tractable algorithm that can be implemented online to generate stable gait of a multilegged robot. In the proposed genetic-fuzzy system, the fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs) are used to generate the stable gait of a hexapod and a GA is used to improve the performance of the FLCs. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is tested on a number of turning-gait generation problems of a hexapod that involve translation as well as rotation of the vehicle. The hexapod will have to take a sharp circular turn (either clockwise or counter-clockwise) with minimum number of ground legs having the maximum average kinematic margin. Moreover, the stability margin should lie within a certain range to ensure static stability of the vehicle. Each leg of a six-legged robot is controlled by a separate FLC and the performance of the controllers is improved by using a GA. It is to be noted that the actual optimization is done off-line and the hexapod can use these optimized FLCs to navigate in real-world scenarios. As an FLC is computationally less expensive, the proposed algorithm will be faster compared with the traditional methods of gait-generation, which include both graphical as well as analytical methods. The GA-tuned FLCs are found to perform better than the author-defined FLCs.",

The focus for the constraint satisfaction problem is derived from an effort to support spatial layout generation in a conceptual design framework. The constraint specification allows a high-level representation and manipulation of qualitative geometric information. We present a computational technique based on ATeams to instantiate solutions to the constraint satisfaction problem. The technique uses a search for a solution in numerical space. This permits us to handle both qualitative relationships and numerical constraints in a unified framework. We show that simple knowledge, about human spatial reasoning and about the nature of arithmetic operators can be hierarchically encapsulated and exploited efficiently in the search. An example illustrates the generality of the approach for conceptual design. We also present empirical studies that contrast the efficiency of ATeams with a search based on genetic algorithms. Based on these preliminary results, we argue that the ATeams approach elegantly handles arbitrary sets of constraints, is computationally efficient, and hence merits further investigation.",

    "abstract": "The current paper describes the Multidisciplinary Combinatorial Approach (MCA), the idea of which is to develop discrete mathematical representations, called “Combinatorial Representations” (CR) and to represent with them various engineering systems. During the research, the properties and methods embedded in each representation and the connections between them were investigated thoroughly, after which they were associated with various engineering systems to solve related engineering problems. The CR developed up until now are based on graph theory, matroid theory, and discrete linear programming, whereas the current paper employs only the first two. The approach opens up new ways of working with representations, reasoning and design, some of which are reported in the paper, as follows: 1) Integrated multidisciplinary representation—systems which contain interrelating elements from different disciplines are represented by the same CR. Consequently, a uniform analysis process is performed on the representation, and thus on the whole system, irrespective of the specific disciplines, to which the elements belong. 2) Deriving known methods and theorems—new proofs to known methods and theorems are derived in a new way, this time on the basis of the combinatorial theorems embedded in the CR. This enables development of a meta-representation for engineering as a whole, through which the engineering reasoning becomes convenient. In the current paper, this issue is illustrated on structural analysis. 3) Deriving novel connections between remote fields—new connections are derived on the basis of the relations between the different combinatorial representations. An innovative connection between mechanisms and trusses, shown in the paper, has been derived on the basis of the mutual dualism between their corresponding CR. This new connection alone has opened several new avenues of research, since knowledge and algorithms from machine theory are now available for use in structural analysis and vice versa. Furthermore, it has opened opportunities for developing new design methods, in which, for instance, structures with special properties are developed on the basis of known mechanisms with special properties, as demonstrated in this paper. Conversely, one can use these techniques to develop special mechanisms from known trusses.",

Assemblability analysis and evaluation play a key role in assembly design, assembly operation analysis and assembly planning. This paper develops a novel approach to assemblability and assembly sequence analysis and evaluation using the concept of the fuzzy set theory and neuro-fuzzy integration. Assemblability is described by assembly-operation difficulty, which can be represented by a fuzzy number between 0 and 1. Assemblability evaluation is therefore fuzzy evaluation of assembly difficulty. The evaluation structure covers not only the assembly parts' geometric and physical characteristics, but also takes into account the assembly operation data necessary to assemble the parts. The weight of each assemblability factor is subject to change to match the real assembly environments based on expert advice. The approach has the flexibility to be used in various assembly methods and different environments. It can be used in a knowledge-based design for assembly expert system with learning ability. Through integration with the CAD system, the developed system can effectively incorporate the concurrent engineering knowledge into the preliminary design process so as to provide users with suggestions for improving a design and also helping to obtain better design ideas.

A new unified class of object-oriented knowledge Petri nets, which can incorporate a knowledge-based system with ordinary Petri nets, is defined and used for the unified representations of assembly design and modeling. The object knowledge Petri nets, as a graphical language and a new knowledge-based description scheme, can be used to express the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the assembly design and modeling process in an interactive and integrated way. The four-level hierarchy model is proposed and constructed in terms of function-behaviors, structures, geometries, and features. The function-behavior-structure description is built on more abstract concepts so that it can match well top-down design. The static and dynamic characteristics in the design of assembly can also be captured. With the help of fuzzy logic, the incomplete, imprecise knowledge and uncertainty in the design process can also be dealt with. Therefore, the hybrid design object model can incorporate product data model, top-down design process, and assembly process model using an object-oriented, knowledge-based, feature-based, parametric, and constraint-based modeling approach, and can provide a more accurate and more flexible representation. To verify and demonstrate the effective use of the proposed hybrid design object model, a prototype system has been developed.

    "abstract": "Some designs are sufficiently creative that they are considered to be inventions. The invention process is typically characterized by a singular moment when the prevailing thinking concerning a long-standing problem is, in a “flash of genius,” overthrown and replaced by a new approach that could not have been logically deduced from what was previously known. This paper discusses such logical discontinuities using an example based on the history of one of the most important inventions of the 20th century in electrical engineering, namely, the invention of negative feedback by AT&amp;T's Harold S. Black. This 1927 invention overthrew the then prevailing idiom of positive feedback championed by Westinghouse's Edwin Howard Armstrong. The paper then shows how this historically important discovery can be readily replicated by an automated design and invention technique patterned after the evolutionary process in nature, namely, genetic programming. Genetic programming employs Darwinian natural selection along with analogs of recombination (crossover), mutation, gene duplication, gene deletion, and mechanisms of developmental biology to breed an ever improving population of structures. Genetic programming rediscovers negative feedback by conducting an evolutionary search for a structure that satisfies Black's stated high-level goal (i.e., reduction of distortion in amplifiers). Like evolution in nature, genetic programming conducts its search probabilistically without resort to logic using a process that is replete with logical discontinuities. The paper then shows that genetic programming can routinely produce many additional inventive and creative results. In this regard, the paper discusses the automated rediscovery of numerous 20th-century patented inventions involving analog electrical circuits and controllers, the Sallen–Key filter, and six 21st-century patented inventions. In addition, two patentable new inventions (controllers) have been created in the same automated way by means of genetic programming. The paper discusses the promising future of automated invention by means of genetic programming in light of the fact that, to date, increased computer power has yielded progressively more substantial results, including numerous human-competitive results, in synchrony with Moore's law. The paper argues that evolutionary search by means of genetic programming is a promising approach for achieving creative, human-competitive, automated design because illogic and creativity are inherent in the evolutionary process.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a model of collective learning in design is developed in the context of team design. It explains that a team design activity uses input knowledge, environmental information, and design goals to produce output knowledge. A collective learning activity uses input knowledge from different agents and produces learned knowledge with the process of knowledge acquisition and transformation between different agents, which may be triggered by learning goals and rationale triggers. Different forms of collective learning were observed with respect to agent interactions, goal(s) of learning, and involvement of an agent. Three types of links between team design and collective learning were identified, namely teleological, rationale, and epistemic. Hypotheses of collective learning are made based upon existing theories and models in design and learning, which were tested using a protocol analysis approach. The model of collective learning in design is derived from the test results. The proposed model can be used as a basis to develop agent-based learning systems in design. In the future, collective learning between design teams, the links between collective learning and creativity, and computational support for collective learning can be investigated.",

    "abstract": "Design involves reasoning about descriptions of design artifacts, reasoning about design requirements, and reasoning about design process objectives (such as keeping to deadlines and available budget). Reasoning about these three aspects occurs during exploration, generation, and evaluation of partial design descriptions. Design space exploration involves exploration in all three related spaces: the space of partial descriptions of design artifacts, the space of design requirements, and the space of design process objectives. These spaces are vast. Explicit representation of the relations between elements in these three spaces provides the additional information needed to understand and reuse descriptions of partial design process traces, and to guide design exploration. In their Keynote Article, Woodbury and Burrow describe one of these spaces, namely, the space of design object descriptions, as a network of partial and intentional descriptions of design artifacts. The links between partial descriptions represent paths in design processes. Making the information compiled in these paths of exploration explicit, as proposed in this paper, extends the approach described by Woodbury and Burrow, increasing options for accessibility.",

This paper presents a systematic method that decomposes product geometry at an early stage of design, selects joint types, and generates subassembly partitioning to achieve the adjustment of the critical dimensions during assembly processes. A genetic algorithm generates candidate assemblies based on a joint library specific for an application domain.

    "abstract": "Abstract Problem solving methods (PSMs) are software components that represent and encode reusable algorithms. They can be combined with representations of domain knowledge to produce intelligent application systems. A goal of research on PSMs is to provide principled methods and tools for composing and reusing algorithms in knowledge-based systems. The ultimate objective is to produce libraries of methods that can be easily adapted for use in these systems. Despite the intuitive appeal of PSMs as conceptual building blocks, in practice, these goals are largely unmet. There are no widely available tools for building applications using PSMs and no public libraries of PSMs available for reuse. This paper analyzes some of the reasons for the lack of widespread adoptions of PSM techniques and illustrate our analysis by describing our experiences developing a complex, high-throughput software system based on PSM principles. We conclude that many fundamental principles in PSM research are useful for building knowledge-based systems. In particular, the task–method decomposition process, which provides a means for structuring knowledge-based tasks, is a powerful abstraction for building systems of analytic methods. However, despite the power of PSMs in the conceptual modeling of knowledge-based systems, software engineering challenges have been seriously underestimated. The complexity of integrating control knowledge modeled by developers using PSMs with the domain knowledge that they model using ontologies creates a barrier to widespread use of PSM-based systems. Nevertheless, the surge of recent interest in ontologies has led to the production of comprehensive domain ontologies and of robust ontology-authoring tools. These developments present new opportunities to leverage the PSM approach.",

Existing research shows that design tools either require high levels of knowledge engineering or large databases of training cases. To address these limitations, we present a singular value decomposition (SVD) and unsupervised clustering-based method that performs design reformulation by acquiring semantic knowledge from the syntax of design representations. The development of the method was analogically inspired by applications of SVD in statistical natural language processing and digital image processing. We demonstrate our method on an analytically formulated hydraulic cylinder design problem and an aeroengine design problem formulated using a nonanalytic design structure matrix form. Our results show that the method automates various design reformulation tasks on problems of varying sizes from different design domains, stated in analytic and nonanalytic representational forms. The behavior of the method presents observations that cannot be explained by pure symbolic AI approaches, including uncovering patterns of implicit knowledge that are not readily encoded as logical rules, and automating tasks that require the associative transformation of sets of inputs to experiences. As an explanation, we relate the structure and performance of our algorithm with findings in cognitive neuroscience, and present a set of theoretical postulates addressing an alternate perspective on how symbols may interact with each other in experiences to reify semantic knowledge in design representations.",

This article describes an experiment that sought to provide greater insight into the impact that resources can have on how decision making is executed. Investigated variables included the experience levels of decision makers and the quality and availability of information resources. The experiment provided insights into the variety of impacts that resources can have upon decision making, manifested through the evolution of the approaches, methods, and processes used within it. The findings illustrated that there could be an impact on the decision-making process but not on the method or approach, the method and process but not the approach, or the approach, method, and process. In addition, resources were observed to have multiple impacts, which can emerge in different timescales. Given these findings, research is suggested into the development of resource-impact models that would describe the relationships existing between the decision-making activity and resources, together with the development of techniques for reasoning using these models. This would enhance the development of systems that could offer improved levels of decision support through managing the impact of resources on decision making.",

Through data clustering, the relevant factors are identified as a result of plan change, and critical equipment health management is carried out through data-driven anomaly detection. A case study is implemented, and the result shows that the proposed data-driven method is able to reschedule the shipbuilding plans smoothly.",

This tool is oriented for the exploration of design alternatives in the early concept phase of the chair design process. This work addresses two shortcomings within the research area of shape grammars (SGs), namely, the lack of implementation of SGs applied to design domains, and the lack of practical applications in real-life design scenarios. To address these problems, a methodology is proposed for the implementation of a SG (more specifically, a set grammar) into a tool, comprising the translation of the grammar into user-interface elements oriented for design practitioners. By using the proposed tool, the user can add/delete chair components and edit shape parameters, while visualizing the effects on a three-dimensional digital model presented in a variety of CAD applications. Compared with other SG implementations, ChairDNA uses an approach that keeps under control the combinatorial explosion of rule applications, which simplifies the use of the tool by designers that do not have experience in SGs. The generative potential of the tool is demonstrated by generating chairs of different types, and its usability and utility in aiding the designer are evaluated by design students and design practitioners.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Manufacturing knowledge is maintained primarily in the unstructured text in industry. To facilitate the reuse of the knowledge, previous efforts have utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify manufacturing documents or to extract structured knowledge (e.g. ontology) from manufacturing text. On the other hand, extracting more complex knowledge, such as manufacturing rule, has not been feasible in a practical scenario, as standard NLP techniques cannot address the input text that needs validation. Specifically, if the input text contains the information irrelevant to the rule-definition or semantically invalid expression, standard NLP techniques cannot selectively derive precise information for the extraction of the desired formal manufacturing rule. To address the gap, we developed the feedback generation method based on Constraint-based Modeling (CBM) coupled with NLP and domain ontology, designed to support formal manufacturing rule extraction. Specifically, the developed method identifies the necessity of input text validation based on the predefined constraints and provides the relevant feedback to help the user modify the input text, so that the desired rule can be extracted. We proved the feasibility of the method by extending the previously implemented formal rule extraction framework. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by enabling the extraction of correct manufacturing rules from all the cases that need input text validation, about 30% of the dataset, after modifying the input text based on the feedback. We expect the feedback generation method will contribute to the adoption of semantics-based technology in the manufacturing field, by facilitating precise knowledge acquisition from manufacturing-related documents in a practical scenario.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Architectural spatial design is a wicked problem that can have a multitude of solutions for any given brief. The information needed to resolve architectural design problems is often not readily available during the early conceptual stages, requiring proposals to be evaluated only after an initial solution is reached. This “solution-driven” design approach focuses on the generation of designs as a means to explore the solution space. Generative design can be achieved computationally through parametric and algorithmic processes. However, utilizing a large repertoire of organiational patterns and design precedent knowledge together with the precise criteria of spatial evaluation can present design challenges even to an experienced architect. In the implementation of a parametric design process lies an opportunity to supplement the designer's knowledge with computational decision support that provides real-time spatial feedback during conceptual design. This paper presents an approach based on a generative multiperformance framework, configured for generating and optimizing architectural designs based on a precedent design. The system is constructed using a parametric modeling environment enabling the capture of precedent designs, extraction of spatial analytics, and demonstration of how populations can be used to drive the generation and optimization of alternate spatial solutions. A pilot study implementing the complete workflow of the system is used to illustrate the benefits of coupling parametric modeling with structured precedent analysis and design generation.",

Only limited focus has been placed on potential use for qualitative and quantitative reasoning and analysis of the design concept. This potential for early stage analysis has not been fully explored partly because computational reasoning tools have not been developed for this express purpose. This paper presents a set of requirements and their justification to realize this design enabling tool. The requirements include coverage, consistency, validity against physics laws, domain neutrality, physics-based definitions, normative and descriptive modeling, and qualitative and quantitative modeling and reasoning. Each requirement is defined in concrete terms and illustrated with examples and logic. With the requirements for function-based reasoning and representation clearly identified, future research toward formalizing of function-based design will be more focused and objective validation of proposed representations against these requirements would be possible.",

    "abstract": "Abstract One challenge in building collaborative design tools that use speech and sketch input is distinguishing gesture pen strokes from those representing device structure, that is, object strokes. In previous work, we developed a gesture/object classifier that uses features computed from the pen strokes and the speech aligned with them. Experiments indicated that the speech features were the most important for distinguishing gestures, thus indicating the critical importance of the speech–sketch alignment. Consequently, we have developed a new alignment technique that employs a two-step process: the speech is first explicitly segmented (primarily into clauses), then the segments are aligned with the pen strokes. Our speech segmentation step is unique in that it uses sketch features for locating segment boundaries in multimodal dialog. In addition, it uses a single classifier to directly combine word-based, prosodic (pause), and sketch-based features. In the second step, segments are initially aligned with strokes based on temporal correlation, and then classifiers are used to detect and correct two common alignment errors. Our two-step technique has proven to be substantially more accurate at alignment than the existing technique that lacked explicit segmentation. It is more important that, for nearly all cases, our new technique results in greater gesture classification accuracy than the existing technique, and performed nearly as well as the benchmark manual speech–sketch alignment.",

These methods use the high-dimensional model representation concept for variance decomposition that presents a unique model representation when inputs are uncorrelated. However, when the inputs are correlated, multiple model representations may be possible leading to ambiguous sensitivity ranking with Sobol indices. In this work, we present the effect of input correlation on sensitivity analysis and discuss the methods presented by Li and Rabitz in the context of Kennedy and O'Hagan's framework with Gaussian processes.

We found that participants from both groups used precise and vague expressions in their verbalizations and used a median of three parameters in their verbalizations.

    "abstract": "Abstract The ability to successfully conduct radical innovations is mandatory for mature industrial companies that want to remain competitive in the global market. This ability relies on several ingredients, namely: (1) the structuring of the innovation process; (2) managerial principles; (3) methodological tools; (4) the presence of a culture of innovation. This paper reports about the impact of applying the User eXperience-Fuzzy Front End (UX-FFE) model, which brings together the systemic innovation process with the social, economical, and methodological aspects on the outcomes of the innovation process. Firstly, it appears that the operational performance of the upstream innovation process relies on the quality of the social context, intrinsic to the group of co-creators, corresponding to the reported perceived experience. Secondly, the UX-FFE model application, therefore, allows optimizing the upstream innovation process performance. Indeed, we argue that the evaluation of the co-creators perceived experience brings new opportunities to optimize the operational performance of the upstream innovation process. The first part of this paper presents deeper a theoretical model, named UX-FFE, which combines a UX approach with an upstream innovation process (FFE). The main interest of this UX-FFE model is that it allows evaluating the social aspect of the upstream innovation process, which may be detrimental to the success of radical innovation projects in mature companies. The second part presents the results of previous experiments that validated the model. The results allow the design of an instrument dedicated to the evaluation of the user experience of co-creators in the ideation stage. Finally, the third part reports about the experimentation of the UX-FFE in a mature company. Results present the impact of the co-creators' experience on the performance of radical innovation projects.",

Leisure activities are associated with reducing the risk of dementia and are preventive policies for delaying the cognitive impairment in later stages of those neurodegenerative diseases. Electronic games related to cognitive abilities are an easy and inexpensive alternative for stimulating brain activity in this kind of patients. The previous research demonstrated the acceptance of these activities in the environment of Connected TV when playing at home and in daily care centers. Interaction in Connected TV applications has its own particularities that influence the design of the interface, including the viewing distance, the type of interaction through a remote control or other techniques, the size of the screen, or the collectiveness of consumption. Iterative testing with patients of these groups revealed how the physical characteristics and cognitive impairment of these concrete end-users affect the human–computer interaction, offering guidelines and recommendations in good practices for the Smart TV interface design. On the other hand, data analytics extracted from the interaction and evolution of the game offer important information enabling the creation of estimation prediction models about the cognitive state of the patient.",

Modeler enables designers to create customizable designs as parametric models, and Navigator subsequently permits novice end-users to explore these designs. While most parametric designs support direct manipulation of low-level features, we propose interpolation features to give customers more flexibility. In this paper, we focus on the implementation of such interpolation features into Navigator and its user interface. To assess our approach, we designed and performed user experiments to test and compare Modeler and Navigator, thus providing insights for further developments of our approach. Our results suggest that barycentric interpolation between qualitative parameters provides a more easily understandable interface that empowers novice customers to explore the design space expeditiously.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Design is a decision-making process for which knowledge is a prerequisite. Most decisions are taken at the conceptual stage and have pronounced influence on the final design. The literature, therefore, recommends the incorporation of sustainability criteria, such as environment, at this stage. Difficulty in performing life cycle assessment (LCA) due to low availability of information at the conceptual stage for evaluation and highly abstract nature of solutions, inadequate incorporation of DfE (Design for Environment) guidelines and LCA reports into the design process, and a lack of effective communication of the same to the designers for prompt decision-making are major motivations for the development of a support. This paper discusses a “ concep tual T ool for e nvironmentally benign design” – concepTe – that supports designers in decision-making during the conceptual design stage, by offering environmental impact (EI) estimates of abstract solutions with associated uncertainty, for evaluation and selection of the most environmentally benign solution as concept. The EI estimates are calculated by a module in the tool based on a proposed EI estimation method, which requires the support of a knowledge base to fetch appropriate LCA information corresponding to the design element being conceptualized. This knowledge base is grounded in the domain-agnostic SAPPhIRE model ontology, allows semantic operability of the knowledge, and offers the results to the designers in a familiar domain language to aid decision-making. A “proof of concept” of the tool is developed for application in design of building in the AEC (Architectural design, Engineering, and Construction) domain. Further, empirical studies are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the “proof of concept” to support decision-making and results are found favorable. The paper also discusses the future scope for further development of the tool into a holistic design decision-making platform.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Industry 4.0 represents high-level methodologies for the development of new generation manufacturing metrology systems, which are more intelligent (smart), autonomous, flexible, high-productive, and self-adaptable. One of the systems capable of responding to these challenges is a cyber-physical manufacturing metrology system (CP2MS) with techniques of artificial intelligence (AI). In general, CP2MS systems generate Big data, horizontally by integration [coordinate measuring machines (CMMs)] and vertically by control. This paper presents a cyber-physical manufacturing metrology model (CP3M) for Industry 4.0 developed by applying AI techniques such as engineering ontology (EO), ant-colony optimization (ACO), and genetic algorithms (GAs). Particularly, the CP3M presents an intelligent approach of probe configuration and setup planning for inspection of prismatic measurement parts (PMPs) on a CMM. A set of possible PMP setups and probe configurations is reduced to optimal number using developed GA-based methodology. The major novelty is the development of a new CP3M capable of responding to the requirements of an Industry 4.0 concept such as intelligent, autonomous, and productive measuring systems. As such, they respond to one smart metrology requirement within the framework of Industry 4.0, referring to the optimal number of PMPs setups and for each setup defines the configurations of probes. The main contribution of the model is productivity increase of the measuring process through the reduction of the total measurement time, as well as the elimination of errors due to the human factor through intelligent planning of probe configuration and part setup. The experiment was successfully performed using a PMP specially designed and manufactured for the purpose.",

The general form of such statements is that “the function of S is R ,” where S is the functioning system and R is the functional role it plays. However, such statements do not represent how that single function was selected from many possible alternatives. This article renders those alternatives explicit by revealing the other possible function statements that might be made when either S or R is being considered. In particular, two forms of selection are emphasized. First, when we say “the function of S is R ,” there are typically many systems other than S that are required to be in operation for that role to be fulfilled. The functioning system, S , does not perform the role, R , all by itself, and those systems that support S in performing that role might also have been considered as functioning. Second, when we say, “the function of S is R ,” there are typically many other roles that S plays apart from R , and those other roles might also have been considered functional. When we make function assignments, we select both the functioning system, S , and the functional role, R , from a range of alternatives. To emphasize these alternatives, this article develops a diagrammatic representation of multiple systems playing multiple roles in multiple supersystems.",

For instance, web analytics studies the intersection between society and the Internet to better understand use patterns and preferences. Business analytics studies the interfaces between human capital and technical systems in the context of corporate management and industrial production. Engineering design is ripe with such sociotechnical systems where consumers and engineered systems intersect producing a complex sociotechnical system marked by difficult to predict behavior and trends. In this paper, the paradigm of design analytics is further developed and used to study a diverse sociotechnical product. The product is a refrigerator that is hypothetically equipped with sensors and feedback mechanisms, and a simulator models the interactions of a population of 1000 users. Analyzing this sociotechnical product using design analytics demonstrates the ability to extract valuable insights at the juncture of people and technology. Insights into the leading behaviors of different populations are presented, and it is shown that design analytics and the associated tools can provide a platform for designers to develop better performing products that meet both explicit and implicit customer needs.",

Each user has a unique set of human factors, preferences, personal knowledge, and solution constraints that could potentially influence the characteristics of the artifact. Currently, there is little work supporting the process of how to formally generate user-specific design specifications, resulting in ad hoc or a priori decisions when generating design specifications. Further, because most design processes generate design specifications manually, the number of design specifications is not typically addressed at the user level. This research presents an affordance-based approach for use in the early stages of design to help designers establish user-specific design specifications. This information can then be used in the creation of a system or set of systems that meets the demands of both the user(s) and the organization that is developing the artifact. An affordance-based approach is leveraged because it maintains the relational field of view among the user, existing artifacts, and the artifact(s) being designed. Once individual design specifications are generated, designers can use this information in later stages of the design process.",

We organized an industrial workshop with the objective of choosing 5 out of 800 architectures. The first step, the identification of selection criteria, proved to be the greatest challenge. As a result, designers selected system architectures that did not satisfy them without being able to explain why. It appeared that most of the difficulties faced by the designers came from the criteria used for architecture selection. This study aims to identify what made the selection criteria difficult to use. The audio recordings of the workshop were transcribed and analyzed in order to identify the obstacles related to the definition and the use of selection criteria. The analysis highlights two issues: the interdisciplinarity of system architecture makes criteria interdependent and the lack of information makes it impossible to define an exhaustive set of criteria. Finally, this study provides recommendations for selecting appropriate selection criteria and insights for future selection support tools dedicated to system architecture design.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Maintenance optimization is a process for improving the efficiency of maintenance strategies and activities, considering various aspects of the target system and components, such as the probabilities of system failures and the cost of repair and replacement of a failed component. The improvement of maintenance optimization algorithms generally requires information from various data sources. For example, it may require the system risk information derived from risk analysis tools or the residual lifetime of a component from fault prognosis tools. The requirements of data acquisition (DAQ) and aggregation pose new challenges for maintenance management systems (MMSs) that implement and use these maintenance optimization algorithms. This paper proposes a multiple aspects maintenance ontology-based framework to facilitate DAQ from MMSs, online monitoring systems, fault detection and discrimination tools, risk assessment tools, decision-making tools, and component identification tools, and accelerate the implementation and verification of contemporary maintenance optimization models and algorithms. The proposed framework consists of a multi-aspect maintenance ontology with critical information for maintenance optimization and application interfaces for collecting information from various data sources, such as fault prognosis tools, online monitoring tools, risk assessment tools, and decision-making algorithms. In addition, this paper proposes a heuristic method for integrating concepts and properties from other existing ontologies into the proposed framework when the existing ontology is not fully compatible with the ontology under construction. Finally, the paper verifies the proposed ontology framework using a feedwater system designed for nuclear power plants with valves and filters as the components under maintenance.",

A systematic AHML approach was deployed to scan the human wrist distal end optimally using a portable SENSE 2.0 3D scanner. A central composite design (CCD) matrix was developed for three input variables; light intensity (LI = 12–20 W/m 2 ), capture angle (CA = 10°–50°), and scanning distance (SD = 10–20 inches) for executing the experimental runs. For accuracy evaluation, the wrist perimeter on the distal end was checked using CREO Parametric software for wrist perimeter error (WPE). Various AHML tools were developed using: response surface methodology (RSM), multi-objective genetic algorithm RSM, and multi-objective genetic algorithm neural networking (MOGANN). The optimal process parameters recommended by the hybrid tools were experimentally validated for their prediction accuracy. The MOGANN approach combined with the Bayesian regularization algorithm (trainabr) provided the best mutual combination of optimal ST = 20.072 sec and WPE = 0.375 cm corresponding to LI = 12.001 W/m 2 , CA = 29.428°, and SD = 18.214 inch, with a significant percentage reduction of 55.83% in WPE. Executing 3D scanning of the human wrist over the optimized process parameters predicted by AHML tools will ensure the availability of precise scans for the rapid prototyping of customized orthotic devices in a reliable manner.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Face milling is performed on aluminum alloy A96061-T6 at diverse cutting parameters proposed by the design of experiments. Surface roughness is predicted by examining the effects of cutting parameters (CP), vibrations (Vib), and sound characteristics (SC). Sound characteristics based on surface roughness estimation determine the rarity of the work. In this study, a unique ANN-TLBO hybrid model (Artificial Neural Networks: Teaching Learning Based Algorithm) is created to predict the surface roughness from CP, Vib, and SC. To ascertain their correctness and efficacy in evaluating surface roughness, the performance of these models is evaluated. First off, the CP hybrid model demonstrated an amazing accuracy of 95.1%, demonstrating its capacity to offer trustworthy forecasts of surface roughness values. The Vib hybrid model, in addition, demonstrated a respectable accuracy of 85.4%. Although it was not as accurate as the CP model, it nevertheless showed promise in forecasting surface roughness. The SC-based hybrid model outperformed the other two models in terms of accuracy with a remarkable accuracy of 96.2%, making it the most trustworthy and efficient technique for assessing surface roughness in this investigation. An analysis of error percentages revealed the exceptional performance of SC-based Model-3, exhibiting an average error percentage of 3.77%. This outperformed Vib Model-2 (14.52%) and CP-based Model-1 (4.75%). The SC model is the best option, and given its outstanding accuracy, it may end up becoming the go-to technique for industrial applications needing accurate surface roughness measurement. The SC model’s exceptional performance highlights the importance of optimization strategies in improving the prediction capacities of ANN-based models, leading to significant advancements in the field of surface roughness assessment and related fields. An IoT platform is developed to link the model’s output with other systems. The system created eliminates the need for manual, physical surface roughness measurement and allows for the display of surface roughness data on the cloud and other platforms.",

To achieve this effectively for cyber-physical systems (CPS), it is necessary to possess specialized expertise in technical products, innovation processes, and data analytics. An understanding of the process from domain knowledge to data analysis is of critical importance for the successful completion of projects, even for those without expertise in these areas. In this paper, we set out the foundation for a toolbox for data analytics, which will enable the creation of domain-specific pipelines for product planning. The toolbox includes a morphological box that covers the necessary pipeline components, based on a thorough analysis of literature and practitioner surveys. This comprehensive overview is unique. The toolbox based on it promises to support and enable domain experts and citizen data scientists, enhancing efficiency in product design, speeding up time to market, and shortening innovation cycles.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes a generic approach to guiding designers when making decisions during the early stages of design. The objective of the research is to enable designers to foresee unintended life-cycle consequences during mechanical component design. Engineering design is a process of evolving solutions to a design problem through the commitment of decisions. As a designer commits a new design decision, a more concrete design solution is generated. Decisions made can have intended and unintended consequences on the performance of the life phase activities that follow, such as manufacturing, assembly, and disposal. Many existing tools only consider the impact of the design solution on later life-cycle phases when the solution is almost complete. This makes changes expensive and difficult. This paper presents a novel approach to how consequences encountered in down stream life-cycle phases can be brought to the designer's attention early in generation of component form. For this purpose, a knowledge model has been derived from a phenomena model. The phenomena model describes how life-cycle consequences are generated during component synthesis. An insight into the representation of the resultant knowledge model is discussed through examples. The implementation of a prototype Knowledge Intensive CAD tool, entitled FORESEE, aimed at supporting life-oriented, feature-based component synthesis and exploration, is also described. The results of the evaluation of FORESEE with a range of designers show that by using the system designers are motivated to explore alternative design solutions and are able to make more informed design decisions. This highlights that the knowledge structure provides a base for extending feature-based component design to a ‘Design Synthesis for Multi-X’ approach.",

The backpropagation learning algorithm is implemented by a supervised training technique to deal with the problem of remeshing structural elements in a structural analysis. A recent study introduced a structural remeshing that incorporated a finite-element analysis with an adaptive mesh generation technique. The main objective of the study is to demonstrate how neural networks can be employed to remesh structural elements without using numerically intensive computations. One essential requirement of this approach is the selection of feasible and appropriate training and testing data. The exploration of neural network in remeshing structural elements is a fundamental technique that looks beyond the finite-element and adaptive mesh generation techniques. It also demonstrates the capability of neural network to represent n -dimensional space and track each individual characteristic in that separate space. In general, an overview is presented, and the potential of neural networks to use the backpropagation algorithm instead of the more conventional approach of numerical methods is demonstrated.",

The architecture is based on an integration of design and CAD with some of the more well known concepts in case-based reasoning (CBR). DEJAVU provides a flexible and cognitively intuitive approach for acquiring and utilizing design knowledge. It is a domain independent mechanical design shell that can incrementally acquire design knowledge in the domain of the user. DEJAVU provides a design environment that can learn from the designer(s) until it can begin to perform design tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. The main components of DEJAVU are a knowledge base of design plans, an evaluation module in the form of a design plan system, and a blackboard-based adaptation module. The existance of these components are derived from the utilization of a CBR architecture. DEJAVU is the first step in developing a robust designer's assistant shell for mechanical design problems. One of the major contributions of DEJAVU is the development of a clean architecture for the utilization of case-based reasoning in a mechanical designer's assistant shell.

To this end, a hierarchical weight manipulation approach is introduced which creates and successively refines a fused output. The performance of the fusion tool is evaluated throughout its design. This allows impact assessment of adding heuristics and enables early tuning of parameters.

Generally, this plan is constructed by a team of designers with different tasks, but sharing a common objective, that is, to create a high-quality, low-cost integrated artifact. Active Design Documents (ADDs) are powerful tools for cooperative design because they account for revealing the rationale among design participants while assisting each of them in their own. Design rationale capture and retrieval are critical issues on building documentation assistant tools. In this paper, we propose to achieve more efficient and effective delivery of design and designers intent by resorting to rhetorical means. The wealth of knowledge kept in ADD’s knowledge bases is organized into high-level Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) schema and mapped onto input and output screen configurations that gear the interaction between systems and users. We illustrate the effects of such an organization with evidences from an implemented version of ADD for the domain of offshore platform.",

GAs are a means of effectively searching that state space which is defined by the length of the genotype's bit string. Of particular interest in design computing are processes that enlarge that state space to change the set of possible designs. This paper presents one such process based on the generalization of the genetic crossover operation. A crossover operation of genetic algorithms is reinterpreted as a random sampling of interpolating phenotypes, produced by a particular case of phenotypic interpolation. Its generalization is constructed by using a more general version of interpolation and/or by adding extrapolation to interpolation. This generalized crossover has a potential to move the current population outside of the original state space. An adaptive strategy for state space enlargement, which is based on this generalization, is designed. This strategy can be used for computational support of creative designing. An example is given.",

    "abstract": "Conceptual design produces a number of functions the designed product is to fulfill, several solution principles (means) for each function, and multiple overall principle solutions (concepts). Besides concept synthesis, it is important to determine the (few) early solution properties that are of interest at the concept stage. Further activities are assessing the consequences of the chosen means and their instantiation, the effects of changes, and how decisions affect other elements. Using a quantitative functional representation can facilitate these tasks, but a balance is needed between product-dependent tools predicting many detailed properties, and product-independent, generally applicable tools with limited prediction capabilities. A balance between a closed, general set of predefined building blocks and extensibility by modeling application-specific, individual elements is also necessary. In this paper, a generally applicable conceptual design model is presented, which has been established by theoretical reasoning applied to a number of products. These products were the subjects of previous company-ordered student projects. The resulting information model spans continuously from requirements to concepts and permits modeling desired functionality (functions), achieved functionality (means and their value choices), and explicit constraints (internal and external relations between parameters of requirements, functions and means). To indicate the suitability in principle, the model has been implemented in an interactive, incremental prototype for computer support that permits modeling, storage, and reuse in a database. It can be concluded that the model permits explicit modeling of complex relations, automatic change propagation, and handling of many concept alternatives. Integrated, bidirectional, and continuous connections from requirements to concepts facilitate conceptual design, reuse, documentation of the results, and allow changes to be made and their effects assessed easily. Incremental constraint networks are approved, for example, in configuration design or geometry modelers, and the significance of this article is to enable their use also for quantitative analysis of incomplete, evolving concepts in original design tasks allowing different principle solutions, and for various products of mechanical design.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ontologies are an emerging means of knowledge representation to improve information organization and management, and they are becoming more prevalent in the domain of engineering design. The task of creating new ontologies manually is not only tedious and cumbersome but also time consuming and expensive. Research aimed at addressing these problems in creating ontologies has investigated methods of automating ontology reuse mainly by extracting smaller application ontologies from larger, more general purpose ontologies. Motivated by the wide variety of existing learning algorithms, this paper describes a new approach focused on the reuse of domain-specific ontologies. The approach integrates existing software tools for natural language processing with new algorithms for pruning concepts not relevant to the new domain and extending the pruned ontology by adding relevant concepts. The approach is assessed experimentally by automatically adapting a design rationale ontology for the software engineering domain to a new one for the related domain of engineering design. The experiment produced an ontology that exhibits comparable quality to previous attempts to automate ontology creation as measured by standard content performance metrics such as coverage, accuracy, precision, and recall. However, further analysis of the ontology suggests that the automated approach should be augmented with recommendations presented to a domain expert who monitors the pruning and extending processes in order to improve the structure of the ontology.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Configuration of large-scale applications in an engineering context requires a modeling environment that allows the design engineer to draft the configuration problem in a natural way and efficient methods that can process the modeled setting and scale with the number of components. Existing configuration methods in artificial intelligence typically perform quite well in certain subareas but are hard to use for general-purpose modeling without mathematical or logics background (the so-called knowledge acquisition bottleneck) and/or have scalability issues. As a remedy to this important issue both in theory and in practical applications, we use a standard modeling environment like the Unified Modeling Language that has been proposed by the configuration community as a suitable object-oriented formalism for configuration problems. We provide a translation of key concepts of class diagrams to inequalities and identify relevant configuration aspects and show how they are treated as an integer linear program. Solving an integer linear program can be done efficiently, and integer linear programming scales well to large configurations consisting of several thousands components and interactions. We conduct an empirical study in the context of package management for operating systems and for the Linux kernel configuration. We evaluate our methodology by a benchmark and obtain convincing results in support for using integer linear programming for configuration applications of realistic size and complexity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Change mode and effects analysis (CMEA) is a powerful technique for measuring product flexibility toward future changes and diminishing the cost of redesign as well as shortening time to market. As a systematic methodology, it provides an in-depth view for the investigation of potential changes, causes, and effects in designs, products, and processes. Traditional CMEA determines the risk priorities of change modes by using change potential number, which requires the risk factors of design flexibility, occurrence, and readiness to be precisely evaluated. However, this is not always possible in real applications due to the uncertainty and subjectivity involved in the early design stages. It has been criticized much for its deficiencies in criteria weighting of the risk factors, change potential number calculation, and risk priorities determination of the change modes. This paper presents a systematic evaluation approach for determining a more rational rank of change modes by combining with the entropy weight method, rough number, and grey relational analysis. In this study, the entropy weight method is adopted to calculate the relative importance of risk factors. Rough number is presented to aggregate individual weights and preferences, and to manipulate the vagueness in the evaluation process. Then a rough number enhanced grey relational analysis is proposed to evaluate the risk ranking of change modes. Finally, a practical example is put forward to validate the performance of the proposed method. The result shows that the proposed change mode evaluation method can effectively overcome the shortcomings of traditional CMEA and strengthen the objectivity of product flexibility measurement.",

In this study, a Systems Modeling Language extension for mechatronic system architecture modeling called ArchME is proposed. The requirements for the mechatronic System Modeling Language are analyzed, and the metamodels are defined. Then, the modeling elements are determined. Finally, the profiles based on the systems modeling language are defined to support the modeling of function, behavior, structure, and their association. This enables system designers to model the system architecture and facilitates communication between different stakeholders.

In order to promote an inventive dynamic, it implies to set up tools, habits, and an adapted environment to foster creativity. Creativity is the wealth of companies that should be valorized. To promote creativity, companies implement creativity workshops that gather people with various roles and expertise exchange and create knowledge to solve collectively open-ended engineering problems. However, group dynamics or facilitation can make the wrong decision and make the creative problem-solving unfruitful. The aim of our research project is to create a digital system to manage and valorize knowledge during creativity workshops. To design this system, we need to formalize the knowledge domain of creative workshops. The ontologies are used for decades to structure and manage information and knowledge in different domains. However, methodologies to design these ontologies are either hardly reproducible or not oriented to extract knowledge from organization. This article describes a methodology based on an organizational modeling to build ontologies. We will illustrate our approach by designing an ontology that models knowledge of creativity workshops.",

Ancient Libraries showcase a significant variability of scale, monumentality, and design with the use of different architectural components, and researchers cannot identify them as easily as other building types. The grammar is in 2D and captures all the variability of libraries from the simpler forms of the Hellenistic period to the more monumental of the Roman period, creating a vast range of designs. The paper presents the grammar-generated plans of the known libraries based on the evidence in the archaeological record. A frequency analysis of the occurrence of the rules in the derivations ranks the different characteristics of libraries and the architectural forms with which they occur in the corpus, to determine the probability of specific rules and to interpret them as mandatory or optional. The contribution of this work is that the shape grammar summarizes the design principles of ancient libraries visually and helps establish the building type of the ancient library. The frequency analysis assists tremendously in the reconstruction of fragmentarily preserved ancient libraries by providing a system in the reconstruction of the missing parts, when ambiguity is involved.",

Further, by comparing the cases to three classical user research activities, namely observation, prototyping, and user journey mapping, we highlight the main aspects of this new context of user research. We find that accessibility to makerspaces enables user researchers to build low-fidelity yet high-functionality prototypes for exploring users’ preferences and motivations in controlled and repeatable ways. These prototypes fall into the category of experience prototypes, but they have greater functionality than the prototypes previously used in this field. Thus, a user researcher can explore a topic more systematically and in a more hypothesis-driven manner. In summary, this study encourages stakeholders in the early stages of product development to consider a makerspace as a resource for user-related requirement elicitation rather than for only specific product iteration.",

Design characteristics are understood as a set of specific features which constitute a discriminant of a class of architectural forms. The Biederman recognition-by-components theory is used to recognize the design structure. An evolutionary algorithm, which serves as a generative tool, is driven by the fuzzy evaluation based on Birkhoff's aesthetic measure. Phenotypes of architectural objects are seen as configurations of Biederman's basic components essential for visual perception. Genotypes of these objects are represented by graphs with bonds, where nodes represent object components, node bonds represent component surfaces, while graph edges represent relations between surfaces. Graph evolutionary operators, that is, crossover and mutation, are defined in such a way that they preserve characteristic features seen as design requirements specified for designed objects. The fitness function is determined by the fuzzy evaluation of designs based on Birkhoff's aesthetic measure for polygons adapted for three-dimensional solids. The approach is illustrated by examples of designing objects with the use of a fuzzy evaluation mechanism, which takes into account both aesthetic criteria and the degree to which design requirements corresponding to object characteristic features are satisfied.",

The objective of this research is to evaluate the effect of physical activity versus movement in a virtual environment on the creative output of industrial design students. This study contributes a novel assessment of whether the use of virtual reality can produce the same creative output within designers as physical activity has been shown to produce in prior studies. Eighteen industrial design students at the Georgia Institute of Technology completed nine design tasks across three conditions in a within-subjects experimental design. In each condition, participants independently experienced one of three interventions. Solutions were scored for novelty and feasibility, and self-reported mood data was correlated with performance. No significant differences were found in novelty or feasibility of solutions across the conditions. However, there are statistically significant correlations between mood, interventions, and peak performance to be discussed. The results show that participants who experienced movement in virtual reality prior to problem solving performed at an equal or higher level than physical walking for all design tasks and all designer moods. This serves as motivation for continuing to study how VR can provide an impact on a designer's creative output. Hypothesized creative performance with each mode is discussed using trends from four categories of mood, based on the combined mood characteristics of pleasantness (positive/negative) and activation (active/passive).",

However, such components may introduce new types of hazards that can have disastrous consequences and need to be addressed for engineering trustworthy systems. Although deep neural networks offer advanced capabilities, they must be complemented by engineering methods and practices that allow effective integration in CPS. In this paper, we proposed an approach for assurance monitoring of learning-enabled CPS based on the conformal prediction framework. In order to allow real-time assurance monitoring, the approach employs distance learning to transform high-dimensional inputs into lower size embedding representations. By leveraging conformal prediction, the approach provides well-calibrated confidence and ensures a bounded small error rate while limiting the number of inputs for which an accurate prediction cannot be made. We demonstrate the approach using three data sets of mobile robot following a wall, speaker recognition, and traffic sign recognition. The experimental results demonstrate that the error rates are well-calibrated while the number of alarms is very small. Further, the method is computationally efficient and allows real-time assurance monitoring of CPS.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper presents research in the development of heuristic evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for generating and exploring differentiated force-based structures. The algorithm is weighted toward design exploration of topological differentiation while including specific structural and material constraints. An embryological EA model is employed to “grow” networks of mass-spring elements achieving desired mesh densities that resolve themselves in tensile force (form-active) equilibrium. The primal quadrilateral quadrisection method serves as the foundation for a range of extensible subdivision methods. Unique to this research, the quad is addressed as a “cell” rather than a topological or geometric construct, allowing for the contents of the cell to vary in number of mass-spring elements and orientation. In this research, this approach has been termed the quadrilateral quadrisection with n variable topological transformation method. This research culminates with the introduction of a method for grafting meshes where emergent features from the evolved meshes can be transposed and replicated in an explicit yet informed manner. The EA and grafting methods function within a Java-based software called springFORM , developed in previous research, which utilizes a mass-spring based library for solving force equilibrium and allows for both active (manual) and algorithmic topology manipulation. In application to a specific complex tensile mesh, the design framework, which combines the generative EA and mesh grafting method, is shown to produce emergent and highly differentiated topological arrangements that negotiate the specific relationships among a desired maximal mesh density, geometric patterning, and equalized force distribution.",

Gilles and Paquet identified a fourth type of disciplinary knowledge and labeled it as delta. This includes the knowledge of creative disciplines such as design, law, and economy. Since the time of these road-paving works, a lot has changed. In the last two decades, various concepts and manifestations of intellectualized engineered systems have appeared. A paradigmatic feature of these systems, exemplified by smart cyber-physical systems, is that they collect, infer, or extract massive amount of synthetic system knowledge (M-SSK) based on some pre-programmed human knowledge. The amount of this type of knowledge grows continuously. It can be aggregated on system level and on system of systems level. This paper argues that this aggregated M-SSK is not covered by the abovementioned four genres of knowledge. In fact, it represents a new genre. The conducted literature study underpins this claim. Therefore, the paper suggests dealing with it as a new genre, called epsilon-knowledge. Artificial intelligence, system engineering, cyber-physical systems, and knowledge engineering are the disciplines dealing with epsilon-knowledge. The paper refers to sympérasmology as the proper conceptual framework of studying this genre of knowledge.",

Compared with physical design characteristics (form, material, mechanical design, appearance), automotive designers find UX (user experience) challenging to communicate during the early stages of the design process without investing in expensive prototypes and/or models. This paper presents the development of a method to explore strategies to communicate UX through the medium of storyboards early in the design process. The method enables links to be drawn between the design tool of storyboarding and the attributes of theoretical UX outlined in theoretical frameworks. By applying this method in a case study of a storyboard created by Ford Design Asia Pacific, we identify how the theoretical attributes of UX are manifested, and we also highlight certain attributes of UX that are difficult to convey during the early phases of automotive design. This research thus contributes a method relevant to practice that assists with effectively communicating UX in early-stage automotive design where higher fidelity prototyping is unviable. Additionally, it enables the study of storyboard outcomes in the design process to assess the degree to which the intended UX is communicated. In doing so, it contributes a first step toward formalizing the analysis of UX in concept design, which in turn opens up this highly subjective area to further research in the automated analysis of conceptual design and even generative design.",

However, UX value creation of ML-enhanced products is still challenging because of ML's unique characteristics and numerous complex factors in conceptual design. To help designers create UX value for ML-enhanced products, we developed the UX value framework and the CoMLUX design process. The proposed framework describes how ML, stakeholders, and context co-create the UX value of ML-enhanced products, and identifies the growability and opacity of ML, helping designers systematically understand the co-creators while avoiding cognitive overload. The CoMLUX design process provides practical guidance for designing ML-enhanced products with growability and transparency. At last, we demonstrate the usage methods of the framework and process in an actual project and summarize the inspirations and limitations of our work.",

In general, it has challenges to model and ensure all of the cutting conditions that are suitable in the actual cutting process for sustainable manufacturing. In order to overcome the doing large amount of experimental data and predict different tool RULs, this study combines the analytical force modeling, the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) machine learning, and the current sensor which all are integrated in smart machine box (SMB) to realize the practical RUL prediction for on-line and real-time applications. The analytical model of the cutting force coefficients of shear and ploughing was established from average cutting forces, it could reduce the experimental number and predict the different cutting conditions. In general, the loading current of the cutting tool from a spindle motor is relatively easier acquired than the resultant forces. Thus, the loading currents of the spindle are used to train and predict the cutting forces using the BPNN model during intelligent manufacturing. The SMB architecture mainly performed the autonomous actions based on the edge layer, the fog layer, and the cloud layer via the TCP/IP, the MQTT protocol, and the unified communication library. Results showed that a predictive error for the ends of the tool life is about 3–10% that are based on the calculating of the cumulative current ratio.",

However promising, such methods are not scalable as the time investment is shifted to an up-front investment. Furthermore, most proposed methods require the engineer to adopt a new design process. The current study presents FISh, a scalable search method based on the standard engineering design process. By leveraging machine translation between a representative corpus of biological and engineering texts, the engineer can start the search using engineering terminology, which, behind the scenes, is automatically converted to a biological query. This conversion is done using language models trained on patents and biological publications for the engineering and biology domains. Both models are aligned using the most used English words. The biological query is used to retrieve biological documents that describe the most relevant functionality for the engineering query. The presented method allows searching for bio-inspiration using a free-text query. Furthermore, updating the underlying datasets, models and organism aspects is automated, allowing the system to stay up to date without requiring interactive effort. Finally, the search functionality is validated by comparing the search results for the functionality of existing bio-inspired designs with their inspiring organisms.",

The opportunities for conflict are magnified if many perspectives are brought to bear on a common artifact early in the design process, as in concurrent engineering or integrated engineering. Design advice tools can assist in the process of resolving these conflicts by making critiques and suggestions conveniently available to design participants, and by offering a fair means of evaluating and comparing suggested alternatives for compromise solution. In previous work we introduced a protocol based on notions of economic utility by which design advice systems can recognize conflict and mediate negotiation fairly. This protocol allowed design teams to express the desire to maximize or minimize the values of design parameters over totally ordered bounded domains of values, such as real numeric intervals. In this paper we extend this approach by allowing expressed preferences of design teams to be qualitative as well as quantitative, by allowing teams to express interest in parameters before they actually come into existence, and by relaxing many other of the earlier restrictions on the ways teams may express their preferences.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A difficult task in concurrent engineering tasks is to provide appropriate manufacturability feedback to the designer in a timely manner. Many tools provide designers with cost and manufacturability evaluations, but they do not necessarily help the designer to identify what aspects of the design to change in order to improve it from a manufacturing perspective. A computer-assisted concurrent-engineering technology is described which identifies cost-critical tolerances in the design and generates cost-reducing design suggestions. The purpose of the system is to help focus the designer’s attention on the specific aspects of the design that influence manufacturing cost. This can aid the designer in optimizing the manufacturing costs of prismatic, one-off parts created on a CNC machining center. This work uses a program called the Manufacturing Evaluation Agent to produce cost-reducing design suggestions. The Manufacturing Evaluation is made up of two portions: a manufacturing planner and a suggestion generator. The manufacturing planner, P 3 , takes a design and generates a manufacturing constraint net that represents all manufacturing steps and their sequencing. Each constraint in the network has a label indicating the portions of the design (or manufacturing environment) that gave rise to that constraint. The Suggestion Generator analyzes the manufacturing constraint net to find the cost-critical areas, and uses the labels to find the portions of the design responsible for these cost-critical parts of the manufacturing plan. By pinpointing the cost-critical areas of the design and suggesting alternatives, the Manufacturing Evaluation Agent can help the de-signer to more quickly develop a superior design. This results in more rapid turnaround time, lower cost designs, and fewer engineering change orders once the design is sent to the factory floor.",

This approach is intended to cause the developers, from the outset, to consider all elements of the product life cycle from concept through disposal, including quality, cost, schedule, and user requirements. To achieve successful concurrent-engineering design, one needs an integrated framework, a well-organized design team, and adequate design tools. The research on concurrent engineering to date has focused on developing communication infrastructure, design tools, and product data representations. Little attention has been paid to developing tools to address the organizational issues involved in concurrent engineering. The authors’ research on the Virtual Design Team (VDT) attempts to develop a computerized analysis tool to sup-port the systematic design of organization structures for concurrent engineering projects. VDT is a computer simulation system. It takes descriptions of design tasks, actors (i.e., designers and managers), and organization structure as input, and produces predicted historical records of the actors’ design and coordination behavior, project du-ration, cost, and design process quality as output. VDT has been applied to model more than ten realistic engineering projects, and the results are qualitatively consistent with the predictions from theory and project managers. The VDT framework for modeling concurrent-engineering teams is described, and examples of VDT applications are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Virtual Design Team approach to modeling the organizational behavior of concurrent design teams.",

    "abstract": "Abstract During the course of the design of a complex artifact many thousands of objects will be created that will refer to many different types of information. Thus, an effective design support system must be able to store various types of data and allow easy navigation of the resulting extensive network of objects. In addition, the quality of the design records (both the record of the design artifact and rationale) is increased by the quality and quantity of information which the designer is able to record. In this paper we describe two new developments to Kbds a design support system for chemical process design, which enable easier navigation of the design network, and a fuller representation of the design process. In addition, we show how these extensions may be used together to improve the quality of the design information recorded—both for the evolution of the design artifact and the supporting rationale. The first development enables the designer to record a variety of complementary types of document within the process design history, fulfilling the task of improving the design information recorded. The second enhancement to Kbds eases the navigation of the design history by categorizing design objects according to a user-defined set of keywords. The categorization of design objects is carried out semiautomatically using, in part, the various design representations (documents) enabled through the first extension and enables rapid navigation of the design network. Finally, a method of checking the consistency of design rationale structures using keywords is also described. Thus, various representations may be used to generate keywords that in turn may be used to improve the quality of design rationale records. An example showing this situation is described.",

One of the important problems that have been investigated is motion planning, and very significant results have been obtained. This paper describes an implemented system for designing pipe layouts automatically using motion planning techniques. It introduces a new approach to pipe layout design automation in which pipe routes are treated as trajectories left behind by rigid objects (‘robots’). We have implemented this approach in a basic Pipe Router that is described in detail in this paper. We have extended this router in order to make it capable of treating a variety of other constraints which are typical of practical pipe layout design problems. These constraints relate to the process carried out in the pipes, to the design of their mechanical support, and to the constructability and the ease of operation and maintenance of the designed pipe systems.",

This framework is based on the concept of Design Justification using a Design-for-Economics approach. We have developed a knowledge-based system that can be used to evaluate aircraft structural concept material and process selections. The framework consists of the knowledge-based system, integrated with numerical analysis tools including an aircraft performance/sizing code and a life-cycle cost analysis code. Production cost estimates are applied for evaluation of process trades at the subcomponent level of design. Life-cycle cost estimates are used for evaluation of process trades at the system level. Results of a case study are presented for several advanced wing structural concepts for a future supersonic commercial transport aircraft. Cost versus performance studies indicate that a high-speed civil transport aircraft with a hybrid wing structural concept, though more expensive to manufacture than some homogeneous concepts, can have lower direct operating costs due to a lower take-off gross weight and less mission fuel required.",

A dual agent strategy (GAANT) involving elements of an ant colony search and an evolutionary search concurrently manipulating the discrete and continuous variable parameter sets is presented. Appropriate communication between the two search agents results in a more efficient search across the hierarchy than that achieved by the stGA, while also simplifying the chromosomal representation.

Traditionally, the method is used to understand how one decision affects the options available to other decisions in a large-scale project. The method is to be used interactively with designers participating in a brainstorming session so that ideas are added to AIDA and immediately combined with other compatible ideas. The existing implementation has been tested in a classroom setting in which upper level undergraduates have successfully used the AIDA method along with numerous of design methods to solve conceptual design problems.",

Central to the notion of situatedness is the notion of design situation and constructive memory. A design situation models a particular state of interaction between a design agent and the environment at a particular point in time. Memory construction occurs whenever a design agent uses past experiences and knowledge within the current design environment in a situated manner. This paper is concerned with the development of an agent-based computational design tool that takes into consideration the notion of situatedness in designing. A key element of this tool is a constructive memory system that supports the dynamic nature of designing. Memories of past experiences are constructed as required by the current situation, and past experiences are refined for future utility according to the current interactions between the agent and the environment. This latter case of knowledge improvement is illustrated through a series of experiments that demonstrates the effect of grounding on the operating modes and responses of a constructive memory system.",

The application of a visual order entails some explicit grouping property that is both cognitively plausible and contextually dependent. Central to cognitive–contextual notions are the type of representation used in analysis and the flexibility to allow semantic interpretation. We present a model of visual style based on the concept of similarity as a qualitative context-dependent categorization. The two core components of the model are semantic feature extraction and self-organizing maps (SOMs). The model proposes a method of categorizing two-dimensional unannotated design diagrams using both low-level geometric and high-level semantic features that are automatically derived from the pictorial content of the design. The operation of the initial model, called Q-SOM, is then extended to include relevance feedback (Q-SOM:RF). The extended model can be seen as a series of sequential processing stages, in which qualitative encoding and feature extraction are followed by iterative recategorization. Categorization is achieved using an unsupervised SOM, and contextual dependencies are integrated via cluster relevance determined by the observer's feedback. The following stages are presented: initial per feature detection and extraction, selection of feature sets corresponding to different spatial ontologies, unsupervised categorization of design diagrams based on appropriate feature subsets, and integration of design context via relevance feedback. From our experiments we compare different outcomes from consecutive stages of the model. The results show that the model provides a cognitively plausible and context-dependent method for characterizing visual style in design.",

The implementation of a society of agents fulfilling these roles within a virtual world based, multidisciplinary design tool called DesignWorld is described.

This characteristic makes designing a difficult task even for humans let alone for machines, because most of our knowledge and the means to acquire it assume that the world is given to us and what we need to do is characterize it.

Borrowing its concept of design competence from Chomsky's definition of linguistic competence, the paper reviews biological evidence from fields including evolution, genetics, and animal behavior from the perspective of design research to propose that design competence is the product of an evolutionary history during which five key developments in cognitive evolution came together: conception unbounded by sensory perception, symbolic manipulation at a level of metarepresentation, theory of mind, curiosity, and mental time travel. These cognitive capabilities were derived from the biological evidence based upon the criteria that they are presumed to be unique to humans ( Homo sapiens ), they may be lost because of neurodegenerative diseases or they may fail to develop because of neurodevelopmental disorders, and they are not immediately present upon birth and develop as a child's brain matures. Based on these five capabilities, the paper concludes by discussing how computation may provide a useful way to understand the origins and evolution of design competence.",

In this paper genetically generated fuzzy knowledge based models of three-dimensional (3-D) probing accuracy for one- and two-stage touch trigger probes are proposed. The fuzzy models are automatically generated using a dedicated genetic algorithm developed by the authors. The algorithm uses hybrid coding, binary for the rule base and real for the database. This hybrid coding, used with a set of specialized operators of reproduction, proved to be an effective learning environment in this case. Data collection of the measured objects' coordinates was carried out using a special setup for probe testing. The authors used a novel method that applies a low-force high-resolution displacement transducer for probe error examination in 3-D space outside the CMM measurement. The genetically generated fuzzy models are constructed for both one stage (TP6) and two stage (TP200) types of probes. First, the optimal number of settings is defined using an analysis of the influence of fuzzy rules on TP6 accuracy. Then, once the number of settings is obtained, near optimal fuzzy knowledge bases are generated for both TP6 and TP200 triggering probes, followed by analysis of the finalized fuzzy rules bases for knowledge extraction about the relationships between physical setup values and error levels of the probes. The number of fuzzy sets on each premise leads to the number of physical setups needed to get satisfactory error profiles, whereas the fuzzy rules base adds to the knowledge linking the design experiment parameters to the pretravel error of CMM machines. Satisfactory fuzzy logic equivalents of the 3-D error profiles were obtained for both TP6 and TP200 with root mean squsre errors ranging from 0.00 mm to a maximum of 0.58 mm.",

In many cases, finding the optimal configuration solution for the user is a creative process that requires them to decide trade-offs between conflicting goals (multicriteria optimization problem). These problems are best supported by an interactive dialog that is managed by a dedicated software program (the configurator) that provides decision support. We illustrate this using a real example (configuration of a business software system). This productively used application makes the user aware of which choices are available in a given situation, provides assistance in resolving inconsistent choices and defaults, and generates explanations if desired. One of the key configurator components used to manage this is a truth maintenance system. We describe how this component is used and two novel extensions to it: methods for declarative handling of defaults (of varying strength) and the declarative handling of incompleteness. Finally, we summarize our experiences made during the implementation of this application and the pros and cons of declarative versus procedural approaches.",

Methods developed for the configuration of modular systems comprising components have traditionally adopted a representation where the properties and compatibility requirements are expressed as constraints associated with individual components. However, this representation does not accurately capture constraints on paths and subprocesses and is therefore unsuitable for process configuration. This article extends established constraint-based configuration methods with a constraint language for specifying properties of execution paths in work processes. A framework for semiautomated process customization is presented. It integrates the extended constraint language with a metamodel of the work processes in an organization and allows to adapt generic work processes to fit the requirements of specific development projects. Heuristic search methods are applied to build valid process configurations by incrementally resolving constraint violations. The declarative framework facilitates the adaptation of abstract work processes as well as the validation and repair of existing processes. The approach was developed in the context of a real-world system of complex design and development processes where it was shown that significant process improvements and reduction in effort required to edit process models can be achieved.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Conceptual design is a key stage of product design and has received increasing attention in recent years. However, this stage is characterized by limited information, large uncertainty, and multidisciplinary aspects. Thus, increased workload and time cost are associated with conceptual design information acquisition; sometimes, it is difficult to develop novel solutions and the feasibility of the solutions obtained according to these limited and uncertain information is difficult to guarantee. Genetics-based design (GBD) is an effective approach to develop novel solutions and improve the reuse of knowledge, which is consistent with the goal of the conceptual design process. Product-gene acquisition is the premise and basis of GBD. At present, there are few reported studies in this area; most of the existing works are constrained by the structural aspects of the acquisition process, and there are limited studies on specific implementation techniques. To explore the specific implementation technologies of product-gene acquisition, an intelligent acquisition method based on K -means clustering and mutual information-based feature selection algorithm is proposed in this paper. The product genes defined in this paper are key product information that determines the nature of the product and influences the conceptual design process. Thus, solutions obtained according to them are more feasible than that based on limited and uncertain information. An illustrative example is presented. The results show that the proposed method can achieve intelligent acquisition of product genes to a certain extent. Further, the proposed method will allow designers to quickly search for the corresponding product genes when performing similar functional design tasks.",

On this basis, an experiment is performed by investigating users' requirements for the computer to obtain the data, and the data are used for the analysis based on the proposed model. The analysis result shows that the model can reveal the difference among heterogeneous users well, find out the implicit requirements of users, and identify the gap between existing products and users' personalized requirements, which provides support to the subsequent improvement of product design.",

If available, DR provides a comprehensive record of the reasoning behind the decisions made during the design. Unfortunately, while this information is potentially quite valuable, it is usually not explicitly captured. Instead, it is often buried in other design and development artifacts. In this paper, we study how to identify rationale from text documents, specifically software bug reports and design discussion transcripts. The method we examined is statistical text mining where a model is built to use document features to classify sentences. Choosing which features are most likely to be good predictors is important. We studied two evolutionary algorithms to optimize feature selection – ant colony optimization and genetic algorithms. We found that for many types of rationale, models built with an optimized feature set outperformed those built using all the document features.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Studies show that there are shortcomings in applying conventional methods for the emotional evaluation of the aircraft cockpit. In order to resolve this problem, a more efficient cockpit emotion evaluation system is established in the present study to simply and quickly obtain the cockpit emotion evaluation value. To this end, the neural network is applied to construct an emotional model to evaluate the emotional prediction of the interior design of the aircraft cockpit. Moreover, several technologies and the Kansei engineering method are applied to acquire the cockpit interior emotional evaluation data for typical aircraft models. In this regard, the radical basis function neural network (RBFNN), Elman neural network (ENN), and the general regression neural network (GRNN) are applied to construct the sentimental prediction evaluation model. Then, the three models are comprehensively compared through factors such as the model evaluation criteria, network structure, and network parameters. Obtained experimental results indicate that the GRNN not only has the highest classification accuracy but also has the highest stability in comparison to the other two neural networks, so that it is a more appropriate method for the emotional evaluation of the aircraft cockpit. Results of the present study provide decision supports for the emotional evaluation of the cockpit interior space.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Multiagent systems have been considered as a potential solution for developing adaptive systems. In this research, a cellular self-organizing (CSO) approach is proposed for developing such multiagent adaptive systems. The design of CSO systems however is difficult because the global effect emerges from local actions and interactions that are often hard to specify and control. In order to achieve high-level flexible and robustness of CSO systems and retain the capability of specifying desired global effects, we propose a field-based regulative control mechanism, called field-based behavior regulation (FBR). FBR is a real-time, dynamical, distributed mechanism that regulates the emergence process for CSO systems to self-organize and self-reconfigure in complex operation environments. FBR characterizes the task environment in terms of “fields” and extends the system flexibility and robustness without imposing global control over local cells or agents. This paper describes the model of CSO systems and FBR, and demonstrates their effectiveness through simulation-based case studies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In reality, the behavior of processes is sometimes vague and the observed data is irregular. This research proposes an approach for optimizing fuzzy multiple responses using fuzzy regression. In this approach, each response repetition is transformed into a signal to noise ratio then modeled using statistical multiple regression. A trapezoidal fuzzy regression model is formulated for each response utilizing the statistical regression coefficients. The most desirable response values and the deviation function are determined for each response. Finally, four optimization models are formulated for the trapezoidal membership fuzzy number to obtain the optimal factor level at each number. Two case studies are adopted for illustration, where excluding response fuzziness will result in misleading optimal factor settings if solved by the traditional optimization techniques. In conclusion, the proposed approach based on fuzzy regression approach can successfully optimize fuzzy multiple responses in a wide range of manufacturing applications on the Taguchi's method. Moreover, compared to other approaches, such as data envelopment analysis and grey relational analysis, the proposed approach has the distinct advantage of being able to generate models using only a small number of experimental data sets and minimizing inherent variations.",

Analogical reasoning systems for use in design tasks require representations that are open to being reinterpreted. The framework, interpretation-driven mapping, casts the process of constructing an analogical relationship as requiring iterative, parallel interactions between mapping and interpreting. This paper argues that this interpretation-driven approach focuses research on a fundamental problem in analogy making: how do the representations that make new mappings possible emerge during the mapping process? The framework is useful for both describing existing analogy-making models and designing future ones. The paper presents a computational model informed by the framework Idiom, which learns ways to reinterpret the representations of objects as it maps between them. The results of an implementation in the domain of visual analogy are presented to demonstrate its feasibility. Analogies constructed by the system are presented as examples. The interpretation-driven mapping framework is then used to compare representational change in Idiom to that in three previously published systems.",

The objectives of FuncSION are to help generate a variety of functional requirements for a given problem and a variety of concepts to fulfill these functions.

This paper provides an overview of FuncSION in terms of representation of design problems, representation of building blocks, and rules with which building blocks are combined to generate concepts at three levels of abstraction: topological, spatial, and physical. The paper then provides a detailed account of evaluating FuncSION for its effectiveness in providing stimuli for enhanced ideation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract As a benefit of modularization of complex systems, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) can choose suppliers in a less constricted way when faced with new or evolving requirements. However, new suppliers usually add uncertainties to the system development. Because suppliers are tightly integrated into the design process in modular design and therefore greatly influence the outcome of the OEM's products, the uncertainty along with requirements satisfaction of the suppliers and their modules should be controlled starting from potential supplier identification. In addition, to better satisfy new requirements, the potential supplier identification should be combined with architecture generation to enable the new technology integration. In this paper, we propose the Architecture &amp; Supplier Identification Tool, which generates all possible architectures and corresponding suppliers based on new requirements through matrix mapping and propagation. Using the Architecture &amp; Supplier Identification Tool, the overall uncertainty and requirements satisfaction of generated architectures can be estimated and controlled. The proposed method aims at providing decision support for early design of complex systems, thereby helping OEMs have an integrated view of suppliers and system architectures in requirements satisfaction and overall uncertainty.",

The characteristics of artifacts that induce natural activities of people, affordances, play critical roles in making interactions successful and meaningful. The notion of affordance features, structural elements of artifacts that provide affordances, has been proposed earlier. In this paper, a methodological framework for design for affordances is proposed where repositories of affordance features are used. Affordances are identified through function–task interaction matrices or use activity observations. Using an affordance feature repository where many alternative structural elements for a specific affordance are stored together with corresponding design constraints and contexts, affordance features for those identified affordances are retrieved considering similarities between the target design constraints and those of the affordance features in the repositories. Using the clues given by such affordance features, a new affordance feature is to be designed through analogical reasoning. We present this design for affordance framework together with illustrative cases where various designers designed affordance features using affordance feature repositories.",

A typical computer system consists of diverse components (e.g., electronic and software components), thus, the faults contained in these components tend to possess diverse characteristics. How to describe and model such diverse faults, and further determine fault propagation through different components are challenging problems to be addressed in the fault propagation analysis. This paper proposes an ontology-based approach, which is an integrated method allowing for the generation, injection, and propagation through inference of diverse faults at an early stage of the design of a computer system. The results generated by the proposed framework can verify system robustness and identify safety and reliability risks with limited design level information. In this paper, we propose an ontological framework and its application to analyze an example safety-critical computer system. The analysis result shows that the proposed framework is capable of inferring fault propagation paths through software and hardware components and is effective in predicting the impact of faults.",

To facilitate the prototyping of ML-enhanced products and improve the ML literacy of designers, we draw inspiration from a design method called Material Lifecycle Thinking (MLT), which regards ML as a continuously evolving design material. Based on the MLT, we proposed a cyclical prototype workflow and developed inML Kit, a toolkit enabling designers to make functional ML prototypes and improve ML literacy by involving them in the never-ending ML lifecycle. The toolkit was designed, iterated, and implemented through the participatory design process with experienced designers in this field. We evaluated inML Kit by conducting a controlled user study where our toolkit was compared with Google AIY.

    "abstract": "Abstract This research envisages an automated system to inform engineers when opportunities occur to use existing features or configurations during the development of new products. Such a system could be termed a \"predictive CAD system\" because it would be able to suggest feature choices that follow patterns established in existing products. The predictive CAD literature largely focuses on predicting components for assemblies using 3D solid models. In contrast, this research work focuses on feature-based predictive CAD system using B-rep models. This paper investigates the performance of predictive models that could enable the creation of such an intelligent CAD system by assessing three different methods to support inference: sequential, machine learning, or probabilistic methods using N-Grams, Neural Networks (NNs), and Bayesian Networks (BNs) as representative of these methods. After defining the functional properties that characterize a predictive design system, a generic development methodology is presented. The methodology is used to carry out a systematic assessment of the relative performance of three methods each used to predict the diameter value of the next hole and boss feature type being added during the design of a hydraulic valve body. Evaluating predictive performance providing five recommendations ( $k = 5$ ) for hole or boss features as a new design was developed, recall@k increased from around 30% to 50% and precision@k from around 50% to 70% as one to three features were added. The results indicate that the BN and NN models perform better than those using N-Grams. The practical impact of this contribution is assessed using a prototype (implemented as an extension to a commercial CAD system) by engineers whose comments defined an agenda for ongoing research in this area.",

In particular, we use assumptions and conflict management to achieve efficient search in contexts where little reliable information exists. A knowledge representation, containing a semantic differentiation between two types of assumptions, is used within a computational model based on the dynamic constraint satisfaction paradigm. Conflict management strategies consist of three generic mechanisms adapted to the type of constraints involved.

This paper describes two experiments performed in an attempt to address some of these problems. First, a design problem with only a small computational cost of evaluating candidate shapes was used as a testbed for designing genetic operators for this shape representation. Second, these operators were refined for a design problem using a more costly finite element evaluation. It was concluded that the voxel representation can, with careful design of genetic operators, be useful in shape optimization.",

The main purpose of this paper is to determine how well such a relatively fast model for analyzing a queuing network could substitute for far more expensive simulation. Its substitutability for simulation is judged by relative discrepancies in predicting tow delays between the ANN and simulation models. This model is developed by integrating five distinct ANN submodels that predict tow headway variances at (1) merge points, (2) branching (i.e., diverging) points, (3) lock exits, and (4) link outflow points (e.g., at ports, junctions, or lock entrances), plus (5) tow queuing delays at locks. Preliminary results are shown for those five submodels and for the integrated network analysis model. Eventually, such a network analyzer should be useful for designing, selecting, sequencing, and scheduling lock improvement projects, for controlling lock operations, for system maintenance planning, and for other applications where many combinations of network characteristics must be evaluated. More generally, this method of decomposing complex queuing networks into elements that can be analyzed with ANNs and then recombined provides a promising approach for analyzing other queuing networks (e.g., in transportation, communication, computing, and production systems).",

However, each of these approaches has limitations. Using word or phrase search, users are faced with a compromise between overly broad searches returning an excessive amount of information or overly narrow searches that may fail to return relevant information. Browsing organizational structures is dependent on the user's knowledge of the structures, and a user may find it difficult to refine searches. This paper introduces a user interface based approach to the browsing of hierarchically organized information entities that avoids these problems by allowing the incremental narrowing down of a set of search results and by pruning the organizational structure after each user selection to show the consequences of the selection. The effect is to present to the user at all times only that part of the organizational structure that will lead to a nonnull selection. The approach is called no zero match (NZM) browsing. The paper presents the computational basis of NZM browsing before describing a trial implementation of the approach and presenting three case studies, which represent common search situations in an engineering context.",

One of the problems encountered is the selection of the right software component. This is related not only to the similarity between the desired functionality and the function delivered by the retrieved software component, but also to the effort needed to modify the chosen component to accommodate the desired functionality. Most of the research done in the case-based reasoning area has been in developing accurate and efficient retrieval algorithms. We think that case-based reasoning retrieval concepts and ideas can be successfully applied to software reuse. In this article we propose a metric to assess similarity between software cases supported on functional and behavioral knowledge. One important aspect of this metric is that reusability is taken into account to estimate the amount of effort needed to reuse retrieved software cases. We also present experimental work that shows that similarity at the functional level is the most important aspect of the similarity metric proposed.",

Human artistry, context, and connectionist approaches to knowledge are the common threads highlighted. ED is considered to be a type of RP and AI a part of RP. This is supported by an analysis of the transformation processes involved in each. AI and systems are presented as approaches for the formalization of RP at the technical and conceptual levels, respectively. Interconnectedness in a hierarchical fashion and purposeful process loops are defined as the key ingredients of a systems approach. AI techniques that could support a range of ED categories (case-based reasoning, decomposition, and transformation) are identified, as are the wider RP approaches that subsume those categories. The ED, AI, and RP categories are identified as spanning from routine to creative, connectionist to cognitivist, and intuitive to deliberate, respectively.",

Using feature-based computer-aided design models is thought to make a complete integration. This paper presents a feature recognition approach based on the use of a feature grammar. Given the complexity of feature recognition in interactions, the basic idea of the approach is to find the latent and logical structure of features in interaction. The approach includes five main phases. The first phase, called regioning, identifies the potential zones for the birth of features. The second phase, called virtual extension, builds links and virtual faces. The third phase, called structuring, transforms the region into a structure compatible with the structure of the features represented by the feature grammar. The fourth phase, called Identification, identifies the features in these zones. The fifth phase, called modeling, represents the model by features. The feature modeling system software is developed based on this approach.",

    "abstract": "The problem investigated in this research is that engineering design decision making can be complicated and made difficult by highly coupled design parameters and the vast number of design parameters. This complication often hinders the full exploration of a design solution space in order to generate optimal design solution. These hindrances result in inferior or unfit design solutions generated for a given design problem due to a lack of understanding of both the problem and the solution space. This research introduces a computational framework of a new algebraic constraint-based design approach aimed at providing a deeper understanding of the design problem and enabling the designers to gain insights to the dynamic solution space and the problem. This will enable designers to make informed decisions based on the insights derived from parameter relationships extracted. This paper also describes an enhanced understanding of an engineering design process as a constraint centered design. It argues that with more effort and appreciation of the benefits derived from this constraint-based design approach, engineering design can be advanced significantly by first generating a more quantitative product design specification and then using these quantitative statements as the basis for constraint-based rigorous design. The approach has been investigated in the context of whole product life-cycle design and multidisciplinary design, aiming to derive a generic constraint-based design approach that can cope with life-cycle design and different engineering disciplines. A prototype system has been implemented based on a constraint-based system architecture. The paper gives details of the constraint-based design process through illustrating a worked real design example. The successful application of the approach in two highly coupled engineering design problems and the evaluation undertaken by a group of experienced designers show that the approach does provide the designers with insights for better exploration, enabled by the algebraic constraint solver. The approach thus provides a significant step towards fuller scale constraint-based scientific design.",

    "abstract": "Exploration with a generative formalism must necessarily account for the nature of interaction between humans and the design space explorer. Established accounts of design interaction are made complicated by two propositions in Woodbury and Burrow's Keynote on design space exploration. First, the emphasis on the primacy of the design space as an ordered collection of partial designs (version, alternatives, extensions). Few studies exist in the design interaction literature on working with multiple threads simultaneously. Second, the need to situate, aid, and amplify human design intentions using computational tools. Although specific research and practice tools on amplification (sketching, generation, variation) have had success, there is a lack of generic, flexible, interoperable, and extensible representation to support amplification. This paper addresses the above, working with design threads and computer-assisted design amplification through a theoretical model of dialogue based on Grice's model of rational conversation. Using the concept of mixed initiative, the paper presents a visual notation for representing dialogue between designer and design space formalism through abstract examples of exploration tasks and dialogue integration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In many cases, the use of product configurators provides a number of benefits for engineering-oriented companies, such as shorter lead times, the use of fewer man hours, and improved product quality. However, not all of these projects are successful. The task of defining what should be implemented into the configurator is much more complex than anticipated in many configurator projects. In the worst-case scenario, this implies that the configurator is never fully developed or it fails to support the users in a satisfactory manner. The difficulties in creating adequate specifications of what to implement in the knowledge base of a configurator have been explained in much of the configuration literature by the assumption that much of the relevant knowledge of the product experts is tacit. However, this paper shows that this kind of explanation can be misleading and may even be incorrect. This is accomplished by discussing the problems inherent in such explanations and through interviews with configuration project knowledge engineers. Therefore, according to this basis, this paper provides general recommendations concerning the use of the term tacit knowledge and outlines issues related to the acquisition of product knowledge in configuration projects.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Spatial grammars are rule-based, generative systems for the specification of formal languages. Set and shape grammar formulations of spatial grammars enable the definition of spatial design languages and the creation of alternative designs. The original formalism includes labels that provide the possibility to restrict the application of rules or to incorporate additional, nongeometric information in grammar rules. Labels have been used in various ways. This paper investigates the different uses of labels in existing spatial grammars, both paper based and computational, and introduces a new concept of three-dimensional (3-D) labels for spatial grammars. The approach consolidates the different label types in one integrated concept. The main use of 3-D labels is that they can simplify the matching of the left-hand side of rules in parametric grammars. A prototype implementation is used to illustrate the approach through a mechanical engineering example of generating robot arm concepts. This approach more readily enables the use of complex solid geometry in the definition and application of parametric rules. Thus, the flexible generation of complex, meaningful design solutions for mechanical engineering applications can be achieved using parametric spatial grammars combined with 3-D labels.",

Such a formal analysis is a prerequisite to come to a formal theory of design and for the development of automated support for the dynamics of design processes. The analysis was geared toward the identification of dynamic design properties at different levels of aggregation. This approach is specifically suitable for component-based design processes. A complicating factor for supporting the design process is that not only the generic properties of design must be specified, but also the language chosen should be rich enough to allow specification of complex properties of the system under design. This requires a language rich enough to operate at these different levels. The Temporal Trace Language used in this paper is suitable for that. The paper shows that the analysis at the level of a design process as a whole and at subprocesses thereof is precise enough to allow for automatic simulation. Simulation allows the modeler to manipulate the specifications of the system under design to better understand the interlevel relationships in his design. The approach is illustrated by an example.",

The method includes: (1) extracting objects from the data, (2) forming structures from objects, (3) expanding structures into rules based on frequency, and (4) finding rule similarities that lead to consolidation or abstraction. To evaluate this method, grammars are induced from generated data, architectural layouts and three-dimensional design models to demonstrate that this method offers usable grammars automatically which are functionally similar to grammars produced by hand.",

To appraise the energy savings, we compared simulations that consider either no forecast (reactive control), perfect forecast (to estimate the control ability to consider forecast), or the forecast provided by our algorithm. The measurements and simulations are run on 26 different but real dwellings to assess results variability.

This fact affects the results and conclusions drawn and, for that reason, it is necessary to design and implement the same language interpreter-independent evaluation tools. Novel web technologies facilitate the design of web interfaces that support online, multiple-choice questionnaires, while exploiting the storage of tracking data as a source of information about user interaction. This paper proposes an online, multiple-choice sign language questionnaire based on an intuitive methodology. It helps users to complete tests and automatically generates accurate, statistical results using the information and data obtained in the process. The proposed system presents SL videos and enables user interaction, fulfilling the requirements that SL interpretation is not able to cover. The questionnaire feeds a remote database with the user answers and powers the automatic creation of data for analytics. Several metrics, including time elapsed, are used to assess the usability of the SL questionnaire, defining the goals of the predictive models. These predictions are based on machine learning models, with the demographic data of the user as features for estimating the usability of the system. This questionnaire reduces costs and time in terms of interpreter dedication, as well as widening the amount of data collected while employing user native language. The validity of this tool was demonstrated in two different use cases.",

A data series of 108 samples was collected in order to develop a new hybrid structure of an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) network, and the group method of the data handling (GMDH) type neural network was optimized by applying the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm over the hybrid ANFIS-GMDH topology, which leads to a new hybrid AI model called as ANFIS-GMDH-PSO. The derived database provides information related to pile load tests, in situ field CPT data, and soil–pile information for introducing the proposed hybrid neural system. The cross-section of the pile toe, average cone tip resistance along embedded pile length, and sleeve frictional resistance along the shaft had been considered as input parameters for the proposed network. The results of this research indicated that the proposed ANFIS-GMDH-PSO model predicted the UPBC with an acceptable precision compared to various CPT methods, including Schmertmann, De Kuiter &amp; Bringen, and LPC/LPCT methods. Moreover, ANFIS-GMDH-PSO network model performance was compared to CPT-based models in terms of statistical criteria in order to achieve a best fitted model. From the statistical results, it was found that the developed ANFIS-GMDH-PSO model has achieved a higher accuracy level in terms of statistical indices compared to CPT-based empirical methods, such as Schmertmann model, De Kuiter &amp; Beringen model, and Bustamante &amp; Gianeselli for predicting driven pile ultimate bearing capacity.",

To verify theories and quantitatively describe the design process, design experiment, and data analysis are crucial and inevitable. However, applying data analysis in the design experiment is tricky and design data is not fully utilized in many aspects. To explore the potential of design experiment data, this paper introduces data-driven research based on an interior design experiment, aiming to reveal the category and process of design by conducting data analysis, visualization, and recommendation. We introduce an interactive evolutionary computation (IEC) design experiment that deals with a simplified interior design task and has already been tested on 230 subjects. Using the data gathered during the experiment, we conduct data analysis and visualization involving methods including Holistic color interval and K-means clustering to show categories and processes in design. Additionally, we train a content-based recommendation system with experiment data to capture user preference and make the IEC system more efficient and intelligent. The analysis and visualization show clear design categories and capture an evident trend towards the final design outcome. The application of the recommendation system brings a prominent improvement to the IEC system. This research shows the great potential of the various data-driven methods in design research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In today's aggressive global market, innovation is key for success and design solutions require not only to achieve competitive edge, but also to address the growing environmental, social, and economic needs of the community at large. Consideration of these three pillars of sustainability makes a design inclusive, and life cycle thinking is found to be a promising approach across the literature. However, most supports for design address certain facets or aid singular tasks, and the use of design methods and tools, which have the potential to significantly improve the design process, is low due to inappropriate use and selection of these methods. InDeaTe (Innovation Design database and Template) is a holistic, knowledge-driven, computer-based tool for design of sustainable systems, such as products, manufacturing systems andservice systems and has been developed to address and integrate the aspects of sustainability on a singular design platform. It comprises of the generic design process Template that imbibes life cycle thinking into the process by incorporating consideration of every life cycle phase in each design stage, where design activities are performed iteratively. It further supports the design process by aiding the use and selection of appropriate design methods and tools in concurrence with the primary motivation of improving sustainability of the system with the aid of the InDeaTe Design Database. This paper discusses the ontological underpinnings behind the conceptualization of the InDeaTe methodology and the development of the supporting tool. The paper further reports empirical findings from six different case studies conducted for evaluating the effectiveness of InDeaTe tool in supporting design for sustainability (DfS). The results show that InDeaTe tool has potential in supporting DfS.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The user's gaze can provide important information for human–machine interaction, but the analysis of manual gaze data is extremely time-consuming, inhibiting wide adoption in usability studies. Existing methods for automated areas of interest (AOI) analysis cannot be applied to tangible products with a screen-based user interface (UI), which have become ubiquitous in everyday life. The objective of this paper is to present and evaluate a method to automatically map the user's gaze to dynamic AOIs on tangible screen-based UIs based on computer vision and deep learning. This paper presents an algorithm for automated Dynamic AOI Mapping (aDAM), which allows the automated mapping of gaze data recorded with mobile eye tracking to the predefined AOIs on tangible screen-based UIs. The evaluation of the algorithm is performed using two medical devices, which represent two extreme examples of tangible screen-based UIs. The different elements of aDAM are examined for accuracy and robustness, as well as the time saved compared to manual mapping. The break-even point for an analyst's effort for aDAM compared to manual analysis is found to be 8.9 min gaze data time. The accuracy and robustness of both the automated gaze mapping and the screen matching indicate that aDAM can be applied to a wide range of products. aDAM allows, for the first time, automated AOI analysis of tangible screen-based UIs with AOIs that dynamically change over time. The algorithm requires some additional initial input for the setup and training, but analyzed gaze data duration and effort is only determined by computation time and does not require any additional manual work thereafter. The efficiency of the approach has the potential for a broader adoption of mobile eye tracking in usability testing for the development of new products and may contribute to a more data-driven usability engineering process in the future.",

In the traditional association rule mining methods, a large number of candidate sets affect the mining efficiency, and the results are not easy for customers to understand. Therefore, a mining method based on binary particle swarm optimization ant colony algorithm to discover service demands and remanufacture services association rules is proposed. This method preprocesses the RMS records, converts them into a binary matrix, and uses the improved ant colony algorithm to mine the maximum frequent itemset. Because the particle swarm algorithm determines the initial pheromone concentration of the ant colony, it avoids the blindness of the ant colony, effectively enhances the searchability of the algorithm, and makes association rule mining faster and more accurate. Finally, a set of historical RMS record data of straightening machine is used to test the validity and feasibility of this method by extracting valid association rules to guide the design of RMS scheme for straightening machine parts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A multistudy approach is presented that allows design thinking of complex systems to be studied by triangulating causal controlled lab findings with coded data from more complex products. A case study illustration of this approach is provided. During the conceptual design of engineering systems, designers face many cognitive challenges, including design fixation, errors in their mental models, and the sunk cost effect. These factors need to be mitigated for the generation of effective ideas. Understanding the effects of these challenges in a realistic and complex engineering system is especially difficult due to a variety of factors influencing the results. Studying the design of such systems in a controlled environment is extremely challenging because of the scale and complexity of such systems and the time needed to design the systems. Considering these challenges, a mixed-method approach is presented for studying the design thinking of complex engineering systems. This approach includes a controlled experiment with a simple system and a qualitative cognitive-artifacts study on more complex engineering systems followed by the triangulation of results. The triangulated results provide more generalizable information for complex system design thinking. This method combines the advantages of quantitative and qualitative study methods, making them more powerful while studying complex engineering systems. The proposed method is illustrated further using an illustrative study on the cognitive effects of physical models during the design of engineering systems.",

The ontology consists of 14 concepts and 5 relationships. The ontology is developed using Protégé 4.3 and DL-query to query and reason with the ontology. The ontology is demonstrated using a consumer vacuum cleaner. The formal ontology serves as the basis for developing computer support for ABD applications. When implemented, these design tools will help designers manage the affordances of artifacts being designed, specifying the interacting entities of every affordance when a three-dimensional model of the artifact is available. Further, these software tools could be used to support ABD methods.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We describe three approaches to identify novel product affordances: affordance of absence; insights from lead users, specifically do-it-yourselfers (DIYers); and natural-language searches. While these approaches were separately pursued, we show their connection to each other in this paper. We begin by describing the affordance of absence, inspired by insights on affordances arising from a lack of resources. For example, in the absence of specialized tools, more general tools are used to accomplish similar tasks. Such absence clarifies how other tools could be modified to add relevant features and identifies critical features of the absent tool. In addition, the temporary removal of physical features and objects enables user interaction in ways that may not emerge in their presence. Affordance of absence has the potential to more fully specify affordances for a given object and to help overcome functional fixedness. For the second approach, we describe insights from DIYers obtained from the “IKEA hackers” online community. We consider DIYers lead users for seeking out and exploiting product affordances, often transforming product functions dramatically. We also discuss their projects through the lens of affordance of absence. For the third approach, we outline our natural-language approach to affordance extraction, beginning with consumer product reviews provided for Canadian Tire, a major Canadian retailer. We describe efforts toward automatically identifying less common affordances, and the use of cue phrases to highlight insightful DIY transformations from the IKEA hackers community. Finally, we comment on the potential value of this work for product design in general.",

Current keyword search methods are inefficient primarily due to the knowledge gap between engineering and biology domains. To improve current keyword search methods, we propose an algorithm that extracts and organizes morphology-based solutions from biological text. WordNet is utilized to discover morphological solutions in biological text. The novel algorithm also adapts latent semantic analysis and the expectation–maximization algorithm to categorize morphological solutions and group biological text. We introduce a novel penalty function that reflects the distance between functions (problems) and morphologies (solutions). The penalty function allows the algorithm to extract morphological solutions directly related to a design problem. We compare the output of the algorithm to manually extracted solutions for validation. A case study is included to exemplify the utility of the developed algorithm. Upon implementation of the algorithm, engineering designers can discover innovative solutions in biological text in a straightforward, efficient manner.",

The requirements for such a system are included. Existing collaborative DSSs are shown to lack the capability to manipulate complex simulation-based relationships. On the other hand, advances within the machine learning in design community are shown to have a potential for providing, but have not yet addressed, simulation-based support for collaborative design processes. The developed SB-DSS is described in terms of its four principal components. First, the behavior-evaluation (BE) model is used to both structure individual, domain-specific decision models and organize these models into a collaborative decision model. Second, a probabilistic framework for the BE model enables management of the uncertainty inherent in learning and using simulation-based knowledge. Significantly, this framework provides a constraint satisfaction environment in which simulation-based knowledge is used. Third, a statistical neural network approach is used to capture simulation-based knowledge and build the probabilistic behavior models based on this knowledge. Fourth, since a probability distribution theory does not exist for the nonlinear neural network approaches, Monte Carlo simulation is introduced as a method to sample the trained neural networks and approximate the likelihoods of design variable values. Consequently, constraint satisfaction problem-solving capability is obtained. In addition, a mapping of the SB-DSS architecture onto a collaborative design agent framework is provided. Experimental evaluation of a prototype SB-DSS system is summarized, and performance of the SB-DSS with respect to search and usability metrics is documented. Initial results in developing the simulation-based support for collaborative design are encouraging. Lastly, a categorization of the machine learning approach and a critique of the proposed categorization scheme is presented.",

Therefore, to allow such diversity, we directed our attention to developmental processes in biology and proposed an adaptive-growth-type 3D representation based on evolutionary algorithms. Here, the adaptive-growth-type means the shape expressed in the process, which develops through interaction with an outside environment, like shape generation of a living organism in the natural world.

Physical modeling precedes the numerical simulation phase of finite element analysis and involves applying modeling idealizations to real world physical systems so that complex engineering problems are more amenable to numerical computation. In the paper, the nature of physical modeling is explored, a cognitive model of how engineers are thought to model complex problems is described and based on this model a knowledge-based modeling assistant is proposed. The AI approach taken is based on Chandrasekaran's propose-critique-modify design model adapted for the task of physical modeling. Within this framework, the AI paradigms of case-based reasoning, derivational analogy and model-based reasoning are exploited. By representing fundamental thermal modeling scenarios as cases, complex physical systems can be modeled in a piecewise fashion. Derivational analogy permits generative adaptation of retrieved cases by using model-based engineering traces thereby providing a basis for critiquing case solutions. An initial prototype is described which has been implemented for the domain of convection heat transfer analysis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract New methods of configuration analysis have recently emerged that are based on development trends characteristic of many technical systems. It has been found that though the development of any system aims to increase a combination of the performance, reliability and economy, actual design changes are frequently kept to a minimum to reduce the risk of failure. However, a strategy of risk reduction commits the designer to an existing configuration and an approved set of components and materials. Therefore, it is important to analyze the configurations, components, and materials of past designs so that good aspects may be reused and poor ones changed. A good configuration produces the required performance and reliability with maximum economy. These three evaluation criteria form the core of a configuration optimization tool called KATE, where known configurations are optimized producing a set of ranked trial solutions. The authors suggest that this solution set contains valuable design knowledge that can be reused. This paper briefly introduces a generic method of configuration evaluation and then describes the use of a self-organizing neural network, the Kohonen Feature Map, to analyze solution sets by performing an initial data reduction step, producing archetype solutions, and supporting qualitative clustering.",

    "abstract": "A generalized approach to fast interpretation of objects and their features has so far eluded researchers. In manufacturing, this interpretation can be approached from the vision point of view or from the CAD data perspective. Presently, CAD systems are widely used in several aspects of manufacturing production. It is therefore more efficient to use CAD data for object reasoning in manufacturing, especially when systems will eventually be data driven. Components can be modelled on a CAD system using various modelling techniques and the representation of their geometric information is still CAD system dependent. However, the advent of the Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (IGES) now makes it possible to represent CAD data in a neutral and standard manner. This paper describes a scheme for recognizing and representing features for CAD data extracted using the IGES interface. The concepts developed are based on graph-based feature representation, where features are represented by a set of faces as well as their topological adjacency. Strategies for classifying features and methods of decomposing a complicated feature into several simpler features for recognition purposes are discussed.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a framework and a prototype for designing Integrated Construction Management (ICM) software applications using reusable components. The framework supports the collaborative development of ICM software applications by a group of ICM application developers from a library of software components. The framework focuses on the use of an explicit software development process to capture and disseminate specialized knowledge that augments the description of the ICM software application components in a library. The importance of preserving and using this knowledge has become apparent with the recent trend of combining the software development process with the software application code. There are three main components in the framework: design patterns, design rationale model, and intelligent search algorithms. Design patterns have been chosen to represent, record, and reuse the recurring design structures and associated design experience in object-oriented software development. The Design Recommendation and Intent Model (DRIM) was extended in the current research effort to capture the specific implementation of reusable software components. DRIM provides a method by which design rationale from multiple ICM application designers can be partially generated, stored, and later retrieved by a computer system. To address the issues of retrieval, the paper presents a unique representation of a software component, and a search mechanism based on Reggia's setcover algorithm to retrieve a set of components that can be combined to get the required functionality is presented. This paper also details an initial, proof-of-concept prototype based on the framework. By supporting nonobtrusive capture as well as effective access of vital design rationale information regarding the ICM application development process, the framework described in this paper is expected to provide a strong information base for designing ICM software.",

    "abstract": "Concurrent Engineering needs a series of measures (or measurement criteria) that are distinct to each process, and a set of metrics to check (and validate) the outcome when two or more of the life-cycle processes are overlapped or required to be executed in parallel. Because product realization involves concurrent processes that occur across multiple disciplines and organizations, appropriate measures and the methods of qualifying metrics are essential. Inevitably, such concurrent processes generate design conflicts among multiple life-cycle concerns. Individual assurances of satisfying life-cycle design criterion (one at a time) do not capture the most important aspect of Concurrent Engineering—the system perspective—meaning achieving a well-balanced trade-off among the different life-cycle design measures. While satisfying life-cycle design measures in a serial manner only those, which are not in conflict, are occasionally met. The paper first describes a set of life-cycle measures and metrics and explains how those could be used for gaining operational excellence. Second, this paper provides an insight into the mechanisms (such as knowledge-based systems, rule-based simulation, and rule-based optimization) to ensure an effective trade-off across different life-cycle measures, customer requirements, and their inclusion into a product design, development, and delivery (PD 3 ) process.",

On the other hand, previous database-oriented design efforts have focused primarily on knowledge-poor databases of solutions, in which the traditional engineering handbook of solutions has simply been replaced by digital data. The challenge is to find a way to capture and apply the kind of case-based, design-dependent knowledge that structural engineers have traditionally used. The long-term results will be better structural designs and better structural designers. This paper discusses the character of the design-dependent knowledge in a structural engineering context, describes two initial applications of case-based reasoning to component design, and presents a general paradigm for a knowledge-based design system integrating rule-based and case-based reasoning.",

In particular, we study the problem of specifying an appropriate schedule for the tasks in the request for bids. We expect bids to require resource commitments, so we expect different settings of time windows to solicit different bids and different costs. The agent is interested in soliciting “desirable” bids, where desirable means bids that can be feasibly combined in a low-cost combination that covers the entire collection of tasks. Since the request for bids has to be issued before the agent can see any bids, in this decision process there is a probability of loss as well as a probability of gain. This requires the decision process to deal with the risk posture of the person or organization on whose behalf the agent is acting. We describe a model based on Expected Utility Theory and show how an agent can attempt to maximize its profits while managing its financial risk exposure. We illustrate the operation and properties of the model and discuss what assumptions are required for its successful integration in multiagent contracting applications.",

The solving of design problems frequently involves visual thinking, which has to do with the intensive use of visual knowledge like pictures, images, and other types of visual displays. The recognized power of typological knowledge in design problem solving is applied to support the exploration of a diversity of possible design solutions represented in a pictorial mode. The innovative use of computer science technologies enables a smooth link of visual typological knowledge with the design goals. Within the framework, a core technology was designed to respond to a designer's specific needs through dynamic user viewpoint generation, so that design solutions are associated with relevant (retrieved) visual typologies from the knowledge base. This has been achieved in a two-way process, in which the designer establishes an interactive dialogue with an experimental computerized framework.",

    "abstract": "In the construction industry, projects are becoming increasingly large and complex, necessitating multiple subcontractors. Traditional centralized coordination techniques used by general contractors become insufficient as subcontractors perform most work and provide their own resources. When subcontractors cannot provide enough resources, they hinder their own performance, that of other subcontractors, and ultimately the entire project. Thus, projects need a new distributed coordination approach wherein all of the concerned subcontractors can respond to changes and reschedule a project dynamically. This paper presents a new distributed coordination framework for project schedule changes (DCPSC) that is based on an agent-based negotiation approach wherein software agents evaluate the impact of changes, simulate decisions, and give advice on behalf of the human subcontractors. A case example demonstrates the significance of the DCPSC. It compares two centralized coordination methodologies used in current practice to the DCPSC framework. We demonstrate that our DCPSC framework always finds a solution that is better than or equal to any of two centralized coordination methodologies.",

The characteristics of the dependent and the primary descriptors are examined and their distinct roles in the design process are discussed. Term definitions concerning the information importance and the design effort are also introduced. The descriptors are used to form a matrix. A number of operations on this matrix results in its transformation, with the final matrix reflecting the quantitative relationship between the information importance and the design effort. From the aforementioned matrix, a unique sorted list for the primary design descriptors is produced. Following this list during descriptor instantiation ensures the production of design information of maximum importance with the least effort in the early design stages. The design of a belt conveyor is used as a basis for a better understanding of the theoretical analysis and for a demonstration of the use of the suggested descriptor list.",

Central to this improved capacity is the manner in which the organization's member agents are related. This study is an initial investigation into the role and potential of interagent ties in computational teaming. A computational team-based model, designed to more fully integrate agent ties, is created and presented. It is applied to a bulk manufacturing process-planning problem and its performance compared against a previously tested agent-based algorithm without these agent relationships. The performance of the new agent method showed significant improvement over the previous method: improving solution quality 280% and increasing solution identification per unit time an entire order of magnitude. A statistical examination of the new algorithm confirms that agent interdependencies are the strongest and most consistent performance effects leading to the observed improvements. This study illustrates that the interagent ties associated with team collaboration can be a highly effective method of improving computational design performance, and the results are promising indications that the application of organization constructs within a computational context may significantly improve computational problem solving.",

In developing such systems, the main focus has been on the enhanced retrieval performance of searches, and recent trends in QA systems center on the extraction of exact answers. However, when their usability was evaluated, some users indicated that they found it difficult to accept the answers because of the absence of supporting context and rationale. Current approaches to address this problem include providing answers with linking paragraphs or with summarizing extensions. Both methods are believed to be sufficient to answer questions seeking the names of objects or quantities that have only a single answer. However, neither method addresses the situation when an answer requires the comparison and integration of information appearing in multiple documents or in several places in a single document. This paper argues that coherent answer generation is crucial for such questions, and that the key to this coherence is to analyze texts to a level beyond sentence annotations. To demonstrate this idea, a prototype has been developed based on rhetorical structure theory, and a preliminary evaluation has been carried out. The evaluation indicates that users prefer to see the extended answers that can be generated using such semantic annotations, provided that additional context and rationale information are made available.",

To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a formal failure knowledge representation model combined with the structural decomposition of the complex system. The model defines the failure modes as the inherent properties of the physical entities at different hierarchical levels, and employs the individual color, unified color, and Boolean matrix of the polychromatic sets to represent the failure modes in terms of their interrelationships and their relations to the physical system. This method is a structure-based modeling technique that provides a simple, yet comprehensive framework to organize the failure modes and their causes and effects more systematically and completely. Using the iterative search process operated on the reasoning matrices, the end effects on the entire system can be achieved automatically, which allows for the consideration of both the single and multiple failures. An example is embedded in the description of the methodology for better understanding. Because of the powerful mathematical modeling capability of the polychromatic sets, the approach presented in this paper makes significant progress in FMEA formalization.",

There are two major questions related to them: (i) What way are smart design and smart systems enabled by artificial narrow, general, or super intelligence? and (ii) How can smart design be used in the realization of smart systems? and How can smart systems contribute to smart designing? A difficulty is that there are no exact definitions for these novel concepts in the literature. The endeavor to analyze the current situation and to answer the above questions stimulated an exploratory research whose first findings are summarized in this paper. Its first part elaborates on a plausible interpretation of the concept of smartness and provides an overview of the characteristics of smart design as a creative problem solving methodology supported by artificial intelligence. The second part exposes the paradigmatic features and system engineering issues of smart systems, which are equipped with application-specific synthetic system knowledge and reasoning mechanisms. The third part presents and elaborates on a conceptual model of AI-based couplings of smart design and smart systems. The couplings may manifest in various concrete forms in real life that are referred to as “connectors” in this paper. The principal types of connectors are exemplified and discussed. It has been found that smart design tends to manifest as a methodology of blue-printing smart systems and that smart systems will be intellectualized the enablers of implementation of smart design. Understanding the affordances of and creating proper connectors between smart design and smart systems need further explorative research.",

One path concerns analogically transferring within-domain properties to the design solution. The other path concerns mentally simulating end-user characteristics and preferences and inclusion of the user in the resulting design. Study 1 supported that random images led to increased outcome usefulness, and supported both hypothesized paths, by using within-domain products and end-user images as input. Study 2 showed that the image categories competed for attention, and that the within-domain product stimuli attracted the most attention and was considered the most inspirational to the designers. The practical use of the technique may lead to only marginally original products perhaps limiting its applicability to incremental innovation.",

Its intended usage is to help the engineer to choose the optimization approach when faced with a robust optimization problem. This paper demonstrates the usage of the method to find the most appropriate robust design optimization method to solve an engineering problem. Five robust design optimization methods, including a novel method, are compared in the demonstration of the comparison method. Four of the five compared methods involve surrogate models to reduce the computational cost of performing robust design optimization. The five methods are used to optimize several mathematical functions that should be similar to the engineering problem. The methods are then used to optimize the engineering problem to confirm that the most suitable optimization method was identified. The performance metrics used are the mean value and standard deviation of the robust optimum as well as an index that combines the required number of simulations of the original model with the accuracy of the obtained solution. These measures represent the accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of the compared methods. The results of the comparison show that sequential robust optimization is the method with the best balance between accuracy and number of function evaluations. This is confirmed by the optimizations of the engineering problem. The comparison also shows that the novel method is better than its predecessor is.",

When assessing these enhancements and their respective impacts on the climate, it is important that we also quantify the associated uncertainties. This is important to support an effective decision and policymaking process. However, such quantification of uncertainty is challenging, especially in a complex system that comprises multiple interacting components. The uncertainty quantification task can quickly become computationally intractable and cumbersome for one individual or group to manage. Recognizing the challenge of quantifying uncertainty in multicomponent systems, we utilize a divide-and-conquer approach, inspired by the decomposition-based approaches used in multidisciplinary analysis and optimization. Specifically, we perform uncertainty analysis and global sensitivity analysis of our multicomponent aviation system in a decomposition-based manner. In this work, we demonstrate how to handle a high-dimensional multicomponent interface using sensitivity-based dimension reduction and a novel importance sampling method. Our results demonstrate that the decomposition-based uncertainty quantification approach can effectively quantify the uncertainty of a feed-forward multicomponent system for which the component models are housed in different locations and owned by different groups.",

Despite numerous approaches for function modeling and modular product design (Srinivasan et al., 2012; Eckert, 2013; Vermaas, 2013) that have been developed in the last decades, carrying out an efficient product variants’ design process is still an open issue for many manufacturing companies. The proposed approaches offer numerous ways to model information about product functionality, but each approach is useful and particularly well suited for different applications and domains (Summers et al., 2013). The present research compares the existing approaches for product variants design and defines a function-based model to support product design and redesign according to a modular framework, merging qualitative technical issues with business-oriented evaluation. Such a framework has been used to develop a multiuser IT platform, composed of a knowledge-based engine and four different tools to support designers and engineers in product variants creation, management, and configuration, from product functional modeling to cost estimation and life cycle assessment. The proposed model has been tested on industrial cases in the context of household appliances. Experimental results demonstrates that, after a preliminary context analysis and a proper knowledge base creation, such a model supports a more conscious decision-making and promote collaboration within an interdisciplinary design team. Finally, the case study shows the necessity, but in the meanwhile the insufficiency, of a functional decomposition as the only representation viewpoint.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The standard penetration test (SPT) is the most common test conducted in the field, and it is used to determine in situ properties of different soils. Although it is a matter of debate, these tests are also used for the determination of the consistency of fine-grained soils, whereby the test results can also be utilized to establish numerous empirical correlations to predict the strength of soils in the field. In this study, unsupervised clustering algorithms were employed to classify the SPT standard penetration resistance value (SPT-N) in the field. In this scope, shear strength and liquidity index parameters were used to classify the SPT-N values by taking the classification system of Terzaghi and Peck (1967) into consideration. The results showed that the input parameters were successful for classifying the SPT-N value to an acceptable degree of strength attribute. Therefore, in cases where the SPT tests are unreliable or could not be performed, laboratory tests on undisturbed specimens can give valuable information regarding the consistency and SPT-N value of the soil specimen under investigation. Data in this study is based on several tests that were conducted in a region; nevertheless, it is advised that the results of this study should be evaluated using global data.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A novel swarm intelligence approach for combinatorial optimization is proposed, which we call probability increment based swarm optimization (PIBSO). The population evolution mechanism of PIBSO is depicted. Each state in search space has a probability to be chosen. The rule of increasing the probabilities of states is established. Incremental factor is proposed to update probability of a state, and its value is determined by the fitness of the state. It lets the states with better fitness have higher probabilities. Usual roulette wheel selection is employed to select states. Population evolution is impelled by roulette wheel selection and state probability updating. The most distinctive feature of PIBSO is because roulette wheel selection and probability updating produce a trade-off between global and local search; when PIBSO is applied to solve the printed circuit board assembly optimization problem (PCBAOP), it performs superiorly over existing genetic algorithm and adaptive particle swarm optimization on length of tour and CPU running time, respectively. The reason for having such advantages is analyzed in detail. The success of PCBAOP application verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of PIBSO and shows that it is a good method for combinatorial optimization in engineering.",

In this particular work, we use a custom parametric chair design program to produce a large set of chairs that are tested for their physical properties using ergonomic simulations. Design schemata are found from this set of chairs and used to generate new designs by placing constraints on the generating parameters used in the program. The schemata are found by training decision trees on the chair data sets. These are automatically reverse engineered by examining the structure of the trees and creating a schema for each positive leaf. By finding a range of schemata, rather than a single solution, we maintain a diverse design space. This paper also describes how schemata for different properties can be combined to generate new designs that possess all properties required in a design brief. The method is shown to consistently produce viable designs, covering a large range of our design space, and demonstrates a significant time saving over generate and test using the same program and simulations.",

Toward solving these issues, this paper emphasized the using of data mining and machine learning techniques to improve the project characteristic understanding process. The work presented in this paper proposed an automatic model and some analytical approaches for learning and predicting the characteristics of engineering service projects. To evaluate the model and demonstrate its functionalities, an industrial data set from the aerospace sector is considered as a the case study.

    "abstract": "Abstract Several industrial systems are characterized by high nonlinearities with wide operating ranges and large set point changes. Identification and representation of these systems represent a challenge, especially for control engineers. Multimodel technique is one effective approach that can be used to describe nonlinear systems through the combination of several submodels, where each is contributing to the output with a certain degree of validity. One major concern in this technique, especially for systems with unknown operating conditions, is the partitioning of the system's operating space and thus the identification of different submodels. This paper proposes a three-stage approach to obtain a multimodel representation of a nonlinear system. A reinforced combinatorial particle swarm optimization and hybrid K-means are used to determine the number of submodels and their respective parameters. The proposed method automatically optimizes the number of submodels with respect to the submodel complexity. This allows operating space partition and generation of a parsimonious number of submodels without prior knowledge. The application of this approach on several examples, including a continuous stirred tank reactor, demonstrates its effectiveness.",

Among these approaches, it is worth mentioning the TRIZ-based frameworks such as the Inventive Design Methodology (IDM), where the Problem Graph method is used to formulate a problem. However, the application of IDM is time-consuming due to the construction of a complete map to clarify a problem situation. Therefore, the Inverse Problem Graph (IPG) method has been introduced within the IDM framework to enhance its agility. Nevertheless, the manual gathering of essential information, including parameters and concepts, requires effort and time. This paper integrates the neural network doc2vec and machine learning algorithms as Artificial Intelligence methods into a graphical method inspired by the IPG process. This integration can facilitate and accelerate the development of inventive solutions by extracting parameters and concepts in the inventive design process. The method has been applied to develop a new lattice structure solution in the material field.",

And it is of profound significance to improve process executability, reduce environmental pollution, decrease manufacturing cost, and improve product quality. In this paper, based on the perceptual data of parts machining process, considering the diversity of process planning schemes and factors affecting the green manufacturing, a multi-level evaluation criteria system is established from the aspects of processing time, manufacturing cost and processing quality, resource utilization, and environmental protection. An integrated evaluation method of low-carbon process planning schemes based on digital twins is constructed. Each index value is normalized by the polarized data processing method, its membership is determined by the fuzzy statistical method, and the combination weight of each index is determined by the hierarchical entropy weight method to realize the organic combination of theoretical analysis, practical experience, evaluation index, and process factors. The comprehensive evaluation of multi-process planning schemes is realized according to the improved fuzzy operation rules, and the best process planning solution is finally determined. Finally, taking the low-carbon process planning of an automobile part as an example, the feasibility and effectiveness of this method are verified by the evaluation of three alternative process planning schemes. The results show that the method adopted in this paper is more in line with the actual production and can provide enterprises with the optimal processing scheme with economic and environmental benefits, which may be helpful for more data-driven manufacturing process optimization in the future.",

The method builds on natural language processing to determine change candidates from textual data and uses dependency modeling to reveal direct and indirect change propagation paths arising from the change candidates. The method was applied in a case example where 3665 YouTube comments on a diesel engine were analyzed. Based on the results, two engine components were recommended for design change with six others predicted as likely to be affected through change propagation. The findings suggest that the method can be used to aid decision quality in product planning through a better understanding of the change impact associated with the opportunities identified.",

These benefits include reduced rework, improved design quality, and retention of knowledge to use in future projects. Previous studies that introduce SBCE in practice achieved success and had very positive future outlooks, but SBCE encounters opposition because its core procedures appear wasteful as designers must divide their time among many designs throughout the process, most of which are ultimately not used. The impacts of these procedures can be explored in detail through open-source computational tools, but currently few exist to do this. This work introduces the Point/Set-Organized Research Teams (PSORT) modeling platform to simulate and analyze a set-based design process. The approach is used to verify statements made about SBCE and investigate its effects on project quality. Such an SBCE platform enables process exploration without needing to commit many projects and resources to any given design.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The use of local natural and recycled feedstock is promising for sustainable construction. However, unlike versatile engineered bricks, natural and recycled feedstock involves design challenges due to their stochastic, sequential, and heterogeneous nature. For example, the practical use of stone masonry is limited, as it still relies on human experts with holistic domain knowledge to determine the sequential organization of natural stones with different sizes/shapes. Reinforcement learning (RL) is expected to address such design challenges, as it allows artificial intelligence (AI) agents to autonomously learn design policy, that is, identifying the best design decision at each time step. As a proof-of-concept RL framework for design automation involving heterogeneous feedstock, a stone masonry design framework is presented. The proposed framework is founded upon a virtual design environment, MasonTris , inspired by the analogy between stone masonry and Tetris. MasonTris provides a Tetris-like virtual environment combined with a finite element analysis (FEA), where AI agents learn effective design policies without human intervention. Also, a new data collection policy, almost-greedy policy , is designed to address the sparsity of feasible designs for faster/stable learning. As computation bottleneck occurs when parallel agents evaluate designs with different complexities, a modification of the RL framework is proposed that FEA is held until training data are retrieved for training. The feasibility and adaptability of the proposed framework are demonstrated by continuously improving stone masonry design policy in simplified design problems. The framework can be generalizable to different natural and recycled feedstock by incorporating more realistic assumptions, opening opportunities in design automation for sustainability.",

The incentive for developing the technique is its potential for rapid execution of a simulation through parallel processing, and facilitation of the development and improvement of models particularly where there is limited theory describing the dependence between component processes. A brief introduction is provided to a radial-Gaussian neural network architecture and training process, the system adopted for the work presented in this paper. A description of the basic approach proposed for applying this technology to simulation is then described. This involves the use of a modularized neural network approach to model construction and the prediction of the occurrence of events using information retained from several previous states of the simulation. A class of earth-moving systems, comprising a push-dozer and a fleet of scrapers, is used as the basis for assessing the viability and performance of the proposed approach. A series of experiments show the neural network to be capable of both capturing the characteristic behavior and making an accurate prediction of production rates of scraper-based earth-moving systems. The paper concludes with an indication of some areas for further development and evaluation of the technique.",

This paper describes a new efficient and robust approach which is unique to those utilized by traditional heuristic and optimization resource leveling techniques. The Resource Leveling Artificial Neural Network (RLANN) exploits advantages of both Hopfield networks and competition-based artificial neural networks. The universal scheme of the RLANN is applicable to construction project networks produced with Critical Path Method (CPM), in forms of either arrow or precedence diagrams. The scheme is comprised of two layers, an input and a competition layer, of artificial node matrices fully connected by links. Solving mechanisms inside the RLANN are based on an equation of motion and a competition strategy that control the level of daily resource usage. While the equation of motion governs activities to be shifted within schedule constraints, the competition process finds the best positions for the activities to achieve optimum results. The approach is simple and can be implemented on either a personal computer or a parallel processing device. The solutions produced are comparable to, or better than, those generated by other heuristic or optimization techniques. This paper describes the development of the RLANN, its solving mechanisms, and its uses in construction resource leveling problems. The comparison of the result of the RLANN to those of other traditional techniques is also included. The conclusions highlight the applicability of this model to other civil engineering problems.",

Rather than adapting the time-space network formulation typically used in Operations Research, we propose a discrete dynamic network to represent a scheduled service network. In a discrete dynamic network, there are finite, discrete, predetermined possibilities for moving from one vertex to another. Visiting a vertex has a cost (possibly zero), which may depend both on how the vertex was reached and how it will be left. We describe the DYNET search algorithm for finding optimal paths in discrete dynamic networks. DYNET has been implemented in a working system (TRAINS) which searches the entire Dutch railway services network. An optimal path in a discrete dynamic network makes us arrive at our destination as early as possible (given our planned earliest departure time), and given this earliest arrival time (eat) , will allow us to leave as late as possible, thereby guaranteeing a shortest path relative to the eat. DYNET first conducts a forward search to find the earliest possible arrival time, then a backward search which uses results of the forward search, to find the latest departure to arrive at that eat . Various AI techniques (symmetries, abstraction spaces, distance estimates, etc.) improve the performance of DYNET .",

    "abstract": "Within the engineering design community there is support for further research into the development of improved approaches to design management. Such research has lead to coordination being identified as an important and pervasive characteristic of many existing approaches (e.g., concurrent engineering and work-flow management). In this article, operational design coordination is proposed as the basis for an improved approach. This article also presents a novel integrated approach that incorporates the key elements of operational design coordination: coherence, communication, task management, resource management, schedule management, and real-time support. Through unifying these key elements, this approach provides an integrated means of managing design in a controlled and harmonious fashion. The approach also provides knowledge of the constituent techniques involved in operational design coordination, the interrelationships and dynamic interactions between them, and the knowledge used and maintained within and between them. The approach has been realized within an agent-oriented system called the Design Coordination System, which provides a systematic means of simultaneously coordinating operational management tasks and technical design tasks. To evaluate the approach, the system has been applied to an industrial case study involving the computational process of turbine blade design. This application has been shown to enable the structured undertaking of interrelated tasks by allocating and using resources of varying performance efficiency in an optimized fashion in accordance with dynamically derived schedules in a coherent, appropriate, and timely manner. This is achieved by managing tasks, their dependencies, and the information required to undertake them. In addition, the approach enables and sustains the continuous optimized use of resources by monitoring, forecasting, and disseminating resource performance efficiency. The approach facilitates dynamic scheduling and the subsequent enactment of the resulting schedules. Decision making for rescheduling is also incorporated within the approach such that it is only performed as and when appropriate. If rescheduling is performed, it is done so in parallel with task enactment such that resources continue to be utilized in an optimized manner.",

In short, PSMs provide a solid foundation for creating a semantic layer supporting planetary-scale networks. Moreover, within a world-scale network where billions services are used and created by billions of parties in ad hoc dynamic fashion we believe that PSM-based mechanisms provide the only viable approach to dealing the sheer scale systematically. Our current experiments in this area are based upon a generic ontology for describing Web services derived from earlier work on PSMs. We outline how platforms based on our ontology can support large-scale networked interactivity in three main areas. Within a large European project we are able to map business level process descriptions to semantic Web service descriptions, to enable business experts to manage and use enterprise processes running in corporate information technology systems. Although highly successful, Web service-based applications predominately run behind corporate firewalls and are far less pervasive on the general Web. Within a second large European project we are extending our semantic service work using the principles underlying the Web and Web 2.0 to transform the Web from a Web of data to one where services are managed and used at large scale. Significant initiatives are now underway in North America, Asia, and Europe to design a new Internet using a “clean-slate” approach to fulfill the demands created by new modes of use and the additional 3 billion users linked to mobile phones. Our investigations within the European-based Future Internet program indicate that a significant opportunity exists for our PSM-derived work to address the key challenges currently identified: scalability, trust, interoperability, pervasive usability, and mobility. We outline one PSM-derived approach as an exemplar.",

The course of designing is determined by the interaction between cooperating specialized agents.

The notions of a valid design solution and a design solution consistent with the design criteria are also introduced.

    "abstract": "Abstract In the product design realm, designers often use presentations to convey certain ideas about a product or a specific stage of the design process. The popular forms of presentation include verbal pitching, two-dimensional drawing, and prototyping. The clients, investigators, and other audiences rely on such presentations to evaluate an idea. Popular idea evaluation assessment tools, such as the consensual assessment technique, utilize such interactions. On the other hand, numerous pieces of literature state that the audiences are heavily influenced by the quality of presentation when evaluating the worth of the product being presented. In this study, we examine if the audience is able to discriminate between the quality of the presentation and the quality of the idea being presented. A total of 613 ideas were evaluated over a 4-year period during a specific product design class at different phases in the design process. The result shows that no matter the kind of presentation tool used, the presentation quality ratings and the idea value ratings had a very strong positive correlation despite the explicit instructions to reviewers to separate presentation quality from concept quality. Our additional analysis shows that such a pattern did not change during the different phases of the design process.",

    "abstract": "Abstract With growing city density and mass gatherings held all over the world in urban spaces, crowd disasters have been happening each year. In considering the avoidance of crowd disasters and the reduction of fatalities, it is important to analyze the efficient spatial layout of the public space in situations of high crowd density. Compared with traditional empirical design methods, computational approaches have better abilities for quantitative analysis and are gradually being adopted in the planning and management of the urban public space. In this paper, we investigated the official documents, publicly available videos, and materials of the Shanghai waterfront crowd disaster which happened on December 31, 2014. Based on the investigation, a detailed site survey was conducted and pedestrian flow data were acquired. To test the influence of different spatial layouts, an agent-based simulator is built, following the ASPFver4.0 (Agent Simulator of Pedestrian Flow) pedestrian walking rules. With the surveyed pedestrian flow data, the original spatial layout of the Shanghai Bund waterfront together with five other comparison scenarios are tested, including both space design and crowd management improvements. In the simulation results, the efficiencies of different space design and crowd management solutions are compared. The results show that even simple crowd control measures such as capacity reserve and more proper route planning will allow for a positive improvement in crowd safety. The results also compare the efficiency of different spatial operations and give general suggestions to the problems urban public space designers should consider in high-density environments.",

These facilities provide tools and machines that enable making and tinkering; and while the offerings, organizational and operational models, and outreach of the academic makerspaces can vary widely across institutions, their common value proposition is enabling innovation, entrepreneurship, and hands-on project-based learning and these studies are largely qualitative and exploratory by nature. Through a case study, this paper presents an in-depth analysis and insights on the users and usage of an academic makerspace. Using the data generated by and collected from the users of an academic makerspace, we evaluate the effects of having access to the makerspace on users' teaching and learning experiences, and their satisfaction with the offerings. Our results show that attracting courses and educators to the facilities played a strong role in growing the user base, courses and teaching activities introduced new teaching and learning activities to adopt the offerings, group and project work is positively impacted, and the users are very satisfied with the facilities and having the access to its offerings. The analysis also showed that the demand for the offerings can be challenging to manage during certain periods, most of the users come from three departments (mechanical, electrical, civil engineering), and the diversity of the users could improve with the introduction of new offerings, such as a wet lab for bio/chemistry experiments and a food lab to tinker with food processing and preparation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Functional design is regarded as a design activity primarily aimed at clarifying customer needs, and developing the functional architecture and solution concepts for a system under development. Existing functional design approaches are mainly focused on how to assist designers in searching for solution principles for desired products, which, however, do not adequately take into account the interactions between a smart system under development and its environment, and cannot explicitly represent the complex functional logic of the system, resulting in that they cannot effectively assist designers in the functional design of smart systems. Therefore, this paper proposes a scenario-integrated approach for functional design of smart systems to address the above issues. Based on the concept of scenario in software engineering, the proposed approach explicitly elaborates how to employ scenarios to express subjective customer needs and how to generate the functional architectures and the corresponding solution concepts through a structured process. The functional design of the automated doors-unlocking system of a smart vehicle is employed to illustrate the proposed approach, which also demonstrates that the proposed approach is suitable for functional design of smart systems.",

Boundary shapes from the built environment and nature are studied in a morphospace composed of two axes: one corresponding to each measure, to yield a typological classification of form. It is shown that the covariance between distance and directionality is mediated by the topological structure of embedded main circulation. Three kinds of circulation—elementary, ring, and linear—thus affect three fundamentally different balancing conditions between distance and directionality in boundary shapes. The analysis of large samples of shapes thus far demonstrates a “unique shape” status, where no two different shapes have the same pair of relative distance and directional fragmentation values.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Functional modeling is an effective method of depicting products in the design process. Using this approach, product architecture, concept generation, and physical modeling all contribute to the design process to generate a result full of quality and functionality. The functional basis approach provides taxonomy of uniform vocabulary to produce function structures with consistent functions (verbs) and flows (nouns). Material and energy flows dominate function structures in the mechanical engineering domain with only a small percentage including signal flows. Research suggests that the signal flow gap is due to the requirement of “carrier” flows of either material or energy to transport the signals between functions. This research suggests that incorporating controls engineering methodologies may increase the number of signal flows in function structures. We show correlations between the functional modeling and controls engineering in four facets: schematic similarities, performance matching through flows, mathematical function creation using bond graphs, and isomorphic matching of the aforementioned characteristics allows for analogical solutions. Controls systems use block diagrams to represent the sequential steps of the system. These block diagrams parallel the function structures of engineering design. Performance metrics between the two domains can be complimentary when decomposed down to nondimensional engineering units. Mathematical functions of the actions in controls systems can resemble the functional basis functions with bond graphs by identifying characteristic behavior of the functions on the flows. Isomorphic matching, using the schematic diagrams, produces analogies based upon similar functionality and target performance metrics. These four similarities bridge the mechanical and electrical domains via the controls domain. We provide concepts and contextualization for the methodology using domain-agnostic examples. We conclude with suggestion of pathways forward for this preliminary research.",

Dynamically after the entrance of each new online input datum, the code book of nonrandom weights and other important information about online data as essentially important information are updated and stored in the memory. Consequently, the exclusive threshold of the data is calculated based on the essentially important information, and the data is clustered. Then, the network of clusters is updated. After learning, the model assigns a class label to the unlabeled data by considering a linear activation function and the exclusive threshold. Finally, the number of clusters and density of each cluster are updated. The accuracy of the proposed model is measured through the number of clusters, the quantity of correctly classified nodes, and F -measure. Briefly, in order to predict the survival time, the F -measure is 100% of the Iris, Musk2, Arcene, and Yeast data sets and 99.96% of the Spambase data set from the University of California at Irvine Machine Learning Repository; and the superior F -measure results in between 98.14% and 100% accuracies for the breast cancer data set from the University of Malaya Medical Center.

Such a framework brings forward the need for formal languages in which to specify the vehicles that compose a team, the scenario in which they will operate, and the mission to be performed. This paper introduces the Scenario Description Language (SDL) and the Team Description Language (TDL), two Extensible Markup Language based dialects that compose the static components necessary for representing scenario and mission knowledge. SDL provides a specification of physical scenario and global operational constraints, while TDL defines the team of vehicles, as well as team-specific operational restrictions. The dialects were defined using Extensible Markup Language schemas, with all required information being integrated in the definitions. An interface was developed and incorporated into the framework, allowing for the creation and edition of SDL and TDL files. Once the information is specified, it can be used in the framework, thus facilitating environment and team specification and deployment. A survey answered by practitioners and researchers shows that the satisfaction with SDL+TDL is elevated (the overall evaluation of SDL+TDL achieved a score of 4 out of 5, with 81%/78.6% of the answers ≥4); in addition, the usability of the interface was evaluated, achieving a score of 86.7 in the System Usability Scale survey. These results imply that SDL+TDL is flexible enough to represent scenarios and teams, through a user-friendly interface.",

Despite the centrality of the concept, a systematic, rigorous analysis of the utility of function and its different conceptualizations is missing in the engineering design literature. This paper addresses this challenge. We investigate the utility of function and its different meanings in the following engineering design contexts: malfunction explanation, innovative design, redesign, and routine design. This analysis provides theoretical justification for the current engineering practice of accepting ambiguity of functional descriptions and for methods to translate and/or convert functional descriptions across engineering design frameworks. We show that the utility of specific meanings of function is highly task dependent, identify novel roles for functional descriptions in engineering design, and present methodological implications for translation methods for functional descriptions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Requirement planning is one of the most critical tasks in the product development process. Despite its significant impact on the outcomes of the design process, engineering requirement planning is often conducted in an ad hoc manner without much structure. In particular, the requirement planning phase suffers from a lack of quantifiable measures for evaluating the quality of the generated requirements and also a lack of structure and formality in representing engineering requirements. The main objective of this research is to develop a formal Web Ontology Language ontology for standard representation of engineering requirements. The proposed ontology uses explicit semantics that makes the ontology amenable to automated reasoning. To demonstrate how the proposed ontology can support requirement analysis and evaluation in engineering design, three possible services enabled by the ontology are introduced in this paper. These services are information content measurement, specificity and completeness analysis, and requirement classification. The proposed ontology and its associated algorithms and tools are validated experimentally in this work.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Documents are a useful source of expert knowledge in organizations and can be used to foresee, in an earlier stage of a product's life cycle, potential issues and solutions that might occur in later stages of its life cycle. In this research, these stages are, respectively, design and assembly. Even if these documents are available online, it is rather difficult for users to access the knowledge contained in these documents. It is therefore desirable to automatically extract the knowledge contained in these documents and store them in a computer accessible or manipulable form. This paper describes an approach for the first step in this acquisition process: automatically identifying segments of documents that are relevant to aircraft assembly, so that they can be further processed for acquiring expert knowledge. Such identification of relevant segments is necessary for avoiding processing of unrelated information that is costly and possibly distracting for domain relevance. The approach to extracting relevant segments has two steps. The first step is the identification of sentences that form a coherent segment of text, within which the topic does not shift. The second step is to classify segments that are within the topics of interest for knowledge acquisition, that is, aircraft assembly in this instance. These steps filter out segments that are unrelated, and therefore need not be processed for subsequent knowledge acquisition. The steps are implemented by understanding the contents of documents. Using methods of discourse analysis, in particular, discourse representation theory, a list of discourse entities is obtained. The difference in discourse entities between sentences is used to distinguish between segments. The list of discourse entities in a segment is compared against a domain ontology for classification. The implementation and results of validation on sample texts for these steps are described.",

Currently, the mainstream method to ascertain the MRR through offline measurements proves time inefficient and struggles to represent process variability accurately. An efficient MRR prediction model based on stacking ensemble learning that integrates models with disparate architectures was proposed in this study. First, the processing signals collected during wafer polishing, as available in the PHM2016 dataset, were analyzed and preprocessed to extract statistical and neighbor domain features. Subsequently, Pearson correlation coefficient analysis (PCCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) were employed to fuse the extracted features. Ultimately, random forest (RF), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and backpropagation neural network (BPNN) with hyperparameters optimized by the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm were integrated to establish an MRR prediction model based on stacking ensemble learning. The developed model was verified on the PHM2016 benchmark test set, and a Mean Square Error (MSE) of 7.72 and a coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) of 95.82% were achieved. This indicates that the stacking ensemble learning based model, integrated with base models of disparate architectures, offers considerable potential for real-time MRR prediction in the CMP process of semiconductor wafers.",

A neural network model together with feature-based model translates the input pattern into a preliminary boundary representation (B-rep).

A feasible assembly plan that minimizes tool changes and subassembly reorientations is generated from the system. A robust part collision detection algorithm to generate the precedence relationships among the assembly's components is included in the system. By contrast with many assembly planning systems that used a prolonged question-and-answering session or required knowledge beyond what is typically available in the design database, an automated assembly planning system presented here draws input relationships directly from the conceptual design and the geometry of the assembly. The system developed under this study extracts all reasoning information from the product model and permits the components to be assembled in a multitude of directions. Several experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the designed assembly planning system.",

ANNs demonstrate problem solving characteristics not inherent in KBSs, including an ability to learn from example, develop a generalized solution applicable to a range of examples of the problem, and process information extremely rapidly. In this respect, KBSs and ANNs are complementary, rather than alternatives, and may be integrated into a system that exploits the advantages of both technologies.

This paper presents a pilot system that is being developed based on such a vision. The system has adopted minimum commitment modelling and incremental refinement as the guiding principles. The representation of geometric configuration is based on a parametric and constraint-based geometric design model, and provides a uniform representation of the approximate and precise size and location parameters. A constraint-based mechanism has been developed for processing geometric information. The use of the system in assisting the development of a geometric configuration is also demonstrated. Finally, features and limitations of the system as well as relations to relevant works are discussed, and based on this a number of key research directions are established.",

One aspect of spatial reasoning is visualizing and constructing three-dimensional (3D) solid objects from two-dimensional (2D) projections. To assist in teaching this to engineering students, an instructional software system is being developed at the University of Illinois. This instructional software system is comprised of the Visual Sweeper and the Visual Teacher. The Visual Sweeper is a geometric framework for solving missing view problems. In missing view problems, students create 3D solid objects from two 2D projections by applying operations inverse to orthographic projection. The Visual Teacher, which is the focus of this article, is an intelligent critiquing and tutoring module that gives feedback to the student regarding partial solutions to missing view problems. The Visual Teacher is comprised of a Recognizer and a Critiquer. The Recognizer identifies which solution solid the student's partial solution is closest to. Based on the solution solid and a student's partial solution, the Criti-quer gives critique and advice to the student. The Recognizer is based on an algorithm for bipartite graph matching, while the Critiquer uses a rule-based approach. This paper describes the Visual Teacher, gives examples of how it can be used, presents preliminary evaluation results, and discusses the system's assumptions and limitations.",

In a modern manufacturing environment, a process planning system consists of highly trained people and complex software. The plans prepared by a process planning system are not always executed as planned. It is useful if the system can discover why plans fail, when they do fail. In order to learn why plans fail, the system must analyse a number of plans, both successful and unsuccessful, to find patterns in the failures of plans. This type of analysis is difficult for people, who are much better at analysing single events than multiple events. The aim of the project described here is to design and implement a computer program which will help human planners in a process planning system to understand why plans fail. To achieve this aim, a program called IMAFO (Intelligent MAnufacturing FOreman) has been developed. IMAFO uses decision tree induction to analyse examples of both successful and unsuccessful plans. The difficulties presented by this application are discussed and solutions are presented. Problems addressed include finding an appropriate set of attributes for describing the plans, using data efficiently, consolidating input from distinct sources, and presenting decision trees in an understandable form.

This paper describes our efforts to remove the technological barrier in mechanisms design automation. Although the ideas presented apply to automation of mechanisms design in general, the paper discusses the development of an expert system for a particular sub-set of mechanisms called Dwell mechanisms. Many essential and desirable motion characteristics of mechanisms are so implicit that they are difficult to control by analytical methods. By systematically and extensively studying the entire motion characteristics of hundreds of linkages, a comprehensive classification system and heuristics were developed. This qualitative classification scheme led to a finite set of linkage models that cover the entire design space in the sense that any possible design falls under one or more of the models. Our system, called Dwell-Expert, incorporates this design expertise to select the best linkage model for a given set of design specifications and to compare that model against alternatives. The new design methodology and its implementation in AGNESS (A Generalized Network-based Expert System Shell) are explained. A design example is also presented. Our system can reduce even an experienced designer’s initial-design time from a day or more to a minute or less, assuming specifications have already been formulated.

In the field of constraint satisfaction, the major focus has been on finding solutions to difficult problems. However, many real-life configuration problems, although not extremely complicated, have a huge number of solutions, few of which are acceptable from a practical standpoint. In this paper we present a value ordering heuristic for constraint solving that attempts to guide search toward solutions that are acceptable. More specifically, by considering weights that are assigned to values and sets of values, the heuristic can guide search toward solutions for which the total weight is within an acceptable interval. Experiments with random constraint satisfaction problems demonstrate that, when a problem has numerous solutions, the heuristic makes search extremely efficient even when there are relatively few solutions that fall within the interval of acceptable weights. In these cases, an algorithm that is very effective for finding a feasible solution to a given constraint satisfaction problem (the “maintained arc consistency” algorithm or MAC) does not find a solution in the same weight interval within a reasonable time when it is run without the heuristic.",

    "abstract": "A crucial early stage in the engineering design process is the conceptual design phase, during which an initial solution design is generated. The quality of this initial design has a great bearing on the quality and success of the produced artefact. Typically, the knowledge required to perform this task is only acquired through many years of experience, and so is often at a premium. This has led to a number of attempts to automate this phase using intelligent computer systems. However, the knowledge of how to generate designs has proved difficult to acquire directly from human experts, and as a result, is often unsatisfactory in these systems. The application of inductive machine learning techniques to the acquisition of this sort of knowledge has been advocated as one approach to overcoming the difficulties surrounding its capture. Rather than acquiring the knowledge from human experts, the knowledge would be inferred automatically from a set of examples of the design process. This paper describes the authors' investigations into the general viability of this approach in the context of one particular conceptual design task, that of the design of fluid power circuits. The analysis of a series of experiments highlights a number of issues that would seem to arise regardless of the working domain or particular machine learning algorithm used. These issues, presented and discussed here, cast serious doubts upon the practicality of such an approach to knowledge acquisition, given the current state of the art.",

    "abstract": "Abstract During the 1980s, a community of artificial intelligence researchers became interested in formalizing problem solving methods (PSMs) as part of an effort called “second-generation expert systems.” We provide an example of how we are applying second-generation expert systems concepts in an agent-based system for space flight operations, the orbital communications adapter mirroring system (OCAMS), which was developed in the Brahms multiagent framework. Brahms modeling language provides an ontology for simulating work practices, including groups, agents, activities, communications, movements, and geographic areas. Activities are a behavioral unit of analysis to be contrasted with tasks , a functional unit of analysis. Problem solving occurs in the context of activities in the service of tasks; appropriate PSMs depend on the context: which people/roles are participating, what tools are available, how the results will be evaluated, and so forth. A work practice simulation facilitates designing workflow tools that appropriately interact with the physical and organizational context in which work occurs. OCAMS was developed using a simulation-to-implementation methodology, in which a prototype workflow tool was embedded in a Brahms simulation of how people would use the tool. The reusable components in a workflow system like OCAMS include entire “problem solvers” (e.g., a planning subsystem), interoperability frameworks, and agents that inspect and change the world. Thus, a tool kit for building workflow tools requires more than a library of PSMs, which play a relatively small role in the overall multiagent, systems-integration architecture. Our research concern has shifted to situations that may arise that are outside the OCAMS' capability. In practical decision making, people must reflect on the validity of their models. As programs becoming actors in the workplace, we need to develop systems that help people to understand the limitations of the models that drive the automated operations, which means in part detecting when the formalizations in the system are inadequate.",

    "abstract": "Abstract When developing a better understanding of the design process there are several possible approaches to choose from. Many studies are based on novice designers (e.g., students) or designers of relatively modest talents. By contrast, some studies have queried designers who are considered to have outstanding and exceptional ability in order to gain an understanding of design at the highest level that it is practiced. The study reported here adopts yet another approach by exploring how design processes are perceived by design educators. The approach is motivated by the observation that teaching design requires consciously distilling the essence of the design process for the students, observing students during their design process and guiding them through the process. As a result, design teachers tend to develop a more articulate view of design processes than most other designers. Nineteen design teachers are interviewed using general topics as discussion points. Such an approach is invaluable when exploring more abstract research questions such as the notion of design processes. This approach differs from more controlled approaches (e.g., protocol analysis) in that it accepts that the data obtained are partially driven by negotiation between the researchers and the participants, and that the discussions are largely stories or narratives about design and designing. The resulting data illustrate that design processes are interpreted, articulated, and understood in a variety of ways by different teachers. These data and subsequent results tell us in rich detail about designing and design teaching, and as a result extend our understanding of the design process.",

In contrast to studies conducted i n vitro settings, this study emphasizes the importance of studying analogies, metaphors, and similes in a natural setting. All similarity relationships were coded according to their type, the level of expertise, range, frequency, goal, value judgment, and depth. The results indicate that analogies, metaphors, and similes were used spontaneously and without any difficulty by both reviewers and students. Reviewers, however, were almost twice as likely to evoke similarities. Metaphor was the most frequently used similarity relationship among the three. It was found that there was a significant relationship between the level of expertise and type of similarity, with students more likely to use analogies and less likely to use similes. It was also found that goal is the most important factor, with a significant relation to all other variables, and that embodiment is often invoked in both students’ and reviewers’ metaphors. We conclude that design education should take full advantage of students’ natural ability to benefit from similarity relationships.",

A software application named CoStorm is developed.

Researchers have simplified complexities associated with PCB assembly; however, they have overlooked hardware constraints, such as pick-and-place restrictions and simultaneous pickup restrictions. In this study, a hybrid group search optimizer (HGSO) was proposed. Assembly optimization of PCBs for a multihead placement machine is segmented into three problems: the (1) auto nozzle changer (ANC) assembly problem, (2) nozzle setup problem, and (3) component pick-and-place sequence problem. The proposed HGSO proportionally applies a modified group search optimizer (MGSO), random-key integer programming, and assigned number of nozzles to an ANC to solve the component picking problem and minimize the number of nozzle changes, and the place order is treated as a traveling salesman problem. Nearest neighbor search is used to generate an initial place order, which is then improved using a 2-opt method, where chaos local search and a population manager improve efficiency and population diversity to minimize total assembly time. To evaluate the performance of the proposed HGSO, real-time PCB data from a plant were examined and compared with data obtained by an onsite engineer and from other related studies. The results revealed that the proposed HGSO has the lowest total assembly time, and it can be widely employed in general multihead placement machines.",

Decision makers spend time on identifying the decisions that will be taken for the whole of the crisis management, and on anticipating the preparation of these decisions, ensuring that they have time to properly prepare all decisions to be taken and, be able to implement them as fast as possible. However, the context and the characteristics of the crisis make the decision process complicated because there is no specific methodology to anticipate these decisions and properly manage collaboration with the other protagonists. There is also the pressure of time, a significant stress and, the emotional impact on the decision maker that lead to losing objectivity in decision making. We understand so that the right decision will be greatly facilitated and enhanced by the development of an adequate tool and process for decision-making. This tool must respect methods of the emergency department considered, and highlight the importance of experience feedback referencing to past cases, especially success and failures. We propose in this paper, software in order to handle experience feedback as a support for decision-making in crisis management “Crisis Clever System”. Several dimensions are considered in this study, from one side: organization, communication and problem-solving activities and from the other side the presentation and finding of experience feedback thanks to an analogy technique.",

The aim of this paper is to contribute to identifying the strengths and limits of current sustainability education practices to will be able to improve future decision-makers' and product designers' training. The first step of our research concerns the identification of knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values associated with sustainability and ecodesign to highlight what kind of engineers' competencies for sustainability have to be trained. Based on this identification, we examine the French education system from secondary school to university to study sustainability and ecodesign integration in different technological French curricula and practices. The objective is to estimate the effective place of sustainable development and ecodesign in the technological training courses. We analyze programs and complete our approach by observing teachers in their classrooms or by conducting interviews. Even if concepts, knowledge and skills related to ecodesign appear in many different programs, our study emphasizes that there is not a continuum between pre-secondary school, high school, and university. As a consequence, teachers have difficulties to understand the aims and the coherence of the program, and students are not really comfortable with the issues of sustainability and ecodesign. We propose to improve programs and practices by developing multidisciplinary curricula covering most of the sustainable issues and integrating best practices of international universities.",

To examine this effect, 24 second-year architecture students volunteered to participate. Each of them undertook similar conceptual design briefs in two different conditions, one with and another without a visual constraint. Retrospective reporting was used to collect the verbalization of participants. The FBS ontology was used to model the design cognition of the participants by coding their design protocols. A dynamic analysis was used to study the differences between the two conditions based on the problem–solution index. A further index, the pre-structure–post-structure index, was proposed to measure design behavior differences between the two conditions. The correspondence analysis was used to explore the effect of gender. There were statistically significant differences in the distributions of cognitive effort between the two groups. These differences include in the visual constraint group a decrease in the focus on behavior before structure and in the processes related to it, compared to the non-visual constraint group. The non-visual constraint group changed their focus on problem framing and solving while adding a visual constraint led participants to focus simultaneously on both framing and solving. The visual constraint group had a different attention temporally to pre- and post-structure design processes during designing than the non-visual constraint group. The order of experiencing the two design sessions had only a small effect. The results of correspondence analysis demonstrate that there are categorical gender differences not found using statistical testing.",

We present a case study of the reuse of constraint knowledge acquired for one problem solver, by two further problem solvers. For our analysis, we chose a well-known benchmark knowledge base (KB) system written in CLIPS, which was based on the propose and revise problem-solving method and which had a lift/elevator KB. The KB contained four components, including constraints and data tables, expressed in an ontology that reflects the propose and revise task structure. Sufficient trial data was extracted manually to demonstrate the approach on two alternative problem solvers: a spreadsheet (Excel) and a constraint logic solver (ECLiPSe). The next phase was to implement ExtrAKTor, which automated the process for the whole KB. Each KB that is processed results in a working system that is able to solve the corresponding configuration task (and not only for elevators). This is in contrast to earlier work, which produced abstract formulations of the problem-solving methods but which were unable to perform reuse of actual KBs. We subsequently used the ECLiPSe solver on some more demanding vertical transport configuration tasks. We found that we had to use a little-known propagation technique described by Le Provost and Wallace (1991). Further, our techniques did not use any heuristic “fix”’ information, yet we successfully dealt with a “thrashing” problem that had been a key issue in the original vertical transit work. Consequently, we believe we have developed a widely usable approach for solving this class of parametric design problem, by applying novel constraint-based problem solvers to data and formulae stored in existing KBs.",

As resources become further constrained, options become more numerous, and goals become increasingly complex, it is more critical and more challenging for design teams to find these integrated solutions. Theory proposes the integration of transformation, flow, and value views as necessary to support such integrated design. This paper develops requirements for these views that encourage flexible yet systematic integrated conceptual design processes. It then illustrates how these requirements are only partially satisfied by current design management systems, provides motivating case studies, and introduces a new framework, multiattribute interaction design (MAID), to fill this void by systematically guiding design teams to explicitly consider the potential interactions of options and the resulting value of design solutions. The paper defines the terms relevant to design space exploration and interactions. It then defines the MAID method and specifies metrics and a process for its validation. Initial laboratory charettes carry out first validations, illustrating evidence for how MAID can help integrate transformation, flow, and value views and lead teams of students to discover and record more interactions in a relatively short amount of time. The paper then lists future work required to further develop and validate MAID.",

Conditional constraint satisfaction problems (CCSPs) and feature models (FMs) have been developed to represent configuration problems in a natural way. CCSPs are like constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), but they also include potential variables, which might or might not exist in any given solution, as well as classical variables, which are required to take a value in every solution. CCSPs model, for example, options on a car, for which the style of sunroof (a variable) only makes sense if the car has a sunroof at all. FMs are directed acyclic graphs of features with constraints on edges. FMs model, for example, cell phone features, where utility functions are required, but the particular utility function “games” is optional, but requires Java support. We show that existing techniques from formal methods and answer set programming can be used to naturally model CCSPs and FMs. We demonstrate configurators in both approaches. An advantage of these approaches is that the model builder does not have to reformulate the CCSP or FM into a classic CSP, converting potential variables into classical variables by adding a “does not exist” value and modifying the problem constraints. Our configurators automatically reason about the model itself, enumerating all solutions and discovering several kinds of model flaws.",

In addition to the storage and analysis of information using such standards, the effect of globalization today necessitates the publishing of information on the Web. Thus, it is advisable to use formats that make the information easily publishable and accessible while developing KR standards.

When such systems are employed to allow for the mass customization of product form , they must be able to handle mass production and engineering constraints that can be time-consuming to evaluate and difficult to fulfill. These issues are related to how the constraints are handled in the generative design system. This article evaluates two promising sequential constraint-handling techniques and the often used weighted sum technique with regard to convergence time, convergence rate, and diversity of the design solutions. The application used for this purpose was a design system aimed at generating a table with an advanced form: a Voronoi diagram based structure. The design problem was constrained in terms of production as well as stability, requiring a time-consuming finite element evaluation. Regarding convergence time and rate, one of the sequential constraint-handling techniques performed significantly better than the weighted sum technique. Nevertheless, the weighted sum technique presented respectable results and therefore remains a relevant technique. Regarding diversity, none of the techniques could generate diverse solutions in a single search run. In contrast, the solutions from different searches were always diverse. Solution diversity is thus gained at the cost of more runs, but no evaluation of the diversity of the solutions is needed. This result is important, because a diversity evaluation function would otherwise have to be developed for every new type of design. Efficient handling of complex constraints is an important step toward mass customization of nontrivial product forms.",

In developing the system, it was noticed that due to the highly subjective requirements of users in terms of quantity and quality of lighting, a purely Boolean control system would not always be appropriate. Following from that, and taking advantage of the dynamic nature of the system, a further approach of control supported by fuzzy logic was also implemented at the operative state, whose logic is explained.

    "abstract": "Abstract Nowadays, on the basis of significant work carried out, architectural adaption structures are considered to be intelligent entities, able to react to various internal or external influences. Their adaptive behavior can be examined in a digital or physical environment, generating a variety of alternative solutions or structural transformations. These are controlled through different computational approaches, ranging from interactive exploration ones, producing alternative emergent results, to automate optimization ones, resulting in acceptable fitting solutions. This paper examines the adaptive behavior of a kinetic structure, aiming to explore suitable solutions resulting in final appropriate shapes during the transformation process. A machine learning methodology that implements an artificial neural networks algorithm is integrated to the suggested structure. The latter is formed by units articulated together in a sequential composition consisting of primary soft mechanisms and secondary rigid components that are responsible for its reconfiguration and stiffness. A number of case studies that respond to unstructured environments are set as examples, to test the effectiveness of the proposed methodology to be used for handling a large number of input data and to optimize the complex and nonlinear transformation behavior of the kinetic system at the global level, as a result of the units’ local activation that influences nearby units in a chaotic and unpredictable manner.",

JSP is not an independent task, but is rather a part of a company business case. In this paper, we have studied JSPs under sudden machine breakdown scenarios that introduce a risk of not completing the jobs on time. We have first solved JSPs using an improved memetic algorithm and extended the algorithm to deal with the disruption situations, and then developed a simulation model to analyze the risk of using a job order and delivery scenario. This paper deals with job scheduling under ideal conditions and rescheduling under machine breakdown, and provides a risk analysis for a production business case. The extended algorithm provides better understanding and results than existing algorithms, the rescheduling shows a good way of recovering from disruptions, and the risk analysis shows an effective way of maximizing return under such situations.",

In this paper, a change propagation dynamic model is built based on the compartmentalization of engineering entities into susceptible engineering entities and affected engineering entities (SA), the ordinary differential equations for describing the rate of affected entities with respect to the total ones and the duration for resolving all the changes for every moment are presented by combining the calculations of change impacts with different split and joint junctions. Considering the difficulty of finding analytical solutions to the differential equations, algorithms for sequential and concurrent simulations of change propagations across different development stages, and random and GA (Genetic Algorithm)-based optimal selections of feasible propagation paths are developed to obtain numerical solutions for single and multiple change requests. Simulation results show that change ripples and blossoms can be observed in both sequential and concurrent change propagations, and these propagation patterns are not sensitive to the initial change effect and the threshold value for propagations, while critical change propagation paths and the number of initiated changes have important effects on both concurrent and sequential change propagation process. It is also demonstrated that concurrent propagation strategy is advantageous for processing single or few of initiated changes since it can shorten product redevelopment time, sequential propagation strategy has an advantage of robustness for handling multiple initiated change requests.",

How to take advantage of the conveniently available data to support creative design activities remains a challenge. In the phase of idea generation, the visual analogy is considered an effective strategy to stimulate designers to create innovative ideas. Designers can read useful information off vague and incomplete conceptual visual representations, or stimuli, to reach potential visual analogies. In this paper, a computational framework is proposed to search and retrieve visual stimulation cues, which is expected to have the potential to help designers generate more creative ideas by avoiding visual fixation. The research problems include identifying and detecting visual similarities between visual representations from various categories and quantitatifying the visual similarity measures serving as a distance metric for visual stimuli search and retrieval. A deep neural network model is developed to learn a latent space that can discover visual relationships between multiple categories of sketches. In addition, a top cluster detection-based method is proposed to quantify visual similarity based on the overlapped magnitude in the latent space and then effectively rank categories. The QuickDraw sketch dataset is applied as a backend for evaluating the functionality of our proposed framework. Beyond visual stimuli retrieval, this research opens up new opportunities for utilizing extensively available visual data as creative materials to benefit design-by-analogy.",

However, the development of such positive AI poses substantial challenges due to the current lack of mature methods for addressing the complexities that designing AI for wellbeing poses. This article presents and evaluates the positive AI design method aimed at addressing this gap. The method provides a human-centered process for translating wellbeing aspirations into concrete interventions. First, we explain the method’s key steps: (1) contextualizing, (2) operationalizing, (3) designing, and (4) implementing supported by (5) continuous measurement for iterative feedback cycles. We then present a multi-case study where novice designers applied the method, revealing strengths and weaknesses related to efficacy and usability. Next, an expert evaluation study assessed the quality of the case studies’ outcomes, rating them moderately high for feasibility, desirability, and plausibility of achieving intended wellbeing benefits. Together, these studies provide preliminary validation of the method’s ability to improve AI design, while identifying opportunities for enhancement. Building on these insights, we propose adaptations for future iterations of the method, such as the inclusion of wellbeing-related heuristics, suggesting promising avenues for future work. This human-centered approach shows promise for realizing a vision of “AI for wellbeing” that does not just avoid harm, but actively promotes human flourishing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The disassembly of end-of-life lithium–ion batteries (EOL-LIBs) is inherently complex, owing to their multi-state and multi-type characteristics. To mitigate these challenges, a human–robot collaboration disassembly (HRCD) model is developed. This model capitalizes on the cognitive abilities of humans combined with the advanced automation capabilities of robots, thereby substantially improving the disassembly process’s flexibility and efficiency. Consequently, this method has become the benchmark for disassembling EOL-LIBs, given its enhanced ability to manage intricate and adaptable disassembly tasks. Furthermore, effective disassembly sequence planning (DSP) for components is crucial for guiding the entire disassembly process. Therefore, this research proposes an approach for the generation of HRCD sequences for EOL-LIBs based on knowledge graph, providing assistance to individuals lacking relevant knowledge to complete disassembly tasks. Firstly, a well-defined disassembly process knowledge graph integrates structural information from CAD models and disassembly operating procedure. Based on the acquired information, DSP is conducted to generate a disassembly sequence knowledge graph (DSKG), which serves as a repository in graphical form. Subsequently, knowledge graph matching is employed to align nodes in the existing DSKG, thereby reusing node sequence knowledge and completing the sequence information for the target disassembly task. Finally, the proposed method is validated using retired power LIBs as a case study product.",

The concurrent verbalization of our inner thoughts during the execution of a design task enables the use of dynamic semantic networks as a tool for investigating, evaluating, and monitoring creative thought. The primary advantage of using lexical databases such as WordNet for reproducible information-theoretic quantification of convergence or divergence of design ideas in creative problem solving is the simultaneous handling of both words and meanings, which enables interpretation of the constructed dynamic semantic networks in terms of underlying functionally active brain cortical regions involved in concept comprehension and production. In this study, the quantitative dynamics of semantic measures computed with a moving time window is investigated empirically in the DTRS10 dataset with design review conversations and detected divergent thinking is shown to predict success of design ideas. Thus, dynamic semantic networks present an opportunity for real-time computer-assisted detection of critical events during creative problem solving, with the goal of employing this knowledge to artificially augment human creativity.",

However, this is a non-trivial problem, which requires sufficient data analytics knowledge and labeled data, either to design supervised fault detection models or to evaluate the performance of unsupervised models. While today most companies collect data by adding sensors to their machinery, the majority of this data is unfortunately not labeled. Moreover, labeling requires expert knowledge and is very cumbersome. To solve this mismatch, we present an architecture that guides experts, only requiring them to label a very small subset of the data compared to today’s standard labeling campaigns that are used when designing predictive maintenance solutions. We use auto-encoders to highlight potential anomalies and clustering approaches to group these anomalies into (potential) failure types. The accompanied dashboard then presents the anomalies to domain experts for labeling. In this way, we enable domain experts to enrich routinely collected machine data with business intelligence via a user-friendly hybrid model, combining auto-encoder models with labeling steps and supervised models. Ultimately, the labeled failure data allows for creating better failure prediction models, which in turn enables more effective predictive maintenance. More specifically, our architecture gets rid of cumbersome labeling tasks, allowing companies to make maximum use of their data and expert knowledge to ultimately increase their profit. Using our methodology, we achieve a labeling gain of 90% at best compared to standard labeling tasks.",

To address the challenges associated with single-dimensional detection, high network complexity, and difficulties in mobile deployment for longitudinal tearing detection in conveyor belts, we have proposed an efficient parallel acceleration method based on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) for the ECSMv3-YOLO network, which is an improved version of the you only look once (YOLO) network, enabling multidimensional real-time detection. The FPGA hardware acceleration architecture of the customized network incorporates quantization and pruning methods to further reduce network parameters. The convolutional acceleration engines were specifically designed to optimize the network’s inference speed, and the incorporation of dual buffers and multiple direct memory access channels can effectively mitigate data transfer latency. The establishment of a multidimensional longitudinal tear detection experimental device for conveyor belts facilitated FPGA acceleration experiments on ECSMv3-YOLO, resulting in model parameters of 6.257 M, mean average precision of 0.962, power consumption of 3.2 W, and a throughput of 15.56 giga operations per second (GOP/s). By assessing the effects of different networks and varying light intensity, and comparing with CPU, GPU, and different FPGA hardware acceleration platforms, this method demonstrates significant advantages in terms of detection speed, recognition accuracy, power consumption, and energy efficiency. Additionally, it exhibits strong adaptability and interference resilience.",

The results demonstrate that YOLOv5-CG-AS can automatically extract fault features from images for offline fault diagnosis and can perform real-time online diagnosis of multiple parameter curves of PEMFCs. Moreover, the experimental results have validated the feasibility and effectiveness of proposed method and shown the average precision mean Average Precision (mAP) of the trained model reaches 99.50%, superior than other conventional strategies. This has significant implications for advancing fault diagnosis methods, enhancing the reliability and durability of PEMFC systems, and promoting further development in the field.",

A newly developed aggregate product model for welding is introduced, which forms part of CAPABLE, a concurrent engineering toolkit for machining and welding. This product model supports the representation of the design at multiple levels of detail and allows the rapid modelling of alternative designs where solid model representation is inappropriate. The potential applications of the aggregate product model in weld product design, such as the integration of joint design and weldability assessment, are discussed using simple examples. The design of weld products must consider process-dependent properties including geometry, materials combinations, and weld joint characteristics to arrive at a near-optimal configuration. The object-oriented and feature-based model structure of CAPABLE enhances the design process by the automatic generation of compatible options and allows rapid design evaluation. The aggregate product model provides the input data necessary for tasks like process selection, optimization, process sequencing, fixture design and welding orientation selection. The main advantage of this product model over traditional CAD environments is that planning of the welding and fabrication operations can start during the conceptual and embodiment stages of the design process, thus ensuring the concurrency of design and planning tasks and resulting in product and process improvement and cost reduction.",

    "abstract": "There exists a large body of Artificial Intelligence (AI) research on generating plans, i.e. linear or non-linear sequences of actions, to transform an initial world state to some desired goal state. However, much of the planning research to date has been complicated, ill-understood, and unclear. Only a few of the developers of these planners have provided a thorough description of their research products, and those descriptions that exist are usually unrealistically favorable since the range of applications for which the systems are tested is limited to those for which they were developed. As a result, it is difficult to evaluate these planners and to choose the best planner for a different domain. To make a planner applicable to different planning problems, it should be domain independent. However, one needs to know the circumstances under which a general planner works so that one can determine its suitability for a specific domain. This paper presents criteria for evaluating AI planners; these criteria fall into three categories: (1) performance issues , (2) representational issues , and (3) communication issues . This paper also assesses four non-linear AI planners (NOAH, NONLIN, SIPE and TWEAK) based on a study of the published literature and on communication (via electronic mail, meetings and correspondence) with their developers.",

    "abstract": "Collaborative development of engineered products in a business to business (B2B) environment requires more than the selection of components from an on-line catalogue. It involves the electronic exchange of product, process, and production engineering information during both design and manufacturing. Although the state of the practice does include a variety of ways to exchange product data electronically, it does not extend to the exchange of manufacturing process data. The reason is simple: process data are usually tied to specific manufacturing resources. These resources are not known typically at product development time. This paper proposes an approach called integrated product and process data, in which manufacturing process data are considered during product development. This approach replaces traditional process plans, which are resource specific, with a resource-independent process representation. Such a representation will allow a much wider collaboration among business partners and provide the necessary base for collaborative product development.",

    "abstract": "Design consists of analyzing scenarios and proposing artifacts, obeying the initial set of requirements that lead from initial to goal state. Finding or creating alternative solutions, analyzing them, and selecting the best one are expected steps in the designer’s decision making process. Very often, not a sole designer, but a team of them is engaged in the design process, sharing their expertise and responsibility to achieve optimum projects. In a design team, most conflicts occur due to misunderstanding of one’s assessment of specifications and contexts. Decision explanations play a key role in teamwork success. Designers are rational agents trained to follow rational methods. Acceptable justifications include value function, requirements, constraints, and criteria. Generally, explanations are delivered in a multimedia fashion, composed of text, graphics and gestures, to provide the audience the ability to perceive what was contextually imagined. The more spatial the reasoning is, the richer the explanation channel should be. This paper presents CineADD, a design explanation generation model based on cinema techniques such as animation, scripting, editing, and camera movements. The idea is to provide designers with a tool for describing the way their projects should be visually explained, as in a movie. Designers develop their projects in an active design document environment. Rationale is captured as a design model, so explanations can be generated instead of retrieved. The captured design model serves as a base to visually reconstruct design, giving emphasis and guidance by using movie storytelling techniques. CineADD was implemented for the domain of oil pipeline layout showing the feasibility of this approach. We expect CineADD to become a commodity attachable to any intelligent CAD system.",

One of the genetically evolved lens systems infringed a previously issued patent, whereas the others were noninfringing novel designs that duplicated (or improved upon) the performance specifications contained in the patents. One of the patents was issued in the 21st century. The designs were created in a substantially similar and routine way, suggesting that the approach described in the paper can be readily applied to other similar problems in the field of optical design. The genetically evolved designs are instances of human-competitive results produced by genetic programming in the field of optical design.",

Design rationale answers questions about why a given design takes the form that it does. Answers to these why questions represent a significant portion of the knowledge generated from design research. This knowledge, along with that from empirical studies of designs in use, contributes to what Simon called the sciences of the artificial . Most research on the nature and use of design rationale has been analytic or theoretical. In this article, we describe an empirical study of the roles that design rationale can play in the conduct of design research. We report results from an interview study with 16 design researchers investigating how they construe and carry out design as research. The results include an integrated framework of the affordances design rationale can contribute to design research. The framework and supporting qualitative data provide insight into how design rationale might be more effectively leveraged as a first-class methodology for research into the creation and use of artifacts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract It is known that wherever there is human interaction, there is social influence. Here, we refer to more influential individuals as “influencers”, who drive team processes for better or worst. Social influence gives rise to social learning, the propensity of humans to mimic the most influential individuals. As individual learning is affected by the presence of an influencer, so is an individual's idea generation . Examining this phenomenon through a series of human studies would require an enormous amount of time to study both individual and team behaviors that affect design outcomes. Hence, this paper provides an agent-based approach to study the effect of influencers during idea generation. This model is supported by the results of two empirical experiments which validate the assumptions and sustain the logic implemented in the model. The results of the model simulation make it possible to examine the impact of influencers on design outcomes, assessed in the form of exploration of design solution space and quality of the solution. The results show that teams with a few prominent influencers generate solutions with limited diversity. Moreover, during idea generation, the behavior of the teams with uniform distribution of influence is regulated by their team members' self-efficacy.",

Predefining rules for self-organizing agents can be challenging, especially in tasks with high complexity and changing environments. Our previous work has introduced a multiagent reinforcement learning (RL) model as a design approach to solving the rule generation problem of SOS. A deep multiagent RL algorithm was devised to train agents to acquire the task and self-organizing knowledge. However, the simulation was based on one specific task environment. Sensitivity of SOS to reward functions and systematic evaluation of SOS designed with multiagent RL remain an issue. In this paper, we introduced a rotation reward function to regulate agent behaviors during training and tested different weights of such reward on SOS performance in two case studies: box-pushing and T-shape assembly. Additionally, we proposed three metrics to evaluate the SOS: learning stability, quality of learned knowledge, and scalability. Results show that depending on the type of tasks; designers may choose appropriate weights of rotation reward to obtain the full potential of agents’ learning capability. Good learning stability and quality of knowledge can be achieved with an optimal range of team sizes. Scaling up to larger team sizes has better performance than scaling downwards.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The presence of aerodynamics loadings makes the design of some classes of elastic structures, as, for instance, marine structures and risers, very challenging. Moreover, capturing the complex physical interaction between the structure and the fluid is challenging for both theoretical and numerical models. One of the most important phenomena that appear in these situations is vortex-induced vibrations. The picture is even more complicated when multiple elastic elements are close enough to interact by modifying the fluid flow pattern. In the present work, we show how the common design practice for these structures, which is entirely based on deterministic simulations, needs to be complemented by the uncertainty quantification analysis. The model problem is a structure constituted by two elastically mounted cylinders exposed to a two-dimensional uniform flow at Reynolds number 200. The presence of a manufacturing tolerance in the relative position of the two cylinders, which we consider to be a source of uncertainty, is addressed. The overall numerical procedure is based on a Navier–Stokes immersed boundary solver that uses a flexible moving least squares approach to compute the aerodynamics loadings on the structure, whereas the uncertainty quantification propagation is obtained by means of a nonintrusive polynomial chaos technique. A range of reduced velocities is considered, and the quantification, in a probabilistic sense, of the difference in the performances of this structure with respect to the case of an isolated cylinder is provided. The numerical investigation is also complemented by a global sensitivity analysis based on the analysis of variance.",

Stochastic qualified outputs of these facilities are due to their imperfect productions systems. We show that uncertainties propagate and qualified flow depreciates by moving material, components, and products from upstream to the downstream of these supply chains, and these phenomena should be quantified to determine the service levels of this company in the pre- and after-sales markets. At the end, we propose a mathematical model determining the best marketing strategies for this company (i.e., price, warranty length, and service levels) in the markets and their preserving reliable flow dynamics throughout the chains’ networks.

    "abstract": "Abstract It is desirable for complex engineered systems to be resilient to various sources of uncertainty throughout their life cycle. Such systems are high in cost and complexity, and often incorporate highly sophisticated materials, components, design, and other technologies. There are many uncertainties such systems will face throughout their life cycles due to changes in internal and external conditions, or states of interest , to the designer, such as technology readiness, market conditions, or system health. These states of interest affect the success of the system design with respect to the main objectives and application of the system, and are generally uncertain over the life cycle of the system. To address such uncertainties, we propose a resilient design approach for engineering systems. We utilize a Kalman filter approach to model the uncertain future states of interest. Then, based upon the modeled states, the optimal change in the design of the system is achieved to respond to the new states. This resilient method is applicable in systems when the ability to change is embedded in the system design. A design framework is proposed encompassing a set of definitions, metrics, and methodologies. A case study of a communication satellite system is presented to illustrate the features of the approach.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recently, new types of layouts have been proposed in the literature in order to handle a large number of products. Among these are the fractal layout, aiming at minimization of routing distances. There are already researchers focusing on the design; however, we have noticed that the current approach usually executes several times the allocations of fractal cells on the shop floor up to find the best allocations, which may present a significant disadvantage when applied to a large number of fractal cells owing to combinatorial features. This paper aims to propose a criterion, based on similarity among fractal cells, developed and implemented in a Tabu search heuristics, in order to allocate it on the shop floor in a feasible computational time. Once our proposed procedure is modeled, operations of each workpiece are separated in n subsets and submitted to simulation. The results (traveling distance and makespan) are compared to distributed layout and to functional layout. The results show, in general, a trade-off behavior, that is, when the total routing distance decreases, the makespan increases. Based on our proposed method, depending on the value of segregated fractal cell similarity, it is possible to reduce both performance parameters. Finally, we conclude the proposed procedure shows to be quite promising because allocations of fractal cells demand reduced central processing unit time.",

Our qualitative study led to observations on how each of the three transformation principles, expand/collapse, expose/cover, and fuse/divide, specifically supports ECBs. As expected, expand/collapse enables better portability of products. Increased portability of reusable products (e.g., travel mugs and shopping bags) reduces reliance on their disposable counterparts. A less expected observation is that increased portability also increases the spontaneity by which ECBs could be carried out. While there are fewer ECB supporting products that incorporate the expose/cover principle, we believe that it enables one to include, yet hide potentially unaesthetic, features that support ECB in often-used or worn items. Finally, we found fuse/divide to enable portability beyond what is possible with expand/collapse alone. Fuse/divide may also make possible other product transport and reuse strategies. We conclude that mechanically transformable products support and enable ECBs, especially when existing infrastructure presents obstacles. Such products may increase the rate of participation in ECB, which then justifies improvements to the shortfalls in infrastructure for which they compensate.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Identifying failure paths and potentially hazardous scenarios resulting from component faults and interactions is a challenge in the early design process. The inherent complexity present in large engineered systems leads to nonobvious emergent behavior, which may result in unforeseen hazards. Current hazard analysis techniques focus on single hazards (fault trees), single faults (event trees), or lists of known hazards in the domain (hazard identification). Early in the design of a complex system, engineers may represent their system as a functional model. A function failure reasoning tool can then exhaustively simulate qualitative failure scenarios. Some scenarios can be identified as hazardous by hazard rules specified by the engineer, but the goal is to identify scenarios representing unknown hazards. The incidences of specific subgraphs in graph representations of known hazardous scenarios are used to train a classifier to distinguish hazard from nonhazard. The algorithm identifies the scenario most likely to be hazardous, and presents it to the engineer. After viewing the scenario and judging its safety, the engineer may have insight to produce additional hazard rules. The collaborative process of strategic presentation of scenarios by the computer and human judgment will identify previously unknown hazards. The feasibility of this methodology has been tested on a relatively simple functional model of an electrical power system with positive results. Related work applying function failure reasoning to a team of robotic rovers will provide data from a more complex system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Primary among all the activities involved in conceptual design is freehand sketching. There have been significant efforts in recent years to enable digital design methods that leverage humans’ sketching skills. Conventional sketch-based digital interfaces are built on two-dimensional touch-based devices like sketchers and drawing pads. The transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional (3-D) digital sketch interfaces represents the latest trend in developing new interfaces that embody intuitiveness and human–human interaction characteristics. In this paper, we outline a novel screenless 3-D sketching system. The system uses a noncontact depth-sensing RGB-D camera for user input. Only depth information (no RGB information) is used in the framework. The system tracks the user's palm during the sketching process and converts the data into a 3-D sketch. As the generated data is noisy, making sense of what is sketched is facilitated through a beautification process that is suited to 3-D sketches. To evaluate the performance of the system and the beautification scheme, user studies were performed on multiple participants for both single-stroke and multistroke sketching scenarios.",

This process is highly nonlinear and leads to large computation times to fully model the process. This paper describes the use of dimension-reduced neural networks (DR-NNs) for predicting temperature changes due to plastic deformation in a two-stage cold rolling process. The main objective of these models is to reduce computational demand, error, and uncertainty in predictions. Material properties, feed velocity, sheet dimensions, and friction models are introduced as inputs for the dimensionality reduction. Different linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods reduce the input space to a smaller set of principal components. The principal components are fed as inputs to the neural networks for predicting the output temperature change. The DR-NNs are compared against a standalone neural network and show improvements in terms of lower computational time and prediction uncertainty.",

Extracting other type of knowledge is important but challenging for multiple engineering fields where data are scarce and difficult to collect. This research aims to address this problem by presenting a machine learning-based modeling framework leveraging the knowledge available in fundamental units of the variables recorded from data samples, to develop parsimonious, explainable, and graph-based simulation models during the early design stages. The developed approach is exemplified using an engineering design case study of a spherical body moving in a fluid. For the system of interest, two types of intricated models are generated by (1) using an automated selection of variables from datasets and (2) combining the automated extraction with supplementary knowledge about functions and dimensional homogeneity associated with the variables of the system. The effect of design, data, model, and simulation specifications on model fidelity are investigated. The study discusses the interrelationships between fidelity levels, variables, functions, and the available knowledge. The research contributes to the development of a fidelity measurement theory by presenting the premises of a standardized, modeling approach for transforming data into measurable level of fidelities for the produced models. This research shows that structured model building with a focus on model fidelity can support early design reasoning and decision making using for example the dimensional analysis conceptual modeling (DACM) framework.",

    "abstract": "Abstract One of the products of engineering, besides constructed artifacts, is design documentation. To understand how design participants use documentation, designers and typical documentation users were interviewed and protocols were taken of them both creating and using design documentation. The protocols were taken from realistic projects of preliminary design for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems (HVAC). The studies of document creation and use revealed three important issues: (1) design participants not only look up design facts; they frequently access documents to obtain information about the rationale for design decisions; (2) the design rationale that they see often is missing from the documents; and (3) design requirements change frequently over a project life cycle so that design documents are often inconsistent and out of date. Recognizing these documentation issues in design practice, a new approach was developed in which documents are no longer static records, but rather interactive design models supporting a case. The feasibility of the approach was demonstrated by constructing a running system and testing it with designers on realistic problems. The costs and benefits of creating and using documentation of design rationale also were analyzed. In particular, the active documents approach was evaluated for a routine, preliminary design in domains where community practice is widely shared and largely standardized. The approach depends on the feasibility of creating a parametric design model for the design domain.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses an important application of machine learning (ML) in design. One of the major bottlenecks in the process of engineering analysis by using the finite-element method—a design of the finite-element mesh—was a subject of improvement. Defining an appropriate geometric mesh model that ensures low approximation errors and avoids unnecessary computational overhead is a very difficult and time-consuming task based mainly on the user's experience. A knowledge base for finite-element mesh design has been constructed using the ML techniques. Ten mesh models have been used as a source of training examples. The mesh dataset was probably the first real-world relational dataset and became one of the most widely used training set for experimenting with inductive logic programming (ILP) systems. After several experiments with different ML systems in the last few years, the ILP system CLAUDIEN was chosen to construct the rules for determining the appropriate mesh resolution values. The ILP has been found to be an effective approach to the problem of mesh design. An evaluation of the resulting knowledge base shows that the mesh design patterns are captured well by the induced rules and represent a solid basis for practical application. The aim of this paper is not only to present the real-life ML application to design, but also to describe and discuss a relation of the work being done to the topic of this special issue: the proposed “dimensions” of ML in design.",

The latter contains a library of knowledge acquisition techniques and a set of acquisition support entities, which work on the library, guided by the generated methodological knowledge, to extract domain knowledge. The generated methodological knowledge, coupled with the domain knowledge, forms the RA tools. We have demonstrated the use of the approach by deriving an RA tool to assist the system analyst to acquire and formalize a requirement specification for a network management system.

This difficulty arises from the complexity of learning problems and the large variety of available techniques. In order to understand this complexity and begin to overcome it, it is important to construct a characterization of learning situations. Building on previous work that dealt with the practical use of ML, a set of dimensions is developed, contrasted with another recent proposal, and illustrated with a project on the development of a decision-support system for marine propeller design. The general research opportunities that emerge from the development of the dimensions are discussed. Leading toward working systems, a simple model is presented for setting priorities in research and in selecting learning tasks within large projects.

This paper significantly extends the analysis capabilities of GP by searching for multiple simple models within a single population by splitting the population into multiple islands according to the design variables used by individual members. Where members from different islands “cooperate,” simple design models can be extracted from this cooperation. This relatively simple extension to GP is shown to have powerful implications to extracting design models that can be readily interpreted and exploited by human designers.

Although machine vision systems have played an important role in these tasks, there are still challenges in performing these tasks in which parts may be in motion and subjected to noise. Using a flexible vibratory bowl feeder system as a test bed to simulate motion of parts subjected to noise, scanned signatures of part features are acquired using fiber optic sensors and a data acquisition system. Because neural networks have been shown to exhibit good pattern recognition capability, ARTMAP, a neural network that learns patterns under supervision, was incorporated into the feeder system. The pattern recognition capability of the feeder system is dependent on a set of parameters that characterized ARTMAP, the sampling rate of the data acquisition system, and the mean speed of the vibrating parts. The parameters that characterized ARTMAP are the size of an input vector, the vigilance, threshold value of the nonlinear noise suppression function, and the learning rate. Through extensive training and testing of the ARTMAP within the feeder system, it was shown that high success rates of recognition of parts features in motion under noisy conditions can be obtained provided these parameters of ARTMAP are appropriately selected.",

However, most of the existing computational design tools are focused on the latest stages of the design process and especially directed to drafting operations. Conceptual design tools that support the designer in the creative and inventive early stages of the design project are still in their early development. Shape grammars (SG) were introduced by George Stiny in the 1970s, allowing the generation of designs according to a set of predefined rules. SG computational implementations have the potential to answer the need for tools that can assist designers, architects, and artists in the creative process, offering design alternatives, stimulating new ideas and encouraging the search for new design generation processes. Acknowledging this potential, a user-friendly interface seems essential for the adoption of these tools. Taking Scott Chase's interaction model as background, the aim of the present investigation is to define guidelines and begin to design a graphical-user interface for SG implementations. Inspection methods of human–computer interaction (HCI) were used to analyze existing SG implementations and understand usability issues. Subsequently, HCI ergonomic criteria for interface evaluation were adapted to establish guidelines for the design of an SG implementation interface, called IM-sqi. These guidelines take into account different user groups, adjustable interaction modes for each user group, and the nature of each task performed by the user.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper proposes to contribute to our understanding of the fundamental cognitive processes essential to designing by exploring the experiences of people who have different information processing behaviors to those found in most people. In particular, we focus on people with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) because they are known to have information processing behaviors that are both maladaptive and exceptional. Central to our study is the question: what can we learn from people with ASC about cognitive processes essential to designing? The scholarship on cognitive behaviors associated with the autism spectrum and narratives on the experiences with design practice by individuals with ASC are discussed in relation to cognitive processes associated with designing. In turn, the individuals commented upon the analysis of cognitive processes associated with designing in light of their personal experiences with design practice. We conclude that the weak central coherence theory of autism provides a useful prediction of the cognitive processes necessary for expertise in design, and that both the framework for expertise in design and the way it is studied may require updating.",

The first challenge is the representation of shapes, which needs to enable reinterpretation of parts regardless of the creation history of the shapes. The second challenge is the relevant part searching algorithm that provides an extensive exploration of the design space–time efficiently. In this work, we propose a novel method to solve both problems; we treat shapes as they are and use a parallel particle swarm optimization-based algorithm to compute emergent parts. The execution time of the proposed method is improved substantially by dividing the search space into small parts and carrying out searches in each part concurrently using a graphics processing unit. The experiments show that the proposed implementation detects emergent parts accurately and time efficiently.",

The human conditions (familial and life) and, the influence of the environment (politic, economic, media) pushes the actors to lose control of the crisis situation. The question we face in this paper is: “is it possible to predict the impact of the stress in this type of situation?” Our main hypothesis to answer is to represent experience feedback using knowledge management. To model the crisis management as systemic system emphasizing regulation loops, and the collaboration activity by showing the dimension of the communication, coordination, and cooperation. This modeling is illustrated in a terrorist attack situation in Algeria. To predict stress consequences, fuzzy set principle is adopted, based on experience feedback and situations modeling, as a generator of alternative states given a stress event.",

Considering the optimization objectives of processing time, processing cost, product qualification rate, and resource utilization, MOM-WCR was constructed. Based on the time sequence of workshop processing tasks, the workshop collaborative manufacturing resource was integrated in MOM-WCR. Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) was adopted to simplified the multi-objective problem into the single-objective problem. Then, the improved firefly algorithm which integrated the particle swarm algorithm (IFA-PSA) was used to solve MOM-WCR. Finally, a group of connecting rod processing experiments were used to verify the model proposed in this paper. The results show that the model is feasible in the application of workshop-level resource allocation in the context of cloud manufacturing, and the improved firefly algorithm shows good performance in solving the multi-objective resource allocation problem.",

As an instance of the revisionary approach discussed in Vermaas's position paper, we have proposed an ontological definition of function and a modeling framework based on it, which has been deployed in industry. In addition, as an instance of the overarching approach, we have proposed a reference ontology of function that explains some kinds, definitions, and practical expressions of functions. In this paper, we explain our methodology in an overarching approach based on perspectives for capturing functions . When one captures a function of an artifact, one focuses on a specific aspect of the artifact from a specific perspective. In this paper, we conceptualize such perspectives behind the reference ontology. In addition, based on our experiences in deployment in an industrial setting, we report some solutions, such as ontological modeling guidelines, for overcoming some of the difficulties faced in the practical functional modeling approach described in Eckert's position paper. Our findings suggest that such solutions will help engineers to describe consistent functional models compliant with a single definition of function.",

    "abstract": "In preliminary design, the details of a structure are insufficient to warrant the use of numeric tools traditionally used in structural analysis. However, an accurate prediction of the behavior of a structure and its components in the preliminary design phase can have a significant effect on the final design process in reducing the number of alternative solutions, avoiding the costly design revisions, and improving the quality of design. Presently, there are few tools available for preliminary analysis of structures. This study represents an initial effort towards the development of a tool that can be used in the conceptual design stage to qualitatively evaluate the behavior of a structure. This paper describes a prototype system, QStruc, for qualitative structural analysis , which combines first principles in structural engineering and experiential knowledge of structural behavior. The purposes of QStruc are: (1) to generate qualitative models from the schematics of a structure; and (2) to infer the qualitative response of the structure in terms of deflected shape, moments, and reactions. The qualitative analysis strategy employs: (1) a greedy depth-first approach that tries to expand the derived response as much as possible from known parameter values; (2) a causal ordering mechanism, which enables the system to identify the solution path for the qualitative analysis; (3) qualitative calculus, which enables the qualitative evaluation of the physical quantities of the causal model that describes the behavior of the structure; and (4) Quantity Lattice (Simmons, 1986) which enables the system to reason about partial ordering among physical quantities and to reduce some of the ambiguous conclusions caused by the impreciseness of the information. Examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and limitations of the prototype system.",

These measurements are converted into qualitative values and are used for two purposes: first, to determine the state of the circuit components; second, to trigger the diagnostic procedure whenever a discrepancy between observed and predicted behavior is found. The main difficulty in this phase of measurement interpretation is in obtaining meaningful numerical-qualitative data conversion for values of quantities approaching a boundary between two different qualitative intervals. System performance has been verified through a number of simulations, which have shown the proposed approach to be efficient both in terms of localized faults and of flexibility in adapting to different circuits.",

This process is complicated by interactions between different parts of the design, and many researchers have addressed these issues. An overview is given of a large design tool under development, the Circuit Designer's Apprentice. This tool integrates various techniques for reengineering existing circuits so that they meet new circuit requirements. The primary focus of the paper is one particular technique being used to reengineer circuits when they cannot be transformed to meet the new problem requirements. In these cases, a design plan is automatically generated for the circuit, and then replayed to solve all or part of the new problem. This technique is based upon the derivational analogy approach to design reuse. Derivational Analogy is a machine learning algorithm in which a design plan is saved at the time of design so that it can be replayed on a new design problem. Because design plans were not saved for the circuits available to the Circuit Designer's Apprentice, an algorithm was developed that automatically reconstructs a design plan for any circuit. This algorithm, Reconstructive Derivational Analogy, is described in detail, including a quantitative analysis of the implementation of this algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Hewlett-Packard develops and markets a family of computer-aided engineering products used by high-frequency designers to model the signal path in contemporary communications systems. As design frequencies, clock speeds and packaging densities continue to increase, more designers are finding that system and circuit simulation products need to be complemented by electromagnetic simulation software to develop models for basic circuit functionality or to characterize and compensate undesired parasitic effects. The HP High-Frequency Structure Simulator (HP HFSS) is a frequency-domain, finite element-based simulator, which enables engineers to characterize high-frequency behavior in 2D (transmission lines) and arbitrary 3D structures. Links with mechanical computer aided design (CAD) software have also become more important as the 3D structures to be analyzed by HP HFSS can involve packaging parasitics when the housing in which the electrical circuitry is enclosed becomes an influence on the signal path. Depending upon the complexity of the structure to be analyzed, HP HFSS can require hundreds of Mbytes of RAM and disk during automated adaptive solution convergence processes which determine field and circuit parameter solution results to user-specified accuracies. Although computer resource requirements will always be an important consideration for users of this type of product, another important situation to address for the future involves the exchange of data between the different simulation and modelling tools required to take design from concept through simulation to manufacture. The introduction of physical simulation tools into the traditional circuit simulation arena changes the design process flow and increases the demand for improved integration and interoperability of circuit simulators, numerical EM simulators, and mechanical CAD software. This paper provides an overview of data exchange issues in high-frequency electrical–physical–mechanical design processes.",

    "abstract": "We present a new representation that allows a rigid-body dynamic simulation to be described as a set of “causal-processes.” A causal-process is an interval of time during which both the behavior and the causes of the behavior remain qualitatively uniform. The representation consists of acyclic, directed graphs that are isomorphic to the flow of causality through the kinematic chain. Forces are the carriers of causality in this domain; thus they are central to the representation. We use this representation to compute the purposes of the geometric features on the parts of a device. To compute the purpose of a particular feature, we simulate the behavior of the device with and without the feature present. We then re-represent the two simulations as causal-processes and identify any causal-processes that exist in one simulation but not the other. Such processes are indicative of the feature's purpose. Because they are already causal descriptions of behavior, they can be directly translated into natural language descriptions of the feature's purpose. We have implemented our approach in a computer program called ExplainIT II.",

    "abstract": "Abstract With the increasing demand for a personalized product and rapid market response, many companies expect to explore online user-generated content (UGC) for intelligent customer hearing and product redesign strategy. UGC has the advantages of being more unbiased than traditional interviews, yielding in-time response, and widely accessible with a sheer volume. From online resources, customers’ preferences toward various aspects of the product can be exploited by promising sentiment analysis methods. However, due to the complexity of language, state-of-the-art sentiment analysis methods are still not accurate for practice use in product redesign. To tackle this problem, we propose an integrated customer hearing and product redesign system, which combines the robust use of sentiment analysis for customer hearing and coordinated redesign mechanisms. Ontology and expert knowledges are involved to promote the accuracy. Specifically, a fuzzy product ontology that contains domain knowledges is first learned in a semi-supervised way. Then, UGC is exploited with a novel ontology-based fine-grained sentiment analysis approach. Extracted customer preference statistics are transformed into multilevels, for the automatic establishment of opportunity landscapes and house of quality table. Besides, customer preference statistics are interactively visualized, through which representative customer feedbacks are concurrently generated. Through a case study of smartphone, the effectiveness of the proposed system is validated, and applicable redesign strategies for a case product are provided. With this system, information including customer preferences, user experiences, using habits and conditions can be exploited together for reliable product redesign strategy elicitation.",

This paper revisits the various modes of reasoning – explanatory abduction, innovative abduction, deduction, and induction – that have been proposed by earlier researchers as crucial modes of reasoning underlying the design process. First, our paper expands earlier work on abductive reasoning – an essential mode of reasoning involved in the process of synthesis – by understanding its role with the help of the “SAPPhIRE” model of causality. The explanations of abductive reasoning in design using the SAPPhIRE model have been compared with those using existing models. Second, the paper captures and analyzes various modes of reasoning during design synthesis with the help of the “Extended Integrated Model of Designing”. The analysis of participants' verbal speech and outcomes shows the model's ability to explain the various modes of reasoning that occur in design. The results indicate the above models to provide a more extensive account of reasoning in design synthesis. Earlier empirical validation of both the models lends further support to the claim of their explanatory capacity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study attempts to correlate the nonlinear invariants' with the changing conditions of a drilling process through a series of condition monitoring experiments on small diameter (1 mm) drill bits. Run-to-failure tests are performed on these drill bits, and vibration data are consecutively gathered at equal time intervals. Nonlinear invariants, such as the Kolmogorov entropy and correlation dimension, and statistical parameters are calculated based on the corresponding conditions of the drill bits. By intervariations of these values between two successive measurements, a drop–rise table is created. Any variation that is within a certain threshold (±20% of the measurements in this case) is assumed to be constant. Any fluctuation above or below is assumed to be either a rise or a drop. The reduct and conflict tables then help eliminate incongruous and redundant data by the use of rough sets (RSs). Inconsistent data, which by definition is the boundary region, are classified through certainty and coverage factors. By handling inconsistencies and redundancies, 11 rules are extracted from 39 experiments, representing the underlying rules. Then 22 new experiments are used to check the validity of the rule space. The RS decision frame performs best at predicting no failure cases. It is believed that RSs are superior in dealing with real-life data over fuzzy set logic in that actual measured data are never as consistent as here and may dominate the monitoring of the manufacturing processes as it becomes more widespread.",

A Post-Bit is a design prototype of a small electronic paper device for handling multimedia content, with interaction control and display in one thin flexible sheet. Tangible properties of paper such as flipping, flexing, scattering, and rubbing are mapped to controlling aspects of the multimedia content such as scrubbing, sorting, or up- or downloading dynamic media (images, video, text). In this paper we discuss both the design process involved in building a prototype of a tangible interface using new technologies, and how the use of Post-Bits as a tangible design tool can impact two common design tasks: design ideation or brainstorming, and storyboarding for interactive systems or devices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper outlines a procedure for assessing the quality of failure explanations in engineering failure analysis. The procedure structures the information contained in explanations such that it enables to find weak points, to compare competing explanations, and to provide redesign recommendations. These features make the procedure a good asset for critical reflection on some areas of the engineering practice of failure analysis and redesign. The procedure structures relevant information contained in an explanation by means of structural equations so as to make the relations between key elements more salient. Once structured, the information is examined on its potential to track counterfactual dependencies by offering answers to relevant what-if-things-had-been-different questions. This criterion for explanatory goodness derives from the philosophy of science literature on scientific explanation. The procedure is illustrated by applying it to two case studies, one on Failure Analysis in Mechanical Engineering (a broken vehicle shaft) and one on Failure Analysis in Civil Engineering (a collapse in a convention center). The procedure offers failure analysts a practical tool for critical reflection on some areas of their practice while offering a deeper understanding of the workings of failure analysis (framing it as an explanatory practice). It, therefore, allows to improve certain aspects of the explanatory practices of failure analysis and redesign, but it also offers a theoretical perspective that can clarify important features of these practices. Given the programmatic nature of the procedure and its object (assessing and refining explanations), it extends work on the domain of computational argumentation.",

The database was established by collecting published reports on the annealing treatment of selective laser melting (SLM) Ti6Al4V, from 2006 to 2020. Using the established model, it is possible to prescribe annealing parameters and predict properties after annealing for SLM Ti-6Al-4V parts with high confidence. The model shows high accuracy in the prediction of yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS). It is found that the YS and UTS are sensitive to the annealing parameters, including temperature and holding time. The YS and UTS are also sensitive to initial YS and UTS of as-printed parts. The model suggests that an annealing process of the holding time of fewer than 4 h and the holding temperature lower than 850°C is desirable for as-printed Ti6Al4V parts to reach the YS required by the ASTM standard. By studying the collected data of microstructure and tensile properties of annealed Ti6Al4V, a new Hall-Petch relationship is proposed to correlate grain size and YS for annealed SLM Ti6Al4V parts in this work. The prediction of strain to failure shows lower accuracy compared with the predictions of YS and UTS due to the large scattering of the experimental data collected from the published reports.",

Our approach combines various diagnostic paradigms seamlessly, such as the model-based and heuristic association-based paradigms, in order to better approximate the reasoning process of the domain experts.

However, the approach also accentuates the problem of how to handle and manage conflicts, which frequently arise due to several factors as discussed in this paper.

    "abstract": "To obtain optimal design efficiently in the initial design stage of a ship, a hybrid system is developed by integrating the optimization algorithm and knowledge-based system. The hybrid system can manipulate numeric and symbolic data simultaneously. To increase search efficiency in a design space, the optimization algorithm (optimizer) is implemented by coupling a genetic algorithm (GA) and search method. The optimizer determines a candidate region around the optimum point by using the GA, then searches the optimum point by the search method concentrating in this region, thus reducing calculation time and increasing search efficiency. To generate input data for the optimizer, a rule-based system is developed. Some domain knowledge for ship optimization in the initial design stage is retrieved from a database of existing ship and design experts. The obtained knowledge is stored in the knowledge base. The optimizer incorporates a knowledge-based system with heuristic and analytic knowledge, thereby narrowing the feasible space of the design variables. Therefore, search speed and the capability of finding an optimum point will be increased in comparison with conventional approach. The developed system is applied principally to particulars of optimization of ships with multicriteria. Through application ship design, it shows that the hybrid system can be a useful tool for optimum design.",

    "abstract": "A logic-based approach for automating the processing of design standards is illustrated. This approach is composed of three steps: conceptualization, formalization and implementation. Conceptualization is referred to as the representation of the knowledge necessary for solving the problem of interest in terms of objects and relations. Formalization is referred to as the representation of the objects and relations of interest as axioms using the language of predicate calculus. And, Implementation is referred to as the representation of the axioms of interest and the strategy for manipulating axioms using the constructs of a programming language. The paper illustrates the logic-based approach to engineering problem-solving automation by considering the portion of the AISC Specification that governs the design of axially loaded members. First, the relations of interest are identified (Conceptualization). Then, predicate calculus is used to formally represent the relations (Formalization) as axioms and to mechanically manipulate them. The checking and designing of structural components via mechanical manipulation of the axioms are illustrated in the paper. Finally, a constraint logic programming language is used to develop a computer program for automatic processing of the specification (Implementation). This program is composed of a set of rules that closely resemble the formulated axioms.",

    "abstract": "The external formation of integrated circuits based on lithographic processes is not the only possible method for manufacturing electron devices, either integrated circuits or photovoltaic cells. Planar technology, based on external formation, requires a certain sequence of interactions between the structured medium and the object being formed, in which the configuration of the region to be formed and its position are defined by the structure of the media and their alignment with the object. By contrast, in self-formation the interaction between an object to be formed and its chaotic medium is controlled by the object structure itself, and it is this interaction that changes the object's structure, leading to its increasing complexity. Three kinds of self-formation can be used in manufacturing: self-formation , based on a certain sequential interaction between an object and chaotic media; development , which requires only a single chaotic medium; and reproduction , which involves a developing object generating primary objects. All these cases represent self-formation of artificial systems. Simpler patterns of self-formation have already led to various patents and technologies, while more complex ones may be applied in the future. The following article attempts to define the necessary and sufficient conditions for self-formation.",

    "abstract": "Under the concept of a global economy, enterprises are assigning design and production environments around the world in different areas. A serious issue of information exchange emerges as companies use traditional hardware and very distinct software appropriate to their field of expertise. To overcome the problem of low productivity due to the interruption of information, the concept of simultaneous engineering and concurrent design becomes very significant. In this article an agent-based ship design system is developed to support cooperation in distributed ship design environments. Above all, the conflicts that occur while sharing knowledge in the system must be resolved. One approach is to adopt a case-based conflict resolution strategy formulated to resolve current conflict on the basis of similar previously resolved cases in agent-based collaborative design system environments. To do this, conflict cases that occur in the initial ship design stage are extracted. On the basis of the extracted cases, a case base is constructed. In addition, a conflict resolution handler located in the superagent called a facilitator, an agent to control other subagents, is developed to treat conflict problems effectively by case-based reasoning. The case-based conflict resolution strategy is evaluated by applying it to a collaborative design process in the initial ship design stage, especially the machinery outfitting design, the preliminary design, the hullform design, and the structural design. Through the help of the collaboration of the design agents, the facilitator, the conflict resolution handler, and the case-based system, a designer can make decisions based on similar previously resolved cases.",

The accuracy and depth of evaluation has increased markedly because of the availability of powerful simulation tools and the development of domain-specific knowledge bases. Efforts to extend the state of the art in evaluation have unfortunately been carried out in stovepipe fashion, depending on domain-specific views both of function and of what constitutes “good” design. Although synthesis as practiced by humans is an intentional process that centers on the notion of function, computational synthesis often eschews such intention for sheer permutation. Rather than combining synthesis and analysis to form an integrated design environment, current methods focus on comprehensive search for solutions within highly circumscribed subdomains of design. This paper presents an overview of the progress made in representing design function across abstraction levels proven useful to human designers. Through an example application in the domain of mechatronics, these representations are integrated across domains and throughout the design process.",

The fillet curve may be a trochoid or an arc of suitable size as specified by designer. The fillet stress is influenced by the fillet geometry as well as the number of teeth, modules, and the pressure angle of the gear. Because the relationship is nonlinear and complex, an artificial neural network and a backpropagation algorithm are used in the present work to predict the fillet stresses. Training data are obtained from finite element simulations that are greatly reduced using Taguchi's design of experiments. Each simulation takes around 30 min. The 4-5-1 network and a sigmoid activation function are chosen. TRAINLM function is used for training the network with a learning rate parameter of 0.01 and a momentum constant of 0.8. The neural network is able to predict the fillet stresses in 0.03 s with reasonable accuracy for spur gears having 25–125 teeth, a 1–5 mm module, a 0.05–0.45 mm fillet radius, and a 15°–25° pressure angle.",

The specific aim of this article is to present a conceptual framework for design rationale systems. The framework built upon the cross-fertilization of approaches and methods drawn from systems engineering and philosophy, focussing on the notions of antecedence and consequence. It was developed in the course of tackling design problems originating in industrial contexts. The methods developed were thus evaluated, updated, and refined in real applications. Two application cases are described that have been drawn from the aerospace and power sectors, respectively. The applications showed that the framework's central antecedent/consequent scheme provides a cell from which to develop either a history of actual successive changes, or a tree of alternative possible projected designs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The ability to work with ambiguity and compute new designs based on both defined and emergent shapes are unique advantages of shape grammars. Realizing these benefits in design practice requires the implementation of general purpose shape grammar interpreters that support: (a) the detection of arbitrary subshapes in arbitrary shapes and (b) the application of shape rules that use these subshapes to create new shapes. The complexity of currently available interpreters results from their combination of shape computation (for subshape detection and the application of rules) with computational geometry (for the geometric operations need to generate new shapes). This paper proposes a shape grammar implementation method for three-dimensional circular arcs represented as rational quadratic Bézier curves based on lattice theory that reduces this complexity by separating steps in a shape computation process from the geometrical operations associated with specific grammars and shapes. The method is demonstrated through application to two well-known shape grammars: Stiny's triangles grammar and Jowers and Earl's trefoil grammar. A prototype computer implementation of an interpreter kernel has been built and its application to both grammars is presented. The use of Bézier curves in three dimensions opens the possibility to extend shape grammar implementations to cover the wider range of applications that are needed before practical implementations for use in real life product design and development processes become feasible.",

A grammar is a Rhinoceros3d model; thus users can manipulate all its parts directly and immediately. That is, they can modify any shape without selecting or invoking an editor, and they can lay out the parts of the grammar in any way they find meaningful. Using this approach, which I call a whole-grammar approach, users are shielded from most subdomain tasks, like typing text files or specifying transformations. Informal observations suggest that users of this implementation can work effectively.",

By analyzing the variables needed to optimize the fleet size, which must be evaluated in combination with the event space method (ESM), the solution to this problem would normally require high computing performance and long computing times. Considering this, the combined use of an integer genetic algorithm (GA) and the ant colony optimization (ACO) method was proposed in order to determine the optimal solution. In order to analyze and highlight the added value of this proposal, several empirical simulations were performed. The results showed the potential strengths of the proposal related to its flexibility and capacity in solving large problems with a near optimal solution for large fleet size and potential real-world applications. Even larger problems can be solved this way than by using the complete enumeration approach and a non-family fleet approach. Thus, this allows for a more real solution to fleet design that also considers overcapacity, availability, and an LCC approach. The simulations showed that the model can be solved in much less time compared with the base model and allows for the resolution of a fleet of at least 64 trucks using GA and 130 using ACO, respectively. Thus, the proposed framework can solve real-world problems, such as the fleet design of mining companies, by offering a more realistic approach.",

Now, in this article, the invention of the airplane by the Wright brothers is analyzed as a retrospective case study. Key parts of the re-proposed notion of design abduction are demonstrated, and two new types of design abduction are identified, namely strategic abduction and dynamic abduction. Perhaps even more importantly, a new hypothesis on the cognitive basis of design abduction is reached. While the importance of model-based abduction (and reasoning) is confirmed, the case also pinpoints the central role of verbalization and discussion in supporting design reasoning in general and especially abduction. All in all, it seems that an improved understanding of design abduction and its cognitive basis would be instrumental in promoting more effective and efficient designing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The development of autonomous greenhouses has caught the interest of many researchers and industrial considering their potential of offering an optimal environment for the growth of high-quality crops with minimum resources. Since an autonomous greenhouse is a mechatronic system, the consideration of its subsystem (e.g. heating systems) and component (e.g. actuators and sensors) interactions early in the design phase can ease the product development process. Indeed, this consideration could shorten the design process, reduce the number of redesign loops, and improve the performance of the overall mechatronic system. In the case of a greenhouse, it would lead to a higher quality of the crops and a better management of resources. In this work, the layout design of a general autonomous greenhouse is translated into an optimization problem statement while considering product-related dependencies. Then, a genetic algorithm is used to carry out the optimization of the layout design. The methodology is applied to the design of a fully autonomous greenhouse (45 cm × 30 cm × 30 cm) for the growth of plants in space. Although some objectives are conflictual, the developed algorithm proposes a compromise to obtain a near-optimal feasible layout design. The algorithm was also able to optimize the volume of components (occupied space) while considering the energy consumption and the overall mass. Their respective summed values are 2844.32 cm 3 , which represents 7% of the total volume, 5.86 W, and 655.8 g.",

However, use of singular value decomposition technique with LM is considered as a novel method to overcome the problem of initial guess, which is presented for the first time in this research. In order to illustrate the benefits of the proposed algorithm, it has been applied in a Malaysian manufacturing company for forecasting in inventory control. Moreover, a comparison between the basic GMDH algorithm and the enhanced GMDH algorithm is made, and the results show that the accuracy of the proposed method is considerably high with reasonable reduction in processing time. Therefore, the enhanced GMDH method can be used to replace old techniques in an inventory control system to generate a structure when it is applied to a Kanban setting in the just in time system.",

Despite many different research results focusing on ambiguities reduction, fundamentally it is impossible to totally remove ambiguities with only qualitative methods and to guarantee the consistency of results. This prevents the wide use of qualitative reasoning techniques in practical situations, particularly in conceptual design, where qualitative reasoning is considered intrinsically useful. To improve this situation, this paper initially investigates the origin of ambiguities in qualitative reasoning. Then it proposes a method based on intelligent interventions of the user who is able to detect ambiguities, to prioritize interventions on these ambiguities, and to reduce ambiguities based on the least commitment strategy. This interaction method breaks through the limit of qualitative reasoning in practical applications to conceptual design. The method was implemented as a new feature in a software tool called the Knowledge Intensive Engineering Framework in order to be tested and used for a printer design.",

In 2005, the Faculty of Architecture, Building, and Planning of the University of Technology Eindhoven commenced a multidisciplinary master project on integral design focused on a sustainable climatic design. Students of architecture, building technology, structural engineering, and building services participated in these multidisciplinary master projects. The students began with a 2-day learning-by-practice workshop that was implemented and tested in collaboration with experienced professionals from the Royal Institute of Dutch Architects and the Dutch Association of Consulting Engineers.

    "abstract": "Abstract New styles can be created by modifying existing ones. In order to formalize style change using grammars, style has to be formally defined in the design language of a grammar. Previous studies in the use of grammars for style change do not give explicit rationale for transformation. How would designers decide which rules to modify in a grammar to generate necessary changes in style(s) of designs? This paper addresses the aforementioned issues by presenting a framework for strategic style change using goal-driven grammar transformations. The framework employs a style description scheme constructed by describing the aesthetic qualities of grammar elements using adjectival descriptors. We present techniques for the formal definition of style in the designs generated by grammars. The utility of the grammar transformation framework and the style description scheme is tested with an example of mobile phone design. Analyses reveal that constraining rules in grammars is a valid technique for generating designs with a dominance of desired adjectival descriptors, thus aiding in strategic style change.",

    "abstract": "Abstract One of the principal advantages of affordance-based design is that Gibson's theory of affordances is a relational theory, akin to other relational approaches such as relational biology and relational computer science. The relationships between artifacts and their designers and users are of such primary importance that only a theory that is able to deal with those relationships directly appears to be sufficient for describing the wide breadth of problems in engineering design. However, there is no precise definition for what qualifies as a relational theory. In mathematics, we do find something approaching a theory of relations, dating back at least to Charles Peirce's Logic of Relatives around 1870. While rather general, Peirce's ideas on the subject laid the foundation for advances in the 20th century, including the relational model of databases. This paper is a first attempt at applying the mathematics of relations to affordances, with the aim of more precisely characterizing affordances, which heretofore have been difficult to define and, lacking appropriate mathematics, nearly impossible to subject to computation. Meanwhile, the implicit computability of affordances as relations is demonstrated by examples drawn from engineering, physics, computer science, biology, and architecture.",

The new optimization algorithm introduced in this paper departs from the notion that optimal design choices over a large set of design parameters and properties can be driven by energy targets. We assume that design parameters are determined by many concurrent considerations fighting over the attention span of the design team. Our approach starts from a design outcome and asks the question, which set of discrete technologies are the right mix to reach an energy target in the cost optimal way? Such an approach has to face the challenge that the properties of market-available building technologies have a discrete nature that makes their optimal selection a combinatorial problem. The optimization algorithm searches the discrete combinatoric space by maximizing the following objective function: calculated energy savings divided by premium cost, where cost is defined as the additional cost over a baseline solution. The algorithm is codified into a custom MATLAB script and when compared to prescriptive methodologies is shown to be more cost effective and generically applicable given a palette of building technology alternatives and their corresponding cost data.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The main function of a heavy truck is to transport goods, with ton-kilometers/year as an example of a major quantitative performance measure. Furthermore, the truck is directly operated by a driver, who has several additional functional requirements, of both ergonomic and communicative characters. Failure of these functions may be a subjective experience, differing between drivers, but the failures are still important. Today's just-in-time delivery systems rely on getting the goods on time, and this requires high availability. Availability is reduced not only by technical failures but also by subjectively experienced failures, because these also require repairs, or downtime. Product reliability is a systems property that cannot be attributed to a single component. It is in many cases related to interaction between components, or to interaction between humans and the technical system, in the case of subjectively experienced failures. Reliability assessments of systems with interactive functions require a system model that includes the interfaces between the technical system and human features that are carriers of interactive functions. This paper proposes a model of system architecture, for the purpose of reliability assessments, that integrates different and complementary representations, such as function–means diagrams and a design structure matrix. The novelty of the presented approach is that it treats and integrates the technical and the human subsystems through the human–technical system interfaces. The proposed systems reliability approach is described and verified with a component analysis case study of an extended truck cab and driver system.",

First, an ontology-based semantic model of DR is developed based on the extended issue-based information system-based DR representation in order to effectively utilize the semantics embedded in DR, and a database of ontology-based DR is constructed, which supports SPARQL queries. Second, two SPARQL query generation methods are proposed. The first method generates initial SPARQL queries from natural language queries automatically using template matching, and the other generates initial SPARQL queries automatically from DR record-based queries. In addition, keyword extension and optimization is conducted to enhance the SPARQL-based retrieval. Third, a design rationale retrieval prototype system is implemented.

It was observed that modeling with interdependencies in belief networks simplifies the knowledge engineering task for the IC tester diagnosis problem, by avoiding procedural knowledge and focusing on the diagnostic component’s interdependencies. Several general model frameworks evolved through knowledge engineering to capture diagnostic expertise that facilitated expanding and modifying the networks. However, model implementation was restricted to a small portion of the modeling, that of contact resistance failures, which were due to time limitations and inefficiencies in the prototype inference software we used. Further research is recommended to refine existing methods, in order to speed evaluation of the models created in this research. With this accomplished, a more complete diagnosis can be achieved.",

    "abstract": "The concept of discretization of a design space is used to make initial selection of prior designs using specification matching, and to direct redesign with evaluation and iteration. A general paradigm for routine design has been developed and implemented in a system called IDS (Initial Design Selection.) For a given design domain, certain characteristics are identified that allow all specifications and models (which represent prior designs) in that design domain to be described in terms of their values or intervals that these values may lie in. These characteristics are seen as dimensions of a design space discretized into a finite number of partitions. Each partition is represented by a model, thought of as occupying its center. Each such model is associated with a deep model, which contains sufficient information for the modeled device, process, or system to be realized. Despite the fact that the models inhabiting the space are shallow, the paradigm comprises a relatively rich mathematical structure. This paper describes in detail a computational methodology to implement this domain-independent paradigm. The IDS paradigm presents a convenient and structured framework for acquiring and representing domain knowledge. This paper also briefly discusses an enhanced version of the system, which attempts iterative redesign directed by the particular mismatch between a specification and an otherwise promising model. To date, this methodology has been applied in a variety of design domains, including mechanism design, hydraulic component selection, assembly methods, and non-destructive testing methods.",

The system aims to facilitate the simulation requirements of different user groups that include engineers, mathematicians and numerical analysts. To attain this objective, a flexible multi-perspective modelling environment is proposed which incorporates three natural modelling platforms, namely; a physical model, a mathematical model and a numerical model. The modelling environment is integrated with a sophisticated numerical solver. We believe that combination of an open modelling system with a basic numerical simulator provides a powerful problem solving environment capable of meeting the needs of these different user groups. The overall system architecture is based on automatic transformation using mathematical and numerical knowledge bases between the three identified models. The knowledge bases are organized in a frame based manner to reflect the hierarchical nature of the knowledge in PDEs and numerical algorithms. The object oriented paradigm is used to bind local rule bases to each frame and for implementing a global inference mechanism which works over the hierarchical knowledge structures. Evaluation of the modelling environment has indicated that engineers can tackle PDE based engineering problems without the necessity for detailed knowledge of mathematics or numerical techniques and mathematicians can examine the mathematical properties of PDEs without the requirement of numerical expertise.",

Traditional Qualitative Reasoning is also unable to model this degree of ambiguity in shape. Cognitively, shapes are often represented in terms of an axial model. In defining 2D contours, such an axial representation is called the Medial Axis Transform or MAT. By perturbing the parameters of the MAT—length, link angle, and the node radius—one can define a shape class. Unlike the contour-to-MAT transform, which is well-known to be unstable, the MAT-to-contour process is an integrative process and is very stable. The variation in these parameters can be controlled by defining a suitable discretization over the parameter space. This leads to a broad class of similar shapes from which an optimized shape can be obtained for a given set of criteria. The optimizing criteria may involve the boundary description for each shape; the axial model is only used for generating the shape class. This Qualitative MAT model has been tested in several design optimization contexts, using Genetic Algorithms, and we show results for Automobile contours, IC engine parts, building profiles, etc.",

This paper describes a new, 3-D input system aimed at alleviating this problem. It is based on the use of a three-dimensional digitizer for the direct input of spatial coordinates, and an intelligent interactive user interface. The intent of this system is to create a high level, intelligent interface between the designer and a geometric solid modeler which would lighten the designer's burden in performing arduous 3-D geometric description tasks. The user interface is developed around the Knowledge Craft expert system building tool, using the rule-based Carnegie Representation Language OPS5 (CRL-OPS). The system uses schematic networks or frames and production rules to encode knowledge about geometric primitive digitization methods, object feature operators, solid modeler requirements, and input command functions. It also employs a forward-chaining inference strategy to direct the knowledge. This ensures that only a minimal amount of valid data entry is required by the user. However, if excessive data is entered the intelligent interface has the capability to extract the required information. As a result, the solid modeler can automatically create the appropriate object “primitive” or the specific object “feature” upon recognition by the expert system. It will be demonstrated that these capabilities can simplify the 3-D model description process.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a fuzzy neural network (FNN) based approach to construct an individual-oriented car-following system. The feature of this system is firstly to incorporate a personal risk-taking factor in addition to other mechanical factors as the input parameters. Through the learning capability of artificial network, the complex membership functions between the input factors and the output (i.e., the appropriate car-following headway) can be efficiently established, and then the fuzzy logic rules can be properly constructed. The performance of the FNN system is finally assessed against the field data. The results are inspiring that the system is proven capable of providing highly accurate predictions of the required car-following headways from person to person at various speeds. The success of this study provides some clues of utilizing FNN techniques in exploring some individual-oriented machines.",

    "abstract": "Most engineering design problems involve optimizing a number of often conflicting performance measures in the presence of multiple constraints. Traditional vector optimization techniques approach these problems by generating a set of Pareto-optimal solutions, where any specific objective can be further improved only at the cost of degrading one or more other objectives. The solutions obtained in this manner, however, are only single points within the space of all possible Pareto-optimal solutions and generally do not indicate to designers how small deviations from predicted design parameters settings affect the performance of the product or the process under study. In this paper we introduce a new approach to robust design based on the concept of inductive learning with regression trees. Given a set of training examples relating to a multiobjective design problem, we demonstrate how a multivariate regression tree can utilize an information-theoretic measure of covariance complexity to capture optimal, tradeoff design surfaces. The novelty of generating design surfaces as opposed to traditional points in the design space is that now designers are able to easily determine how the responses of a product or process vary as design parameters change. This ability is of paramount importance in situations where design parameter settings need to be modified during the lifetime of a product/process due to various economic or operational constraints. As a result, designers will be able to select optimal ranges for design parameters such that the product's performance indices exhibit minimal or tolerable deviations from their target values. To highlight the advantages of our methodology, we present a multiobjective example that deals with optimum design of an electric discharge machining (EDM) process.",

These are a radial-Gaussian neural networking system, a linear predictor, and a hybrid of these two. Two methods of using these models to predict ground acceleration are adopted. The first is based on a direct prediction of ground acceleration at some point in time in the future from a series of ground accelerations that occurred earlier in the earthquake event. The second is a recursive approach whereby a model predicts a sequence of future ground accelerations by feeding back its predictions to its inputs. The performances of the models are tested using the 1985 Mexico earthquake and aftershock. The linear predictor and hybrid models perform best at direct prediction while none of the models perform particularly well at recursive prediction. The paper concludes with an outline of some areas for future work.",

    "abstract": "This article addresses computational synthesis systems that attempt to find a structural description that matches a set of initial functional requirements and design constraints with a finite sequence of production rules. It has been previously shown by the author that it is computationally difficult to identify a sequence of production rules that can lead to a satisficing design solution. As a result, computational synthesis, particularly with large volumes of selection information, requires effective design search procedures. Many computational synthesis systems utilize transformational search strategies. However, such search strategies are inefficient due to the combinatorial nature of the problem. In this article, the problem is approached using a completely different paradigm. The new approach encodes a design search problem as a Boolean (propositional) satisfiability problem, such that from every satisfying Boolean-valued truth assignment to the corresponding Boolean expression we efficiently can derive a solution to the original synthesis problem (along with its finite sequence of production rules). A major advantage of the proposed approach is the possibility of utilizing recently developed powerful randomized search algorithms for solving Boolean satisfiability problems, which considerably outperform the most widely used satisfiability algorithms. The new design-as-satisfiability technique provides a flexible framework for stating a variety of design constraints, and also represents properly the theory behind modern constraint-based design systems.",

    "abstract": "Creative Stimulator (CreaStim) is an intelligent interface for pattern design that behaves as a semiactive partner to human designers rather than as a passive graphical or computational tool. By making adjustments to psychological differentials and/or design parameters, CreaStim is able to help designers to explore innovative pattern designs and to get inspiration, producing different types of novel designs. In this article, the mechanism, the technique, the implementation, and the testing of CreaStim are described. The basic principle of CreaStim is the catastrophe theory, which implies that sudden realization in the thinking process of design may lead to creativity. CreaStim tries to stimulate and/or impact designers' creativity in design process using the output of it, rather than to simulate the sudden realization. The core of the CreaStim is a neural network-based imagining engine, a data repository, and its learning strategies considering psychological factors. The psychological factors, which are thought one of the key influences to creative design, are based on the questionnaires completed by designers about the existing successful designs. The repository contains not only a traditional database storing functional attributes, economic attributes, graphic description, structural description, and psychological attributes, but also methods, rule-based knowledge, and pattern-type knowledge. And it is managed by an application program called Design Template Group (DTG) manager. Trained with 12 pieces of successful pattern designs and 528 pieces of pseudo-examples produced and evaluated by the authors, CreaStim is implemented for a PC and an evaluation poll from five designers shows that designers may most likely get some inspiration from the produced patterns and some of them can even be adopted as the design alternatives directly.",

Such a formal DR is usually a multicriteria decision problem, involving multiple disciplines. This paper proposes a systematic framework for DR using fuzzy set theory. This fuzzy approach to DR is considered particularly relevant for several reasons. First, information available at early design phases is often incomplete and imprecise. Second, the relationships between the product design parameters and the review criteria cannot usually be exactly expressed by mathematical functions due to the enormous complexity. Third, DR is frequently carried out using subjective expert judgments with some degree of uncertainty. The DR is defined as the reverse mapping between the design parameter domain and design requirement (review criterion) domain, as compared with Suh's theory of axiomatic design. Fuzzy sets are extensively introduced in the definitions of the domains and the mapping process to deal with imprecision, uncertainty, and incompleteness. A simple case study is used to demonstrate the resulting fuzzy set theory of axiomatic DR.",

    "abstract": "The word “topology” is derived from the Greek word “τοπος,” which means “position” or “location.” A simplified and thus partial definition has often been used (Croom, 1989, page 2): “topology deals with geometric properties which are dependent only upon the relative positions of the components of figures and not upon such concepts as length, size, and magnitude.” Topology deals with those properties of an object that remain invariant under continuous transformations (specifically bending, stretching, and squeezing, but not breaking or tearing). Topological notions and methods have illuminated and clarified basic structural concepts in diverse branches of modern mathematics. However, the influence of topology extends to almost every other discipline that formerly was not considered amenable to mathematical handling. For example, topology supports design and representation of mechanical devices, communication and transportation networks, topographic maps, and planning and controlling of complex activities. In addition, aspects of topology are closely related to symbolic logic, which forms the foundation of artificial intelligence. In the same way that the Euclidean plane satisfies certain axioms or postulates, it can be shown that certain abstract spaces—where the relations of points to sets and continuity of functions are important—have definite properties that can be analyzed without examining these spaces individually. By approaching engineering design from this abstract point of view, it is possible to use topological methods to study collections of geometric objects or collections of entities that are of concern in design analysis or synthesis. These collections of objects and or entities can be treated as spaces, and the elements in them as points.",

Features must be given an order for removal. This order, or sequence, is partially dependent on the geometric relationships between the features. If the geometric relationships between features are such that they dictate a particular sequence, the features are said to have an interaction. Identifying these interactions is an important first step in creating the process plan. An approach to solve this problem using constructive solid geometry operations and the Episodal Associative Memory (EAM) is demonstrated. The EAM is an associative memory that integrates dynamic memory organization and neural computing techniques. The geometric feature relationships can be represented by a pattern. This pattern captures very qualitative information about the geometric positions fo the features. The EAM can organize these patterns into groups of similar geometric relationships. A method for dealing with exceptions, and for retrieving and storing general machining problems associated with interacting features will be described. The system implemented is shown to correctly sequence several types of feature interactions.",

However, it is not immediately obvious how the design aspects of such tasks, where these are an important feature of problem solving, can be incorporated in this approach. Design issues differ from search problems in that there may be several choices, each valid in some sense, but not (necessarily) equally good or equally appropriate in the current context. A case study is described in which a methodology is used based on the development of proof plans . The ability to conduct research according to the Popperian framework of hypothesis, validation, testing, and modification in response to empirical evidence – the hypothetico-deductive approach – seems essential to any rigorous scientific endeavor. It is believed that proof planning is a method which readily exploits this inherently incrementalist approach and could prove to be a powerful tool in designing AI systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper presents an approach for the case adaptation, especially case repairing, in a case-based process planning system: PROCASE, for machining of rotational parts. In PROCASE, a new process plan is generated by adapting an existing similar process plan from its case library. Case adaptation is a crucial issue in achieving an automated case-based process planning system. This is because, usually, an existing process plan cannot necessarily produce an exact identical part as of the desired part. Adaptation is essential to tailor this existing plan to generate a new process plan for the new part. The case adaptation in this paper comprises case modification, case simulation, and case repairing. The modifier uses the knowledge extracted from case library to edit the retrieved similar plan. The simulator plays an important role in verifying the adapted plan as well as in directing the plan repairing. The repairing rules are indexed by the error messages obtained from the simulation. With the proposed case adaptation, the system will have the capability to repair the erroneous plans to achieve an automated and intelligent process planning system. This paper will first briefly introduce the case representation and case retrieval in PROCASE. Then the rest of the paper is dedicated to the case adaptation.",

The models are based on a mesoscale probabilistic graph model, where the sensing and computing capabilities of the nodes are captured as the probabilities of correct predictions. A topology-informed vector autoregression model and a latent variable vector autoregression model are proposed to model the correlations between prediction capabilities of nodes as linear functional relationships. A hybrid Gaussian process regression model is also developed to capture both the nonlinear spatial and temporal correlations between nodes. The new information dynamics models are demonstrated and tested with a simulator of CPSS networks. The results show that the topological information of networks can improve the efficiency in constructing the time series models.

This paper summarizes the evolution of my ideas in the last two decades. I start with a review of the original ideas. From an artificial intelligence (AI) point of view, it is not PSMs as such, which are essentially high-level design strategies for computation, that are interesting, but PSMs associated with tasks that have a relation to AI and cognition. They are also interesting with respect to cognitive architecture proposals such as Soar and ACT-R: PSMs are observed regularities in the use of knowledge that an exclusive focus on the architecture level might miss, the latter providing no vocabulary to talk about these regularities. PSMs in the original conception are closely connected to a specific view of knowledge: symbolic expressions represented in a repository and retrieved as needed. I join critics of this view, and maintain with them that most often knowledge is not retrieved from a base as much as constructed as needed. This criticism, however, raises the question of what is in memory that is not knowledge as traditionally conceived in AI, but can support the construction of knowledge in predicate–symbolic form. My recent proposal about cognition and multimodality offers a possible answer. In this view, much of memory consists of perceptual and kinesthetic images, which can be recalled during deliberation and from which internal perception can generate linguistic–symbolic knowledge. For example, from a mental image of a configuration of objects, numerous sentences can be constructed describing spatial relations between the objects. My work on diagrammatic reasoning is an implemented example of how this might work. These internal perceptions on imagistic representations are a new kind of PSM.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In a construction project, resource leveling techniques are necessary as a primary schedule-improvement tool to reduce overall project cost by decreasing day-to-day fluctuation in resource usage and resource idleness. There are, however, some limitations in traditional resource leveling techniques. Conventional heuristic approaches cannot guarantee a near-optimum solution for every construction project; a given heuristic may perform well on one project and poorly on another. The existing optimization approaches, such as linear programming and enumeration methods, are best applicable only to small size problems. Recently, there has been success in the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for solving some optimization problems. The paper discusses how state-of-the-art ANNs can be a functional alternative to traditional resource leveling techniques. It then investigates the application of different ANN models (such as backpropagation networks, Hopfield networks, Boltzmann machines, and competition ANNs) to resource leveling problems. Because the development of ANNs involves not only science but also experience, the paper presents various intuitive yet effective ways of mapping resource leveling problems on different applicable ANN architectures. To demonstrate the application of ANNs to resource leveling, a simple ANN model is developed using a Hopfield network. The conclusion highlights the usefulness and the limitations of ANNs when applied to resource leveling problems.",

The main benefit of the proposed system over Hamming networks, its main counterpart, is that it can group patterns into different classes along any boundary. The system is shown to outperform 1) the Hamming network for a character recognition problem where the images are subject to both position change and noise; and 2) a radial-Gaussian network in a truck-type classification problem. A variant of the system, where hidden neuron thresholds are set to zero, is shown to further improve performance if a comprehensive set of noise-free input patterns are available for training.",

The grouping layer clusters features such as cubes or cylinders into groups for each surface of an object. The topology layer recognizes patterns formed by the groups on each surface, and describes the pattern in terms of topological structures. The orientation layer selects promising surfaces from the two objects and attempts to align the two surfaces. If the orientation layer aligns the topological structures on the two surfaces, the matching layer tries to pair the features within the topological structures. The confirmation layer inspects paired features to determine whether the surfaces are compatible. If the surfaces are compatible, then the two objects qualitatively fit together.",

Encore combines object-oriented, rule-based, and procedural programming techniques to design 60 Hz power transformers. The system uses a heuristic search strategy to generate design alternatives, and then selects the “best” design based on size and efficiency considerations The heuristics are represented and applied as rules; the electromagnetic components are modelled as frame-like objects. The object-oriented nature of this system facilitated enhancements; by specializing some of the objects comprising a power transformer, a power inductor model was quickly developed. Encore reduces design time from a couple of days to less than an hour; it is being used to design the transformers and inductors of power supplies in new Schlumberger well-logging tools. The system was implemented on a Xerox interlisp Workstation using an object-oriented environment called STROBE.",

In computational terms, routine design can also be seen as “search,” (sometimes also called “exploitation”) in so far as a certain, predefined search space is searched for a design solution. For creative design, where the search proceeds outside the boundaries of a predefined search space, the term “exploration” can be used.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Numerical simulation of partial differential equations (PDEs) plays a crucial role in predicting the behavior-of physical systems and in modern engineering design. However, to produce reliable results with a PDE simulator, a human expert must typically expend considerable time and effort in setting up the simulation. Most of this effort is spent in generating the grid, the discretization of the spatial domain that the PDE simulator requires as input. To properly design a grid, the gridder must not only consider the characteristics of the spatial domain, but also the physics of the situation and the peculiarities of the numerical simulator. This article describes an intelligent gridder that is capable of analyzing the topology of the spatial domain and of predicting approximate physical behaviors based on the geometry of the spatial domain to automatically generate grids for computational fluid dynamics simulators. Typically, gridding programs are given a partitioning of the spatial domain to assist the gridder. Our gridder is capable of performing this partitioning. This enables the gridder to automatically grid spatial domains with a wide range of configurations.",

Manufacturing domains require agent-based problem solving to be flexible and tolerant of faulty information (e.g., due to faulty sensors), equipments, and communication links. These issues are addressed by research on Sensible Agents, capable of 1) Dynamic Adaptive Autonomy and 2) explicit Perspective Modeling. Dynamic Adaptive Autonomy allows Sensible Agents to change problem-solving roles during system operation to address dynamic factory floor conditions, while Perspective Models internal to a respective Sensible Agent serve to maintain knowledge about the agent itself, other agents, and the environment.

    "abstract": "Abstract Readily available and affordable technologies such as the Internet, groupware, and Web conferencing mean that sharing information and data within teams is simple and affordable. However, many small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) struggle to implement or perform distributed collaborative design effectively or even at all. As part of the extended design team of large multinational companies it is not uncommon for SMEs to have collaborative working tools and practice imposed on them to meet the requirements of the multinational. However, many SMEs need to develop their own working practices to support effective, collaborative team design within their own organization or their extended design team. Through a series of case studies, this paper describes how a typical SME achieved successful distributed team design within their organization. A “strategy for effective distributed team design” encompassing the processes, methods, and tools developed and implemented within the company to achieve this success, is presented. In total, four live case studies, spanning a 2-year period, are described; two initial studies focus on current distributed design team practice clearly highlighting issues and areas for improvement, leading to the development of processes, methods, and tools to support distributed collaborative team design. A strategy for effective distributed team design encapsulating these processes methods and tools is presented together with its evaluation through two further live industrial case studies. The case studies themselves, together with the processes, methods, and tools developed by this company, could be adopted by other SMEs directly to achieve the same success. Generic and transferable findings drawn from this study aimed at helping others achieve this success form the conclusion of the paper.",

Indeed, having the possibility to know if a given CoP is successful or not is essential to better manage it over time. The existing approaches for efficiency evaluation are difficult and time-consuming to put into action on real CoPs. They require either to evaluate subjective constructs making the analysis unreliable, either to work out a knowledge interaction matrix that is difficult to set up. However, these approaches build their evaluation on the fact that a CoP is successful if knowledge is exchanged between the members. It is the case if there are some interactions between the actors involved in the CoP. Therefore, we propose to analyze these interactions through the exchanges of emails thanks to Natural Language Processing. Our approach is systematic and semi-automated. It requires the e-mails exchanged and the definition of the speech-acts that will be retrieved. We apply it on a real project-based CoP: the SEPOLBE research project that involves different expertise fields. It allows us to identify the CoP core group and to emphasize learning processes between members with different backgrounds (Microbiology, Electrochemistry and Civil engineering).",

This paper aims to clarify how simple spatial configurations may emerge from concise metaphoric descriptions at the conceptual design phase. To this aim, we propose a framework for a metaphor-based design process. As a basis for the framework, we introduce the concept of “complementary visual potential” – a property which ties the spatial configuration of the objects in the composition with their metaphoric roles. The framework is developed by studying the practice of metaphor-based spatial configuration design in Japanese rock gardens. Accordingly, it is implemented and tested in this context by attempting to generate alternative designs for an existing rock composition in the famous garden of Ryōan-ji. This is followed by a discussion of its possible implications and potential for generalization to other areas of design.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Today, in the field of architecture, bio-inspired algorithms can be used to design and seek solutions to design problems. Two of the most popular algorithms are the genetic algorithm (GA) and swarm intelligence algorithm. However, no study has examined the simultaneous use of these two bio-inspired algorithms in the field of architecture. Therefore, this study aims to test whether these two bio-inspired algorithms can work together. To this end, GA is used in this study to optimize the rule-based swarm algorithm for the conceptual design process. In this optimization test, the objective was to increase the surface area, and the constraints are parcel boundary and building height. Further, the forms associated with swarm agents were determined as variables. Following the case studies, the study concludes that the two bio-inspired algorithms can effectively work together.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Design effort is a key resource for product design projects. Environments where design effort is scarce, and therefore valuable, include hackathons and other time-limited design challenges. Predicting design effort needs is key to successful project planning; therefore, understanding design effort-influencing factors (objective considerations that are universally accepted to exert influence on a subject, that is, types of phenomena, constraints, characteristics, or stimulus) will aid in planning success, offering an improved organizational understanding of product design, characterizing the design space and providing a perspective to assess project briefs from the outset. This paper presents the Collaborative Factor Identification for Design Effort (CoFIDE) Method based on Hird's (2012) method for developing resource forecasting tools for new product development teams. CoFIDE enables the collection of novel data of, and insight into, the collaborative understanding and perceptions of the most influential factors of design effort levels in design projects and how their behavior changes over the course of design projects. CoFIDE also enables design teams, hackathon teams, and makerspace collaborators to characterize their creative spaces, to quickly enable mutual understanding, without the need for complex software and large bodies of past project data. This insight offers design teams, hackathon teams, and makerspace collaborators opportunities to capitalize on positive influences while minimizing negative influences. This paper demonstrates the use of CoFIDE through a case study with a UK-based product design agency, which enabled the design team to identify and model the behavior of four influential factors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The choice of components in industrial design involves setting design parameters that typically must reside inside permissible ranges called “design margins”. This paper proposes a novel automated method called the Margin-Based General Regression Neural Network (MB-GRNN) that classifies design errors for design parameters that are outside of permissible ranges as outliers, directly from industrial design data, using an unsupervised machine learning approach. The method is based on a modified GRNN that estimates extremal margin boundaries of design parameters by self-learning the features from datasets. These extremal permissible margin boundaries are determined by “stretching out” the upper and lower GRNN surfaces using an iterative application of stretch factors (a second kernel weighting factor). The method creates a variable insensitive band surrounding the data cloud, interlinked with the normal regression function, providing upper and lower margin boundaries. These boundaries can then be used to determine outliers and to predict a range of permissible values of design parameters during design. Pushing out extremal margin boundaries reduce the false identification of outliers. This classification technique could be used by industrial engineers to detect likely outliers and to predict a range of permissible output limits for chosen design parameters. The efficacy of this method has been validated against the widespread Parzen window method by comparing experimental results from three multivariate datasets. It was found that the two methods have different but complementary capabilities. The MB-GRNN also uses a modified algorithm for estimating the smoothing parameter using a combination of clustering, k-nearest neighbor, and localized covariance matrix.",

When interacting with design representations, designers often rely on metaphorical descriptions as interpretive devices, which aid in coping with the task at hand. Consequently, such descriptions can enlighten us regarding the designer's perspective of the situation, and their analysis can deepen our knowledge of design cognition. We observe designers as they metaphorically interpret design representations during a simple task of spatial configuration, and introduce an approach for modeling this practice, as a means for getting insights into the designer's mental world. In this, we draw on traditional practices of protocol analysis, as well as on state-of-the-art theoretical frameworks for situated design and discourse analysis. Our integrated approach demonstrates how important relations between external and internal reality in design activity can be mapped and visualized. This sheds some light on the cognitive process of interpretation in design. The proposed method can both serve as a basis for detailed analyses of design cognition and for the enhancement of current models for situated design agents.",

Extraction of filler morphology greatly depends on accurate segmentation of fillers (fibers and particles), which is a challenging task due to the overlap of fibers and particles and their obscure presence in SEM images. Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) have been shown to be very effective at object recognition in digital images. This paper proposes an automatic filler detection system in SEM images, utilizing a Mask Region-based CNN architecture. The proposed system can simultaneously classify, detect, and segment fillers in SEM images, making it suitable for morphology analysis of fillers and automatic quality inspection. We also propose a novel SEM image simulation procedure to overcome the data scarcity for training a deep CNN architecture. The proposed filler detection system is trained on the simulated images. It is shown that the trained network can detect and segment fillers with higher accuracy even in the overlapping and obscure situations. The performance and robustness of the proposed system are evaluated using both simulated and real microscopic images.",

A comprehensive review of the AD indicates that the powerful principle of AD has been widely studied and applied to many areas, however, inexperienced practitioners of the AD theory still find it difficult to follow or apply the principles in their design which inadvertently often leads to misunderstanding and skepticism. The lack of definitive descriptions for all the elements and specific approaches to guiding the mapping process restricts the development and application of AD theory. This paper improves the design procedure of AD with Extenics. The elements in AD domain are expressed by basic-elements of Extenics, and the formulations are generated. The mapping process based on AD and Extenics is developed. The improved design procedure provides designers with a theoretical foundation based on the logical and rational thought process, meanwhile the solution space can be expanded and innovative designs are inspired. Based on the proposed design procedure, a computer-aided system is developed, which makes the complex and fuzzy design activity clear and easy to follow by filling in the blanks in a step-by-step manner. An example of a novel corn harvester header design scheme is considered to illustrate the validity of the improved design procedure.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the era of rapid product update and intense competition, aesthetic design has been increasingly important in various fields, as aesthetic feelings of customers largely influence their purchase preferences. However, the quantification of aesthetic feeling is still a very subjective process due to vague evaluations. The determination of form parameters according to aesthetics is difficult hitherto. Aesthetic measure recently arises as a prominent tool for this purpose using formulas derived from aesthetic theory. But as revealed by existing studies, it needs to be customized with deterministic and objective methods to be reliable in practice use. To facilitate this application, this paper proposes an evolutionary form design method, integrating aesthetic dimension selection and parameter optimization. After summarizing initial aesthetic dimensions, aesthetic dimension selection based on expert decision-making and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is carried out. With filtered aesthetic dimensions, design parameters are optimized with NSGA-II (non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm). The quality of pareto solutions obtained to be design schemes is assessed by three criteria to conduct sensitivity analysis of cross and mutation probability and population size. Our experiment using bicycle form design shows that the proposed evolutionary form design method can generate numerous and variant aesthetic design schemes rapidly. This is very useful for both product redesign and innovative new product development.",

    "abstract": "Abstract One of the biggest challenges associated with design and digital reconstruction of free forms comes from uniqueness and unrepeatability of these shapes. During digital reconstruction of these forms, the designer has to choose the right set of geometric features and then compose them in a way that will enable the most accurate reconstruction of the geometry. While doing this, the designer primarily relies on personal experience gained through work with free-form objects of similar geometry. In our opinion, the analysis of free-form objects geometry should rely upon semantic interpretation of their geometric and other features, and the greatest challenge of automation of digital reconstruction and free-form object design in general is closely related to automation of semantic interpretation of geometric and other free-form object features. In this paper, a case of chest bone implant digital reconstruction is presented, where a new semantic model called the active semantic model was used for modeling the meaning of geometric elements, that is, the semantic features of a free-form object. The active semantic model and its analogy-based reasoning algorithms have shown themselves as applicable for the automation of semantic interpretation of the unique, unrepeatable, and unpredictable forms of chest bone. Moreover, this semantic model showed the potential to help automate selecting and composing of geometric features for efficient digital reconstruction of the geometry of free forms.",

We distinguish this research by focusing on the interactions between local and architectural impulses in the form of designer mistakes and dissolution, division, and combination impulses, respectively, for a distributed design case study. We provide statistical support for the “parallel character hypothesis,” which asserts that parallel arrangements generally best mitigate dissolution and division impulses. We find that local impulses tend to slow convergence, but systems also subjected to dissolution or division impulses still favor parallel arrangements. We statistically uphold the conclusion that the strategy to mitigate combination impulses is unaffected by the presence of local impulses.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper presents a robust reliability analysis method for systems of multimodular redundant (MMR) controllers using the method of partitioning and parallel processing of a Markov chain (PPMC). A Markov chain is formulated to represent the N distinct states of the MMR controllers. Such a Markov chain has N 2 directed edges, and each edge corresponds to a transition probability between a pair of start and end states. Because N can be easily increased substantially, the system reliability analysis may require large computational resources, such as the central processing unit usage and memory occupation. By the PPMC, a Markov chain's transition probability matrix can be partitioned and reordered, such that the system reliability can be evaluated through only the diagonal submatrices of the transition probability matrix. In addition, calculations regarding the submatrices are independent of each other and thus can be conducted in parallel to assure the efficiency. The simulation results show that, compared with the sequential method applied to an intact Markov chain, the proposed PPMC can improve the performance and produce allowable accuracy for the reliability analysis on large-scale systems of MMR controllers.",

Numerous design methodologies exist to support the design of a product or set of products that address this consumer variation. However, currently there is little work supporting the selection of a design methodology, resulting in an ad hoc or a priori decision before conceptual design begins. This paper presents an affordance-based design method for use prior to conceptual design to help designers understand the consumer variation that is present. This facilitates the creation of a product or set of products that meets the demands of both the consumer(s) and the organization that is developing the product. Once consumer variation is understood, conceptual design can be performed with a more complete understanding of the overall problem.",

This ideation can be measured by metrics such as usefulness, novelty, variety, quality, completeness, and quantity. In bioinspired design, biological analogies are used to inspire design concepts. Biological analogies have been provided in earlier studies to measure ideation effectiveness. Tools like IDEA-INSPIRE, DANE, etc., allow designers to search analogies using functions, behaviors, and structures. However, we wanted to inquire about the effect of providing a very large number of biological analogies (26), fulfilling the same function to develop bioinspired solutions. In this paper, an empirical study has been performed to analyze the effect of biological analogies on ideation. The designers are exposed to provided multiple biological analogies and generate concepts for which four ideation metrics: novelty, variety, quality, and quantity metrics are evaluated. The results are compared to the unaided condition where other designers are given the same task. A new method to measure variety using a 2D matrix has been presented. The results suggest that designers can generate bioinspired solutions when multiple biological analogies performing similar functions are provided in a presentable format. Statistically, exposure to multiple biological analogies in idea generation can significantly increase the variety of design ideas. The novelty, quality, and quantity for the biological group and control group remain the same.",

Intelligent robotic welding is an area that has received much consideration owing to the widespread use of robots in welding operations. With the dawn of Industry 4.0, machine learning is substantially developing to alleviate issues around applying robotic welding intelligently. Identifying the correct weld joint type is essential for intelligent robotic welding. It affects the quality of the weldment and impacts the per-unit cost. The robot controller must change different welding parameters per joint type to attain the desired weld quality. This article presents an approach that uses image features like edges, corners, and blobs to identify different weld joint types using machine learning algorithms. Feature extractors perform the task of feature extraction. The feature extractor choice is crucial for accurate weld joint identification. The present study compares the performance of five feature extractors, namely (1) Histogram of gradients, (2) Local binary pattern, (3) ReLU3 layer, (4) ReLU4 layer, and (5) Pooling layer of ResNet18 Neural network applied to classifiers like Support Vector machines, K -Nearest Neighbor and Decision trees. We trained and tested the proposed model using the Kaggle Weld joint dataset (for Butt and Fillet Joints) and our in-house dataset (for Vee, lap, and corner joints). The experimental findings show that out of the 15 models, the pre-trained ResNet18 feature extractor with an Support Vector Machines classifier has excellent performance with a threefold recognition accuracy of 98.74% for the mentioned dataset with a computation time of 31 ms per image.",

The expert system, called DASE, identifies the most likely failure modes that may be developed by columns or beams of a damaged building, determines the severity of damage and, suggests immediate actions to take afterwards, such as rehabilitation procedures or tests, to maintain an acceptable local safety level. Floor damage classification and restoration guidelines can also be provided, assuming that all of the structural components in a building's floor have been inspected. The Analytic Hierarchy Process has been implemented as the overall framework to determine the severity of damage, since it allows judgments and personal values to be represented in a systematic and rational manner. DASE provides graphics that customize the user interface and an explanation facility. The knowledge acquisition process consisted primarily of the analysis of documented knowledge found through literature research.",

In order to derive the order of magnitude relation between any two variables, a nonlinear optimization problem is solved for the minimum and maximum values of the ratio between the two variables, subject to two classes of constraints. The first class of constraints corresponds to the quantitative model and the second class of constraints corresponds to the qualitative model. The optimization approach is shown to provide more precise inferences as compared to the conventional constraint satisfaction approaches. Moreover, this approach provides a crucial step in developing unified frameworks that allow the incorporation of qualitative information at various levels of abstraction into numerical frameworks used for reasoning with quantitative models.",

First, the types of design problems upon which the method may apply are presented and a graph topology is adopted for representing the problem decomposition in the level of design parameter interrelations (design parameter graphs). Next, the problem of constraint violations for the design parameters is discussed. It is shown that these violations can be resolved by modifying the values of the primary design parameters and recalculating the values of the violated parameters. Any “blind” attempt of modifying the values of the primary design parameters for resolving occurring violations may, eventually, create additional violations. The proposed method guides the designer toward those primary design parameters that present the least possibility of creating more violations when their values are modified. This is achieved by applying multiple criteria and by producing a final, sorted list of primary design parameters. The designer may then choose the first element of this list to handle efficiently the violations of the design parameters. Two examples are given on a design space where constraint violations occur. Through these examples, the capability of the proposed method in helping the designer to handle constraint violation is shown. The concluding remarks, except for summarizing the potential of the method, determine its boundaries and include a reference on relative work currently under investigation.",

Therefore, two questions arise: What kind of deviation occurs in the association rules over time, and how could these temporal rules be presented efficiently? To address this problem of representation, we propose a method of visualizing temporal association rules in a virtual model with interactive exploration. The presentation form is a three-dimensional correlation matrix, and the visualization methods used are brushing and glyphs. Interactive functions used for displaying rule attributes and exploring temporal rules are implemented by utilizing Virtual Reality Modeling Language v2 mechanisms. Furthermore, to give a direction of rule potential for the user, the rule statistical interestingness is evaluated on the basis of combining weighted characteristics of rule and rule matrix. A constraint-based association rule mining tool which creates the virtual model as an output is presented, including the most relevant experiences from the development of the tool. The applicability of the overall approach has been verified by using the developed tool for data mining on a hot strip mill of a steel plant.",

Nowadays, the systems are able to frequently carry out even hundreds of measurements in parallel and store them in databases. However, these data are still rarely used in the analysis of processes. In this article, preparation of the raw data for further analysis is considered using feature extraction from signals by piecewise linear modeling. Prior to modeling, a preprocessing phase that removes some artifacts from the data is suggested. Because optimal models are computationally infeasible, fast heuristic algorithms must be utilized. Outlines for the optimal and some fast heuristic algorithms with modifications required by the preprocessing are given. In order to illustrate utilization of the features, a process diagnostics framework is presented. Among a large number of signals, the procedure finds the ones that best explain the observed short-term fluctuations in one signal. In the experiments, the piecewise linear modeling algorithms are compared using a massive data set from an operational paper machine. The use of piecewise linear representations in the analysis of changes in one real process measurement signal is demonstrated.",

The method is based on multiple extensive searches of the design space and produces a final priority list for the instantiation of the primary design entities. If followed, this list ensures the generation of the most decisive design information at the very beginning of the design process. Additionally, the method can produce a priority list of design tasks, which represents the order of completion of these tasks. Finally, it offers a representation platform for tracking the evolution of the design process. First, a brief overview of the current literature is presented, after which the method is presented in detail. Entities, descriptors, and tasks are used for the representation of the design knowledge. They are linked in order to form multiple design relations, formally represented by digraphs . Simple set relations and graph theories are used as mathematical background to the method. Design experience is also taken into account through a weighting process of the primary design entities. Finally, an example of a belt conveyor design is presented, followed by a discussion of the results and some general conclusions. The method may be considered as a design-assisting tool that dynamically processes pieces of design knowledge and suggests corresponding design paths. Additionally, it relates the design tasks in a ordered form. Its extension—currently under elaboration—is expected to treat systematically the problem of identifying and handling the design knowledge inconsistencies.",

In addition, aspects of topology are closely related to symbolic logic, which forms the foundation of artificial intelligence. By approaching engineering design from this abstract point of view, it is possible to use topological methods to study collections of geometric objects or collections of entities that are of concern in design analysis or synthesis. The importance of topological representation and reasoning in analysis, design, and manufacturing is heightened by the contemporary view that stresses the need for conceptual design.",

However, some other constraints are difficult to represent, like comfort or user satisfaction. Partially defined constraints can be used to model the incomplete knowledge of a concept or a relation. Instead of only computing with the known part of the constraint, we propose to complete its definition by using machine-learning techniques. Because constraints are actively used during solving for pruning domains, building a classifier for instances is not enough: we need a solver able to reduce variable domains. Our technique is composed of two steps: first we learn a classifier for the constraint's projections and then we transform the classifier into a propagator. We show that our technique not only has good learning performances but also yields a very efficient solver for the learned constraint.",

In this work, we propose a new design exploration method that enables sketch-based editing of free-form surface geometries where specific modifications can be applied at different levels of detail. This multilevel detail approach allows the designer to work from existing models and make alterations at coarse and fine representations of the geometry, thereby providing increased conceptual flexibility during modeling. At the heart of our approach lies a multiscale representation of the geometry obtained through a spectral analysis on the discrete free-form surface. This representation is accompanied by a sketch-based surface editing algorithm that enables edits to be made at different levels. The seamless transfer of modifications across different levels of detail facilitates a fluid exploration of the geometry by eliminating the need for a manual specification of the shape hierarchy. We demonstrate our method with several design examples.",

In many cases, a combination of models will be more effective than a single model. Our research investigates this idea in the context of engineering design optimization. We present a family of strategies that use multiple models for unconstrained optimization of engineering designs. The strategies are useful when multiple approximations of an objective function can be implemented by compositional modelling techniques. We show how a compositional modelling library can be used to construct a variety of locally calibratable approximation schemes that can be incorporated into the optimization strategies. We analyze the optimization strategies and approximation schemes to formulate and prove sufficient conditions for correctness and convergence. We also report experimental tests of our methods in the domain of sailing yacht design. Our results demonstrate dramatic reductions in the CPU time required for optimization, on the problems we tested, with no significant loss in design quality.",

    "abstract": "According to Simon (1983), machine learning is a process that improves the performance of an intelligent system. The performance task of a design system is to arrive at a structural description of a device given its functional description. Machine learning can occur, to improve the performance of the design system, in a number of ways. The learning can make the process of arriving at a known structure to function mapping faster, either by improving the control strategy or by learning new world knowledge needed for the structure to function mapping. It can also improve the performance of the design system by allowing it to come up with new structure to function mappings. The latter kinds of learning leads to innovative designs. The work presented in this paper, EnviroAdapt, belongs to the latter category. EnviroAdapt has the performance task of designing devices along with their operating environments. The EnviroAdapt learns about the novel environments and designs devices for these environments. This learning process is enabled by adapting the previous designs of devices along with their operating environments. This adaptation process makes use of abstracting general mechanisms from the previous designs, then instantiating them in the context of new design problem. Both of these processes are driven by the characteristics of the new design problem that requires a device to operate within a novel operating environment.",

Graph theory and separation of structure from function concepts have been integrated into an expert system called DOMES (Design Of Mechanism by an Expert System) to effectively implement the following three activities: 1. enumeration of all non-isomorphic labelled graphs; 2. identification of those graphs which satisfy structural constraints; 3. sketching of mechanisms corresponding to a given graph. Developed theories and algorithms are applied to a robot gripper design and a variable-stroke piston engine design. The results from these two applications indicate that the automated techniques effectively identify all previously obtained solutions via manual techniques. Additional solutions are also identified and several errors of the manual process are detected. The developed methodologies and software appear to perform a complete and unbiased search of all possible candidate designs and are not prone to the errors of the manual process. Other important features of DOMES are: 1. it can learn and reason, by analogy, about a new design problem based on its experience of the problems previously solved by the system: 2. it has the capability to incrementally expand its knowledge base of rejection criteria by converting into LISP code information obtained through a query-based interactive session with a human designer; 3. it can select the set of rejection criteria relevant to a design problem from its knowledge base of rejection criteria. These procedures could become a powerful tool for design engineers, especially at the conceptual stage of design.",

User interfaces are generated dynamically through the composition of model fragments that are stored in a fragment library.

The proposed method factors reusability into selection by evaluating models based on comparative estimates of effort involved in adapting them for reuse to model a query problem. The method is developed for FEA models of component-based designs. FEA modeling of electronic chip packages is used to illustrate the method's usefulness. We conclude with a discussion on the method's advantages and limitations and highlight important issues for further research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Product variant design, as one of the key enabling technologies of mass customization, is the transfer of variant information among mating parts from the perspective of informatics. A dimension constraint network (DCN) among mating parts carries on the task of transferring variant information. What are the information transfer characteristics of dimensions in a constraint network is a fundamental issue to plan the product variant design process reasonably. We begin by showing the natural dynamics of the DCN from two aspects: structure and uncertainty. The information efficiency of the DCN was proposed based on its simple path to specify the information transfer capability of the network. Based on this, the information centrality of the dimension was developed by measuring the efficiency loss of the DCN after the removal of a dimension from the network, which describes the information transfer capability of this dimension. Further, the information centrality of a part was derived. Using a spherical valve subassembly, we calculated the information centrality of the dimensions in a constraint network. We determined that the information centrality of dimension is highly correlated to its out-degree. An approach to plan the sequence of the part variant design according to its information centrality was proposed. We calculated the uncertainties of the DCN and its cumulative uncertainties under different sequences of the part variant design. Results indicate that part variant design under the descending information centrality of the parts minimizes the uncertainty of the DCN. This suggests a new method of planning the sequence of part variant design.",

Sketching is an important ideation process in conceptual design for recording and evaluating flashing moments of inspiration. The present study aims to provide a framework for exploring the effects of biological examples on the sketching contours of products, as well as the perceptual matching degree between design ideas generated via sketching and the desired functions. Elliptic Fourier descriptors with principal component analysis and perceptual matching were used to evaluate and compare the effects of biological examples, no examples, and human-engineered examples from different product categories and within one product category on the sketches in an experiment that involved 28 participants. The application of elliptic Fourier descriptors with principal component analysis shows that there are significant differences in the third and seventh principal components. It is also found that exposure to biological examples can produce more sketches with high perceptual matching degree than the other three conditions, but there are no significant effects of the example exposure on the Pearson correlation coefficients of semantic differential evaluation value vectors between design problems and sketches. These results demonstrate that exposure to biological examples will correlate with Elliptic Fourier descriptors of sketches and will not significantly increase the perceptual matching degree between sketches and the desired function.",

This paper examines a Game Theoretic deployment approach to robotic teams in an unstructured environment. A simulation model is developed and used to compare the performance of gaming rules with a non-anticipatory deterministic deployment rule. The initial Game Theoretic rule can be enhanced to exhibit both locally and globally adaptive characteristics. The new rule outperforms both the deterministic algorithm and the straightforward game-theoretic rule. This is achieved by adapting to trends in local regions in the environment as well as anticipating global eventualities.",

Qualitative reasoning, based on confluences, provides global control over the feasible directions of variable adjustments, while quantitative reasoning, based on the dependency network and perturbation analysis, can be used to propose actual quantity of local variable adjustments. We used the design of a helical compression spring as an example to illustrate the performance of IPD system.

    "abstract": "Abstract An ongoing research effort is consolidating material and process knowledge in a critiquing system dealing with fuzzy criteria to aid designers in evaluating the incorporation of composite materials into their design. The extent of knowledge required to perform the task of evaluating composite processes and materials is often beyond the expertise of many design engineers as they lack understanding of the nature of composite material manufacturing. The system under development is known as the Composites Design and Manufacturing Critiquing System (CDMCS). The CDMCS critiques a submitted design through interaction with the user. An account of the strengths and weaknesses of the design is supplied to the user through the facilities. The current focus of the system is on process selection, but the system is generic so that other aspects of composite material manufacturing may be included. The system is implemented in Macintosh™ Common LISP. This article describes the features of the system that have been implemented. The system is currently being extended to cover more than the primary process component of the domain.",

The main focus of attention is the selection and sequencing of material removal operations for components in accordance with the design geometry. This is a central issue in automated process planning. The proposed symbolic calculus defines a computational formalism for symbolic manipulation of feature volumes, so that reasoning about volumetric removals can be treated in a logical manner by using well-defined procedures of algorithmic synthesis. This potentially encourages a more generic approach to the automation of outline and detailed process planning. The underlying philosophy is that a properly interpreted object topology upon the feature model allows the logical synthesis of volumetric removal sequences. The number of sequences is constrained by algorithms within the planning system that consider part geometry as expressed by features. This reduces the problem space associated with plan synthesis. Some of the geometrically viable sequences have the potential for further development to form viable machining removal sequences, or outline process plans.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Constraint-based reasoning is a problem-solving approach based on deductive reasoning. In this approach, a problem is modeled in terms of hypotheses and conclusion constraints, and it is solved via constraint satisfaction. The ability to handle linear and nonlinear algebraic constraints is essential for successful application of constraint-based reasoning in engineering. Due to the scarcity of algebraic techniques for satisfying nonlinear constraints, little attention has been paid to the use of constraint-based reasoning for solving nonlinear problems. This paper examines the use of the Grobner Bases method for satisfying nonlinear constraints in the context of constraint-based reasoning. After a brief introduction to the Grobner Bases method and its role in constraint-based reasoning, two examples are presented. The first example illustrates the use of Grobner bases, in the context of constraint-based reasoning, for reasoning about the behavior of beams. The second example illustrates the geometry configuration of truss structures via constraint-based reasoning.",

    "abstract": "A spatial reasoning system must be able to represent and manipulate the location of objects in its world model. There are two general schemes for doing this—absolute symbolic schemes based on an independent coordinate system, and relative schemes which reference objects in relation to other objects of known location. This paper is concerned strictly with the latter. Given a relative scheme, there are several possible strategies for segmenting space. Two such strategies are identified and discussed. The first, called the situation-specific strategy is the one currently being explored and employed in most spatial reasoning systems. The second, here referred to as the general-purpose or cognitive strategy is the one used by the human cognitive system. It is suggested that while both strategies have outstanding strengths and weakness, the latter holds greater potential for achieving maximal coverage with minimal resources. The paper then proceeds to describe the structure of cognitive models of locative space and to specify how such models can be built from 3-D geometric models. This description is based on a cognitively motivated implementation called SEE-TELL. SEE-TELL takes as its input a 3-D geometric model and outputs a proposition of the form locative (referent, relatum) . The function which maps the input to the output is a two part heuristic procedure. The first part determines the referent and relatum and the second part assigns the locative predicate. The system can assign the predicates on, right-of/left-of, and front-of/back-of. On and right-of/left-of are, respectively, illustrative of invariant and variant locatives. Front-of/back-of allows for a conflict between an ego/observer and a canonical object. These three situations are thought to cover the different classes of problems that can arise in assigning any locative. The paper concludes by summarizing the findings, identifying the shortcomings and limitations, and making suggestions for future work.",

    "abstract": "Since the inception of research on machine learning (ML), these techniques have been associated with the task of automated knowledge generation or knowledge reorganization. This association still prevails, as seen in this issue. When the use of ML programs began to attract researchers in engineering design, different existing tools were used to test their utility and gradually, variations of these tools and methods have sprung up. In many cases, the use of these tools was based on availability and not necessarily applicability. When we began working on ML in design, we attempted to follow a different path (Reich, 1991a; Reich &amp; Fenves, 1992) that led to the design of Bridger (Reich &amp; Fenves, 1995), a system for learning bridge synthesis knowledge. Subsequent experiences and further reflection led us to conclude that the process of using ML in design requires careful and systematic treatment for identifying appropriate ML programs for executing the learning tasks we wish to perform (Reich, 1991b, 1993a). Another observation was that the task of creating or reorganizing knowledge for real design tasks is outside the scope of present ML programs. Establishing the practical importance of ML techniques had to start by addressing engineering problems that could benefit from present ML programs.",

A method is proposed to translate the other two classes of constraints into dimensional constraints. Thus, it is possible to uniformly deal with all of those geometrical layout constraints. The method is twofold. First, it converts regional, interference constraints into a set of simple inequalities. Then each inequality is solved by a geometric gadget , which is a structured set of dimensional constraints. A prototype system is developed and applied to some layout design examples.",

We describe an agent framework called GAME ( g oal-oriented, a gent- m anaged e nvironment), and focus on how GAME agents search cooperatively for information requested by a user. Cooperative search entails several issues such as coordinating agent activities, maintaining transparency to agent heterogeneity, and designing information formats to be shared among the agents that require examination. This article analyzes these issues and describes how they are handled in the GAME framework. Cooperative search effectively supports collaboration and information sharing not only among agents in a domain, but also among GAME agents developed across domains. We illustrate the application of cooperative search in task-oriented domains such as Manufacturing and Front Office showing how GAME promotes intradomain and interdomain collaboration in a Factory environment.",

    "abstract": "Current methods to develop standard Architecture, Engineering, Construction (AEC) product models focus on the definition of product model semantics without concurrent and formal consideration of the engineering analyses that such models must support, or formal consideration of the requirements for sharing information between applications. We present two case studies that demonstrate a service to extract data from product models and provide inputs to component analysis applications. The service was validated in a proof-of-concept application called the Internet Broker for Engineering Services (IBES) that extracts information for component analysis from product models that are external to the application and accessed across the Internet. IBES was tested for two research cases. The product model for the first case, control valve selection is based on STEP Application Protocol 227. The product model for the second case, control valve diagnosis, specifies additional semantics that support the operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) phase of the facility life cycle. The cases offer evidence that large standard data models can support routine analyses for control valves. However, the amount of shared information between the case applications is small and is largely dependent upon the concurrence of component behaviors that are necessary to model analysis. The IBES reference model and reasoning to support information extraction was consistent for both cases. This consistency suggests that it is possible to define a general set of computational methods that integrate project information models with external component analysis applications across the product life cycle. We argue that enabling a web-based link between product models and applications requires a set of capabilities, including bi-directional communication between separated data and analysis nodes, query generation, data translation, and validation of data extracted from semistandard models. We discuss the tentative implication that minimal shared information calls into question the assumption that large core product models will work effectively in practice.",

The method is developed on the basis of relationships between system performance parameters and physical objects, that is, components of the system. These relationships are identified by system functional domain and are modeled in terms of a bipartite graph, called Diagnosability Bipartite Graph (DBG). A matrix called Diagnosability Matrix (DM) represents the DBG. Various diagnosability parameters of the system are derived from the DBG and the DM and these are useful in evaluation and comparison of design variants of the system. These parameters: are maximum number of set conflicts (MNS), maximum number of components in a set conflict (MNCS), diagnosability effort and cost (DEC), and average merit of diagnosability (AMD). The design having the lowest value of MNCS, AMD, and DEC; and highest value of MNS has the highest diagnosability. On the basis of these, a best design alternative is selected from diagnosability point of view. Moreover, components, which have poor diagnosability, are also identified. Maximum number of set conflicts (MNS) also guides in system fault diagnosis. The proposed procedure aids in the design and development of maintainable systems from diagnosability consideration. The method can also be used for evaluating and comparing the diagnosability of the systems. This method is illustrated with the help of two examples.",

When the user designates a curve range to subtract from an initial shape and provides a new curved shape to add to it, the tool splits the initial shape, scales and aligns the curve to be added to fit into this range, introduces additional control points at the joining ends of the new curve to preserve continuity and redraws the new curve.

Multiple-attributed decision-making (MADM) processes are already well established to choose the preeminent alternative from the finite set of alternatives, but there is some lack of geometrical evidence if the alternatives are considered as multi-dimensional points. In this paper, a fresh spatial approach is proposed based on nearest neighbor search (NNS) in which the nearness parameter is considered as a Manhattan norm (Taxicab geometry) in turn which is a function of the Euclidean norm and cosine similarity to raise a preeminent alternative under the MADM framework. Cryogenic storage tank and flywheel are considered as two case studies to check the validity of the proposed spatial approach based on NNS in material selection. The result shows the right choice for the cryogenic storage tank is the austenitic steel (SS 301 FH), and for the flywheel, it is a composite material (Kevler 49-epoxy FRP) those are consistent with the real-world practice and the results are compared with other MADM methods of previous works.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Computational simplification tools can make complex information sources easier to read for engineering designers. To guide and evaluate such approaches, it is necessary to understand how designers process information and how that information can be enhanced and measured. Here, we establish an approach for enhancing and measuring the comprehensibility of technical information for engineering designers. It is grounded in theories of document search and comprehension and provides theoretically supported principles for enhancing information and methods for measuring comprehension experimentally. It is tailored for engineering design in that it (i) does not summarize or remove potentially important information, (ii) is suitable for long, complex sources of information, (iii) can be applied in experiments that simulate real-life information sharing scenarios, and (iv) enables the measurement of domain-specific comprehension. The feasibility of the approach was tested by using patent documents as a test case since they represent a valuable but underutilized source of technical information. A 2 (patent documents) × 2 (conditions: control vs. modified) experiment was conducted with 28 professional engineering designers. Two patent documents were modified with six information design principles. Comprehension scores were higher for the modified patent than for the control, but the change was not statistically significant ( p = 0.073). We attribute this either to redundancy effects causing a smaller than expected overall improvement in performance, or differences in prior knowledge for each patent. Overall, this approach offers a novel method for investigating and measuring information comprehensibility in engineering design; however, its effectiveness in enhancing information comprehensibility remains unvalidated.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Early phases of the design process require designers to select into view elements of the problem that they deem important. This exploration process is commonly referred to as problem framing and is essential to solution generation. There have recently been calls in the literature for more precise representations of framing activity and how individual designers come to negotiate shared frames in team settings. This paper presents a novel research approach to understand design framing activity using a system thinking lens. Systems thinking is the way that we understand a system’s components and the interrelations to create interventions, which can be used to move the system outcomes in a more favorable direction. The proposed approach is based on the observation that systems as mental representations of the problem bear some similarity to frames as collections of concepts implicit in the designer’s cognition. Systems mapping – a common visualization tool used to facilitate systems thinking – could then be used to model external representations of framing, made explicit through speech, and sketches. We thus adapt systems mapping to develop a coding scheme to analyze verbal protocols of design activity to retrospectively represent framing activity. The coding scheme is applied on two distinct datasets. The resulting system maps are analyzed to highlight team problem frames, individual contributions, and how the framing activity evolves over time. This approach is well suited to visualize the framing activity that occurs in open-ended problem contexts, where designers are more focused on problem finding and analysis rather than concept generation and detailed design. Several future research avenues for which this approach could be used or extended, including using new computational methods, are presented.",

Basic element detection is seen as the basis for digitizing drawings. Aiming at the problem of low detection accuracy of existing drawing basic elements, an improved basic elements detection algorithm for bridge engineering design drawings based on YOLOv5 is proposed. Firstly, coordinate attention is introduced into the feature extraction network to enhance the feature extraction capability of the algorithm and alleviate the problem of difficult recognition of texture features inside grayscale images. Then, targeting objectives across different scales, the standard 3 × 3 convolution in the feature pyramid network is replaced with switchable atrous convolution, and the atrous rate is adaptively selected for convolution computation to expand the sensory field. Finally, experiments are conducted on the bridge engineering design drawings basic elements detection dataset, and the experimental results show that when the Intersection over Union is 0.5, the proposed algorithm achieves a mean average precision of 93.6%, which is 3.4% higher compared to the original YOLOv5 algorithm, and it can satisfy the accuracy requirement of bridge engineering design drawings basic elements detection.",

The overall analysis technique incorporates such constraints within the set-based framework with logic programming.

It can be argued that this is due to two fundamental shortcomings of the computational paradigm underlying spreadsheets. First, the distinction between input and output cells has to be fixed before computations. Second, cells may have only exact values. As a result, spread-sheets support the user only with primitive iterative problem solving schemes based on trial-and-error methods. A constraint-based computational paradigm for next generation interval spreadsheets is presented. The scheme makes it possible to exploit incomplete/inexact data (intervals), and it can support problem solving in a top-down fashion. Current spreadsheets constitute a special case of the more general interval constraint spreadsheets proposed.",

Experimental results reveal that embedding constraint propagation in the machine sequencing approach significantly reduces the computation time more than by just using the machine sequencing approach alone. Further, the proposed temporal constraint propagation algorithms provide an order of magnitude improvement on the computation time over the conventional constraint propagation algorithm.",

    "abstract": "We describe an approach that uses causal and geometric reasoning to construct explanations for the purposes of the geometric features on the parts of a mechanical device. To identify the purpose of a feature, the device is simulated with and without the feature. The simulations are then translated into a “causal-process” representation, which allows qualitatively important differences to be identified. These differences reveal the behaviors caused and prevented by the feature and thus provide useful cues about the feature's purpose. A clear understanding of the feature's purpose, however, requires a detailed analysis of the causal connections between the caused and prevented behaviors. This presents a significant challenge because one has to understand how a behavior that normally takes place affects (or is affected by) another behavior that is normally absent. This article describes techniques for identifying such elusive relationships. These techniques employ a set of rules that can determine if one behavior enables or disables another that is spatially and temporally far away. They do so by geometrically examining the traces of the causal processes in the device's configuration space. Using the results of this analysis, our program can automatically generate text output describing how the feature performs its function.",

Computational agents have been developed within the artificial intelligence community over an extended period. The concept of an agent can be traced to Carl Hewitt's 1977 work on “actors.” Hewitt defined actors as self-contained, interactive, and concurrently executing objects. Since then, considerable research has gone into developing the concept of an agent and into formalizing agents, developing multiagent systems, and exploring their use. The use of agents in design is more recent, and the first PhDs in the area appeared in the early 1990s. Although a precise and unique definition of an agent has yet to be agreed upon, one distinguishing characteristic of an agent is that it exhibits autonomous behavior. Research on agents in design focuses on two primary areas: how to make agents useful in design, and how to apply them to design tasks. This Special Issue has papers from both areas.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Although an accurate reliability assessment is essential to build a resilient infrastructure, it usually requires time-consuming computation. To reduce the computational burden, machine learning-based surrogate models have been used extensively to predict the probability of failure for structural designs. Nevertheless, the surrogate model still needs to compute and assess a certain number of training samples to achieve sufficient prediction accuracy. This paper proposes a new surrogate method for reliability analysis called Adaptive Hyperball Kriging Reliability Analysis (AHKRA). The AHKRA method revolves around using a hyperball-based sampling region. The radius of the hyperball represents the precision of reliability analysis. It is iteratively adjusted based on the number of samples required to evaluate the probability of failure with a target coefficient of variation. AHKRA adopts samples in a hyperball instead of an n -sigma rule-based sampling region to avoid the curse of dimensionality. The application of AHKRA in ten mathematical and two practical cases verifies its accuracy, efficiency, and robustness as it outperforms previous Kriging-based methods.",

With the decreasing cost of additive manufacture, the application of topology optimization in the design of structural components has begun to increase. This paper provides a method for using topology optimization to reduce the power dissipation of fluid dynamics systems, with the novelty of it being the first application of stochastic mechanisms in the design of 3D fluid–solid geometrical interfaces. The optimization algorithm uses the continuous adjoint method for sensitivity analysis and is optimized against an objective function for fluid power dissipation. The paper details the methodology behind a vanilla gradient descent approach before introducing stochastic behavior through a minibatch-based system. Both algorithms are then applied to a novel case study for an internal combustion engine's piston cooling gallery before the performance of each algorithm's resulting geometry is analyzed and compared. The vanilla gradient descent algorithm achieves an 8.9% improvement in pressure loss through the case study, and this is surpassed by the stochastic descent algorithm which achieved a 9.9% improvement, however this improvement came with a large time cost. Both approaches produced similarly unintuitive geometry solutions to successfully improve the performance of the cooling gallery.",

However, current engineering case retrieval methods struggle to measure semantic similarity between FEA cases. Therefore, this article proposed a method for measuring the similarity of FEA cases based on ontology semantic trees. FEA tasks are used as indexes for FEA cases, and an FEA case ontology is constructed. By using named entity recognition technology, pivotal entities are extracted from FEA tasks, enabling the instantiation of the FEA case ontology and the creation of a structured representation for FEA cases. Then, a multitree algorithm is used to calculate the semantic similarity of FEA cases. Finally, the correctness of this method was confirmed through an FEA case retrieval experiment on a pressure vessel. The experimental results clearly showed that the approach outlined in this article aligns more closely with expert ratings, providing strong validation for its effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "An efficient locally minimum-time trajectory planning algorithm for coordinately operating multiple robots is introduced. The task of the robots is to carry a common rigid object from an initial position to a final position along a given path in three-dimensional workspace in minimum time. The number of robots in the system is arbitrary. In the proposed algorithm, the desired motion of the common object carried by the robots is used as the key to planning of the trajectories of all the non-redundant robots involved. The search method is used in the trajectory planning. The planned robot trajectories satisfy the joint velocity, acceleration and torque constraints as well as the path constraints. The other constraints such as collision-free constraints, can be easily incorporated into the trajectory planning in future research.",

    "abstract": "MAPCon II is the second generation (Muralidhar and Irish, IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Commumcctions 6(5), 869–873, 1988) of an expert system that interactively guides a user in performing off-line configuration for local area networks that use MAP, the manufacturing automation protocol. This paper describes the configuration task in general and MAPCon in particular. Though MAPCon's purpose is off-line configuration, its problem domain requires that it accomplish other reasoning objectives in addition to those commonly associated with configuration. It is in the process of being expanded into an on-line network supervisor. We develop a taxonomy of reasoning objectives and show how MAPCon combines two different kinds of reasoning to accomplish its objectives. Our experience confirms that of other researchers, and suggests that building robust, practical systems will require us to understand more clearly the interfaces among different reasoning objectives. The paper has four parts: 1. a definition of configuration and other reasoning objectives; 2. a summary of the problem domain in which MAPCon operates; 3. a description of MAPCon as the user sees it; 4. a look ‘under the hood’ to see how MAPCon combines different objectives.",

When an expert system is augmented with the fuzzy logic system, the inference capability of the expert system is greatly expanded; and the establishment of a rule-based knowledge base becomes much easier and more economical. Interpretations of the system’s power and possible future research directions conclude the paper.",

The technique is applicable to situations where the differential equations governing the behavior of a system are nonlinear and poorly understood, such as is the case for frost-heave and thaw-settlement processes in soils. A description is first provided of a means of modeling the unknown component of governing differential equations. A range of levels of understanding of these equations is considered. A method of discretizing the resultant neural models of these equations is then illustrated, and the way in which these can be used to simulate the behavior of a process is described. The performance of the proposed neural network approach is then assessed in a series of experiments simulating the nonlinear thermal behavior of translucent solid materials. The system is proven capable of providing highly accurate simulations of system behavior sustained over many thousands of simulation time steps. The paper concludes with an identification of several ongoing areas of further development and application of the proposed tool.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Product configuration is when an artifact from a product family is assembled from a set of predefined components that can only be combined in certain ways. These ways are defined by configuration rules. The product developers inspect the configuration rules when they develop new configuration rules or modify the configuration rules set. The inspection of configuration rules is thereby an important activity to avoid errors in the configuration rules set. Several formulations of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) are proposed that facilitate the inspection of configuration rules in propositional logic (IF-THEN, AND, NOT, OR, etc.). Many of the configuration rules are so called production rules ; that is, a configuration rule is an IF-THEN expression that fires when the IF condition is met. Several configuration rules build chains that fire during the product configuration. It is therefore important not only to inspect single configuration rules but also to analyze the effect of multiple configuration rules. Formulating the tasks as variations of the CSP can support the inspection activity. More specifically, we address the reformulation of configuration rules, testing of feature variant combinations, and counting of item quantities from an item set. The suggested CSPs are tested on industrial vehicle configuration rules for computational performance. The results show that the time for achieving results from the solving of the CSP is within seconds. Our future work will be to implement the various CSPs into a demonstrator that could be tested by product developers.",

The aims of the research include the selection of components that most closely match a set of requirements which include fluid characteristics, economic constraints, and company policies or preferences. In addition, we consider the storage and retrieval of requirement sets and corresponding component selections. The benefits of maintaining temporal knowledge are twofold: to enhance performance through reuse when new requirement sets are similar to previous sets, and to re-assess selections in the light of changes over time, for example, to the set of available components, to company policy, or, perhaps, to national safety regulations. We propose a temporal truth maintenance system (TTMS) to support this management of selection knowledge over time.",

As a result, a sequence of inspection actions is formulated, which, when performed, will achieve the desired measurements. In manufacturing, automated inspection technologies, such as Computer-Aided Inspection (CAI) or Co-ordinate Measuring Machines (CMMs), will be facilitated by inspection planning. Inspection planning involves the following four aspects: representation of inspection features; process formalization; modeling of inspection activities; and, finally, plan synthesis. This paper discusses an approach to knowledge-based inspection planning. Accordingly, a prototype inspection planning system has been developed, which is also described in this paper.",

    "abstract": "The complexity of mechanical design is reflected in the complexity of the design constraints which relate functional requirements to design parameters. Reformulations of the design constraints can significantly reduce this complexity. This is accomplished by a transformation to alternative design parameters, such as a critical ratio, a non-dimensional parameter, or a simple difference; e.g. the ratio of surface area to volume for heat transfer loss, the Reynold's number in fluid mechanics, or the velocity difference across a fluid coupling. We have developed a method by which the alternative parameters are chosen for physical significance and for the ability to create a more direct correspondence to functional behavior as determined by measures of serial and block decomposability of the constraints. Rules have been developed for the creation of physically significant new parameters from the algebraic combination of the original parameters. The rules are based on engineering principles and rely on knowledge about what a parameter physically represents rather than other qualities such as dimensions. A computer based system, called EUDOXUS, has been developed to automate this procedure. The system operates on a set of design constraints to produce sets of transformed constraints in terms of alternative design parameters. The method and its implementation have demonstrated successful results for many highly nonlinear and highly coupled parameterized designs from many mechanical engineering domains.",

Models of the product and of the process are represented by logical assertions in a common logical language. CAD/CAM functions are represented by the application of logical inference rules, which correspond to the derivation of new information as well as to actions. This allows all the different kinds of model and specification used in design and manufacturing to be represented in a computer in a common form. It therefore allows the representation of constraints and rules connecting any aspects of design and manufacturing together. This approach has all the advantages of formal specifiction, namely, ease of expression, communication, standardization and abstraction. At the same time, we demonstrate its practical implementation in an efficient form, and which is industry compatible, and we report practical experience with using this approach for CAD/CAM models and for intelligent CAD/CAM functions.",

The knowledge acquisition task required for the construction of knowledge bases for these systems is formidable because of the necessity of accurately modeling hundreds of physical devices. We discuss a novel approach to the capture of this component knowledge entitled automated knowledge generation (AKG) that utilizes constraint mechanisms predicated on physical behavior of devices for the propagation of truth through the component model base. A basic objective has been to construct a complete knowledge base for a model-based reasoning system from information that resides in computer-aided design (CAD) databases. If CAD has been used in the design of a process control system, then structural information relating the components will be available and can be utilized for the knowledge acquisition function. Relaxation labeling is the constraint-satisfaction method used to resolve the functionality of the network of components. It is shown that the relaxation algorithm used is superior to simple translation schemes.",

    "abstract": "In this article, an approach is presented for the representation and reasoning over qualitative spatial relations. A set-theoretic approach is used for representing the topology of objects and underlying space by retaining connectivity relationships between objects and space components in a structure, denoted, adjacency matrix. Spatial relations are represented by the intersection of components, and spatial reasoning is achieved by the application of general rules for the propagation of the intersection constraints between those components. The representation approach is general and can be adapted for different space resolutions and granularities of relations. The reasoning mechanism is simple and the spatial compositions are achieved in a finite definite number of steps, controlled by the complexity needed in the representation of objects and the granularity of the spatial relations required. The application of the method is presented over geometric structures that takes into account qualitative surface height information. It is also shown how directional relationships can be used in a hybrid approach for richer composition scenarios. The main advantage of this work is that it offers a unified platform for handling different relations in the qualitative space, which is a step toward developing general spatial reasoning engines for large spatial databases.",

In this process, additional information (such as location of the viewpoints and the points visible from a particular viewpoint) is available and can be exploited for accurately recovering the shape of the objects portrayed in the images. Initially, the set of points is subjected to a Delaunay triangulation that fills the convex hull of the set of points with disjoint tetrahedra. The key idea of the shape recovery algorithm is to eliminate triangles that obstruct the visibility of points from certain viewpoints, whose locations are known from the image acquisition process. The major contribution of this paper is that we have been able to design an algorithm for surface reconstruction that handles a wide variety of shapes, as opposed to currently existing techniques.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we describe an approach to automated manufacturing feature extraction and operations planning that combines the two processes to benefit both. When viewed in planning terms, if feature extraction is the process of identifying planning goals, and operations planning is the the process of selecting and sequencing planning operators, then what we are doing can be viewed as combining the normally separate processes of finding goals and developing instantiated operators to satisfy them. Thus, we call this approach Ebgoc (Effector-Based Goal and Operator Construction), and we have implemented it in a computer program called Mediator. Effectors are the physical equipment, such as tools and machines, that are used to transform the initial materials into the desired end product (goal). We say that this approach is effector-based (rather than feature-based) because we do not recognize a fixed set of features, but instead we geometrically derive the set of shapes that can be machined with the currently available set of effectors. Thus, each shop can customize Mediator so that it identifies machinable volumes appropriate for the resource in that specific shop. This approach gives Mediator several important properties. It can 1) effectively handle feature interactions (e.g., volumetric intersections), 2) be customized to produce features appropriate to specific shop resources, 3) identify areas that the current resources cannot machine, and 4) handle nonstandard, user-defined tooling.",

In a design experiment, a group of 12 architects were handed a design brief. Their drawing activity was recorded and they were required to externalize their thoughts during the design process. Both design solutions and verbal comments were analysed and modelled. A separate group of experienced architects used their expert knowledge to assign creativity and efficiency scores to the 12 design solutions. The design solutions were evaluated spatially. Protocol analysis studies including linkography and macroscopic analysis were used to discern distinctive patterns in the cognitive and metacognition activity of designs marked with the highest and least creativity scores. Entropy models of the linkographs and knowledge graphs were further introduced Finally, we assessed how creativity and efficiency correlates to experiment variables, cognitive activity, metacognitive activity, spatial and functional distribution of spaces in the design solutions, and the number and type of design constraints applied through the course of design. Through this investigation, we suggest that expert knowledge can be used to assess creativity and efficiency in designs. Our findings indicate that efficient layouts have distinct spatial features, and that cognitive and metacognitive activity in design that yields a highly creative outcome corresponds to higher frequencies of design moves and higher linkages between design moves.",

The surrogate models were prepared by training artificial neural networks on datasets of urban form and monthly energy consumption values of all zip codes in San Diego county. The surrogate models were then used as the simulation engine of a generative urban design tool, which generates hypothetical communities in San Diego following the county's existing urban typologies and then estimates the monthly energy consumption value of each generated design option. This paper and developed software prototype is part of a larger research project that evaluates the energy performance of community microgrids via their urban spatial configurations. This prototype takes the first step in introducing a new set of tools for architects and urban designers with the goal of engaging them in the development process of community microgrids.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The task of planning a path between two spatial configurations of an artifact moving among obstacles is an important problem in practically all geometrically intensive applications. Despite the ubiquity of the problem, the existing approaches make specific limiting assumptions about the geometry and mobility of the obstacles, or those of the environment in which the motion of the artifact takes place. We present a strategy to construct a family of paths, or roadmaps, for two- and three-dimensional solids moving in an evolving environment that can undergo drastic topological changes. Our approach is based on a potent paradigm for constructing geometric skeletons that relies on constructive representations of shapes with R-functions that operate on real-valued half-spaces as logic operations. We describe a family of skeletons that have the same homotopy as that of the environment and contains the medial axis as a special case. Of importance, our skeletons can be designed so that they are “attracted to” or “repulsed by” prescribed spatial sites of the environment. Moreover, the R-function formulation suggests the new concept of a medial zone, which can be thought of as a “thick” skeleton with significant applications for motion planning and other geometric reasoning applications. Our approach can handle problems in which the environment is not fully known a priori, and intrinsically supports local and parallel skeleton computations for domains with rigid or evolving boundaries. Furthermore, our path planning algorithm can be implemented in any commercial geometric kernel, and has attractive computational properties. The capability of the proposed technique are explored through several examples designed to simulate highly dynamic environments.",

Engineers are unique computer users with particular needs. They are familiar with fields such as applied mathematics, applied sciences, simulation, project management, technical drawing, and design, as well as engineering law and economics. The nature of the engineering design process means that engineers usually operate within changing environments. Uncertainty relating to incomplete information adds to the complexity of the process especially since the engineer is legally responsible for decisions.",

But if tolerance models for specifying acceptable variations have received a substantial attention, operations on toleranced objects have not been studied extensively. That is the reason why we address in this paper the computation of the union and the intersection of toleranced simple polygons, under a simple and already known tolerance model. First, we provide a practical and efficient algorithm that stores in an implicit data structure the information necessary to answer a request for specific values of the tolerances without performing a computation from scratch. If the polygons are of sizes m and n , and s is the number of intersections between edges occurring for all the combinations of tolerance values, the preprocessed data structure takes O ( s ) space and the algorithm that computes a union/intersection from it takes O (( n + m )log s + k ' + k log k ) time, where k is the number of vertices of the union/intersection and k ≤ k ' ≤ s . Although the algorithm is not output sensitive, we show that the expectations of k and k ' remain within a constant factor τ , a function of the input geometry. Second, we define and study the stability of union or intersection features. Third, we list interesting applications of the algorithms related to feasibility of assembly and assembly sequencing of real assemblies.",

To allow expression of uncertainty, we shall define fluents as disjuncts of positive/negative time-varying properties. A state of the world is represented as a collection of fluents, which is usually incomplete in the sense that neither the positive form nor the negative form of some properties can be implied from it. The world under consideration is assumed to persist in a given state until an action(s) takes place to effect a transition of it into another state, where actions may either be instantaneous or durative. High-level causal laws are characterized in terms of relationships between actions and the involved world states. An effect completion axiom is imposed on each causal law to guarantee that all the fluents that can be affected by the performance of the corresponding action are governed. This completion requirement is practical for most industrial real-time applications and in fact provides a simple and effective treatment to the so-called frame problem.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Case-based design (CBD) systems aim to solve a design problem by tailoring previously solved design problems to the current problem. Designers' specifications are used for indexing the knowledge base of the CBD system to retrieve an appropriate design case. Menu-based systems fail to capture designers' specifications effectively due to lack of expressiveness, while natural language systems are too immature to satisfy the goal. This paper presents the development of a graphical user interface (GUI) to implement a mechanical design specification language (MDSL) (Stelling, 1994) used to facilitate indexing in case-based mechanical design. The specification language is context-free and hence computable. It represents mechanical design knowledge in a (feature):(attribute) format suitable for indexing. An augmented transition network (ATN) parser is built using the grammar of the specification language. The parser provides syntactic as well as semantic checks. It also has capabilities to expand grammar and to adapt to a specific user domain. A graphical front end to the parser assists and guides the user through the specification language syntax in entering the design specifications. Provisions have been made to expand or edit the language grammar and vocabulary. The ATN parser was implemented in Common Lisp and the graphical user interface was written using the Gold Hill Windows Toolkit. Sample user interactions with the interface and screen dumps of the GUI are included.",

While temporal knowledge is central to the design of efficient and reliable process plans, little attention is given to the integration of process planning and temporal processing and reasoning. To fill the void, we propose in this paper a practical approach, which is inspired by the framework of Temporal Constraint Satisfaction Problem (TCSP), to integrate process planning and temporal reasoning. We show that a TCSP formulation is a subset of a formulation using a reified temporal logic, and discuss the advantages of using such a restricted model. To reflect more realistic process planning encountered in real manufacturing environments, we present a model, called n -TCSP, which is a generalization of the TCSP framework. We envision the proposed temporal reasoning framework as one of the modules in the evolving new intelligent computer-aided process planning.",

Although the design applications written about in the journal vary widely, the common thread is that researchers use AI techniques to implement their ideas. The use of AI techniques for design applications, at least when AI EDAM was started, was partially a reaction against the predominant design methods based on some form of optimization. Knowledge-based techniques, particularly rule-based systems of various sorts, were very popular. One of the draws of these methods, I believe, was their ability to represent knowledge that is hard or awkward to represent in traditional optimization frameworks. This mirrors my experience: at the time, I was working in configuration with components that had a large number compatibility and resource constraints. Although many constraints could be represented in mixed integer linear programming systems, it was not easy to conceptualize, write, and most importantly, maintain the constraints in those systems.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) emerged from the 1956 Dartmouth Conference. Twenty-one years later, my colleagues and I started daily operational use of what we think became the first application of AI to be used in practice: the PUFF pulmonary function system. We later described the design and initial performance of that system (Aikins et al., 1983; Snow et al., 1998). Today, easily recognizable descendants of that first “expert system” run on commercial products found in medical offices around the world ( http://www.medgraphics.com/datasheet_pconsult.html ), as do many other AI applications. My research now focuses on integrated concurrent engineering (ICE), a computer and AI-enabled multiparticipant engineering design method that is extremely rapid and effective (Garcia et al., 2004). This brief note compares the early PUFF, the current ICE work, and the modern AI view of neurobiological systems. This comparison shows the dramatic and surprising changes in AI methods in the past few decades and suggests research opportunities for the future. The comparison identifies the continuing crucial role of symbolic representation and reasoning and the dramatic generalization of the context in which those classical AI methods work. It suggests surprising parallels between animal neuroprocesses and the multihuman and multicomputer agent collaborative ICE environment. Finally, it identifies some of the findings and lessons of the intervening years, fundamentally the move to model-based multidiscipline, multimethod, multiagent systems in which AI methods are tightly integrated with theoretically founded engineering models and analytical methods implemented as multiagent human and computer systems that include databases, numeric algorithms, graphics, human–computer interaction, and networking.",

At the juncture of art, design, and computing, however, we recognize computing as becoming loaded with cultural meanings that are enacted through designed works, and designed works that reinterpret a range of assumptions about computing. Design and computing are intervening and lending each other ever-accruing layers of possibilities. The arena of design and computing is producing a new object of knowledge from which they effect: a mode of inquiry, a form of critique, a constitution of practices of subjectivities, and an articulation of objective and subjective investigations.

    "abstract": "Neural network (NN)-based constitutive models have been used increasingly to capture soil constitutive response. When combined with the self-learning simulation (SelfSim) inverse analysis framework, NN models can be used to extract soil behavior when given field measurements of boundary deformations and loads. However, the data sets used to train and repeatedly retrain the NN models are large, and training times, especially when used in SelfSim, are long. A diverse set of stress–strain data is extracted from a simulated braced excavation problem to train a NN-based constitutive model. Several methods for reducing the data set size are proposed and evaluated. Each of these methods selectively removes training data so that the smallest amount of data is used to train the NN. The Gaussian point method removes data based on its position in each finite element in the model. The lattice method removes data so that all remaining points are evenly spaced in stress space. Finally, the loading path method compares the stress–strain history of each Gaussian point and removes points with similar loading histories. Each of these methods shows that a large amount of the training data (up to 94%) can be removed without adversely affecting the performance of the NN model, with the loading path method showing the best and most consistent performance. Model training times are reduced by a factor of 20. The performance of the loading path method is also demonstrated using stress–strain data extracted from a simulated laboratory triaxial compression test with frictional ends.",

We start with a variety of technical and physical problems by showing how discrete modeling under uncertainties is technically meaningful and often even problem inherent. Then we select the technical problem of contaminant spread in water grids, to which we apply the method of risk-level propagation in depth. Extensions of the method such as modeling of contaminant mixing at junctions in the discretized phase space and the applicability of conservation laws arise naturally along these lines and are discussed in the context of the general theory.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Sensitivity analysis plays an important role in finding an optimal design of a structure under uncertainty. Quantifying relative importance of random parameters, which leads to a rank ordering, helps in developing a systematic and efficient way to reach the optimal design. In this work, lift prediction and sensitivity analysis of a potential flow around a submerged body is considered. Such flow is often used in the initial design stage of structures. The flow computation is carried out using a vortex-panel method. A few parameters of the submerged body and flow are considered as random variables. To improve the accuracy in lift prediction in a computationally efficient way, a new semi-intrusive stochastic perturbation method is proposed. Accordingly, a perturbation is applied at the linear system solving level involving the inuence coefficient matrix, as opposed to using perturbation in the lift quantity itself. This proposed method, which is partially analogous to the intrusive or Galerkin projection methods in spectral stochastic finite element methods, is found to be more accurate than using perturbation directly on the lift and faster than a direct simulation. The proposed semi-intrusive stochastic perturbation method is found to yield faster estimates of the Sobol’ indices, which are used for global sensitivity analysis. From global sensitivity analysis, the flow parameters are found to be more important than the parameters of the submerged body.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Predicting the onset of shear localization is among the most challenging problems in machining. This phenomenon affects the process outputs, such as machining forces, surface quality, and machined part tolerances. To predict this phenomenon, analytical, experimental, and numerical methods (especially finite element analysis) are widely used. However, the limitations of each method hinder their industrial applications, demanding a reliable and time-saving approach to predict shear localization onset. Additionally, since this phenomenon largely depends on the type and parameters of the constitutive material model, any change in these parameters requires a new set of simulations, which puts further restrictions on the application of finite element modeling. This study aims to overcome the computational efficiency of the finite element method to predict the onset of shear localization when machining Ti6Al4V using machine learning methods. The obtained results demonstrate that the FCM (fuzzy c-means) clustering ANFIS (adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system) has given better results in both training and testing when it is compared to the ANN (artificial neural network) architecture with an R 2 of 0.9981. Regarding this, the FCM-ANFIS is a good candidate to calculate the critical cutting speed. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study in the literature that uses a machine learning tool to predict shear localization.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Product data sharing is fundamental for collaborative product design and development. Although the STandard for Exchange of Product model data (STEP) enables this by providing a unified data definition and description, it lacks the ability to provide a more semantically enriched product data model. Many researchers suggest converting STEP models to ontology models and propose rules for mapping EXPRESS, the descriptive language of STEP, to Web Ontology Language (OWL). In most research, this mapping is a manual process which is time-consuming and prone to misunderstandings. To support this conversion, this research proposes an automatic method based on natural language processing techniques (NLP). The similarities of language elements in the reference manuals of EXPRESS and OWL have been analyzed in terms of three aspects: heading semantics, text semantics, and heading hierarchy. The paper focusses on translating between language elements, but the same approach has also been applied to the definition of the data models. Two forms of the semantic analysis with NLP are proposed: a Combination of Random Walks (RW) and Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe) for heading semantic similarity; and a Decoding-enhanced BERT with disentangled attention (DeBERTa) ensemble model for text semantic similarity. The evaluation shows the feasibility of the proposed method. The results not only cover most language elements mapped by current research, but also identify the mappings of the elements that have not been included. It also indicates the potential to identify the OWL segments for the EXPRESS declarations.",

Within the context of models of reasoning, the process of design is interpreted and analyzed with a goal of extracting the stages at which it can be consciously improved by mindful control. A language is proposed for team-oriented intra- or interdisciplinary collaborative, as well as individual design that facilitates communication, mutual understanding, and makes explicit alternative nonverbal, nonquantitative thinking processes that otherwise may remain latent. The role of motivation in innovation is briefly discussed, as well as the role of artifact valuation in a societal context. Although not central to the present discussion, computer models of design are presented as an instance of design practice captured for computer-based design support. A brief discussion highlights the application and implications of the proposed method to education and research.",

The problem is to first diagnose the machining operations to determine what fluid characteristics are required, then to select a cutting fluid which satisfies the required characteristics. The problem is exacerbated by the need to select a single fluid to be used by multiple types of operations on a variety of materials. Diagnosis is relatively simple, but treatment specification is difficult due to the variety of operations to be handled. GREASE uses heuristic search in which the evaluation function is heuristically constructed . The construction of the evaluation function begins with the determination of the characteristics of an optimal fluid based on deep knowledge of the machining operations and materials. This is then altered heuristically according to problems diagnosed with the current fluid. Once the evaluation function is complete, it is used to select an existing fluid from the product line. GREASE has been tested extensively with results which equal that of the experts and has been field tested by the Chevron Corporation.",

These patterns can be seen in their information gathering, their use of heuristics and their construction of mental models. This work is extremely knowledge intensive, experience appears to have a useful effect. In this paper we will discuss how we collected and analysed our data. Then we will present some of our observations about how the testers gathered information, used heuristics, formed mental models and were affected by their previous experience in the course of designing their test scenarios.

    "abstract": "Abstract The paper describes a novel means of performing calculus operations on poorly understood engineering functions using networks of radial Gaussian neurons. The network architecture and training algorithm used for this purpose is described briefly. Once trained, a network can be converted into a form that provides the differential or integral of the learned function, by a simple substitution of the type of activation function used at the hidden neurons. A range of substitute activation functions, for conversion to first- and second-order partial differential and integral forms of the network, are derived. Following this, the technique is tested on a selection of calculus operations for two example civil engineering problems: assessing motion in tall structures; and modeling moisture penetration in porous materials. The converted networks produced in these experiments provide accurate models of the actual differentials and integrals of the function the original networks had been taught. A method of improving the accuracy of results by training the original network beyond the region in which the converted networks operate, is described. The paper concludes by identifying some areas for further development of the technique.",

Some sample rules from the knowledge base have been included in the paper to illustrate the application of the domain knowledge and its interaction with algorithmic programs. The system architecture is very open and modular, and it lends itself to easy modifications and future expansions. Possibilities for system enhancements are also outlined in the paper. The approach presented in this paper provides substantial benefits to the automotive air-conditioning design engineer particularly in the early stages of new vehicle platform planning and development.

After diagnosis, the design objectives are clearly specified and the conventional engineering design process can begin. Different problem solving strategies, information representation, and processing are useful for the different phases of rehabilitation design. This paper describes the RETAIN knowledge-based rehabilitation design system which integrates a relational database, production rules and algorithmic functions. RETAIN diagnoses retaining wall failures and synthesizes preliminary rehabilitation designs and cost estimates. Its framework and methodology may be applied to other infrastructure components such as pavements, water and sewage networks, bridge piers and marine structures. RETAIN decomposes rehabilitation problems into influencing failure modes then identifies a set of rehabilitation strategies such that each strategy remedies one or more failure modes. Complete rehabilitation solutions are formed by searching and combining strategy components. Conceptual knowledge for design synthesis is organized in relational database tables. The paper includes an example of design synthesis with relational operations for selecting rehabilitation strategies and forming complete rehabilitation solutions.",

    "abstract": "Reasoning about relationships among design constraints can facilitate objective and effective decision making at various stages of engineering design. Exploiting dominance among constraints is one particularly strong approach to simplifying design problems and to focusing designers' attention on critical design issues. Three distinct approaches to constraint dominance identification have been reported in the literature. We lay down the basic principles of these approaches with simple examples, and we apply these methods to a practical linear electric actuator design problem. With the help of the design problem we demonstrate strategies to synergistically employ the dominance identification methods. Specifically, we present an approach that utilizes the transitive nature of the dominance relation. The identification of dominance provides insight into the design of linear actuators, which leads to effective decisions at the conceptual stage of the design. We show that the dominance determination methods can be synergistically employed with other constraint reasoning methods such as interval propagation methods and monotonicity analysis to achieve an optimal solution for a particular design configuration of the linear actuator. The dominance determination methods and strategies for their employment are amenable for automation and can be part of a suite of tools available to assist the designer in detailed as well as conceptual design.",

Design computing and cognition produces a unifying framework to model and explain design beyond the description of “design computing and cognition,” as in “design computing” and “design cognition” as two cognate disciplines. Research in design computing and cognition recognizes not only the essential relationship between human cognitive processes as models of computation but also how models of computation inspire conceptual realizations of human cognition in design. The articles in this Special Issue address the concomitant key areas of research in design computing and cognition: computational models of design, computational representations in design, computational design systems, and design cognition. The computationally inspired perspectives, metaphors, models, and theories that the papers deliver create a base for computing and cognition to (re)shape design practice and its role in design science and inquiry.",

    "abstract": "This issue of AI EDAM focuses on AI in equipment service. Recently there has been a strong and renewed emphasis on AI technologies that can be used to monitor products and processes, detect incipient failures, identify possible faults (in various stages of development), determine preventive or corrective action, and generate a cost-efficient repair plan and monitor its execution. This renewed emphasis stems from a focus of manufacturing companies on the service market where they hope to grow their market share by offering their customers novel and aggressive service contracts. This service market includes power generation equipment, aircraft engines, medical imaging systems, and locomotives, just to name a few. In some of these new service offerings, the old parts-and-labor billing model is replaced by guaranteed uptime. This in turn places the motivation to maintain equipment in working order on the servicing company. Monitoring can be more efficiently accomplished, in part, by employing remotely monitored systems. Big strides have been taken for in-use monitoring of stationary equipment, such as manufacturing plants or high-end appliances, and also mobile systems such as transportation systems (vehicles, aircraft, locomotives, etc.). While advances in hardware development make it possible to perform these tasks efficiently, there are new avenues for progress in accompanying AI software techniques. Some of these approaches have their roots in efforts of years past while others arise from new challenges. Characteristics of typical challenges for AI in monitoring and diagnosis (M&amp;D) service can be categorized into input, model, and output. In particular, input questions try",

A variation of the methodology for solving the Vehicle Routing Problem , known as the Savings Method , is applied to finding a sequence of controls to maximize the overall performance of multistage control processes. The Savings Method has been modified into a heuristic to traverse state precedence when transitioning from one known system state to another. In addition, the procedure allows for imposing of two different types of precedences (mandatory and optional) among transition states, as well as a pair of fuzzy constraints and goals throughout each stage of the process. As the control of the system progresses, fuzzy goals may be preset or introduced interactively.",

Topology supports design and representation of mechanical devices, communication and transportation networks, topographic maps, and planning and controlling of complex activities. In addition, aspects of topology are closely related to symbolic logic, which forms the foundation of artificial intelligence. By approaching engineering design from this abstract point of view, it is possible to use topological methods to study collections of geometric objects or collections of entities that are of concern in design analysis or synthesis. The importance of topological representation and reasoning in analysis, design, and manufacturing is heightened by the contemporary view that stresses the need for conceptual design.",

It provides a challenging, yet relatively unexplored, area of research for scientists and engineers from multiple disciplines. It is also an area of great interest to industry, with the refocusing of business models from increasing product performance to increasing corporate profitability while reducing expenditures. This paradigm shift has spawned multiple areas of research in Life-Cycle Design, as evidenced by the diversity in the topics of the papers submitted for this special issue of AI EDAM . We have collected five papers that present different areas of Life-Cycle Design; each provides a unique perspective on Life Cycle Design within the broad domain of Artificial Intelligence.",

    "abstract": "This issue of AIEDAM returns for the third time to the subject of evolutionary design. As in the previous two “mini” special issues (Volume 13, Numbers 3 and 5, 1999), this issue contains three papers focussing on the use of evolutionary algorithms to aid designers by automating part of the design process. These papers provide a showcase of the work of some of the original pioneers of this field as they demonstrate that their research is still at the forefront of developments in evolutionary design. As is fitting for this final special issue, the three papers all concentrate on what most designers recognize as the trickiest stage of the design process for computers: nonroutine, conceptual or innovative design.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Shapes are perceived unanalyzed, without rigid representation of their parts. They do not comply with standard symbolic knowledge representation criteria; they are treated and judged by appearance. Resolving the relationship of parts to parts and parts to wholes has a constructive role in perception and design. This paper presents a computational account of part–whole figuration in design. To this end, shape rules are used to show how a shape is seen, and shape decompositions having structures of topologies and Boolean algebras reveal alternative structures for parts. Four examples of shape computation are presented. Topologies demonstrate the relationships of wholes, parts, and subparts, in the computations enabling the comparison and relativization of structures, and lattice diagrams are used to present their order. Retrospectively, the topologies help to recall the generative history and establish computational continuity. When the parts are modified to recognize emergent squares locally, other emergent shapes are highlighted globally as the topology is re-adjusted. Two types of emergence are identified: local and global. Seeing the local parts modifies how we analyze the global whole, and thus, a local observation yields a global order.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Redesign is a widespread strategy for product improvement whose essence is the optimization of design parameters (DPs) considering the trade-off between customer satisfaction and cost concerns. Similar to the relation between customer requirements (CRs) and customer satisfaction, the sensitivity of customer satisfaction is diverse to different DPs. In this study, a sensitivity-enhanced customer satisfaction function is defined for redesign model construction. This fills the research gap in product redesign that lacking of consideration and quantification of customer satisfaction sensitivity. First, a sensitivity index is defined based on Kano indices for analyzing sensitivity of customer satisfaction in different DP categories. Second, traditional customer satisfaction function has been improved by injecting the sensitivity of customer satisfaction to the variations of DPs. Subsequently, a DP optimization model is established to maximize shared surplus between customers and enterprise. Finally, a case study involving the redesign of a braking system of automobile is implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed approach. The results show that the improved customer satisfaction function can reflect a more nuanced relationship between customer satisfaction and fulfilment level of DPs. Additionally, the proposed redesign model helps designers determine the target values of DPs under a better trade-off and enhances enterprise competitiveness.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new logical framework for vehicle route-sequence planning of passenger travel requests. Each request is a fetch-and-send service task associated with two request-locations, namely, a source and a destination. The proposed framework is developed using propositional linear time temporal logic of Manna and Pnueli. The novelty lies in the use of the formal language for both the specification and theorem-proving analysis of precedence constraints among the location visits that are inherent in route sequences. In the framework, legal route sequences—each of which visits every request location once and only once in the precedence order of fetch-and-send associated with every such request—is formalized and justified, forming a basis upon which the link between a basic precedence constraint and the corresponding canonical forbidden-state formula is formally established. Over a given base route plan, a simple procedure to generate a feasible subplan based on a specification of the forbidden-state canonical form is also given. An example demonstrates how temporal logic analysis and the proposed procedure can be applied to select a final (feasible) subplan based on additional precedence constraints.",

Clive put the journal on a very sound footing, and set the high standards that the journal continues to uphold. That it has maintained such a high reputation in the fields that it covers is due to Professor William Birmingham, the second Editor. My goal is to continue with the policies developed by these two prior Editors, while striving to raise the journal's standards, reputation, and visibility even further.",

The underlying logic is that of Allen, which we have extended to include quantitative temporal information. Intervals are still assumed as primitive entities while, to represent metric information, time points are introduced only at the algorithmic level. We illustrate the properties of the temporal representation, the algorithms used for constraint propagation, and their complexity. We show how the system can be used to schedule manufacturing operations in a small factory.",

Finally, evaluations of the human–computer co-operative system are also described.",

The traditional treatment of design as two discrete phases; problem formulation and solution synthesis, is challenged by recent research. Though the view on discrete phases may be applicable to simple and/or well-defined design tasks, current research (Jonas, 1993; Logan &amp; Smithers, 1993; Gero, 1994; Smithers et al., 1994) has shown that design is an ill-structured problem and the discrete phases view is not a good description of the process during which design alternatives are generated. A potential role of machine learning techniques is to provide a computational model of the changing representation of the design problem in response to the search for design solutions.",

The considered problem covers a class of expert systems and the application domain in which the operating personnel actively monitor and control the outcome of an industrial manufacturing process. Based on subjective ranking of the latent fault in the final output product, the operator queries the expert system for a recommended corrective action. Subsequent successful or unsuccessful corrective actions consistently modify confidence measures of all corrective recommendations from the same fault set, according to the embedded analytical model. The described approach is based on the relational data representation and procedural control structures, as opposed to a more traditional declarative, production-based system.",

It applies an evolutionary technique to the problem reformulation to improve the formulation.

The experimental part of the research shows that existing management systems can be used to attack a variety of problems. The authors conclude that flexible planning systems are quite beneficial since they can be used to solve a variety of design problems by making small modifications in the definition of their tools.",

Specifically, artificial intelligence concepts and Lisp programming techniques have been incorporated in this module to implement the following: (1) analysing and understanding design criteria supplied by human designers in the form of English sentences; and (2) transforming these design criteria into Lisp code and storing them in the knowledge base of DOMES. This knowledge engineer module enhances the capability and improves the performance of the expert system DOMES by providing an effective means for knowledge acquisition based on natural language understanding. The concepts and implementation techniques in developing this module are general and can also be utilized for other knowledge-based systems.",

Human experts perform the task in two phases, first qualitatively and then quantitatively in a hierarchical fashion. COWEN (Computer Wood ENgineer) is a fully implemented research prototype expert system that performs the qualitative phase and makes two contributions to the technology of expert systems. The first contribution is a Knowledge Level specification of the task prior to considering Symbol Level implementation. This is important because expert systems have been defined as mostly symbolic processors in the literature. The second contribution is that this Knowledge Level specification has led to the conclusion that additional qualitative sciences, besides physics and geometry, are needed for an engineering task. This is an interesting discovery because qualitative reasoning research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has approached engineering design from the viewpoints of physics and geometry only.",
