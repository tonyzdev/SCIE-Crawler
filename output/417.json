    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an inflammatory disease characterized by pruritic skin lesions. The pathogenesis of AD may include disrupted epidermal barrier function, immunodysregulation, and IgE-mediated sensitization to food and environmental allergens. AD is also part of a process called the atopic march, a progression from AD to allergic rhinitis and asthma. This has been supported by multiple cross-sectional and longitudinal studies and experimental data. Research on the mechanisms of AD has been centered on the adaptive immune system with an emphasis on the T-helper 1 (Th1)-Th2 paradigm. Recently, the conceptual focus has largely shifted to include a primary defect in the epithelial barrier as an initial event in AD providing a significant insight into the disease initiation and pointing to a complex secondary interplay of environmental and immunological sequelae with barrier disruption. Further understanding of AD will help the development of more effective treatment for AD and ultimately, preventative algorithms for the atopic march. In this review we highlight recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of AD and the atopic march.",

    "abstract": "The epidermis contains epithelial cells, immune cells, and microbes which provides a physical and functional barrier to the protection of human skin. It plays critical roles in preventing environmental allergen penetration into the human body and responsing to microbial pathogens. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common, complex chronic inflammatory skin disease. Skin barrier dysfunction is the initial step in the development of AD. Multiple factors, including immune dysregulation, filaggrin mutations, deficiency of antimicrobial peptides, and skin dysbiosis contribute to skin barrier defects. In the initial phase of AD, treatment with moisturizers improves skin barrier function and prevents the development of AD. With the progression of AD, effective topical and systemic therapies are needed to reduce immune pathway activation and general inflammation. Targeted microbiome therapy is also being developed to correct skin dysbiosis associated with AD. Improved identification and characterization of AD phenotypes and endotypes are required to optimize the precision medicine approach to AD.",

    "abstract": "Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a global health problem that causes major illnesses and disabilities worldwide. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that the prevalence of AR has increased progressively over the last few decades in more developed countries and currently affects up to 40% of the population worldwide. Likewise, a rising trend of AR has also been observed over the last 2-3 decades in developing countries including China, with the prevalence of AR varying widely in these countries. A survey of self-reported AR over a 6-year period in the general Chinese adult population reported that the standardized prevalence of adult AR increased from 11.1% in 2005 to 17.6% in 2011. An increasing number of Journal Articles and imporclinical trials on the epidemiology, pathophysiologic mechanisms, diagnosis, management and comorbidities of AR in Chinese subjects have been published in international peer-reviewed journals over the past 2 decades, and substantially added to our understanding of this disease as a global problem. Although guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of AR in Chinese subjects have also been published, they have not been translated into English and therefore not generally accessible for reference to non-Chinese speaking international medical communities. Moreover, methods for the diagnosis and treatment of AR in China have not been standardized entirely and some patients are still treated according to regional preferences. Thus, the present guidelines have been developed by the Chinese Society of Allergy to be accessible to both national and international medical communities involved in the management of AR patients. These guidelines have been prepared in line with existing international guidelines to provide evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of AR in China.",

    "abstract": "A body of evidence suggests that major changes involving the atmosphere and the climate, including global warming induced by anthropogenic factors, have impact on the biosphere and human environment.Studies on the effects of climate change on respiratory allergy are still lacking and current knowledge is provided by epidemiological and experimental studies on the relationship between allergic respiratory diseases, asthma and environmental factors, such as meteorological variables, airborne allergens, and air pollution.Urbanization with its high levels of vehicle emissions, and a westernized lifestyle are linked to the rising frequency of respiratory allergic diseases and bronchial asthma observed over recent decades in most industrialized countries.However, it is not easy to evaluate the impact of climate changes and air pollution on the prevalence of asthma in the general population and on the timing of asthma exacerbations, although the global rise in asthma prevalence and severity could also be an effect of air pollution and climate change.Since airborne allergens and air pollutants are frequently increased contemporaneously in the atmosphere, an enhanced IgE-mediated response to aeroallergens and enhanced airway inflammation could account for the increasing frequency of respiratory allergy and asthma in atopic subjects in the last 5 decades.Pollen allergy is frequently used to study the relationship between air pollution and respiratory allergic diseases, such as rhinitis and bronchial asthma.Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that urbanization, high levels of vehicle emissions, and westernized lifestyle are correlated with an increased frequency of respiratory allergy prevalently in people who live in urban areas in comparison with people living in rural areas.Climatic factors (temperature, wind speed, humidity, thunderstorms, etc.) can affect both components (biological and chemical) of this interaction.",

    "abstract": "Allergic reactions to fungi were described 300 years ago, but the importance of allergy to fungi has been underestimated for a long time. Allergens from fungi mainly cause respiratory and skin symptoms in sensitized patients. In this review, we will focus on fungi and fungal allergens involved in respiratory forms of allergy, such as allergic rhinitis and asthma. Fungi can act as indoor and outdoor respiratory allergen sources, and depending on climate conditions, the rates of sensitization in individuals attending allergy clinics range from 5% to 20%. Due to the poor quality of natural fungal allergen extracts, diagnosis of fungal allergy is hampered, and allergen-specific immunotherapy is rarely given. Several factors are responsible for the poor quality of natural fungal extracts, among which the influence of culture conditions on allergen contents. However, molecular cloning techniques have allowed us to isolate DNAs coding for fungal allergens and to produce a continuously growing panel of recombinant allergens for the diagnosis of fungal allergy. Moreover, technologies are now available for the preparation of recombinant and synthetic fungal allergen derivatives which can be used to develop safe vaccines for the treatment of fungal allergy.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus commonly colonizes the skin of atopic dermatitis (AD) patients and contributes to the development and exacerbation of AD. Multiple factors are associated with colonization of AD skin by S. aureus, including the strength of S. aureus-corneocyte adhesion, deficiency of antimicrobial peptides, decreased levels of filaggrin and filaggrin degradation products, overexpressed Th2/Th17 cytokines, microbial dysbiosis and altered lipid profiles. S. aureus colonization on AD skin causes skin barrier dysfunction through virulence factors such as superantigens (toxins), enzymes and other proteins. Furthermore, colonization of AD skin by S. aureus exacerbates AD and may contribute to microbial dysbiosis, allergen sensitization, Th2/Th17 polarization, development of atopic march and food allergy in AD patients. Skin colonization of S. aureus, particularly methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), is one of the major challenges commonly encountered in the management of AD. Bleach bath, and topical or systemic antibiotics could be used to control S. aureus infection on AD skin. However, careful use of antibiotics is required to control the occurence of MRSA. Recently, various strategies, including microbiome transplant, monoclonal antibodies against virulent toxins, vaccines and recombinant phage endolysin, have been studied to control S. aureus infection on AD skin. Further advances in our understanding of S. aureus could provide us with ways to manage S. aureus colonization more effectively in AD patients.",

    "abstract": "RHINITIS IS A GLOBAL PROBLEM AND IS DEFINED AS THE PRESENCE OF AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING: congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal itching, and nasal obstruction. The two major classifications are allergic and nonallergic rhinitis (NAR). Allergic rhinitis occurs when an allergen is the trigger for the nasal symptoms. NAR is when obstruction and rhinorrhea occurs in relation to nonallergic, noninfectious triggers such as change in the weather, exposure to caustic odors or cigarette smoke, barometric pressure differences, etc. There is a lack of concomitant allergic disease, determined by negative skin prick test for relevant allergens and/or negative allergen-specific antibody tests. Both are highly prevalent diseases that have a significant economic burden on society and negative impact on patient quality of life. Treatment of allergic rhinitis includes allergen avoidance, antihistamines (oral and intranasal), intranasal corticosteroids, intranasal cromones, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and immunotherapy. Occasional systemic corticosteroids and decongestants (oral and topical) are also used. NAR has 8 major subtypes which includes nonallergic rhinopathy (previously known as vasomotor rhinitis), nonallergic rhinitis with eosinophilia, atrophic rhinitis, senile rhinitis, gustatory rhinitis, drug-induced rhinitis, hormonal-induced rhinitis, and cerebral spinal fluid leak. The mainstay of treatment for NAR are intranasal corticosteroids. Topical antihistamines have also been found to be efficacious. Topical anticholinergics such as ipratropium bromide (0.03%) nasal spray are effective in treating rhinorrhea symptoms. Adjunct therapy includes decongestants and nasal saline. Investigational therapies in the treatment of NAR discussed include capsaicin, silver nitrate, and acupuncture.",

    "abstract": "AR have been well documented in many developed countries, there is comparatively little information available in developing countries. 19In this regard, the People's Republic of China is one of the largest countries in the world with a population of around 1.3 billion citizens and rapidly expanding industrialization.It is divided into 34 administrative divisions, including 23 provinces, 5 autonomous regions, 4 municipalities directly under the Central Government, and 2 Special Administrative Regions (Hong Kong and Macao).Moreover, it is traditionally divided into seven divisions, including North, Northeast, East, South, Northwest, Central and Southwest China, which cover an area of around 9.6 million square kilometers-approximately the size of Europe-and lies within several climate zones.The present article reviews the prevalence, incidence of comorbid allergic diseases, and trends and patterns of sensitizing allergens of AR in adults and children in China.The process of selecting articles to include in the present review was based on review of pre-existing published studies.A literature search was conducted in February 2013 for all relevant articles using PubMed.Cita-Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a serious systemic allergic disease, which together with comorbid asthma causes major illness and disability worldwide.Recent epidemiological studies have revealed wide variations in the increasing prevalence of AR and allergies globally, including in China.Despite a markedly higher population than western countries, and a landmass close to Europe in area, little epidemiological data is available on AR in China.Thus, the present study reviewed the prevalence, comorbid allergic diseases, trends and pattern of sensitizing allergens in adults and children suffering from AR in China.Available data indicated that despite variations in the prevalence of AR in different regions of the country, the prevalence of AR has increased in both adults and children over the last 2 decades.Similarly, there has been an increase in a \"western\"-type lifestyle, industrialization and air pollution over this period, which may have contributed to the increased prevalence of AR observed in China.",

Treatment options for AR consist of allergen avoidance, pharmacotherapy, immunotherapy and surgery. For the mechanisms of AR, anti-IgE antibody and specific antibody to cytokines such as IL-4 or IL-5 that correlate with allergic inflammation have recently emerged. SLIT is currently widely used due to its efficacy, safety and convenience, which replaces subcutaneous immunotherapy. Although allergen avoidance and immunotherapy are theoretically ideal, antihistamines and intranasal corticosteroids will play the main role in the management of AR until an innovative treatment develops. However, patients' main symptom, the duration and severity of AR, patients' compliance, safety of medication and cost-effectiveness should be considered when treatment options are chosen. In conclusion, physicians should be aware of etiology, pathophysiology, symptoms, signs and diseases related to AR in order to make a correct diagnosis and choose a proper treatment option for each patient.",

The parents completed an urticaria questionnaire that included questions regarding the duration, severity, and triggering factors of urticaria. Blood sampling (n=464) was performed to measure vitamin D, total eosinophil count (TEC), and total IgE levels, and skin prick tests (n=503) were done.The prevalences of the life-time, acute, and chronic urticaria were 22.5%, 13.9%, and 1.8% (chronic continuous urticaria, 0.7%; and chronic recurrent urticaria, 1.1%), respectively. Acute urticaria was significantly associated with allergic diseases and parental history of allergy (P<0.001), but chronic urticaria was not associated with these clinical factors. There was no significant difference in the 25-hydroxyvitamin D level between subjects with chronic urticaria and controls (P=0.124). Chronic continuous urticaria was associated with living in a new residence (aOR=2.38, 95% CI=1.02-5.54, P=0.044) and belonging to a family with a high income (aOR=4.24, 95% CI=1.24-14.56, P=0.022).A total of 1.8% of children were found to have chronic urticaria.

Apoptosis is the most common form of physiological cell death and a necessary process to maintain but limit cell numbers in humans and other species. It has been directly demonstrated that eosinophil apoptosis is delayed in allergic inflammatory sites, and that this mechanism contributes to the expansion of eosinophil numbers within tissues. Among the proteins known to influence hematopoiesis and survival, expression of the cytokine interleukin-5 appears to be uniquely important and specific for eosinophils. In contrast, eosinophil death can result from withdrawal of survival factors, but also by activation of pro-apoptotic pathways via death factors. Recent observations suggest a role for cell surface death receptors and mitochondria in facilitating eosinophil apoptosis, although the mechanisms that trigger each of these death pathways remain incompletely delineated. Ultimately, the control of eosinophil apoptosis may someday become another therapeutic strategy for treating allergic diseases and other eosinophil-associated disorders.",

    "abstract": "Eosinophils arise from hematopoietic CD34 + stem cells in the bone marrow.They acquire IL-5Rα on their surface at a very early stage during eosinophilopoiesis, and differentiate under the strong influence of interleukin (IL)-5.They then exit to the bloodstream, and enter the lung upon exposure to airway inflammatory signals, including eotaxins.In inflamed tissues, eosinophils act as key mediators of terminal effector functions and innate immunity and in linking to adaptive immune responses.Transcription factors GATA-1, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein, and PU.1 play instructive roles in eosinophil specification from multipotent stem cells through a network of cooperative and antagonistic interactions.Not surprisingly, the interplay of these transcription factors is instrumental in forming the regulatory circuit of expression of eosinophil-specific genes, encoding eosinophil major basic protein and neurotoxin, CC chemokine receptor 3 eotaxin receptor, and IL-5 receptor alpha.Interestingly, a common feature is that the critical cis-acting elements for these transcription factors are clustered in exon 1 and intron 1 of these genes rather than their promoters.Elucidation of the mechanism of eosinophil development and activation may lead to selective elimination of eosinophils in animals and human subjects.Furthermore, availability of a range of genetically modified mice lacking or overproducing eosinophil-specific genes will facilitate evaluation of the roles of eosinophils in the pathogenesis of asthma.This review summarizes eosinophil biology, focusing on development and regulation of eosinophil-specific genes, with a heavy emphasis on the causative link between eosinophils and pathological development of asthma using genetically modified mice as models of asthma.",

Confluent cultures were exposed to 50 or 100 μg/mL PM2.5 for up to 72 hours, and assessed for 1) epithelial barrier integrity as measured by transepithelial resistance (TER) and permeability of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) 4 kDa; 2) expression of TJs using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence staining, and 3) proinflammatory cytokines by luminometric bead array or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Compared to control medium, 50 and/or 100 μg/mL PM2.5-treatment 1) significantly decreased TER and increased FITC permeability, which could not be restored by budesonide pretreatment; 2) significantly decreased the expression of claudin-1 messenger RNA, claudin-1, occludin and ZO-1 protein; and 3) significantly increased production of the cytokines interleukin-8, TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin.Exposure to PM2.5 may lead to loss of barrier function in human nasal epithelium through decreased expression of TJ proteins and increased release of proinflammatory cytokines. These results suggest an important mechanism of susceptibility to rhinitis and rhinosinusitis in highly PM2.5-polluted areas.",

    "abstract": "Environmental variations induced by industrialization and climate change partially explain the increase in prevalence and severity of allergic disease.One possible mechanism is the increase in allergen production leading to more exposure and sensitization in susceptible individuals.House dust mites (HDMs) are important sources of allergens inducing asthma and rhinitis, and experimentally they have been demonstrated to be very sensitive to microenvironment modifications; therefore, global or regional changes in temperature, humidity, air pollution or other environmental conditions could modify natural HDM growth, survival and allergen production.There is evidence that sensitization to HDMs has increased in some regions of the world, especially in the subtropical and tropical areas; however, the relationship of this increase with environmental changes is not so clear as has reported for pollen allergens.In this review, we address this point and explore the effects of current and predicted environmental changes on HDM growth, survival and allergen production, which could lead to immunoglobulin E (IgE) sensitization and allergic disease prevalence.We also assess the role of adjuvants of IgE responses, such as air pollution and helminth infections, and discuss the genetic and epigenetic aspects that could influence the adaptive process of humans to drastic and relatively recent environmental changes we are experiencing.",

    "abstract": "Crustacean shellfish allergy is an important cause of food allergy and anaphylaxis in Asia. The major allergen in shellfish allergy is tropomyosin, a pan-allergen that is also found in house dust mites and cockroaches. Tropomyosins from house dust mites (HDMs) have a high sequence homology to shellfish tropomyosins, and cross-reactivity between HDM and shrimp tropomyosins has been demonstrated. Exposure to inhaled tropomyosins from house dust mites has been postulated to be the primary sensitizer for shellfish allergy, in a reaction analogous to the oral allergy (inhalant-food) syndrome. This notion is supported by indirect data from the effects of HDM immunotherapy on shellfish allergy, and strong correlations of shellfish and HDM sensitization. HDM immunotherapy has been reported to induce both shrimp allergy in non-allergic patients and shrimp tolerance in shrimp-allergic patients. Epidemiological surveys have also demonstrated a strong correlation between shellfish and HDM sensitization in both hospital-based and community-based studies. Unexposed populations have also been shown to develop sensitization-shellfish sensitization in orthodox Jews with no history of shellfish consumption was associated with HDM sensitization. Reciprocally, HDM sensitization in an Icelandic population living in a HDM-free environment was associated with shrimp sensitization. In vitro IgE inhibition studies on sera in shrimp-allergic Spanish patients indicate that mites are the primary sensitizer in shrimp-allergic patients living in humid and warm climates. Current data supports the hypothesis that tropomyosin is the link between HDM and shellfish allergies. The role of tropomyosin in HDM and shellfish allergies is a fertile field for investigation as it may provide novel immunotherapeutic strategies for shellfish allergy.",

Many studies have suggested the role of vitamin D deficiency in both T-helper1 and T-helper2 diseases; however, the association between vitamin D, allergy, and asthma remains uncertain. In this study, the associations of 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 levels with asthma and with the severity of asthma were evaluated.This cross-sectional study was conducted on 50 asthmatic children and 50 healthy controls aged 6-18 years. Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 levels were determined and compared between the two groups. The relationship between serum vitamin D levels and pulmonary function test outcomes and eosinophil counts were examined in asthmatic patients.Univariate analysis of the relationship between asthma and vitamin D showed that decreased vitamin D levels were associated with significantly increased odds of asthmatic state (P=0.002). In a multivariate analysis after adjustment for age, body mass index, and sex, the relationship between vitamin D and asthma increased. In asthmatic patients, 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels had direct and significant correlations with both predicted FEV1 (R(2)=0.318; P=0.024) and FEV1/FVC (R(2)=0.315; P=0.026). There were no associations between vitamin D level and eosinophil counts, duration of disease, and the number of hospitalization or unscheduled visits in the previous year (P>0.05).These results showed that serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were inversely associated with asthma, and there was a direct and significant relationship between vitamin D levels and pulmonary function test outcomes in asthmatic children. An interventional study in asthmatic patients with low serum vitamin D concentration may establish a causal relationship between asthma and vitamin D.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effects of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus (Lcr35) in a mouse model of asthma and to identify its mechanism of action. Lcr35 was administered daily by the oral route at a dosage of 1×10(9) CFU/mouse in BALB/c mice for 7 days before the first sensitization. Clinical parameters and regulatory T (Treg) cells were examined. The role of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Treg cells was analyzed using a Treg cell-depleting anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Airway hyperresponsiveness, total IgE production, pulmonary eosinophilic inflammation, and splenic lymphocyte proliferation were suppressed after Lcr35 treatment. Th1 (IFN-γ) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) cytokines in the serum were suppressed, and the percentage of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Treg cells in the spleen was significantly increased in the Lcr35 treatment group. Anti-CD25 mAb administration abolished the protective effects of Lcr35, indicating that CD4(+) CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Treg cells are essential in mediating the activity of Lcr35. Oral administration of Lcr35 attenuated the features of allergic asthma in a mouse model and induced immune regulation by a CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Treg cell-mediated mechanism.",

However, their efficacy in patients with more severe disease is limited, which led to the incorporation of poor response to ICSs (and thereby use of high doses of ICS) into recent definitions of severe asthma. Several studies have suggested that severe asthma might consist of several different phenotypes, each with ongoing symptoms and health care utilization, despite the use of high doses of ICS, usually in combination with a second or third controller. Several new therapies have been approved for severe asthma. Long-acting muscarinic agents have recently been approved as an additional controller agent and appear to improve lung function, although their effect on symptoms and exacerbations is less. Although bronchial thermoplasty (BT) has emerged as a therapy for severe asthma, little is understood regarding the appropriate selection of these patients. Considerable data have emerged to support the presence of a group of patients with severe asthma who have ongoing Type 2 inflammation. These patients appear to respond to targeted biologic approaches which are at the current time mostly investigational. In contrast, few effective therapies for patients with less or no evidence for Type 2 inflammation have emerged. Many new and exciting therapies are at the forefront for severe asthma therapy and, in conjunction with precision medicine approaches to identify the group of patients likely to respond to these approaches, will change the way we think about treating severe asthma.",

Diagnostic and therapeutic consequences in clinical practice are discussed. We describe that the airway mucosa has the intrinsic capability to produce IgE. Moreover, not only do IgE-positive B cells reside within the mucosa, but all tools are present locally for affinity maturation by somatic hypermutation (SHM), clonal expansion, and class switch recombination to IgE. Recognizing local IgE in the absence of systemic IgE has diagnostic and therapeutic consequences. Therefore, we emphasize the importance of local IgE in patients with a history of AR or CRSwNP.",

Recent findings point to a possible role of total IgE as a marker of CSU disease activity, endotypes, and responses to treatment. The evidence in support of total IgE included in the diagnostic workup of patients with CSU has not yet been reviewed.Publications were searched via PubMed. The search terms used were \"chronic urticaria\" and \"total IgE.\" Studies were screened by titles and abstracts, and 141 were used in the review.CSU patients frequently had elevated total IgE serum levels (up to 50%), but normal or very low total IgE levels also occurred. High total IgE may represent high disease activity, longer disease duration, high chance of responding to omalizumab treatment, quick relapse after stopping omalizumab, and lower chance of responding to cyclosporine. Low IgE, in contrast, may suggest Type IIb autoimmune CSU, poor response to treatment with omalizumab and a better chance to benefits from cyclosporine treatment. Furthermore, IgE in different CSU cohorts may have different physicochemical properties that could explain differences in treatment responses to IgE-directed therapies.The results of our review suggest that total IgE is a valuable marker for CSU, and we recommend its assessment in the routine diagnostic workup of CSU patients.",

In this retrospective multicenter study of CSU patients, we evaluated clinical and laboratory features of CSU associated with a higher risk of comorbid autoimmune diseases. Methods: We analyzed records of CSU patients (n = 1,199) for a history or presence of autoimmune diseases. Patients were diagnosed with type IIb autoimmune CSU (aiCSU) if all 3 tests were positive: autologous serum skin test (ASST), basophil histamine release assay (BHRA) and/or basophil activation test (BAT), and IgG autoantibodies against FcεRIα/IgE detected by immunoassay. Results: Twenty-eight percent of CSU patients had at least 1 autoimmune disease. The most prevalent autoimmune diseases were Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) (≥ 21%) and vitiligo (2%). Two percent of CSU patients had ≥ 2 autoimmune diseases, most frequently HT plus vitiligo. Comorbid autoimmune diseases, in patients with CSU, were associated with female sex, a family history of autoimmune diseases, and higher rates of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism (P < 0.001). Presence of autoimmune diseases was linked to aiCSU (P = 0.02). The risks of having autoimmune diseases were 1.7, 2.9 and 3.3 times higher for CSU patients with a positive ASST, BHRA and BAT, respectively. In CSU patients, markers for autoimmune diseases, antinuclear antibodies and/or IgG anti-thyroid antibodies were associated with non-response to omalizumab treatment (P = 0.013). Conclusions: In CSU, autoimmune diseases are common and linked to type IIb autoimmune CSU. Our results suggest that physicians assess and monitor all adult patients with CSU for signs and symptoms of common autoimmune diseases, especially HT and vitiligo.",

    "abstract": "In the era of novel coronavirus epidemics, vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been recognized as the most effective public health interventions to control the pandemic. An adverse event following immunization (AEFI) is defined as any untoward occurrence following immunization, and the majority of AEFIs are caused by protective immune responses stimulated by vaccines. Most of the reported AEFIs are not serious, and many are not immunologically mediated or even reproducible on re-exposure. However, uncommon severe allergic adverse reactions, such as anaphylaxis or other allergic reactions, can occur after vaccinations. Confirmed allergic reactions to vaccines may be caused by residual non-human protein, preservatives, or stabilizers in the vaccine formulation (also known as excipients). There are 2 main potential allergenic/immunogenic excipients in COVID-19 vaccines, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polysorbate 80. PEG, also known as macrogol, is an ingredient in various laxatives and injectable formulations, such as depot steroids. Polysorbate 80 is present in various medical products, creams, ointments, lotions, and medication tablets. Contraindications to the administration of COVID-19 vaccines include a previous history of severe allergic reactions to the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine or proven hypersensitivity to a vaccine component, such as PEG or polysorbate 80. Anaphylaxis or other allergic reactions following immunization can cause fear and loss of confidence in the safety of vaccines among the public. A better understanding of these events is thought to help alleviate concerns about the current COVID-19 vaccines and provide reassurance to the general population by analyzing the exact incidence of anaphylaxis and potential risk factors. COVID-19 vaccine-associated anaphylaxis could be prevented and managed by risk stratification based on our local and global experience.",

    "abstract": "In the last few decades, there has been a progressive increase in the prevalence of allergic rhinitis (AR) in China, where it now affects approximately 250 million people. AR prevention and treatment include allergen avoidance, pharmacotherapy, allergen immunotherapy (AIT), and patient education, among which AIT is the only curative intervention. AIT targets the disease etiology and may potentially modify the immune system as well as induce allergen-specific immune tolerance in patients with AR. In 2017, a team of experts from the Chinese Society of Allergy (CSA) and the Chinese Allergic Rhinitis Collaborative Research Group (C2AR2G) produced the first English version of Chinese AIT guidelines for AR. Since then, there has been considerable progress in basic research of and clinical practice for AIT, especially regarding the role of follicular regulatory T (TFR) cells in the pathogenesis of AR and the use of allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE) in nasal secretions for the diagnosis of AR. Additionally, potential biomarkers, including TFR cells, sIgG4, and sIgE, have been used to monitor the incidence and progression of AR. Moreover, there has been a novel understanding of AIT during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Hence, there was an urgent need to update the AIT guideline for AR by a team of experts from CSA and C2AR2G. This document aims to serve as professional reference material on AIT for AR treatment in China, thus improving the development of AIT across the world.",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder affecting both children and adults, characterized by pruritus, eczematous lesions, and compromised skin barrier function. A key feature of AD is dysbiosis of the skin microbiome, marked by reduced microbial diversity and the overgrowth of Staphylococcus aureus in lesional skin. S. aureus exacerbates skin barrier dysfunction and immune dysregulation, leading to recurrent infections and disease flares. In contrast, commensal bacteria such as Staphylococcus epidermidis and Roseomonas mucosa may exert protective effects by inhibiting S. aureus colonization and modulating immune responses. Beyond microbial composition, microbial metabolites play a crucial role in AD pathophysiology. Short-chain fatty acids, indole derivatives, and other bacterial metabolites influence cutaneous immune responses, lipid metabolism, and skin barrier integrity. Altered metabolite profiles, including reduced levels of beneficial microbial metabolites, are associated with AD severity and disease progression. Notably, S. aureus overabundance correlates with disruption in lipid metabolism, further compromising the skin barrier. This review explores recent advances in understanding the relationship between microbial metabolites and AD pathogenesis and examines the therapeutic potential of microbiome-targeted interventions. Strategies such as probiotics, prebiotics, and topical microbiome transplantation aim to restore microbial diversity and rebalance metabolite production, ultimately improving clinical outcomes in AD patients. Future therapeutic approaches focusing on commensal-derived metabolites offer promising avenues for alleviating symptoms and modulating disease severity in AD.",

    "abstract": "Chronic spontaneous urticaria is defined as persistent symptoms of urticaria for 6 weeks or more. It is associated with autoimmunity in approximately 45 percent of patients. Therapy is often difficult however the initial approach should employ high-dose non-sedating antihistamines; 4-6 tablets/day may be necessary. It has been shown that the response to 4 tablets/day exceeds 3, and exceeds 2, which exceeds 1. However the dose that corresponds to the maximal dose of first generation antihistamines (hydroxyzine, diphenhydramine) used previously, is 6/day. Yet over half the patients are refractory to antihistamines and other agents should be tried next. Whereas current guidelines (published) often add leukotriene antagonists and/or H(2) receptor antogonists next, these are of little utility. Likewise drugs effective for urticarial vasculitis (colchicine, dapsone, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine) are effective in a small percentage of patients and no study suggests that the response rate of any of them exceeds the 30% placebo responses seen in most double-blind, placebo controlled studies. The drugs that are effective for antihistamine-resistant chronic spontaneous urticaria are corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and Omalizumab. Use of steroids is limited by toxicity. If used at all, a dose of no more than 10 mg/day should be employed with a weekly reduction of 1 mg. The response rates to cyclosporine and Omalizumab are each close to 75%. Cyclosporine can be used effectively if care is taken to monitor blood pressure, urine protein, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine, every 6 weeks. Omalizumab has the best profile in terms of efficacy/toxicity and, once approved by federal agencies for use in chronic spontaneous urticaria, a dramatic change in the treatment paradigm, whether associated with autoimmunity or not, is predicted. A phase 3 trial is currently in place. Refractoriness to both Omalizumab and cyclosporine is expected to be less than 5 percent of patients. Other agents, can then be tried.",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a complex disease that affects up to 20% of children and impacts the quality of patients and families in a significant manner. New insights into the pathophysiology of AD point to an important role of structural abnormalities in the epidermis combined with immune dysregulation. Filaggrin (FLG) is synthesized as a large precursor, profilaggrin, and is expressed in the upper layers of the epidermis. FLG plays a critical role in the epidermal barrier, and FLG mutations cause abnormal epidermal function. FLG mutations are strongly associated with early-onset, and persistent severe AD. In addition, FLG deficiency in the epidermis is related to allergic sensitization and asthma. The basic skin care including repair and protection of the skin barrier with proper hydration and topical anti-inflammatory therapy is important to control the severity of skin disease in patients with AD.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to critically review the available evidence pertaining to occupational, environmental, and individual factors that can affect the development of occupational asthma (OA). Increasing evidence suggests that exploration of the intrinsic characteristics of OA-causing agents and associated structure-activity relationships offers promising avenues for quantifying the sensitizing potential of agents that are introduced in the workplace. The intensity of exposure to sensitizing agents has been identified as the most important environmental risk factor for OA and should remain the cornerstone for primary prevention strategies. The role of other environmental co-factors (e.g., non-respiratory routes of exposure and concomitant exposure to cigarette smoke and other pollutants) remains to be further delineated. There is convincing evidence that atopy is an important individual risk factor for OA induced by high-molecular-weight agents. There is some evidence that genetic factors, such as leukocyte antigen class II alleles, are associated with an increased risk of OA; however, the role of genetic susceptibility factors is likely to be obscured by complex gene-environment interactions. OA, as well as asthma in general, is a complex disease that results from multiple interactions between environmental factors and host susceptibilities. Determining these interactions is a crucial step towards implementing optimal prevention policies.",

Previous studies have shown elevated levels of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in atopic diseases like asthma, atopic dermatitis and mainly in animal models of allergic rhinitis (AR). Here, we investigated the expression of TSLP in nasal polyps from atopics and non-atopics in comparison with the nasal mucosa and its potential role in nasal polyposis.Messenger RNA expression for TSLP, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) and macrophage derived chemokine (MDC) in nasal polyps and nasal mucosa of atopics and non-atopics was analyzed by real time PCR. Immunoreactivity for TSLP in nasal polyps and in the nasal mucosa of patients with AR and non-allergic rhinitis (NAR) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Eosinophil counts was analyzed by Wright-Giemsa staining and nasal polyp tissue IgE, by ELISA.Messenger RNA expression for TSLP,TARC and MDC was markedly higher in nasal polyps as compared to the allergic nasal mucosa. Immunoreactivity for TSLP was detected in epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and inflammatory cells of the nasal mucosa and nasal polyps. The number of TSLP+ cells was significantly greater in the nasal mucosa of AR than NAR patients. The number of TSLP+ cells in nasal polyps from atopics was significantly greater than that of non-atopics and that in the allergic nasal mucosa. The number of TSLP+ cells correlated well with the number of eosinophils and the levels of IgE in nasal polyps.The high expression of TSLP in nasal polyps and its strong correlation to eosinophils and IgE suggest a potential role for TSLP in the pathogenesis of nasal polyps by regulating the Th2 type and eosinophilic inflammation.",

FEV1% predicted was inversely associated with IL-6 level, and cardiovascular disease was associated with an increased IL-6 level. Systemic markers were not associated with airway inflammation.Systemic inflammation is commonly present in asthma-COPD overlap syndrome, and asthma-COPD overlap syndrome resembled COPD in terms of systemic inflammation.

Unlike IL-1β and IL-18, IL-33 is suggested to function as an alarmin that is released upon endothelial or epithelial cell damage and may not enhance acquired immune responses through activation of inflammasome. ST2, a IL-33 receptor component, is preferentially expressed by T-helper type (Th) 2 cells, mast cells, eosinophils and basophils, compared to Th1 cells, Th17 cells and neutrophils. Thus, IL-33 profoundly enhances allergic inflammation through increased expression of proallergic cytokines and chemokines. Indeed, IL-33 and its receptor genes are recognized as the most susceptible genes for asthma by several recent genomewide association studies. It has also recently been shown that IL-33 plays a crucial role in innate eosinophilic airway inflammation rather than acquired immune responses such as IgE production. As such, IL-33 provides a unique therapeutic way for asthma, i.e., ameliorating innate airway inflammation.",

Exosomes or extracellular vesicles are nanosized vesicles of endosomal origin released from inflammatory and epithelial cells that have been implicated in allergic diseases. In this study, we characterized the microRNA (miRNA) content of exosomes in AR.Extracellular vesicles were isolated from nasal mucus from healthy control subjects (n=10) and patients with severe AR (n=10). Vesicle RNA was analyzed by using a TaqMan microRNA assays Human Panel-Early Access kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) containing probes for 366 human miRNAs, and selected findings were validated with quantitative RT-PCR. Target prediction and pathway analysis for the differentially expressed miRNAs were performed using DIANA-mirPath.Twenty-one vesicle miRNAs were up-regulated and 14 miRNAs were under-regulated significantly (P<0.05) in nasal mucus from AR patients when compared to healthy controls. Bioinformatic analysis by DIANA-mirPath demonstrated that 32 KEGG biological processes were significantly enriched (P<0.05, FDR corrected) among differentially expressed vesicle miRNA signatures. Among them, the B-cell receptor signaling pathway (P=3.709E-09), the natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity (P=8.466E-05), the T-cell receptor signaling pathway (P=0.00075), the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway (P=0.00127), the Wnt signaling pathway (P=0.00130), endocytosis (P=0.00440), and salivary secretion (P=0.04660) were the most prominent pathways enriched in quantiles with differential vesicle miRNA patterns. Furthermore, miR-30-5p, miR-199b-3p, miR-874, miR-28-3p, miR-203, and miR-875-5p, involved in B-cell receptor and salivary secretion signaling pathways, were selected for validation using independent samples from 44 AR patients and 20 healthy controls. MiR-30-5p and miR-199b-3p were significantly increased in extracellular vesicles from nasal mucus when compared to healthy controls, while miR-874 and miR-28-3p were significantly down-regulated. In addition, miRNA-203 was significantly increased in AR patients, while miRNA-875-5p was found to be significantly decreased in AR patients.This study demonstrated that vesicle miRNA may be a regulator for the development of AR.",

    "abstract": "B cells are generally considered to positively regulate immune responses by producing antigen-specific antibodies. B cells are classified into classical CD5(-) conventional B cells and CD5(+) B1 cells. The latter produce multi-specific autoantibodies and are thought to be involved in autoimmune diseases. However, evidence supporting a B cell negative regulatory function has accumulated over the past 30 years. Multiple reports have suggested that absence, or loss, of regulatory B cells exacerbates symptoms of both allergic (including contact hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis) and autoimmune (such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, chronic colitis, and collagen-induced arthritis) diseases, and in lupus-like models of autoimmunity. Regulatory B cells are characterized by production of the negative regulatory cytokines, IL-10 and TGF-β. IL-10-producing B cells were the first regulatory B cells to be recognized and were termed 'B10' cells. IL-10-producing regulatory B cells are of the CD19(+)CD5(+)IgM(hi)IgD(lo)CD1d(hi) type. Recently, a TGF-β-producing regulatory B cell subset, Br3, has been shown to be related to immune tolerance in food allergies. Moreover, forkhead box P3 (Foxp3)-expressing B cells have also been identified in humans and may act as regulatory B cells (Bregs). The functional image of regulatory B cells is similar to that of regulatory T cells. Because of the proliferative and apoptotic responses of Br1 and Br3 cells in immune tolerance in non-IgE-mediated food allergy, reciprocal roles and counter-regulatory mechanisms of Br1 and Br3 responses are also suspected. Additionally, different roles for regulatory B and T cells at different time points during initiation and progression of autoimmune disease are described.",

    "abstract": "Periostin acts both as an extracellular matrix protein belonging to the fasciclin family and as a matricellular protein functioning in cell activation by binding to its receptors on the cell surface. It has been established that periostin is a downstream molecule of interleukin (IL)-13, a signature type 2 cytokine, and that periostin plays an important role in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases, including asthma. Based on these findings, much attention has been paid to periostin as a biomarker useful in the treatment of asthma. Periostin is a surrogate biomarker for type 2 immunity; it has been shown that serum periostin can predict the efficacy of anti-IL-13 antibodies (lebrikizumab) and anti-IgE antibodies (omalizumab), and that this usefulness can be potentially expanded to other type 2 antagonists. Moreover, it has been shown that periostin is not a simple surrogate biomarker for type 2 immunity; periostin-high asthma patients have several unique characteristics, including eosinophilia, high fraction of nitric oxide, aspirin intolerance, nasal disorders, and late onset. These characteristics are likely to be correlated with the involvement of periostin in the tissue remodeling of asthma. Periostin is also associated with hyporesponsiveness to inhaled corticosteroids, probably reflecting tissue remodeling. Thus, periostin has 2 characteristics as a biomarker for early diagnosis of asthma: surrogate biomarkers for type 2 immunity and tissue remodeling. Based on these characteristics, we will be able to apply serum periostin to treatment of asthma.",

    "abstract": "Grain-induced asthma is a frequent occupational allergic disease mainly caused by inhalation of cereal flour or powder.The main professions affected are bakers, confectioners, pastry factory workers, millers, farmers, and cereal handlers.This disorder is usually due to an IgE-mediated allergic response to inhalation of cereal flour proteins.The major causative allergens of grain-related asthma are proteins derived from wheat, rye and barley flour, although baking additives, such as fungal α-amylase are also important.This review deals with the current diagnosis and treatment of grain-induced asthma, emphasizing the role of cereal allergens as molecular tools to enhance diagnosis and management of this disorder.Asthma-like symptoms caused by endotoxin exposure among grain workers are beyond the scope of this review.Progress is being made in the characterization of grain and bakery allergens, particularly cereal-derived allergens, as well as in the standardization of allergy tests.Salt-soluble proteins (albumins plus globulins), particularly members of the α-amylase/trypsin inhibitor family, thioredoxins, peroxidase, lipid transfer protein and other soluble enzymes show the strongest IgE reactivities in wheat flour.In addition, prolamins (not extractable by salt solutions) have also been claimed as potential allergens.However, the large variability of IgE-binding patterns of cereal proteins among patients with grain-induced asthma, together with the great differences in the concentrations of potential allergens observed in commercial cereal extracts used for diagnosis, highlight the necessity to standardize and improve the diagnostic tools.Removal from exposure to the offending agents is the cornerstone of the management of grain-induced asthma.The availability of purified allergens should be very helpful for a more refined diagnosis, and new immunomodulatory treatments, including allergen immunotherapy and biological drugs, should aid in the management of patients with this disorder.",

    "abstract": "Hypersensitivity to house dust mite (HDM; Dermatophagoides sp.) allergens is one of the most common allergic responses, affecting up to 85% of asthmatics. Sensitization to indoor allergens is the strongest independent risk factor associated with asthma. Additionally, >50% of children and adolescents with asthma are sensitized to HDM. Although allergen-specific CD4(+) Th2 cells orchestrate the HDM allergic response through induction of IgE directed toward mite allergens, activation of innate immunity also plays a critical role in HDM-induced allergic inflammation. This review highlights the HDM components that lead to activation of the innate immune response. Activation may due to HDM proteases. Proteases may be recognized by protease-activation receptors (PARs), Toll-like receptors (TLRs), or C-type lectin receptors (CTRs), or act as a molecular mimic for PAMP activation signaling pathways. Understanding the role of mite allergen-induced innate immunity will facilitate the development of therapeutic strategies that exploit innate immunity receptors and associated signaling pathways for the treatment of allergic asthma.",

Five-hundred and seventy-five preschoolers with valid data were included in this study.The prevalence of lifetime diagnosis and treatment in the past 12 months was 8.7% and 4.4% for asthma, 24.4% and 19.2% for AR, and 35.1% and 16.6% for AD, respectively. Scores for internalizing and sleep problems were significantly higher in those diagnosed with AR. Preschoolers who had been treated for AD in the past 12 months had higher attention problem and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder scores. Sleep problems were more severe in moderate to severe AD compared to control and mild AD groups, categorised according to SCOring index of AD. The severity of sleep problems correlated positively with the percentage of eosinophils in peripheral blood.Psychological and behavioural problems differed among the three major allergic diseases, weaker association for asthma and stronger association for AR and AD. The results of this study may lead to the identification of potential underlying shared mechanisms common to allergic diseases and psychological and behavioural problems.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic airway disease characterized by airway remodeling, leading to a progressive decline in lung function. Therapeutic agents that attenuate airway remodeling can complement the limited effects of traditional glucocorticoids. In this study, we investigated the effect of resveratrol on allergic airway inflammation and remodeling in a murine model of chronic bronchial asthma.Peribronchial smooth muscle thickening that developed in mice challenged with a 3-month repeated exposure to ovalbumin (OVA) was used to study airway remodeling. Oral resveratrol was administered daily during the OVA challenge. The expression of TGF-β1/Smad signaling proteins and downstream mesenchymal markers in the presence or absence of resveratrol was examined in bronchial epithelial cells.OVA sensitization and chronic challenge increased airway hyperresponsiveness, inflammation, goblet cell hyperplasia, α-smooth muscle actin (SMA), and collagen deposition. Resveratrol effectively suppressed OVA-induced airway inflammation and remodeling. The expression of TGF-β1/phosphorylated Smad2/3 was increased in the lung tissues of OVA-challenged mice but effectively inhibited by resveratrol. In bronchial epithelial cells, the TGF-β1-induced expression of the mesenchymal markers snail, slug, vimentin, and α-SMA was suppressed by resveratrol treatment.Resveratrol effectively ameliorated both airway inflammation and airway structural changes in a mouse model of bronchial asthma. These effects were mediated by decreased TGF-β1 expression, in turn suppressing TGF-β1/Smad signaling and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process. Our results demonstrate the potential benefits of resveratrol for the treatment of airway remodeling associated with bronchial asthma.",

    "abstract": "Determining the culprit allergen is important for the diagnosis and management of allergic diseases. The skin prick test (SPT) has been widely used to identify culprit allergens. Skin reactivity to allergens has changed due to changes in lifestyle and outdoor environments. Therefore, the aim of the present paper was to examine changes in allergen sensitization in Korea. We enrolled 1,135 patients with respiratory allergic diseases who were diagnosed at Severance Hospital from January 2010 to December 2011. SPTs were performed with inhalant allergens, and were compared to our previous studies of the SPTs in the 1980s and the 1990s. In the 2010s, the SPT positive rate of allergic rhinitis or allergic conjunctivitis was higher than asthma without allergic rhinitis or allergic conjunctivitis. The SPT positive rate was decreased by increments of age (P value <0.01). Skin reactivity to tree pollens was significantly increased to 36.4% in the 2010s from 19.0% in the 1990s and 8.8% in the 1980s. Among tree pollens, skin reactivity to oak (4.7%->14.4%), birch (7.1%->13.6%), alder (6.3%->13.4%) and pine (2.9%->14.3%) was significantly increased in the 2010s compared with the 1990s, respectively. Current skin reactivity to grass pollens (13.9%) and weed pollens (27.0%) has significantly decreased since the 1990s (20.3%, 40.9%, respectively). Skin reactivity to house dust mites showed no difference between the 1990s (55.2%) and the 2010s (55.6%). Skin reactivity to dog (27.3%->20.7%) and cockroach (25.3%->12.3%) have significantly decreased in the 2010s in comparison with the 1990s. In light of the above results, we revealed the changes in skin reactivity to inhalant allergens that have occurred in Korean allergic patients over the past three decades. Since outdoor environmental factors such as the amount of pollen, global warming and plant distribution causes the changes in skin reactivity, further study and continuous close observation will be needed.",

    "abstract": "Aging is accompanied by a progressive decline in almost all functions of the immune system. To investigate a possible impact of age on IgE production, this study evaluated total and allergen-specific serum IgE levels in a large cohort of allergic patients. This study included 6,370 allergic patients (2,961 females, 3,409 males; mean age, 21.7 years; age range, 0-96 years). Total and allergen-specific serum IgE levels were measured by immunoenzymatic assay. The analysis of variance showed a significant difference (P<0.0001) in the mean value of total IgE among the different age groups of patients. Moreover, specific IgE levels for all allergens examined differed significantly among the age groups of patients (P<0.0001), with a specific trend pattern for each allergen. Total IgE increased with age, but allergen-specific IgE levels significantly decreased with age, with a trend specific for each allergen tested.",

    "abstract": "Calprotectin is a cytosolic protein with immunomodulatory, antimicrobial, and antiproliferative actions. The concentration of calprotectin increases in infection, inflammation, and malignancy. We determined if calprotectin can be used as a marker for the diagnosis and follow-up of bowel inflammation in cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA).In total, 32 patients newly diagnosed with CMPA were included (24 IgE-mediated, 8 non-IgE-mediated). In all subjects, a complete blood count, total IgE, cow's milk-specific IgE, and fecal calprotectin (FC) were assessed before and after a cow's milk protein (CMP) elimination diet was started. The results were compared with those of 39 healthy children.The mean FC value before the CMP elimination diet was 516±311 µg/g in the 32 patients with CMPA and 296±94 µg/g in the control group (P=0.011). The mean FC value after the diet in these patients was 254±169 µg/g, which was significantly different from the mean value before the CMP elimination diet (P<0.001). When we compared FC levels before the CMP elimination diet in the IgE-mediated group with the control group, we found no significant statistical difference (P=0.142). The mean FC value before the CMP elimination diet was 886±278 µg/g in the non-IgE-mediated group and 296±94 µg/g in the control group; this difference was statistically significant (P<0.001). In the IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated groups, FC values after CMP elimination diet were 218±90 µg/g and 359±288 µg/g, respectively, and FC values before CMP elimination diet were 392±209 µg/g and 886±278 µg/g, respectively; these differences were statistically significant (P=0.001 and P=0.025, respectively).FC levels may be a useful marker for follow-up treatment and recurrence determination in CMPA.",

    "abstract": "Omalizumab is frequently used as add-on treatment to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting β2-agonists in patients with suboptimal control of severe asthma. Patients with severe asthma will typically require chronic treatment, although due to the limited amount of data available there are still some concerns about the safety and efficacy of long-term therapy with omalizumab. Herein, in an extension of a previous 4-year study, we report disease-related outcomes of 8 patients with severe persistent allergic asthma who have been followed for a total of 9 years in a real-life setting. Both quality of life (QoL) (evaluated using the Juniper Asthma-Related QoL Questionnaire [AQLQ]) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) showed sustained improvement at 9 years. The median values of AQLQ and FEV1 at 4 years were 5.5 and 82.0% compared to 5.9 and 85.5%, respectively, at 9 years, which were all significantly increased from baseline. After 9 years, the mean annual number of severe exacerbations was 0.63 compared to 5 at baseline. There also appeared to be a trend toward use of a lower dose of ICS at longer follow-up times. After 9 years, there were no safety concerns for continued use of omalizumab, and no asthma-related hospitalizations or emergency department visits were documented over the last 5 years. The present analysis is the longest reported clinical follow-up of omalizumab. Long-term maintenance treatment with omalizumab for up to 9 years is associated with continued benefits in reducing symptoms, exacerbations, and medication burden without any safety concerns.",

Investigations on the role of intestinal immune system in preventing hypersensitivity reactions to innocuous dietary and microbial antigens have been intensively performed during the last 2 decades. In this review article, we discuss how food allergens are recognized by the intestinal immune system and draw attention to the role of regulatory T (Treg) and B (Breg) cells in the establishment of oral tolerance and tolerogenic features of intestinal dendritic cells. We also emphasize the potential role of tonsils in oral tolerance induction because of their anatomical location, cellular composition, and possible usage to develop novel ways of specific immunotherapy for the treatment of allergic diseases.",

Parents were asked to complete a questionnaire on the detailed history of immediate-type FA. A total of 32,001 (64.0%) responded to the questionnaire survey, and 29,842 children (59.7%) were analyzed after adjusting for missing data. The number of the cases in each age group was 9,671 (6-7 years), 9,756 (9-10 years), 5,169 (12-13 years), and 5,246 (15-16 years). The prevalence of lifetime perceived FA was 15.82%. The prevalence of current immediate-type FA was 4.06% in total, with 3.15% in 6- to 7-year-olds, 4.51% in 9- to 10-year-olds, 4.01% in 12- to 13-year-olds, and 4.49% in 15- to 16-year-olds.

    "abstract": "Endotype in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has been established in the last decade. However, the exact immunologic profile of CRS still has controversy because it has a considerable immunologic heterogeneity. Therefore, we investigated various inflammatory mediators according to different nasal tissues in chronic rhinosinusitis and compared them within the same subject.We collected uncinate process mucosa (UP) and nasal polyp (NP) tissues from controls, CRS without NP (CRSsNP) and CRS with NP (CRSwNP). Expression levels of 28 inflammatory mediators including T helper (Th) 1, Th2, Th17, proinflammatory cytokines and remodeling markers were determined by multiplex immunoassay and were analyzed using paired tests as well as principal component analysis (PCA) to investigate endotype in each subtype of CRS.Signature inflammatory mediators are interleukin (IL)-5, C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL)-24, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-4, and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 in eosinophilic NP, whereas IL-17A, IL-1β, and matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)-9 were detected as signature inflammatory markers in non-eosinophilic NP. Despite differences in inflammatory cytokine profile between eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic NP, the common upregulation of IL-5, CCL-11, IL-23, IL-2Rα, VCAM-1, MMP-3 and MMP-9 were shown in NP compared to UP within the same subject. In the PCA, we observed that Th2 immune response was helpful in discriminating between nasal tissues in subtypes of CRS and that there was a partial overlap between non-eosinophilic NP and eosinophilic NP in terms of Th2 mediators.Commonly upregulated mediators in NP were Th2-associated, compared with UP regardless of CRS subtypes, whereas signature markers were distinct in each NP subtype. These findings imply that Th2 inflammatory responses may play a role in the development of NP regardless of CRSwNP subtypes.",

This study evaluated the cough-related symptom profile and the clinical relevance and impact of cough hypersensitivity in adults with chronic cough.This cross-sectional multi-center study compared cough-related laryngeal sensations and cough triggers in patients with unexplained chronic cough following investigations and in unselected patients newly referred for chronic cough. A structured questionnaire was used to assess abnormal laryngeal sensations and cough triggers. Patients with unexplained cough were also evaluated using the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) and a cough visual analogue scale (VAS), and these scores were assessed for correlations with the number of triggers and laryngeal sensations.This study recruited 478 patients, including 62 with unexplained chronic cough and 416 with chronic cough. Most participants reported abnormal laryngeal sensations and cough triggers. Laryngeal sensations (4.4 ± 1.5 vs. 3.9 ± 1.9; P = 0.049) and cough triggers (6.9 ± 2.6 vs. 5.0 ± 2.8; P < 0.001) were more frequent in patients with unexplained chronic cough than in those with chronic cough. The number of triggers and laryngeal sensations score significantly correlated with LCQ (r = -0.51, P < 0.001) and cough VAS score (r = 0.53, P < 0.001) in patients with unexplained chronic cough.Cough hypersensitivity may be a common feature in adult patients with chronic cough, especially those with unexplained chronic cough. Cough-related health status and cough severity were inversely associated with the number of triggers and laryngeal sensations, suggesting potential relevance of assessing cough hypersensitivity in chronic cough patients.",

We hypothesized that serum eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) could predict the eosinophilic inflammation of SA in adult asthmatics.Severe asthmatics (n = 235), nonsevere asthmatics (n = 898), and healthy controls (n = 125) were enrolled from Ajou University Hospital, South Korea. The serum levels of EDN and periostin were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and compared between severe and nonsevere asthmatics. Their associations with total eosinophil count (TEC) and clinical parameters were evaluated; clinical validation of the K-EDN kit for the measurement of serum EDN was evaluated.Severe asthmatics were older and had longer disease duration with significantly lower levels of forced expiratory volume in 1 second and methacholine PC20 than nonsevere asthmatics. Significant differences were found in TEC or sputum eosinophil count (%) between the groups. The serum levels of EDN and periostin were significantly higher in severe asthmatics than in nonsevere asthmatics and in healthy controls (all P < 0.05). Although significant correlations were found between serum EDN levels measured by the 2 kits (ρ = 0.545, P < 0.0001), higher correlation coefficients between serum EDN levels measured by the K-EDN kit and TEC were higher (ρ = 0.358, P < 0.0001) than those between serum EDN levels measured by the MBL kit and TEC (ρ = 0.319, P < 0.0001) or serum periostin level (ρ = 0.222, P < 0.0001). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that serum EDN levels measured by the K-EDN kit predicted the phenotype of SA (P = 0.003), while 2 other biomarkers did not.The serum EDN level may be a useful biomarker for assessing asthma severity in adult asthmatics.",

    "abstract": "Arachidonic acid 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15) is an enzyme that can oxidize polyunsaturated fatty acids. ALOX15 is strongly expressed in airway epithelial cells, where it catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) involved in various airway inflammatory diseases. Interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 induce ALOX15 expression by activating Jak2 and Tyk2 kinases as well as signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) 1/3/5/6. ALOX15 up-regulation and subsequent association with phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (PEBP1) activate the mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, thus inducing eosinophil-mediated airway inflammation. In addition, ALOX15 plays a significant role in promoting the migration of immune cells, such as immature dendritic cells, activated T cells, and mast cells, and airway remodeling, including goblet cell differentiation. Genome-wide association studies have revealed multiple ALOX15 variants and their significant correlation with the risk of developing airway diseases. The epigenetic modifications of the ALOX15 gene, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, have been shown to closely relate with airway inflammation. This review summarizes the role of ALOX15 in different phenotypes of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic rhinosinusitis, aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, and nasal polyps, suggesting new treatment strategies for these airway inflammatory diseases with complex etiology and poor treatment response.",

    "abstract": "Severe asthma (SA) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by uncontrolled symptoms, frequent exacerbations, and lung function decline. The discovery of phenotypes and endotypes of SA significantly improves our understanding of its pathophysiology and allows the advent of biologics blocking multiple molecular targets. The advances have mainly been made in type 2-high asthma associated with elevated type 2 inflammatory biomarkers such as immunoglobulin E (IgE), interleukins (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Previous clinical trials have demonstrated that type 2 biomarkers, including blood/sputum eosinophils and the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), were correlated to severe airway inflammation, persistent symptoms, frequent exacerbations, and the clinical efficacy of these biomarkers in predicting treatment outcomes of type 2-targeting biologics. However, it is well known that type 2 inflammation is partially attributable to the pathogenesis of SA. Although some recent studies have suggested that type 2-low and mixed phenotypes of asthma are important contributors to the heterogeneity of SA, many questions about these non-type 2 asthma phenotypes remain to be solved. Consequently, many efforts to investigate and find novel biomarkers for SA have also made in their methods. Many cross-sectional experimental studies in large-scale cohorts and randomized clinical trials have proved their value in understanding SA. More recently, real-world cohort studies have been in the limelight for SA research, which is unbiased and expected to give us an answer to the unmet needs of the heterogeneity of SA.",

A growing number of people worldwide are contracting allergic diseases caused by pollens. The seasonal variations in pollens have occurred everywhere and the sensitization rate to pollens has increased in children as well as in adults. Moreover, allergenic plants, such as ragweed and Japanese hop, grow in soil damaged by human's activities and deforestation with air pollution. It is impossible to avoid plants that cause allergies, because pollens can travel many kilometers in the breeze or wind. Hence, it is essential to survey and forecast pollens for the management of pollen allergy. Weather conditions may alter pollen concentrations. A number of studies have shown that increases in CO2 concentration and atmospheric temperature raise pollen concentration. Hence most of the studies on the impact of climate change on aeroallergens must include the amount and allergenicity of pollens. It is yet unknown whether complex interactions with pollens, meteorological variables, and air pollutants in the changing environment. Considering the effect of climate change on the long-term trends in pollen levels and emerging viral infection, it is crucial to forecast and eliminate the associated risk for human health in future and take appropriate measures to reduce it.",

    "abstract": "Asia-Pacific is a populous region with remarkable variations in socioeconomic development and environmental exposure among countries. The prevalence rates of asthma and allergic rhinitis appear to have recently reached a plateau in Western countries, whereas they are still increasing in many Asian countries. Given the large population in Asia, even a slight increase in the prevalence rate will translate into an overwhelming number of patients. To reduce the magnitude of the increase in allergic diseases in next few decades in Asia, we must understand the potential factors leading to the occurrence of these disorders and the development of potential preventive strategies. The etiology of allergic disorders is likely due to complex interactions among genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors for the manifestations of inappropriate immune responses. As urbanization and industrialization inevitably progress in Asia, there is an urgent need to curtail the upcoming waves of the allergy epidemic. Potentially modifiable risk exposure, such as air pollution, should be minimized through timely implementation of effective legislations. Meanwhile, re-introduction of protective factors that were once part of the traditional farming lifestyle might give new insight into primary prevention of allergy.",

Notably, emerging clinical studies show that CRDs are associated with systemic and local elevation of neutrophils. Moreover, murine studies suggest that airway-infiltrating neutrophils not only help initiate airway inflammation but also prolong the inflammation. Given this background, this review describes neutrophil-mediated immune responses in CRDs and summarizes the completed, ongoing, and potential clinical trials that test the therapeutic value of targeting neutrophils in CRDs. The review also clarifies the importance of understanding how neutrophils interact with other immune cells and how these interactions contribute to chronic inflammation in specific CRDs.

Overall, diet also seems to have a marked effect on the microbiome compared to single foods. Factors that may negate the allergy-preventative effect of overall diet diversity include the addition of emulsifiers, advanced glycation end-product content, and overuse of commercial baby foods. There is a need to perform randomized controlled trials using overall dietary intake to support international food allergy guidelines.

Recently, the novel regulatory role of BRP-39/YKL-40 in the pathogenesis of asthma has been demonstrated both in human studies and allergic animal models. The levels of YKL-40 are increased in the circulation and lungs from asthmatics where they correlate with disease severity, and CHI3L1 polymorphisms correlate with serum YKL-40 levels, asthma and abnormal lung function. Animal studies using BRP-39 null mutant mice demonstrated that BRP-39 was required for optimal allergen sensitization and Th2 inflammation. These studies suggest the potential use of BRP-39 as a biomarker as well as a therapeutic target for asthma and other allergic diseases. Here, we present an overview of chitin/chitinase biology and summarize recent findings on the role of BRP-39 in the pathogenesis of asthma and allergic responses.",

    "abstract": "The original concept of asthma being primarily a disease of airways smooth muscle drove the development of bronchodilator drugs.However when it was realised that airway inflammation underpinned the disordered airway function, this gave way to the development of controller therapies such as inhaled cromones and corticosteroids.More recently the discovery of complex interconnecting cytokine and chemokine networks has stimulated the development of biologics with varying success.With the recognition that airway wall \"remodelling\" is present early in asthma inception and is in part driven by aberrant epithelial-mesenchymal communication both genetic and environmental factors beyond allergen exposure such as virus infection and air pollution are being seen as being increasingly important not only in asthma exacerbations but in the origins of asthma and its evolution into different sub-phenotypes.This brings us round full circle to once again considering that the origins of asthma lie in defects in the formed elements of the airway; the epithelium, smooth muscle, and vasculature.Over the last 25 years Professor You Young Kim has engaged in the exciting discovery science of allergy and asthma and has made an enormous contribution in bringing Korea to the forefront of disease management and research, a position that both he and his colleagues can justly be proud of.",

A new pollen calendar of allergenic pollens was made based on the data on pollen concentrations obtained in eight regions nationwide between 1997 and 2009. The distribution of pollen was assessed every day at 8 areas (Seoul, Guri, Busan, Daegu, Jeonju, Kwangju, Kangneung, and Jeju) for 12 years between July 1, 1997 and June 30, 2009. Pollens were collected by using Burkard 7-day sampler (Burkard Manufacturing Co Ltd, UK). Pollens which were stained with Calberla's fuchsin staining solution were identified and counted. Pine became the highest pollen in May, and the pollen concentrations of oak and birch also became high. Ragweed appeared in the middle of August and showed the highest pollen concentration in the middles of September. Japanese hop showed a high concentration between the middle of August and the end of September, and mugwort appeared in the middles of August and its concentration increased up until early September. In Kangneung, birch appeared earlier, pine showed a higher pollen concentration than in the other areas. In Daegu, Oriental thuja and alder produced a large concentration of pollens. Pine produced a large concentration of pollens between the middle of April and the end of May. Weeds showed higher concentrations in September and mugwort appeared earlier than ragweed. In Busan the time of flowering is relatively early, and alder and Oriental thuja appeared earliest among all areas. In Kwangju, Oriental thuja and hazelnut appeared in early February. Japanese cedar showed the highest pollen concentration in March in Jeju. In conclusion, update information on pollen calendar in South Korea should be provided for allergic patients through the website to manage and prevent the pollinosis.",

    "abstract": "The house-dust mite (HDM), commonly found in human dwellings, is an important source of inhalant and contact allergens. In this report, the importance of HDM allergy in Korea and the characteristics of allergens from dust mite are reviewed with an emphasis on investigations performed in Korea. In Korea, Dermatophagoides farinae is the dominant species of HDM, followed by D. pteronyssinus. Tyrophagus putrescentiae is also found in Korea, but its role in respiratory allergic disease in Korea is controversial. The relatively low densities of mite populations and concentrations of mite major allergens in dust samples from Korean homes, compared to westernized countries, are thought to reflect not only different climatic conditions, but also cultural differences, such as the use of 'ondol' under-floor heating systems in Korean houses. HDM are found in more than 90% of Korean houses, and the level of exposure to HDM is clinically significant. About 40%-60% of Korean patients suffering from respiratory allergies, and more than 40% of patients suffering from atopic dermatitis, are sensitized to HDM. Mite allergens can be summarized according to their inherent auto-adjuvant activities and/or their binding affinities to the adjuvant-like substances: proteolytic enzymes, lipid binding proteins, chitin binding proteins, and allergens not associated with adjuvant-like activity. In general, allergens with a strong adjuvant-like activity or adjuvant-binding activity elicit potent IgE reactivity. In Korea, Der f 2 is the most potent allergen, followed by Der f 1. Immune responses are modulated by the properties of the allergen itself and by the adjuvant-like substances that are concomitantly administered with the antigens. Characterization of allergenic molecules and elucidation of mechanisms by which adjuvant-like molecules modulate allergic reactions, not only in Korea but also worldwide, will provide valuable information on allergic diseases, and are necessary for the development of diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "My research career has focused on the causes of asthma and its treatment. After establishing the key role that mast cells play in the inflammatory response in asthma, attention was turned towards understanding disease chronicity and variability across the lifecourse. Through a combination of studies on airway biopsies and primary cell cultures we have established that asthma is primarily an epithelial disease driven by increased environmental susceptibility to injury and an altered repair response as depicted by sustained activation of the epithelial mesenchymal trophic unit (EMTU) that is invoked in foetal branching morphogenesis. Varied activation of the EMTU connects the origins of asthma to its progression over time with involvement of epithelial susceptibility through impaired barrier and innate immune functions and altered mesenchymal susceptibility as exemplified by polymorphisms of the metalloprotease gene, ADAM33. Taken together these observations have led to a fundamental re-evaluation of asthma pathogenesis. Rather than placing allergic inflammation as the prime abnormality, it is proposed that the airway epithelium lies at the center of asthma pathogenesis, and that in conjunction with the underlying mesenchyme, it is the principle orchestrator of both the induction of asthma and its evolution over the lifecourse. This concept has provided 'the basis for a new preventative and therapeutic approach focused more on increasing the airways resistance to environmental insults rather than suppressing downstream inflammation once it is established.",

However, their efficiency in identifying PID cases was not sufficiently evaluated in clinical practice. The objective of this study was to test the validity of the 10 warning signs and IDR score in identifying PID among children with recurrent infections at a tertiary pediatric hospital in Egypt.A retrospective analysis of the medical records of 204 patients was performed. Of these patients, 92 had defined PID diseases and 112 were considered non-PID cases because investigations were inconclusive.Demonstrating two warning signs and an IDR score of 6 led to sensitivities of 94 and 66%, respectively, and specificities of 64 and 75%, respectively, in identifying PID cases. The strongest predictor of PID was family history that, if combined with the need for intravenous antibiotics, recurrent deep-seated infections, and failure to thrive, could identify 81% of PID patients. A family history of PID, sibling death, and/or parental consanguinity would predict 92% of combined immunodeficiencies, 92% of phagocyte defects, 87% of well-identified immunodeficiency syndromes, and 84% of antibody deficiency if the need for intravenous antibiotics is considered in the latter.The 10 warning signs and IDR score do not aid in an early diagnosis of severe PID. Educational campaigns should target pediatricians aiming to increase PID awareness and to address family history of PID, parental consanguinity, and previous sibling death as key predictors of PID in communities with a high prevalence of consanguineous marriages.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of asthma and allergic disease has increased worldwide over the last few decades. Many common environmental factors are associated with this increase. Several theories have been proposed to account for this trend, especially those concerning the impact of environmental toxicants. The development of the immune system, particularly in the prenatal period, has far-reaching consequences for health during early childhood, and throughout adult life. One underlying mechanism for the increased levels of allergic responses, secondary to exposure, appears to be an imbalance in the T-helper function caused by exposure to the toxicants. Exposure to environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals can result in dramatic changes in cytokine production, the activity of the immune system, the overall Th1 and Th2 balance, and in mediators of type 1 hypersensitivity mediators, such as IgE. Passive exposure to tobacco smoke is a common risk factor for wheezing and asthma in children. People living in urban areas and close to roads with a high volume of traffic, and high levels of diesel exhaust fumes, have the highest exposure to environmental compounds, and these people are strongly linked with type 1 hypersensitivity disorders and enhanced Th2 responses. These data are consistent with epidemiological research that has consistently detected increased incidences of allergies and asthma in people living in these locations. During recent decades more than 100,000 new chemicals have been used in common consumer products and are released into the everyday environment. Therefore, in this review, we discuss the environmental effects on allergies of indoor and outside exposure.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic obstructive airway disease that involves inflammation of the respiratory tract. Biological contaminants in indoor air can induce innate and adaptive immune responses and inflammation, resulting in asthma pathology. Epidemiologic surveys indicate that the prevalence of asthma is higher in developed countries than in developing countries. The prevalence of asthma in Korea has increased during the last several decades. This increase may be related to changes in housing styles, which result in increased levels of indoor biological contaminants, such as house dust mite-derived allergens and bacterial products such as endotoxin. Different types of inflammation are observed in those suffering from mild-to-moderate asthma compared to those experiencing severe asthma, involving markedly different patterns of inflammatory cells and mediators. As described in this review, these inflammatory profiles are largely determined by the involvement of different T helper cell subsets, which orchestrate the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells. It is becoming clear that T helper cells other than Th2 cells are involved in the pathogenesis of asthma; specifically, both Th1 and Th17 cells are crucial for the development of neutrophilic inflammation in the airways, which is related to corticosteroid resistance. Development of therapeutics that suppress these immune and inflammatory cells may provide useful asthma treatments in the future.",

    "abstract": "rhinitis is a well-recognized risk factor for asthma and is associated with increased asthma severity, 7 little is known on the role of conjunctivitis as an additional risk factor.Few studies have explored the impact of allergic conjunctivitis on asthma. 3Therefore, using a population sample evaluated during a cross-sectional study performed on schoolchildren, we investigated (1) whether rhinitis and rhinoconjunctivitis are associated with different risk factors, (2) the impact of rhinitis and rhinoconjunctivitis on asthma, and (3) the burden of rhinoconjunctivitis among adolescents. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study designThis is a cross-sectional study conducted on a random sample of schoolchildren, aged 10-17 years, living in the city of Palermo Purpose: Rhinitis and conjunctivitis are common diseases worldwide that are frequently associated.Nevertheless, the risk factors for rhinoconjunctivitis are not well-described and the impact of conjunctivitis on rhinitis and asthma in children remains unknown.This study explored the different risk factors and evaluated the burden of rhinoconjunctivitis among adolescents.Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted on a random sample of schoolchildren, aged 10-17 years, using skin prick tests and a self-administered questionnaire on respiratory health investigating the impact of rhinitis and rhinoconjunctivitis on daily activities.Results: A complete evaluation was obtained for 2,150 children.The prevalence of rhinitis alone was 18.2% and rhinitis associated with conjunctivitis was 20.5%.Rhinoconjunctivitis was more frequently associated with females, a parental history of atopy, domestic exposure to mold/dampness, passive smoke exposure, and reported truck traffic in residential streets.Moreover, rhinoconjunctivitis was associated with a higher level of allergic sensitization.The prevalence of current asthma was 1.7% in subjects without rhinitis or rhinoconjunctivitis, 5.1% in rhinitis and 10.7% in rhinoconjunctivitis.In a logistic model, rhinoconjunctivitis yielded a 2-fold risk for current asthma with respect to rhinitis.Subjects with rhinoconjunctivitis had poorer quality of life (QoL); there was an impact on daily activities in 4.6% of rhinitis and 10.7% of rhinoconjunctivitis.Conclusions: Ocular symptoms increase the role of rhinitis as a risk factor for asthma and its impact on daily activities in children.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Across Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, (referred to as Asia) approximately 30-53 million individuals of the 151 million employed suffer from allergic rhinitis (AR) and urticaria.It is estimated that approximately 90% of patients with these allergic conditions are insufficiently treated, impacting the socioeconomic burden in terms of absence from work and decreased productivity.This study aims to estimate the socioeconomic burden of allergies in Asia and the cost savings that their adequate management can provide.Due to the limited availability of regional data, this study focused AR and urticaria in selected countries.Methods: Published literature, information from statistical bureaus, clinician surveys and extrapolation of selected data from the European Union were used to determine the socioeconomic costs of AR and urticaria.Results: Many patients in Asia suffer from perennial allergies and experience symptoms of AR and urticaria for up to 298 days per year.An estimate of the indirect costs of patients insufficiently treated for AR and urticaria amounts to USD 105.4 billion a year, which equates to USD 1,137-2,195 per patient due to absenteeism and presenteeism.Adherence to guideline-approved treatment can lead to estimated savings of up to USD 104 billion.Conclusions: The current study suggests that within Asia, the socioeconomic impact of AR and urticaria is similar to that seen in the European Union in spite of the lower wages in Asia.This is due to the mainly perennial allergens prevailing in Asia, whereas the sensitization patterns observed in the European Union are dominated by seasonal exposure to pollen.These results underline the need for governmental initiatives to increase public awareness on the prevention and treatment of these and other allergic diseases as well as greater research funding and large-scale studies to reduce their growing socioeconomic burden in coming years.",

    "abstract": "Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), a mainly Th2 cytokine-mediated disease, often involves mucus secretion. Recent evidence suggests that transmembrane protein 16A (TMEM16A), a calcium-activated Cl- channel (CaCC), can regulate mucus secretion from airway epithelium by transepithelial electrolyte transport and hydration. However, the role of TMEM16A in mucin production/secretion in the airway epithelium is not clear. This study was conducted to determine the role of TMEM16A in mediating mucin secretion in human nasal polyp epithelial cells (HNPECs) induced by IL-13. Human sinonasal mucosa tissue and dissociated sinonasal epithelium from control subjects and patients with CRSwNP were assessed for the expression of TMEM16A and the secretion of human mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) by immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis, and enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA). A model of the Th2 inflammatory environment was created by exposure of primary air-liquid interface (ALI)-cultured HNPECs to interleukin-13 (IL-13) for 14 days, with subsequent assessment of TMEM16A expression in cell lysates by Western blotting and MUC5AC secretion in apical washings of cells by ELISA. The expressions of TMEM16A and MUC5AC were increased in human nasal polyp tissue and dissociated nasal polyp epithelium. TMEM16A was detected in IL-13-treated HNPECs, specifically in MUC5AC-positive cells but not in ciliated cells. IL-13 treatment increased percentages of TMEM16A-positive cells, MUC5AC-positive cells, and cells coexpressing TMEM16A/MUC5AC, the expression of TMEM16A protein, and the secretion of MUC5AC. T16Ainh-A01, a TMEM16A inhibitor, attenuated these IL-13-induced effects. The expression of TMEM16A and MUC5AC are increased in CRSwNP, which might be a direct effect of Th2 cytokines present in the sinonasal mucosa in CRSwNP. Down-regulation of TMEM16A expression and MUC5AC secretion in HNPECs by T16Ainh-A01 indicates that TMEM16A might play an important role in mucin secretion in upper airway inflammatory diseases.",

CHIT1 is an innate immune mediator that digests the cell walls of chitin-containing eukaryotic pathogens, such as fungi. However, CHIT1 is dysregulated in granulomatous and fibrotic interstitial lung diseases characterized by inflammation and tissue remodeling. These include tuberclosis, sarcoidosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, scleroderma-associated interstitial lung diseases (SSc-ILD), and chronic obstructive lung diseases (COPD). CHIT1 serum concentration correlates with the progression or the severity of these diseases, suggesting a potential use of CHIT1 as a biomarker or a therapeutic target. Recent studies with genetically modified mice demonstrate that CHIT1 enhances TGF-β1 receptor expression and signaling, suggesting a role in initiating or amplifying the response to organ injury and repair. This additional CHIT1 activity is independent of its enzymatic activity. These studies suggest that CHIT1 serves a bridging function; it is both an innate immune mediator and a regulator of tissue remodeling. This review will focus on recent data linking CHIT1 to the pathogenesis of inflammation, interstitial lung disease, and COPD.",

    "abstract": "Various immune cells, including eosinophils and neutrophils, are known to contribute to the development of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). However, the current understanding of the role of neutrophils in the development of CRSwNP still remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated risk factors for refractoriness of CRSwNP in an Asian population.Protein levels of 17 neutrophil-related mediators in nasal polyps (NPs) were determined by multiplex immunoassay, and exploratory factor analysis using principal component analysis was performed. Immunofluorescence analysis was conducted to detect human neutrophil elastase (HNE) or myeloperoxidase (MPO)-positive cells. Tissue eosinophilic nasal polyp (ENP) and tissue neutrophilia (Neuhigh) were defined as greater than 70 eosinophils and 20 HNE-positive cells, otherwise was classified into non-eosinophilic nasal polyp (NENP) and absence of tissue neutrophilia (Neulow).In terms of disease control status, NENP-Neulow patients showed the higher rate of disease control than NENP-Neuhigh and ENP-Neuhigh patients. Linear by linear association demonstrated the trend in refractoriness from NENP-Neulow to NENP-Neuhigh or ENP-Neulow to ENP-Neuhigh. When multiple logistic regression was performed, tissue neutrophilia (hazard ratio, 4.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.76-10.85) was found as the strongest risk factor for CRSwNP refractoriness. Additionally, exploratory factor analysis revealed that interleukin (IL)-18, interferon-γ, IL-1Ra, tumor necrosis factor-α, oncostatin M, and MPO were associated with good disease control status, whereas IL-36α and IL-1α were associated with refractory disease control status. In subgroup analysis, HNE-positive cells and IL-36α were significantly upregulated in the refractory group (P = 0.0132 and P = 0.0395, respectively), whereas MPO and IL-18 showed higher expression in the controlled group (P = 0.0002 and P = 0.0009, respectively). Moreover, immunofluorescence analysis revealed that IL-36R⁺HNE⁺-double positive cells were significantly increased in the refractory group compared to the control group. We also found that the ratio of HNE-positive cells to α1 anti-trypsin was increased in the refractory group.Tissue neutrophilia had an influence on treatment outcomes in the Asian CRSwNP patients. HNE-positive cells and IL-36α may be biomarkers for predicting refractoriness in Asians with CRSwNP. Additionally, imbalances in HNE and α1 anti-trypsin may be associated with pathophysiology of neutrophilic chronic rhinosinusitis.",

    "abstract": "Despite asthma being the most common chronic childhood ailment, there is still much to learn about the disease.Early childhood infections with well-known or emerging viruses can lay the pathophysiologic framework for asthma development and exacerbation later in life, which may be due partly to alteration of the airway microbiome.Once asthma is established, acute exacerbations are usually associated with infections with respiratory viruses, such as rhinoviruses (RVs).Once again, there are bidirectional interactions between viruses and airway bacteria that appear to influence the severity of illness and the likelihood of exacerbation.Studies employing recent advances in viral and bacterial identification analytic techniques will clarify these new concepts and may provide the basis for new treatments or prevention or respiratory infection-associated exacerbation.This paper is a review of the associations among respiratory viruses, bacteria, inflammatory mechanisms, and asthma exacerbation.",

    "abstract": "Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a major concern for public health, as well as for drug development in the pharmaceutical industry, since it can cause liver failure and lead to drug withdrawal from the market and black box warnings. Thus, it is important to identify biomarkers for early prediction to increase our understanding of mechanisms underlying DILI that will ultimately aid in the exploration of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or manage DILI. DILI can be subdivided into 'intrinsic' and 'idiosyncratic' categories, although the validity of this classification remains controversial. Idiosyncratic DILI occurs in a minority of susceptible individuals with a prolonged latency, while intrinsic DILI results from drug-induced direct hepatotoxicity over the course of a few days. The rare occurrence of idiosyncratic DILI requires multicenter collaborative investigations and phenotype standardization. Recent progress in research on idiosyncratic DILI is based on key developments in 3 areas: (1) newly developed high-throughput genotyping across the whole genome allowing for the identification of genetic susceptibility markers, (2) new mechanistic concepts on the pathogenesis of DILI revealing a key role of drug-responsive T lymphocytes in the immunological response, and (3) broad multidisciplinary approaches using different platform \"-omics\" technologies that have identified novel biomarkers for the prediction of DILI. An association of a specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele with DILI has been reported for several drugs. HLA-restricted T-cell immune responses have also been investigated using lymphocytes and T-cell clones isolated from patients. A microRNA, miR-122, has been discovered as a promising biomarker for the early prediction of DILI. In this review, we summarize recent advances in research on idiosyncratic DILI with an understanding of the key role of adaptive immune systems.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: ORM1-like 3 (ORMDL3) belongs to a highly conserved protein family which is anchored as transmembrane protein in the endoplasmic reticulum.Gasdermin B (GSDMB) is adjacent to ORMDL3 on chromosome 17q21.2and belongs to the gasdermin-domain containing the protein family (GSDM family).Recent reports suggest that GSDMB and ORMDL3 are associated with asthma in several populations.However, genetic association studies that examined the association of GSDMB and ORMDL3 gene variants with asthma showed conflicting results.To assess whether combined evidence shows the association between GSDMB/ORMDL3 polymorphism and asthma.Methods: A bibliographic search from MEDLINE identified 13 original articles using the search keywords 'GSDMB ', 'ORMDL3 ', and 'asthma'.An updated literature-based meta-analysis involving 6,691 subjects with asthma, 9,281 control individuals, and 1,360 families were conducted.Meta-odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on the fixed effects model or the random effects model depended on Cochran's Q-statistic and I 2 values.Data from case-control and TDT studies were analyzed in an allelic model using the Catmap software.Results: We selected and identified 3 SNPs of ORMDL3 associated with asthma (rs8076131: OR=1.10; 95% CI, 1.02-1.20;P=0.012.rs12603332: OR=1.15; 95% CI, 1.05-1.25;P=0.002.rs3744246: OR=1.10; 95% CI, 1.02-1.17;P=0.008) and 1 SNP of GSDMB associated with asthma (rs7216389: OR=1.37; 95% CI, 1.27-1.47;P<0.01).Publication bias was estimated using modified Egger's linear regression test proposed by Harbordetal and revealed no evidence of biases.Furthermore, cumulative meta-analysis in chronological order showed the inclination toward significant association for rs7216389 and rs12603332 with continually adding studies, and the inclination toward null-significant association for rs3744246 and rs8076131.Conclusions: Moderate evidence exists for associations of the ORMDL3 rs8076131, rs12603332, and rs3744246 and GSDMB rs7216389 variants with asthma.Large sample size and representative population-based studies and TDT studies with homogeneous asthmatic patients and well-matched controls are warranted to confirm this finding.",

Residential environment was assessed by questionnaires which were completed by their parents. To evaluate the level of exposure to the indoor air pollutants, concentrations of the indoor air pollutants including particulate matter with diameter less than 10 µm (PM10), formaldehyde, carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Total Volatile Organic Compound (TVOC), benzene, toluene, ethyl-benzene, xylene, styrene, bacterial aerosols, and airborne fungi were measured.A significant difference was exhibited in the levels of PM10 in case of visible fungus on the walls (P=0.047). There was relationship between the construction year of the house, moving to a newly constructed building within 1 year and formaldehyde level. With the use of artificial air freshener, the differences were found in the concentrations of TVOC (P=0.003), benzene (P=0.015), toluene (P=0.012) and ethyl-benzene (P=0.027). The concentration of xylene was significantly high when oil was used as heating fuel (P=0.015). Styrene exhibited differences depending on building type and its concentrations were significantly high in a residential and commercial complex building (P=0.005). The indoor concentration of bacterial aerosols was significantly low with the use of air cleaner (P=0.045). High NO2, benzene concentrations were present in case of almost no ventilation (P=0.028 and P=0.028, respectively).Individual residential environments are closely related with the levels of the indoor air pollutants. To alleviate AD symptoms, simple questions about residential environments such as visible fungus on the walls and the use of artificial air freshener are helpful to assess the possibility of increased indoor air pollutant levels when direct measurement is not available.",

In this study, we analyzed 3 different Korean national health survey datasets to determine the general features of adult asthma in Korea and to obtain basic information that would support future strategies for better management of adult asthma.The surveys used in this study included the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES), Korea Community Health Survey (KCHS) and National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC). We investigated annual asthma prevalence, evaluating the rate and risk factors of asthma exacerbation by age and sex, and clinical data of 1,832 patients with asthma who were registered in the Cohort for Reality and Evolution of Adult Asthma in Korea (COREA) were analyzed to elucidate risk factors for asthma exacerbation. We also analyzed another asthma cohort and added it as replication data.In the KNHANES database, annual asthma prevalence rates varied from 1.2% to 3.1%. In the KCHS database, overall prevalence increased, with significant regional differences (1.6%-2.1%). The NHIS-NSC indicated a gradual increase in annual asthma prevalence from 4.5% to 6.2%. Interestingly, all 3 surveys indicated the highest prevalence of asthma among elderly women. In addition, elderly women with asthma had a significantly higher risk of asthma exacerbation (odds ratio [OR], 1.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19-2.93; P=0.006). Approximately 11% of patients were classified as having severe asthma. An asthma cohort analysis identified female sex, low baseline pulmonary function, longer treatment duration, high variability in pulmonary function and significant changes in Asthma Control Test scores as risk factors for asthma exacerbation.The prevalence of asthma in Korea is consistently high among elderly and female populations. These results should lay the foundation for strategies for effective asthma prevention and management; elderly female patients with asthma should receive particular attention.",

Second-generation, relatively non-sedating H₁-receptor blockers are typically employed up to 4 times a day. First-generation antihistamines, such as hydroxyzine or diphenhydramine (Atarax or Benadryl), were employed similarly in the past. Should high-dose antihistamines fail to control symptoms (at least 50%), omalizumab at 300 mg/month is the next step. This is effective in 70% of antihistamine-refractory patients. H₂-receptor blockers and leukotriene antagonists are no longer recommended; they add little and the literature does not support significant efficacy. For those patients who are unresponsive to both antihistamines and omalizumab, cyclosporine is recommended next. This is similarly effective in 65%-70% of patients; however, care is needed regarding possible side-effects on blood pressure and renal function. Corticosteroids should not be employed chronically due to cumulative toxicity that is dose and time dependent. Brief courses of steroid e.g., 3-10 days can be employed for severe exacerbations, but should be an infrequent occurrence. Finally, other agents, such as dapsone or sulfasalazine, can be tried for those patients unresponsive to antihistamines, omalizumab, and cyclosporine.",

In this study, we investigated the prevalence and clinical characteristics of PFAS in Korea.Twenty-two investigators participated in this study, in which patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and/or bronchial asthma with pollen allergy were enrolled. The questionnaires included demographic characteristics, a list of fruits and vegetables, and clinical manifestations of food allergy. Pollen allergy was diagnosed by skin prick test and/or measurement of the serum level of specific IgE.A total of 648 pollinosis patients were enrolled. The prevalence of PFAS was 41.7% (n = 270). PFAS patients exhibited cutaneous (43.0%), respiratory (20.0%), cardiovascular (3.7%) or neurologic symptoms (4.8%) in addition to oropharyngeal symptoms. Anaphylaxis was noted in 8.9% of the PFAS patients. Seventy types of foods were linked to PFAS; e.g., peach (48.5%), apple (46.7%), kiwi (30.4%), peanut (17.4%), plum (16.3%), chestnut (14.8%), pineapple (13.7%), walnut (14.1%), Korean melon (12.6%), tomato (11.9%), melon (11.5%) and apricot (10.7%).

Total and nighttime symptom scores reduced significantly with omalizumab vs placebo (LSM-TD=-0.21, P=0.048 and -0.12, P=0.011, respectively). Although the study was not powered to study differences in exacerbation rates (P=0.097), exacerbations in winter months were less frequent in the omalizumab vs placebo group (2 vs 21). Adverse event and severe adverse event rates were comparable between omalizumab and placebo.Omalizumab improves lung function, quality of life, and asthma control in Chinese patients with moderate-to-severe persistent allergic asthma and has a good safety profile.",

    "abstract": "Chronic cough is a prevalent condition in the community and may pose considerable impairment to quality of life (QoL). However, its disease burden remains largely undefined in the general population. The present study investigated the relationship between chronic cough and health-related QoL in a Korean nationwide population database, with an emphasis on clinical conditions which may confound the impact of cough.This study analyzed cross-sectional datasets of adults (aged ≥ 40 years) in the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2010-2016. Health-related QoL was assessed using the 3-level EuroQoL 5-dimension component (EQ-5D-3L) index score. The presence of chronic cough and other conditions were defined using structured questionnaires.The prevalence of chronic cough was 3.48% ± 0.17% among adults aged ≥ 40 years. The overall EQ-5D-3L index score was significantly lower in subjects with than without chronic cough (0.79 ± 0.01 vs. 0.86 ± 0.00, P < 0.001). In subgroup analyses by age and sex, chronic cough had a notably large impact on QoL in women aged ≥ 65 years (vs. those without chronic cough: 0.55 ± 0.04 vs. 0.70 ± 0.01, P < 0.001), although the mean difference in the scores exceeded the minimally important difference score of 0.05 in all subgroups. In multivariate analyses, chronic cough was significantly associated with QoL, independent of confounders including depression, arthritis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In dimension analyses, chronic cough was more associated with anxiety/depression, pain/discomfort, and usual activities than with self-care or mobility in the EQ-5D.The present study demonstrated significant associations between chronic cough and health-related QoL in a nationwide large general adult population aged ≥ 40 years, which were independent of clinical confounders. The impact of chronic cough was greater in women aged ≥ 65 years. These findings indicate a considerable burden of chronic cough in the general population and warrant further investigations to assess the disease burden of chronic cough in a global scale.",

    "abstract": "Food allergy is a hypersensitive immune response to specific food proteins. Chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1, also known as YKL-40 in humans or BRP-39 in mice) is associated with various chronic diseases, such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and allergic disease. CHI3L1 is involved in allergen sensitization and type 2 helper T (Th2) inflammation, but the role of CHI3L1 in food allergy remains unclear. In this study, we sought to investigate the role of CHI3L1 in the development of food allergy. We measured serum levels of CHI3L1 in food allergic patients. Food allergy was induced in wild-type (WT) and CHI3L1 null mutant (CHI3L1-/-) BALB/c mice with ovalbumin (OVA). We investigated Th2 immune responses, M2 macrophage polarization, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways, and also performed transcriptome analysis. Serum levels of CHI3L1 were significantly higher in children with food allergy compared with those in healthy controls. Furthermore, CHI3L1 expression levels were elevated in WT mice after OVA treatment. Food allergy symptoms, immunoglobulin E levels, Th2 cytokine production, and histological injury were attenuated in food allergy-induced CHI3L1-/- mice compared with those in food allergy-induced WT mice. CHI3L1 expression was increased in OVA-treated WT intestinal macrophages and caused M2 macrophage polarization. Furthermore, CHI3L1 was involved in the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and AKT signaling pathways and was associated with immune response and lipid metabolism as determined through transcriptome analysis. CHI3L1 plays a pivotal role in Th2 inflammation and M2 macrophage polarization through MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT phosphorylation in food allergy.",

    "abstract": "Despite medical and surgical treatments, some cases of nasal polyps (NP) exhibit recidivism. However, the endotype of refractory chronic rhinosinusitis with NP (CRSwNP) remains unclear. Therefore, the objective of this study was to characterize the immunological profile of refractory CRSwNP.The control (n =23), primary NP group (pNP, n =70) and refractory NP group (rNP, n =86) were enrolled in this study. Patients who underwent revision surgeries due to failed maximal medical treatment after primary surgery were defined as the rNP group. A total of 18 inflammatory markers were investigated in nasal tissues using multiplex cytokine assay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.The clinical characteristics of rNP included more extensive disease and worse clinical course after surgery. Additionally, rNP subjects showed higher infection rate (mucopurulence and culture-positive rate), more frequent use of antibiotics and suffered from symptomatic bacterial infection, increased asthma morbidity compared to pNP. Cytokine profile analysis showed that levels of Th17-associated mediators (myeloperoxidase, interleukin (IL)-8, IL-17A and IL-23), B-cell activating factor (BAFF) and Th1 cytokine (interferon-γ) were up-regulated in rNP compared to controls and pNP. Human neutrophil elastase-positive cells were also enhanced in rNP compared with pNP. Upregulation of Th17/Th1mediators and BAFF were observed in rNP, regardless of tissue eosinophilia or asthmatic comorbidity. Interestingly, eosinophilic markers, such as eosinophil cationic protein and C-C motif chemokine ligand 24, were up-regulated in asthmatic rNP compared to pNP and controls. Levels of anti-dsDNA immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA were up-regulated in rNP and highest in asthmatic eosinophilic rNP among subtypes of rNP.Our results suggest that Th17/Th1-associated mediators and BAFF may play a role and be a potential therapeutic target in refractory CRSwNP. Additionally, eosinophilic markers and autoantibodies may contribute to refractoriness in asthmatic rNP.",

Treatment of CRS has been traditionally limited to corticosteroids and sinus surgery; however, novel biologics have more recently been evaluated as steroid- and surgery-sparing options. While it is clear that there are different subtypes or endotypes of CRS, perhaps the most frequent presentation involves the features of type 2 inflammation, including a prominent tissue eosinophilia component. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on eosinophil biology as well as on the potential contribution of eosinophils and their mediators to the pathophysiology of CRS, drawing mechanistic conclusions mainly from studies of human sinus mucosal tissues, nasal secretions, and benefits (or lack thereof) from the use of various pharmacotherapies. The unavoidable conclusion derived from this approach is that eosinophils themselves cannot fully explain the underlying pathophysiology of this complex disorder.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE Eosinophils are frequently found in atopic dermatitis (AD) and chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) that release eosinophil peroxidase (EPX) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP). Continuous exposure to these proteins could trigger an autoimmune response which may contribute to the pathogenesis and severity of skin inflammation. In this study, we investigate the immunoglobulin E (IgE) response against eosinophil proteins in CSU and AD. METHODS We recruited patients with severe AD, severe CSU and healthy subjects to explore the presence of IgE autoantibodies and cross-reactivity against EPX, ECP and thyroid peroxidase (TPO). The potential cross-reactive epitopes among the peroxidase family were determined using in silico tools. RESULTS The frequencies of anti-EPX IgE (28.8%) and anti-ECP IgE (26.6%) were higher in the AD group, and anti-TPO IgE was higher in the CSU group (27.2%). In the CSU group, there was a correlation between the anti-EPX IgE and anti-TPO IgE levels (r = 0.542, P < 0.001); TPO inhibited 42% of IgE binding to EPX, while EPX inhibited 59% of IgE binding to TPO, suggesting a cross-reactivity with EPX as a primary sensitizer. There was greater inhibition when we used a pool of sera CSU and AD, TPO inhibited 52% of IgE binding to EPX, while EPX inhibited 78% of IgE binding to TPO. In silico analysis showed a possible shared epitope in the peroxidase protein family. CONCLUSIONS IgE against eosinophil proteins may contribute to chronic inflammation in patients with AD and CSU. Cross-reactivity between EPX and TPO could explain thyroid problems in CSU patients.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory epithelial cells form a selective barrier between the outside environment and underlying tissues. Epithelial cells are polarized and form specialized cell-cell junctions, known as the apical junctional complex (AJC). Assembly and disassembly of the AJC regulates epithelial morphogenesis and remodeling processes. The AJC consists of tight and adherens junctions, functions as a barrier and boundary, and plays a role in signal transduction. Endothelial junction proteins play important roles in tissue integrity and vascular permeability, leukocyte extravasation, and angiogenesis. Air pollutants such as particulate matter, ozone, and biologic contaminants penetrate deep into the airways, reaching the bronchioles and alveoli before entering the bloodstream to trigger airway inflammation. Pollutants accumulating in the lungs exacerbate the symptoms of respiratory diseases, including asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease. Biological contaminants include bacteria, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. Allergic inflammation develops in tissues such as the lung and skin with large epithelial surface areas exposed to the environment. Barrier dysfunction in the lung allows allergens and environmental pollutants to activate the epithelium and produce cytokines that promote the induction and development of immune responses. In this article, we review the impact of environmental pollutants on the cell barrier in respiratory diseases.",

Patients with mucus plugs had reduced spirometry and larger FOT parameters, especially in COPD patients. Mucus scores correlated positively with IgE in ACO and FeNO in asthmatic patients, but not in COPD patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that SAD parameters, including forced vital capacity and resonant frequency, a respiratory reactance parameter, were significantly associated with the presence of mucus plugs in the whole studied population.SAD, rather than large airway dysfunction, was associated with mucus plugs in asthma, ACO, and COPD patients.",

The production of SAA1 from airway epithelial cells (AECs) and its effects on macrophages and neutrophils were investigated in vitro and in vivo.The SAA1 levels were significantly higher in sera of asthmatic patients than in those of HCs (P = 0.014); among asthmatics, patients with neutrophilic asthma (NA) showed significantly higher SAA1 levels than those with non-NA (P < 0.001). In vitro, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly I-C) treatment markedly enhanced the production of SAA1 from AECs, which was further augmented by neutrophils; SAA1 could induce the production of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and S100 calcium-binding protein A9 from AECs. Additionally, SAA1 activated neutrophils and macrophages isolated from peripheral blood of asthmatics, releasing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and secreting proinflammatory cytokines presenting M1 phenotype, respectively. In ovalbumin-induced asthma mice, Poly I-C treatment significantly increased SAA1 levels as well as IL-17A/interferon-gamma/IL-33 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), leading to airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation. The highest levels of SAA1 and neutrophilia were noted in the BALF and sera of the NA mouse model, followed by the mixed granulocytic asthma (MA) model. Especially, SAA1 induced IL-17/retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor γt expression from activated CD4+ T lymphocytes in asthmatic mice.The results show that SAA1 could induce neutrophilic airway inflammation by activating neutrophils along with NET formation, M1 macrophages, and Th2/Th17 predominant cells, contributing to the phenotype of NA or MA.",

Disease control status at postoperative 1 year was assessed. Refractory cases were defined as partly controlled or uncontrolled cases according to the EPOS 2020 guidelines. NETosis and EETosis were evaluated through immunofluorescence staining (citrullinated histone H3-human neutrophil elastase and citrullinated histone-galectin-10, respectively) followed by manual counting. The z-score of NET and EET counts was used to define the following four groups: low extracellular trap formation (ETosis), NETosis-predominant, EETosis-predominant, and high-ETosis.The refractory and non-refractory groups showed significant differences in the tissue eosinophil count (P = 0.005) and EET count (P = 0.029). The tissue neutrophil count and the NET/neutrophil ratio were significantly different between the refractory and non-refractory groups of patients with neutrophilic CRS (P = 0.045, 0.031, respectively). Refractoriness significantly differed among the low-ETosis (30.77%), NETosis-predominant (47.83%), EETosis-predominant (56.67%), and high-ETosis (83.33%) groups (P = 0.005).The results of this study suggest that tissue Eosinophilia and EETosis may play a prognostic role, primarily in CRSwNP and thattissue neutrophilia and NETosis can play as prognostic biomarkers in neutrophilic CRSwNP.",

The global trends in asthma burden remain poorly understood, and asthma incidence has increased during the worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive view of the global distribution of asthma burden and its attributable risk factors from 1990 to 2019.Based on the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 Database, asthma incidence, deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), the corresponding age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), age-standardized death rate (ASDR), age-standardized DALY rate, and estimated annual percentage change were analyzed according to age, sex, sociodemographic index (SDI) quintiles, and locations. Risk factors contributing to asthma deaths and DALYs were also investigated.Globally, the asthma incidence increased by 15%, but deaths and DALYs decreased. The corresponding ASIR, ASDR, and age-standardized DALY rate also decreased. The high SDI region had the highest ASIR, and the low SDI region had the highest ASDR. The ASDR and age-standardized DALY rate were negatively correlated with the SDI. The low-middle SDI region, particularly South Asia, showed the highest asthma-related deaths and DALYs. The incidence peak was under 9 years old, and more than 70% of all deaths occurred in the population over 60 years old. Smoking, occupational asthmagens, and a high body mass index were the main risk factors for asthma-related mortality and DALYs, and their distributions varied between sexes.Globally, the asthma incidence has increased since 1990. The greatest asthma burden is borne by the low-middle SDI region. The 2 groups that need special attention are those under 9 years old and those over 60 years old. Targeted strategies are needed to reduce the asthma burden based on geographic and sex-age characteristics. Our findings also provide a platform for further investigation into the asthma burden in the era of COVID-19.",

Conventional biomarkers, including immunoglobulin E, blood/sputum eosinophil counts, airway obstruction or reversibility, and fractional exhaled nitric oxide, are widely used to diagnose asthma. However, these markers have some limitations, necessitating the discovery of additional biomarkers. Therefore, this review summarizes recently suggested biomarkers for representing type 2-high (eosinophilic) vs. type 2-low (neutrophilic) asthma, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-exacerbated respiratory disease, and severe asthma. Additionally, we discuss the potential benefits of these biomarkers in classifying specific phenotypes/endotypes and managing asthmatic patients.",

    "abstract": "Lipids are important skin components that provide, together with proteins, barrier function of the skin. Keratinocyte terminal differentiation launches unique metabolic changes to lipid metabolism that result in the predominance of ceramides within lipids of the stratum corneum (SC)-the very top portion of the skin. Differentiating keratinocytes form unique ceramides that can be found only in the skin, and generate specialized extracellular structures known as lamellae. Lamellae establish tight hydrophobic layers between dying keratinocytes to protect the body from water loss and also from penetration of allergens and bacteria. Genetic and immunological factors may lead to the failure of keratinocyte terminal differentiation and significantly alter the proportion between SC components. The consequence of such changes is loss or deterioration of skin barrier function that can lead to pathological changes in the skin. This review summarizes our current understanding of the role of lipids in skin barrier function. It also draws attention to the utility of testing SC for lipid and protein biomarkers to predict future onset of allergic skin diseases.",

The immunotherapeutic effect of the hydrogels was tested using a murine model of allergic rhinitis. Sensitized mice received 3 subcutaneous injections of the HDM extract (subcutaneous immunotherapy [SCIT] group) or phosphate buffer saline (negative and positive control) at 2-day intervals. Mice in the HA hydrogel immunotherapy groups received one subcutaneous injection of each HA hydrogel precursor solution that formed hydrogel by transmitting blue light through the skin. All except the negative control received HDM extract intranasally for 5 days. Nasal symptoms, ear swelling, eosinophil count, antibody levels, and histopathology of the nasal mucosa were analyzed. All HDM-containing immunotherapy groups exhibited reduced nasal symptoms, ear swelling, and eosinophil count in nasopharyngeal lavage compared to the positive control group. Eosinophils, mast cells, and goblet cells in the nasal mucosa decreased in all treatment groups compared to the positive control group. The serum levels of HDM-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG)1 increased in all treatment groups; however, IgG2a levels increased only in the SCIT and Gel-2 groups. Interleukin (IL)-4, 13, and 17 decreased in all treatment groups compared to those in the positive control group, whereas IL-10 level increased only in the SCIT and Gel-2 groups. SCIT and Gel-2 treatment showed similar capability to induce regulatory T cells. Injectable HA hydrogel containing HDM reduced allergic symptoms and induced tolerance in a murine model of allergic rhinitis.",

    "abstract": "Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a prevalent airway disease, leading to health, social, and economic burdens, and substantially impairs quality of life. As CRS is heterogeneous and contains diverse pathogenesis, treatment outcomes and prognosis vary from curative to intractable. Inflammatory endotypes of CRS are divided into 3 types-type 1, type 2 and type 3-based on cytokines promoted. Tissue/blood eosinophilia seems to be the most reliable and feasible biomarker for type 2 CRS in clinical settings, although the cutoff level of eosinophilia remains to be elucidated. In East Asia, the predominant pathogenesis has changed from neutrophilic type 3 inflammation to eosinophilic type 2 inflammation over the past decades. The treatment strategy for CRS has also evolved from classical phenotype-based \"reliever-controller\" treatment to endotype-based \"treatable traits\" treatment. \"Treatable traits\" treatment is a personalized approach for the management of airway disease with complex and heterogeneous conditions. In CRS, traits can be grouped into sinonasal, extra-nasal and risk factor/behavioral domains. Type 2 CRS is one of the sinonasal traits, and biologics targeting immunoglobulin E, interleukin (IL)-5 and its receptor, IL-4/IL-13 receptor (IL-4/IL-13R) and thymic stromal lymphopoietin are the corresponding treatments for this trait. Proper use of these biologics can achieve high efficacy with patient satisfaction, leading to clinical remission. However, some cases show marked hypereosinophilia after the reduction or discontinuation of systemic corticosteroid or the switching of biologics from anti-IL-5/IL-5R to anti-IL-4Rα monoclonal antibody. More precise research on CRS targeting endotype, genotype, regiotype and theratype is needed to address the unmet needs and refine the \"treatable traits\" treatment of CRS.",

    "abstract": "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-exacerbated respiratory disease (N-ERD) is a phenotype of bronchial asthma that is characterized by a severe course and the presence of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with nasal polyps. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) belong to a family of small, non-coding RNAs whose primary function is to regulate gene transcription. The aim of this study was to determine the miRNA profile and to validate selected miRNAs in biological material from the upper respiratory tract collected with a minimally-invasive method in patients with N-ERD. The miRNA profile was assessed in subjects with N-ERD, CRS, and allergic asthma (AA), as well as healthy controls (HCs), using microarray technique. Following this, 6 miRNAs were validated using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in 77 subjects. The profiling identified 23 miRNAs whose expression significantly differed between patients with N-ERD and HCs. Based on these results, 6 miRNAs were selected for further validation. It was found that patients with N-ERD had significantly different expressions of miR-34a-5p and miR-22-5p compared to those with AA. In the whole study group, significant correlations were found between miR-7d-3p/miR-34a-5p/miR-22-5p and the presence of blood eosinophilia (r = 0.25, r = 0.28 and r = 0.26, for all P < 0.05). Forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity was correlated with miR-149a-5p expression (r = 0.27, P < 0.05). The results indicate that the miRNA profile in nasal mucosal lining fluid of patients with N-ERD differs from patients with AA, CRS, and compared to HCs. Some of the miRNAs selected on the basis of profiling may be involved in the regulation of eosinophilic inflammation in the respiratory tract. Our findings suggest that specific miRNAs may be considered as potential biomarkers of N-ERD.",

The quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendations were evaluated using the grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) system based on domestic and international relevant medical evidence. This consensus evaluates the effects of key air pollutants on public health in relation to AR, including the synergistic effects of air pollutants with meteorological conditions and aeroallergens. At the same time, the consensus provides recommendations for targeted therapeutic and preventive measures for AR under conditions of ambient air pollution, aiming to improve AR-related health outcomes. These recommendations aim to increase public and clinical awareness of the contribution of environmental factors to AR, and offer evidence-based insights for policymakers and regulators to establish informed ambient air quality standards.",

However, the impacts of air pollutants on asthma, particularly at levels below these safe thresholds, remain unclear. We analyzed the associations between air pollutants (particulate matter of 10 μm or less in diameter [PM₁₀], particulate matter of 2.5 μm or less in diameter, sulfur dioxide [SO₂], carbon monoxide, ozone [O₃], and nitrogen dioxide) and healthcare utilization in 23,498 individuals with asthma in Seoul during the 2015-2017 season. The relative risk for healthcare utilization was assessed based on quantitative comparison (upper quartile vs. lower quartile) and non-linear concentration-response curves. Safety thresholds for air quality levels were determined according to the World Health Organization and Korean standards. In quantitative analysis, healthcare utilization risk decreased for PM₁₀ and SO₂ but increased for O₃ on lag day 0, with no significant associations observed for other air pollutants. Non-linear analyses revealed significant concentration-response associations for all air pollutants, indicating increased risks of healthcare utilization on lag day 0. Notably, these increased risks occurred below proposed safety thresholds, with a steeper rise observed for asthma-related healthcare utilization within these ranges. Exposure to 6 air pollutants was associated with an increased risk of healthcare utilization among individuals with asthma, with no safe exposure levels identified. The impact was more pronounced below current safety thresholds.",

However, little is known about the association between pet ownership and asthma morbidity in children who are not sensitized to pets. We aimed to investigate the effect of pets on lung function, airway inflammation, and morbidity in children with asthma, and to determine whether the effect of exposure to pets vary based on pet sensitization status. A total of 975 asthmatic children, aged 5-15 years, were enrolled in the Korean Childhood Asthma Study. Pet ownership and asthma morbidity were evaluated by questionnaires or pediatrician evaluations. Pulmonary function, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), and atopic status were assessed. FeNO levels were significantly higher in children with pets than in those without pets. Pet ownership significantly increased FeNO levels in atopic asthmatic children, irrespective of pet sensitization status. In children sensitized to pets, the geometric mean was 46.6 (range of 1 standard deviation, 26.9-81.5) for those with pets vs. 27.2 (13.8-53.6) for those without pets (P < 0.001).

Pet ownership increased the FeNO levels and asthma severity, regardless of pet sensitization status, in children with atopic asthma. Exposure to pets could increase airway inflammation and disease severity even in atopic asthmatic children who are not sensitized to pets.",

Indirect costs, including expenditures on complementary and alternative medicines, and the economic impact of an impaired quality of life (intangible costs) were estimated by surveying 660 asthmatics, and these estimates were transformed to the national level using the prevalence of asthma.The prevalence of asthma and total costs related to the disease in 2004 were 4.19% and $2.04 billion, respectively. Direct costs and indirect costs contributed equally to total costs (46.9% and 53.1%, respectively). However, when intangible costs were included, total costs rose to $4.11 billion, which was equivalent to 0.44% of the national gross domestic product in 2004.The results provide evidence that asthma is a major health cost factor in the Republic of Korea and that intangible costs associated with asthma are significant cost drivers.",

Although the pathogenic mechanisms of CU are not clearly understood, several groups have suggested that genetic mechanisms are involved in various CU cohorts. To further understand the molecular genetic mechanisms of CU, we summarize recent genetic data in this review. Although a few HLA alleles were suggested to be candidate markers in different ethnic groups, further replication studies that apply the recent classification are needed. Genetic polymorphisms in histamine-related genes, including FcεRI and HNMT, were suggested to be involved in mast cell activation and histamine metabolism. Several genetic polymorphisms of leukotriene-related genes, such as ALOX5, LTC4S, and the PGE2 receptor gene PTGER4, were suggested to be involved in leukotriene overproduction, a pathogenic mechanism. Further investigations using candidate gene approaches and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) will provide new insights into the molecular genetic mechanisms of CU, which will provide new marker genes for differentiation of CU phenotypes and identification of potential therapeutic targets.",

Bee pollen-induced anaphylaxis has rarely been reported, and its allergenic components have never been studied. A 40-year-old male came to the emergency room with generalized urticaria, facial edema, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea 1 hour after ingesting one tablespoon of bee pollen. Oxygen saturation was 91%. His symptoms resolved after injection of epinephrine, chlorpheniramine, and dexamethasone. He had seasonal allergic rhinitis in autumn. Microscopic examination of the bee pollen revealed Japanese hop, chrysanthemum, ragweed, and dandelion pollens. Skin-prick with bee pollen extracts showed positive reactions at 0.1 mg/mL (A/H ratio > 3+). Serum specific IgE to ragweed was 25.2, chrysanthemum 20.6, and dandelion 11.4 kU/L; however, Japanese hop, honey-bee venom and yellow-jacket venom were negative (UniCAP®, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Uppsala, Sweden). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) confirmed serum specific IgE to bee-pollen extracts, and an ELISA inhibition assay for evaluation of cross-allergenicity of bee pollen and other weed pollens showed more than 90% of inhibition with chrysanthemum and dandelion and ~40% inhibition with ragweed at a concentration of 1 μg/mL. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and IgE-immunoblot analysis revealed 9 protein bands (11, 14, 17, 28, 34, 45, 52, 72, and 90 kDa) and strong IgE binding at 28-34 kDa, 45 and 52 kDa. In conclusion, healthcare providers should be aware of the potential risk of severe allergic reactions upon ingestion of bee pollen, especially in patients with pollen allergy.",

This study aimed to investigate the sensitization profiles of Korean HDM allergic subjects suffering from respiratory allergy and atopic dermatitis (AD) to Der f 1, Der f 2, Der f 6, Der f 8, Der f 10, and Der f 20. Recombinant HDM allergens were produced in Pichia pastoris (Der f 1) or Escherichia coli (5 allergens). IgE reactivity to the individual recombinant allergens and total extract of mite was assessed by ELISA. Der f 1 was recognized by 79.1%, Der f 2 by 79.1%, Der f 6 by 9.3%, Der f 8 by 6.2%, Der f 10 by 6.2%, and Der f 20 by 6.6% of the patients' sera tested, while the prevalence of IgE reactivity to total mite extract was 94.7%. Combination of Der f 1 and Der f 2 had a sensitivity of 87.6%. Specific IgE to Der f 2 alone was detected from 89.4% of HDM-sensitized respiratory allergy subjects and 92.3% to the combination of the 2 major allergens Der f 1 and Der f 2. However, sera from fewer patients with AD, namely 72.4% and 71.0%, recognized Der f 1 and Der f 2, respectively. The combination of 2 major allergens allowed diagnosis of 84.5% of the AD patients. No correlation between sensitization to specific allergens and HDM allergy entity was found. Der f 2 was the most frequently sensitized allergen among the HDM-sensitized respiratory and AD patients in Korea, and the combination of the group 1 and 2 major allergens increased the diagnostic sensitivity. Minor allergens did not significantly improve diagnostic sensitivity. However, further studies are needed to analyze the relationship between sensitization to other HDM allergens and the disease entity of the HDM allergy.",

In the meanwhile, there has been a long debate on the efficacy of SIT in atopic dermatitis (AD) with only a few double-blind placebo-controlled trials. However, several randomized controlled trials of SIT in AD revealed significant improvement of clinical symptoms and also, positive result was shown by a following meta-analysis study of these trials. In order to predict and evaluate the treatment outcome, finding a biomarker that can predict treatment responses and treatment end-points is critical but it is very challenging at the same time due to the complexity of causes and mechanisms of AD. Other considerations including standardization of the easiest and safest treatment protocol and optimizing the treatment preparations should be studied as well. This review summarizes the basics of SIT in AD including the brief mechanisms, treatment methods and schedules, and also highlights the clinical efficacy of SIT in AD along with mild, controllable adverse reactions. Immunologic effects and studies of various biomarkers are also introduced and finally, future considerations with upcoming studies on SIT were discussed.",

Gut microbiota play an important role in the development of the immune system, and an imbalance in these organisms can affect health, including an increased risk of allergic diseases. Microbial colonization of young infants is affected by the delivery mode at birth and the consequent alterations of gut microbiota in early life affect the development of allergic diseases. We investigated the effects of the delivery mode on the temporal dynamics of gut microbiota in healthy Korean infants. Fecal samples were collected at 1-3 days, 1 month, and 6 months after birth in six healthy infants. Microbiota were characterized by 16S rRNA shotgun sequencing. At the first and third days of life, infants born by vaginal delivery showed a higher richness and diversity of gut microbiota compared with those born by cesarean section. However, these differences disappeared with age. The Bacteroides genus and Bacteroidetes phylum were abundant in infants born by vaginal delivery, whereas Bacilli and Clostridium g4 were increased in infants born by cesarean section. The Firmicutes phylum and Bacteroides genus showed convergent dynamics with age. This study demonstrated the effect of delivery mode on the dynamics of gut microbiota profiles in healthy Korean infants.",

Serum total tryptase was obtained at baseline and 60 min (peak) after the onset of symptoms.Thirty-nine patients were challenged. There were 12 patients with anaphylaxis, 20 with mild reactions and 7 without symptoms (control group). Characteristic features and baseline tryptase were not different among the 3 groups.

    "abstract": "Lovastatin is an effective inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis. A previous study demonstrated that lovastatin can also suppress airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in murine model of asthma. We aimed to investigate the effect of lovastatin on mucus secretion and inflammation-associated gene expression in the lungs of murine model of asthma. Female BALB/c mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA) by intraperitoneal injection, and orally administered lovastatin from days 14 to 27 post-injection. Gene expression in lung tissues was analyzed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. AHR and goblet cell hyperplasia were also examined. BEAS-2B human bronchial epithelial cells were used to evaluate the effect of lovastatin on the expression of cell adhesion molecules, chemokines, and proinflammatory cytokines in vitro. We showed that lovastatin inhibits the expression of Th2-associated genes, including eotaxins and adhesion molecules, in the lungs of murine model of asthma. Mucin 5AC expression, eosinophil infiltration and goblet cell hyperplasia were significantly decreased in the lung tissue of murine model of asthma treated with lovastatin. Furthermore, lovastatin inhibited AHR and expression of Th2-associated cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. However, a high dose (40 mg/kg) of lovastatin was required to decrease specific IgE to OVA levels in serum, and suppress the expression of Th2-associated cytokines in splenocytes. Activated BEAS-2B cells treated with lovastatin exhibited reduced IL-6, eotaxins (CCL11 and CCL24), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 protein expression. Consistent with this, lovastatin also suppressed the ability of HL-60 cells to adhere to inflammatory BEAS-2B cells. These data suggest that lovastatin suppresses mucus secretion and airway inflammation by inhibiting the production of eotaxins and Th2 cytokines in murine model of asthma.",

Mepolizumab (300 mg/4 weeks) has recently been approved for EGPA. However, real-life data are scarce and report experiences with high doses of mepolizumab intravenously administered (750 mg/4 weeks). The aim of our study was to investigate in a real-life setting whether mepolizumab in EGPA patients at low doses would enable us 1) to control asthma symptoms, 2) to obtain oral corticosteroids (OCS) and/or immunosuppressors tapering and 3) to maintain clinical remission and avoid disease relapses. Mepolizumab (100 mg/4 weeks) was subcutaneously administered for 12 months in 18 EGPA patients with uncontrolled severe asthma. Symptoms, annual asthma exacerbation rates, OCS-sparing effects, lung function and eosinophil activation markers were monitored. The proportion of patients with clinical remission or relapse was also evaluated in month 12. A significant decrease in the annual rate of asthma exacerbations in association with significant changes in asthma control were observed. Specifically, 66.6% of the patients experienced no exacerbations during the mepolizumab treatment. Most patients (77.7%) were able to reduce the daily OCS dose by at least 50%. Four patients also stopped cyclosporine A during the study period. No EGPA relapse was observed and a large majority of the patients achieved clinical remission (94.3%). Clinical benefits were paralleled by reduction in blood eosinophils and serum levels of eosinophil activation markers. Low-dose mepolizumab showed clinically relevant benefits in exacerbation rates, asthma symptoms, OCS and immunosuppressive use in EGPA patients. These effects occurred without any EGPA relapse for extrapulmonary manifestations.",

In the airway, although NK cells constitute a small proportion of the resident lymphocytes, they play an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory airway diseases by modulating immune responses. NK cells can promote allergic airway inflammation by increasing the production of type 2 cytokines and inducing eosinophil migration. The increased activity of NK cells can develop or aggravate the destruction of lung parenchymal cells. On the other hand, decreased apoptotic activity of NK cells in eosinophils can serve as an aggravating factor for allergic airway inflammation. The increase in interferon-γ-producing NK cells and the inhibition of type 2 immune response by NK cells can alleviate allergic airway inflammation. This review aims to define the roles of NK cells in chronic inflammatory diseases of lower and upper airways.",

We sought to investigate whether MRGPRX2 levels in the sera from CSU patients differ from those in healthy control subjects and to evaluate the clinical utility of MRGPRX2 levels in CSU patients. Severe CSU was defined as urticaria activity score over 7 days (UAS7) ≥ 28. Serum samples from 116 (73 severe and 43 non-severe) CSU patients and 50 healthy subjects were screened for MRGPRX2 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum MRGPRX2 levels were significantly higher in patients with severe CSU (median [interquartile range], 16.5 [10.8-24.8]) than in healthy controls (11.7 [6.5-21.2], P = 0.036) and in non-severe CSU patients (8.7 [4.5-18.8], P = 0.002), although they did not differ between healthy subjects and non-severe CSU patients. Serum MRGPRX2 levels in CSU patients showed positive correlations with UAS7 and specific IgE against Dermatophagoides farinae in CSU subjects, whereas no correlations were observed for age, sex, urticaria duration, atopy, combined angioedema, autologous serum skin test positivity, or total IgE levels. Logistic regression analysis identified serum MRGPRX2 ≥ 12 ng/mL (odds ratio, 6.421; P = 0.002) as an independent risk factor for severe CSU, along with increased serum total IgE levels, peripheral basophil percentage, and angioedema. In conclusion, we suggest that serum MRGPRX2 could help indicate severe CSU.",

    "abstract": "The real-world management and clinical characteristics of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in Hong Kong and its implications for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination are unknown. We investigated the clinical characteristics of patients with CSU and the role of an immunologist-led Urticaria Clinic as well as the impact of CSU on COVID-19 vaccine uptake in Hong Kong.Longitudinal clinical data of 257 CSU patients were collected and analyzed. Association analyses were performed to identify the relationships between variables and factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine uptake.After the immunologist review, the Weekly Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7) was significantly lower than baseline (median: 0.00 vs. 12.0, P < 0.001). Changes in UAS7 were significantly greater among patients with baseline UAS7 ≥ 16 compared to those with UAS7 < 16 (median: -24.0 vs. -2.00, P < 0.001). CSU patients had lower COVID-19 vaccination rates than the general population with only 176 (68.5%) and 165 (65.0%) receiving at least one dose and 2 doses of vaccination, respectively. The presence of concomitant suspected drug allergy was associated with lower COVID-19 vaccine uptake (odds ratio [OR], 0.47; P = 0.010), while regular pharmacological treatment was associated with higher COVID-19 vaccine uptake among CSU patients (OR, 3.79; P = 0.010).A dedicated immunologist-led Urticaria Clinic may effectively improve CSU management and outcomes in Hong Kong.",

    "abstract": "Food allergy (FA) has become more prevalent and problematic in the last 2 decades, and it poses important individual, social, and economic burdens. Besides treating reactions induced by accidental exposure and periodic evaluation for acquiring natural tolerance, the primary management approach is still allergen avoidance as a global standard. However, an active therapeutic approach that can raise the reaction threshold or accelerate tolerance is needed. This review aimed to provide an overview and the latest evidence of oral immunotherapy (OIT), which has recently been used in the active treatment of FA. FA immunotherapy, particularly OIT, is gaining considerable interest, and substantial effort has been made to integrate this active treatment into clinical practice. Consequently, growing evidence has been obtained regarding the efficacy and safety of OIT, particularly for allergens such as peanuts, eggs, and milk. However, several issues need to be addressed regarding the availability, safety, and long-term effects of this intervention. In this review, we summarize currently available information regarding tolerance-inducing immune mechanisms of OIT, data on efficacy and safety, gaps in current evidence, and ongoing research to develop new therapeutic molecules in order to enhance safety.",

    "abstract": "Atopic diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD) are very common in industrialized countries. Up to 15%-30% of all children and 2%-10% of all adults suffer from AD. Already in early disease stages, a defective epidermal barrier is known to contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. Central elements in the epidermal barrier are antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which are secreted by keratinocytes, sweat gland cells but also infiltrating immune cells. AMPs function as endogenous antibiotics and are able to kill bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Furthermore AMPs act as immune modulators with effects on the innate and adaptive immune system. The probably best studied AMPs in human skin are the defensins and cathelicidin. In atopic diseases the functions of AMPs such as cathelicidin might be impaired and microbial superinfections could serve as cofactors for allergic sensitization. Hence, induction of AMPs could be beneficial in these patients. Cathelicidin which is often referred to its peptide form hCAP18 or LL-37 can be induced by ultraviolet light B (UVB) irradiation and is upregulated in infected and injured skin. The cathelicidin gene carries a vitamin D response element and the vitamin D pathway could therefore be targeted for cathelicidin regulation. As the development and course of atopic diseases might be influenced by vitamin D signaling these pathomechanisms could explain the growing evidence connecting vitamin D to allergic diseases, including AD, allergic rhinitis, food allergies and asthma. In this review the role of vitamin D and the AMP cathelicidin in the pathogenesis of atopic diseases with impaired barrier function will be discussed.",

In addition to specific immunological mechanisms where specific antibodies or sensitised T cells participate, release of inflammatory mediators by non-specific immunological recognition may also occur. Within this category are one of the most common groups of drugs, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In addition to chemical drugs new emerging ones with an increasing protagonism are biological agents like humanised antibodies and others. For IgE dependent reactions both in vivo and in vitro tests can be used for the immunological evaluation. Sensitivity of these is not optimal and very often a drug provocation test must be considered for knowing the mechanism involved and/or establishing the diagnosis. For non-immediate reactions also both in vivo and in vitro tests can be used. Sensitivity for in vivo tests is generally low and in vitro tests may be needed for the immunological evaluation. Immunohistochemical studies of the affected tissue enable a more precise classification of non-immediate reactions. The monitorization of the acute response of the reactions has given clues for understanding these reactions and has promising results for the future of the immunological evaluation of HDR.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways associated with structural changes and airway remodeling. Interleukin (IL)-9 has pleiotropic effects on both inflammatory cells and airway structural cells, which are involved in asthma pathogenesis. We evaluated the effects of IL-9 blockade on chronic airway inflammation.Acute airway inflammation was induced in Balb/c mice using aerosolized ovalbumin (OVA), whereas chronic asthma was induced by OVA exposure for 5 weeks with anti-IL-9 or isotype-matched antibody (Ab) treatment during the OVA challenge. Inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were counted and lung tissues were stained to detect cellular infiltration, mucus deposition, and collagen accumulation. The levels of interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-17, and immunoglobulin E (IgE) in BALF were measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays, and profiles of inflammatory cells and subsets of T helper (Th) cells were analyzed using flow cytometry.IL-9, IL-17, and IFN-γ levels were significantly increased in the chronic group compared to the acute asthma group. However, the number of IL-9-positive cells was not affected, with a decrease in Th17 cells in OVA-challenged caspase-1 knockout mice. Numbers of eosinophils, neutrophils, B cells, mast cells, and Th17 cells decreased after administration of anti-IL-9 Ab. Total IgE, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-17 levels were also lower in the anti-IL-9 group.Our results suggest that anti-IL-9 Ab treatment inhibits pulmonary infiltration of inflammatory cells and cytokine production, especially IL-17. These results provide a basis for the use of an anti-IL-9 Ab to combat IL-17-mediated airway inflammation.",

However, a recent study showed that the antigenic activity of ovomucoid could be reduced by heating when egg white (EW) was mixed with wheat flour. This study was performed to determine the influence of wheat flour on the antigenic activities of EW proteins when EW is heated, and the influence of the duration of heat treatment.A mixture of EW and wheat flour was kneaded for 10 minutes and then baked at 180℃ for 10 minutes and 30 minutes. The EW without wheat flour was also heated at 180℃ for 10 minutes and 30 minutes. The proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and IgE immunoblotting was performed with the pooled sera of 5 egg-allergic patients. The antigenic activities of ovomucoid in different EW samples were measured by inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).1) SDS-PAGE: the intensity of the 37-50 kD bands (overlapped bands of ovomucoid and ovalbumin) decreased significantly in the mixture of EW and wheat flour baked for 30 minutes, compared with the mixture baked for 10 minutes, heated EW and raw EW. 2) IgE immunoblot: in the mixture of EW and wheat, a remarkable decrease of IgE reactivity to 37-50 kD was observed when baked for 30 minutes. 3) Inhibition ELISA: the antigenic activity of ovomucoid decreased significantly in the mixture of EW and wheat baked for 30 minutes, but not in the heated pure EW.This study showed that the antigenic activity of ovomucoid can be reduced by baking EW with wheat flour. The decrease in ovomucoid antigenicity in the baked mixture of EW and wheat flour was dependent on the time of heat treatment, indicating that heating should be prolonged to achieve a reduction in ovomucoid antigenic activity.",

    "abstract": "Although the role of eosinophils in eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EGE) is not fully understood, they are believed to be a principal effector cell. Previous studies have demonstrated that eotaxin and its specific receptor, cysteine-cysteine chemokine receptor-3 (CCR3), play a central role in eosinophil trafficking into the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Thus, we examined the targeting of CCR3 as a potential therapeutic intervention for EGE in a mouse model. Eight- to 10-week-old BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally sensitized and intragastrically challenged with ovalbumin (OVA). Different groups of mice were administered either an anti-CCR3 antibody or a control IgG by intraperitoneal injection 1 hour before each OVA challenge. Eosinophilic inflammation in the intestinal mucosa, mucosal injury, and severity of diarrhea were compared between different groups at 1 hour after final OVA challenge. Anti-CCR3 antibody reduced the number of eosinophils in peripheral blood and intestinal mucosa, but not in bone marrow. This reduction was associated with restoration of reduced villous crypt ratio, increased intestinal epithelial cell proliferation, and weight loss induced by OVA challenge. However, Anti-CCR3 antibody had no effect on the level of OVA specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) and the expression of critical chemokines or cytokines in eosinophil trafficking into the GI tract, such as eotaxin-1, interleukin (IL)-5, and IL-13. Anti-CCR3 antibody significantly reduced the severity of eosinophilic inflammation, mucosal injury, and diarrhea in a mouse model of food allergen-induced GI eosinophilic inflammation. CCR3 may be a novel therapeutic target for treatment of EGE and other GI eosinophil-mediated diseases.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a complex disease, with contributions from multiple genes, various genetic backgrounds, and environmental factors. Many human epidemiological studies have demonstrated that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Toll-like receptor (TLR) genes are inconsistently associated with asthma risk. Some have demonstrated differences concerning the study design and effect size, and conflicting results have been reported. A meta-analysis is necessary to determine the magnitude of this association. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines, a systematic search and meta-analysis of the literature was conducted to estimate the association of SNPs in TLR genes with asthma risk. We screened the medical literature based on the following keyword searches in MEDLINE and EMBASE databases: 'TLR', 'polymorphism', 'asthma', and their combinations. Meta-analysis of eight studies on TLR4 Asp299Gly showed a marginal association of TLR4 with asthma risk (odds ratio [OR]=0.814 [95% confidence interval [CI], 0.652-1.016; P=0.069]) in the recessive model. TLR4 Thr399Ile was not associated with asthma risk under any genetic model. Meta-analysis of four studies on TLR2 Arg753Gln indicated that TLR2 might be significantly associated with asthma in the dominant and codominant models (P=0.029, P=0.030, and P=0.009, respectively). TLR9 -1237 was marginally associated with asthma risk (OR=0.408 [95% CI, 0.163-1.021; P=0.065]) in the codominant model. Analysis using the allele contrast model showed that the major TLR9 -1237 T allele tended to be a significant protective factor with OR=0.689 (95% CI, 0.471-1.007; P=0.055). The results showed that TLR4 Asp299Gly, TLR2 Arg753Gln, and TLR9-1237 might contribute significantly to asthma susceptibility. Future genetic association studies would consolidate these findings.",

    "abstract": "Factors that can induce the release of histamine from basophils have been studied for more than 30 years. A protein termed histamine-releasing factor (HRF) was purified and molecularly cloned in 1995. HRF can stimulate histamine release and IL-4 and IL-13 production from IgE-sensitized basophils and mast cells. HRF-like activities were found in bodily fluids during the late phase of allergic reactions, implicating HRF in allergic diseases. However, definitive evidence for the role of HRF in allergic diseases has remained elusive. On the other hand, we found effects of monomeric IgE on the survival and activation of mast cells without the involvement of a specific antigen, as well as heterogeneity of IgEs in their ability to cause such effects. The latter property of IgE molecules seemed to be similar to the heterogeneity of IgEs in their ability to prime basophils in response to HRF. This similarity led to our recent finding that ~30% of IgE molecules can bind to HRF via their Fab interactions with two binding sites within the HRF molecule. The use of peptide inhibitors that block HRF-IgE interactions revealed an essential role of HRF to promote skin hypersensitivity and airway inflammation. This review summarizes this and more recent findings and provides a perspective on how they impact our understanding of allergy pathogenesis and potentially change the treatment of allergic diseases.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy to induce clinical desensitization to cow's milk (CM) of an oral immunotherapy (OIT) protocol in a pediatric population with cow's milk allergy (CMA). In addition, the immune responses against β-casein, of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from CMA patients, before and after the protocol were evaluated and compared to a nonallergic population.A group of 20 children with IgE-mediated CMA and 15 nonallergic children were recruited. Allergic subjects underwent an OIT protocol based on weekly doses of commercial semi-skimmed ultra-high temperature treated (UHT) CM, followed by a maintenance phase. Immune profiles and changes in all subjects were investigated by measuring Th1, Th2, and Treg cytokines, transcription factors, and specific IgE and IgG4 levels.The CM-OIT protocol enabled to desensitize 70% of the allergic patients. Successful OIT was accompanied by significant increases in casein-specific IgG4 levels, together with a reduction in the concentration of antigen-specific IgE and in IL-5, IL-13, and IL-10 production by β-casein-stimulated PBMCs. Baseline significant differences observed between allergic and nonallergic children in IL-13 and IL-5 levels were no longer found once the protocol had finished.The OIT protocol was safe and effective in inducing milk desensitization in 70% of the children with CMA, leading to alterations in their immune profiles toward a nonallergic phenotype.",

    "abstract": "A pollen/food-associated syndrome (PFAS) has been described between peach and cypress pollen. Cross-reactive allergens were characterized which belong to the Gibberellin-regulated protein (GRP) family, BP14 in cypress pollen and Pru p 7 in peach. GRP are small cationic protein with anti-microbial properties. A patient suffering from a peach/cypress syndrome was explored clinically and biologically using 2 types of immunoglobulin E (IgE) multiarray microchip, immunoblots and a basophil activation test to assess the clinical relevance of various extracts and purified allergens from fruits or cypress pollen. In addition to PR10 sensitization, the patient showed specific IgE to Pru p 7, BP14 and allergen from pomegranate. These last 3 allergens and allergenic sources are able to induce ex vivo basophil activation characterized by the monitoring of the expression of CD63 and CD203c, both cell surface markers correlated with a basophil mediator release. Up to 100% of cells expressed CD203c at 50 ng/mL of BP14 protein. In contrast, snakin-1, a GRP from potato sharing 82% sequence identity with Pru p 7 did not activate patient's basophils. These results strongly suggest that, like Pru p 7, BP14 is a clinically relevant allergenic GRP from pollen. Allergen members of this newly described protein family are good candidates for PFAS where no cross-reactive allergens have been characterized.",

However, whether miRs were involved in allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT) remains largely unknown. This study sought to examine changes in miR-146a and T regulatory cells in children with persistent allergic rhinitis (AR) after 3 months of subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) and sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT).Twenty-four HDM-sensitized children with persistent AR were enrolled and treated with SCIT (n=13) or SLIT (n=11) for 3 months. Relative miR-146a and Foxp3 mRNA expression, the TRAF6 protein level, and the ratio of post-treatment to baseline IL-10+CD4+ T cells between the SCIT and SLIT groups were examined in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of AR patients using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), flow cytometry, and Western blot analysis, respectively. Serum levels of IL-5 and IL-10 were determined using ELISA.After 3 months of SIT, both the TNSS and INSS scores were significantly decreased compared to the baseline value (P<0.01). The relative expression of miR-146a and Foxp3 mRNA was significantly increased after both SCIT and SLIT (P<0.01). The ratio of post-treatment to baseline IL-10⁺CD4⁺ T cells and the serum IL-10 level were significantly increased in both the SCIT and SLIT groups (P<0.01), whereas the TRAF6 protein level and serum IL-5 level were significantly decreased (P<0.01). No significant differences in these biomarkers were observed between the SCIT and SLIT groups.Our findings suggest that miR-146a and its related biomarkers may be comparably modulated after both SCIT and SLIT, highlighting miR-146a as a potential therapeutic target for the improved management of AR.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Chitin is a potent adjuvant in the development of immune response to inhaled allergens in the airways.According to other studies, chitin is known as multi-faced adjuvants which can induce Th2 responses.Recently, we found that TNF-α is a key mediator in the development of Th2 cell response to inhaled allergens.Here, we evaluated the immunologic mechanisms in the development of airway hypersensitivity to inhaled allergens, enhanced by house dust mite (HDM)-derived chitin.Methods: The role of TNF-α and TLRs was evaluated in an airway hypersensitivity mouse model induced by a sensitization with an allergen (ovalbumin, OVA) and HDM-derived chitin using mice with the null mutation of target genes.Results: The present study showed that airway sensitization with HDM-derived chitin plus OVA enhanced OVA-induced airway inflammation v. OVA alone.This phenotype was associated with the increased expression of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines and also with the enhanced production of OVA-specific IgE, IgG1, and IgG2a.As for T cell responses, OVA-specific Th2 cell response, enhanced by chitin, was abolished by the treatment of chitinase, whereas Th1 and Th17 cell responses enhanced by this treatment.Moreover, the null mutation of the TNF-α gene revealed similar effects as the chitinase treatment.In contrast, all the OVA-specific T cell responses, enhanced by chitin, were blocked by the absence of TLR2, but not of TLR1, TLR4, or TLR6.Conclusions: In conclusion, these data suggest that HDM-derived chitin may enhance airway hypersensitivity to inhaled allergens, via the TLR2-dependent pathway, and that chitin-induced TNF-α can be a key mediator in the development of Th2 cell response to inhaled allergens.",

However, the effect of allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) on ILCs remains to be clarified. The aim of this study was to evaluate the levels of ILC subsets in allergic rhinitis (AR) patients in response to house dust mite (HDM)-specific immunotherapy.We enrolled 37 AR patients undergoing AIT (16 responders and 11 non-responders) for 2 years, 35 HDM AR patients and 28 healthy subjects. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were analyzed by flow cytometry to identify ILC subsets. Stimulation of ILC2s with recombinant allergen-specific protein was used to determine ILC2's activation (CD69 expression).Responder AIT patients and healthy subjects had a decreased frequency of circulating ILC2s compared to non-responder AIT and AR patients. Conversely, ILC1s from responder AIT patients and healthy subjects showed increased frequency compared to non-responder AIT and AR patients. The frequency of ILC3s natural cytotoxicity receptor (NCR)⁺ and NCR⁻ in responder AIT patients was significantly lower compared to AR patients and healthy subjects. The ILC1: ILC2 proportion in responder AIT patients was similar to that of healthy subjects. PBMCs from patients who were responders to AIT had a significantly lower expression of the activation marker CD69 on ILC2s in response to allergen re-stimulation compared to AR patients, but no difference compared to non-responder AIT patients and healthy subjects.We propose that AIT might affect ILC responses. The activation of ILC2s was reduced in AR patients treated with AIT. Our results indicate that a relative ILC1/ILC2 skewed response is a possible key to successful AIT.",

We ran 3 analytical models after adjusting for confounding factors including age, sex, the number of visits to healthcare providers, income, and the place of residence (urban/rural).Allergic diseases were most common in male children and those aged < 10 years (atopic dermatitis, asthma and allergic rhinitis; all P < 0.01). Also, urban residents with higher incomes were more likely to develop allergic diseases (all P < 0.01). The annual number of days on which antibiotics were prescribed differed significantly between subjects with each allergic disease studied and a comparison group (all P < 0.01). Multiple logistic regression showed that as the duration of antibiotic exposure increased, the incidences of atopic dermatitis, asthma, and allergic rhinitis trended upward, even after adjusting for confounding factors (P for trend < 0.01).Antibiotic use early in life is associated with an increased risk of allergic disease, especially in young children; the risk increases as the duration of antibiotic therapy rises. Moreover, urban residence was more strongly associated with a longer duration of antibiotic use than was rural residence.",

The aim of the study was to evaluate if allergic asthma phenotype is associated with altered sphingolipid metabolism.Twenty-two HDM-allergic asthmatic patients and 11 HDM-allergic rhinitis patients were challenged intrabronchially with biologically standardized Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus extract. Whole blood and platelet-poor plasma samples were collected before, during early asthmatic response (EAR), late asthmatic response (LAR) and 24 hours after the challenge. Concentrations of sphinganine (SFA), sphinganine-1-phosphate (SFA1P), ceramide, sphingosine (SFO) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) were measured using high performance liquid chromatography.In all house dust mite-allergic patients (HDM-APs), baseline lung function and severity of airway hyperreactivity (AHR) correlated significantly with plasma S1P and SFA1P concentrations. Exhaled nitric oxide concentration, however, correlated with SFA and ceramide, but not with S1P or SFA1P concentration. Allergen challenge increased plasma S1P concentration during EAR, but only in patients who developed both EAR and LAR. The magnitude of the increase determined during EAR correlated with the severity of subsequently developed LAR. Platelet and eosinophil counts were independent predictors of plasma S1P concentration. A significant increase in plasma SFA concentration in response to allergen challenge was seen only in patients who did not develop asthmatic response.Altered sphingolipid metabolism, with augmented synthesis of S1P and impaired de novo sphingolipid synthesis in response to allergen challenge, may participate in the development of asthma phenotype in HDM-APs.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between obesity and AD in Korean young adults.We included nationally representative data of 5,202 Korean adults aged 19-40 years, obtained from the cross-sectional Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2008-2010.Single (unmarried) status was more frequently observed in AD patients (male, [P=0.0002] and female, [P<0.0001]). AD prevalence exhibited a U-shape trend in relation to body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and total body fat (BF) percentage, especially in young adult women. Women with BMI ≥25 kg/m², WC ≥80 cm, and highest quartile (Q4) of total BF percentage had the highest prevalence of AD. The odds ratio (OR) for participants with both BMI ≥25 kg/m² and WC ≥80 cm was 3.29 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.71-3.55); therefore, having both general and abdominal obesity was considered a prominent risk factor for AD in young women. After adjustment for confounding factors, including age, smoking, alcohol drinking, exercise, vitamin D, income level, and single status, high BMI (≥30 kg/m²) (OR=4.08, 95% CI: 1.53-10.93), high WC (≥80 cm) (OR=2.05, 95% CI: 1.07-3.94), and high BF percentage (Q4) (OR=2.10, 95% CI: 1.24-3.57) were shown to be significantly associated with AD in young adult women.In this large-scale nation-wide study of Korean adults, obesity was positively related to the presence of AD in women. Our findings suggest that weight management may help prevent AD.",

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of selective NF-κB inhibition using NF-κB decoy oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) for the local treatment of AR in ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized wild-type mice. BALB/c mice were sensitized with OVA and alum, and then challenged intranasally with OVA. NF-κB decoy ODNs were given intranasally to the treatment group, and NF-κB scrambled ODNs were given to the sham treatment group. Allergic symptom scores, eosinophil infiltration, cytokine levels in the nasal mucosa, nasal lavage fluid, and spleen cell culture, serum total and OVA-specific immunoglobulins, as well as intercellular adhesion molecure-1 (ICAM-1) in the nasal mucosa, were analyzed. NF-κB decoy ODNs significantly reduced allergic symptoms and eosinophil infiltration in the nasal mucosa. They also suppressed serum levels of total IgE, OVA-specific IgE, and IgG1. IL-5 and TNF-α levels and the expression of ICAM-1 were decreased in the nasal mucosa of the treatment group compared to the positive control and sham treatment groups. In addition, IL-6 levels were significantly decreased in the nasal lavage fluid of the treatment group. Furthermore, NF-κB decoy ODNs significantly reduced expression of the systemic Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-5 in spleen cell culture. This study demonstrates for the first time that local NF-κB inhibition using NF-κB decoy ODNs suppressed the allergic response in a murine AR model. This shows the therapeutic potential of local NF-κB inhibition in the control of AR.",

    "abstract": "Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) to antiepileptic drug (AED), are rare, but result in significant morbidity and mortality. We investigated the major culprit drugs, clinical characteristics, and clinical course and outcomes of AED-induced SCARs using a nationwide registry in Korea.A total of 161 patients with AED-induced SCARs from 28 referral hospitals were analyzed. The causative AEDs, clinical characteristics, organ involvements, details of treatment, and outcomes were evaluated. We compared the clinical and laboratory parameters between SJS/TEN and DRESS according to the leading causative drugs. We further determined risk factors for prolonged hospitalization in AED-induced SCARs.Carbamazepine and lamotrigine were the most common culprit drugs causing SCARs. Valproic acid and levetiracetam also emerged as the major causative agents. The disease duration and hospital stay in carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN were shorter than those in other AEDs (P< 0.05, respectively). In younger patients, lamotrigine caused higher incidences of DRESS than other drugs (P= 0.045). Carbamazepine, the most common culprit drug for SCARs, was associated with a favorable outcome related with prolonged hospitalization in SJS (odds ratio, 0.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.02-0.63, P= 0.12), and thrombocytopenia was found to be a risk factor for prolonged hospitalization in DRESS.This was the first large-scale epidemiological study of AED-induced SCARs in Korea. Valproic acid and levetiracetam were the significant emerging AEDs causing SCARs in addition to the well-known offending AEDs such as carbamazepine and lamotrigine. Carbamazepine was associated with reduced hospitalization, but thrombocytopenia was a risk factor for prolonged hospitalization. Our results suggest that the clinical characteristics and clinical courses of AED-induced SCARs might vary according to the individual AEDs.",

Among these, the role of rising carbon dioxide (CO₂) and temperature in aeroallergen exposure and associated changes in the start, duration and intensity of the pollen season, and associated consequences in aeroallergens and allergic disease are a primary concern. This review is intended to provide a synopsis of CO₂ and climate factors associated with likely changes in aeroallergen biology (indoor and outdoor), including changes in the demography of flowering plants, pollen seasonality, aeroallergen production, and potential biotic and abiotic interactions. These factors, in turn, are compared to clinical trials that have linked aeroallergens to allergic disease and associated health impacts. Finally, suggestions to address unmet needs and critical knowledge gaps are offered. Such recommendations are not meant to be inclusive, but to serve as a spur for the additional research and resources that will be necessary to acquire a better understanding of climate change, CO₂, aeroallergens and associated allergic diseases.

We aimed to identify and evaluate DILI with an appropriate screening algorithm.We collected data from 3 university hospitals between June 2015 and May 2016 using our newly developed algorithm for identifying DILI. Among patients with alanine transferase (ALT) ≤ 120 IU/L and total bilirubin (TB) ≤ 2.4 mg/dL in blood test results within 48 hours of admission, those who either had 1) ALT > 120 IU/L and TB > 2.4 mg/dL or 2) ALT > 200 IU/L at least once during hospitalization were identified. After excluding patients with liver disease-related diagnosis at discharge, medical records were retrospectively reviewed to evaluate epidemiological characteristics of DILI.The total number of inpatients was 256,598, of whom 1,100 (0.43%) were selected by the algorithm as suspected DILI. Subsequently, 365 cases (0.14% of total inpatients, 95% confidence interval, 0.13-0.16) were identified as DILI, yielding a positive predictive value of 33.1%. Antibiotics (n = 214, 47.2%) were the major class of causative drug followed by chemotherapeutic agents (n = 87, 19.2%). The most common causative drug was piperacillin-tazobactam (n = 38, 8.4%); the incidence of DILI by individual agent was highest for methotrexate (19.4 cases/1,000 patients administered the drug). Common reasons for excluding suspected DILI cases were ischemic hepatitis and postoperative liver dysfunction.Using our EHR-based algorithm, we identified that approximately 0.14% of patients developed DILI during hospitalization. Further studies are needed to modify criteria for more accurate identification of DILI.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Exposure to particulate matter (PM) is a key public health issue, but effective intervention has not yet been established. A systematic literature review and meta-analysis has been conducted to assess the relationship between the use of air filters, one of the most commonly studied interventions, and respiratory outcomes in patients with chronic respiratory diseases. Methods We systematically reviewed intervention studies on PM using PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases up to September 2019. Studies that included data on PM concentration changes and respiratory symptoms or lung function in patients with respiratory diseases were eligible for inclusion. Effect estimates were quantified separately using the random-effects model. Results Six studies were included in the quantitative analysis. Air filter use reduced indoor PM2.5 by 11.45 µg/m3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.88, 16.01 µg/m3). Air filter use was not associated with improvements in respiratory symptoms in 5 of the 6 studies or significant changes in the predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (mean change, -1.77%; 95% CI, -8.25%, 4.71%). Air filter use was associated with improved peak expiratory flow rate by 5.86 (95% CI, 3.5, 8.19 of standardized difference). Conclusions The findings of this systematic review suggest that air filters may reduce indoor PM and increase peak expiratory rate in asthmatic patients. However, most studies showed no significant effects of air filters on respiratory symptoms or FEV1. Further studies in regions with high-density PM may provide additional information on this issue.

The effects of miR-21 suppression on alveolar macrophage polarization and airway inflammation are not known. Methods BALB/c and miR-21 knockout (KO) mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA). The anti-miR-21 antagomir was administered to BALB/c mice by intranasal inhalation from the day of OVA sensitization. Changes in cell counts, cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) were examined. Total, M1, and M2 macrophages were examined in the lung tissues by immunohistochemistry (IHC). M2 macrophages from the OVA mice lung were inhaled into the anti-miR-21 antagomir-treated asthmatic mice. Moreover, the polarization of M0 to M2 macrophages upon IL-4 stimulation was analyzed after anti-miR-21 antagomir transfection. Results The miR-21 KO mice showed decreases in AHR, total cell and eosinophil counts in BALF, and in the levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13. Expression of IL-12 and IFN-γ were increased in the miR-21 KO mice. Peribronchial inflammation and goblet cell dysplasia were significantly decreased in the lung tissues of miR-21 KO OVA mice compared to the wild type OVA mice. IHC for M1, M2, and total macrophage in the lung tissues showed that miR-21 inhalation suppressed alveolar M2 macrophages in KO mice. M2 macrophage inhalation restored AHR and eosinophilic airway inflammation in the miR-21 antagomir-treated mice. Moreover, anti-miR-21 antagomir transfection decreased the expression of M2 markers and increased the expression of M1 markers in M0 macrophages after IL-4 stimulation. Conclusions The results suggest that miR-21 antagonism could suppress alveolar M2 macrophage polarization, decreasing not only the Th2 eosinophilic airway inflammation but also AHR and airway remodeling process.",

Strategies for diagnosing and preventing ICM-induced HSRs have not been uniformly standardized yet. However, advances have been made based on the results of recent research. A previous history of hypersensitivity to ICM is the most significant risk factor for developing HSR by ICM. Avoidance of culprit agents and premedication is the main strategy to prevent recurrences of HSRs in high-risk patients. In addition, we strongly recommend identifying sensitized ICM using skin tests to determine immunoglobulin E-mediated or delayed-type allergy and to guide the choice of an alternative contrast agent. ICM provocation test procedures have been established and are helpful in selected cases. In this paper, we review how to evaluate patients who have experienced immediate or delayed HSRs caused by ICM to minimize the risk of recurrence and discuss unmet needs that require further research.",

It is a non-immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergy syndrome, most commonly identified in infancy and childhood. It can manifest as a constellation of symptoms following food ingestion, including repetitive and projectile emesis (1-4 hours), accompanied by pallor, lethargy, muscular hypotonia, and diarrhea (5-10 hours). In more severe reactions, significant leukocytosis with neutrophilia, thrombocytosis, metabolic derangements, methemoglobinemia, anemia, low albumin, and total protein may be present. Hypotension and ultimately hypovolemic distributive shock may occur in up to 15%-20% of cases. The diagnosis of FPIES is challenging and providers continue to face difficulties in management.

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the reliability and validity of the Korean version of the Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire-Parent Form (K-FAQLQ-PF) and to identify clinical characteristics related to low quality of life (QoL) in Korean children with food allergy (FA).Parents of 0-12-year-old patients with FA were enrolled. The English version of FAQLQ-PF was translated into Korean. Construct validation was confirmed by the Food Allergy Independent Measure-Parent Form (FAIM-PF) and the Child Health Questionnaire Parent Form 28 (CHQ-PF28). Logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate associations between potential risk factors and QoL outcomes.A total of 182 patients with a median age of 5.0 years were enrolled in the study. Cronbach's α coefficient values indicating internal consistency were higher than 0.8. Intraclass correlation coefficient values for test-retest reliability were good for all age groups (r > 0.6). Total K-FAQLQ-PF scores were positively correlated with the FAIM-PF (r = 0.56, P < 0.05) and were negatively correlated with the parental impact-emotional domain in the CHQ-PF28 (r = -0.44, P < 0.05). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, low QoL was significantly associated with female sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-4.18), age ≥ 5 years (aOR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.31-6.16), FA diagnosis before the age of 3 years (aOR, 3.96; 95% CI, 1.13-13.93), the presence of atopic dermatitis (aOR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.07-4.57), and residence in non-metropolitan areas (aOR, 3.44; 95% CI, 1.73-6.85).According to parental perceptions, the K-FAQLQ-PF is a valid and reliable tool to assess psychosocial QoL in Korean children with FAs. Age, sex, residential area, and comorbid AD can affect the QoL of pediatric patients with FA.",

    "abstract": "Cough is one of the most common symptoms of acute coronavirus disease 2019, but cough may persist for weeks or months. This study aimed to examine the clinical characteristics of patients with post-coronavirus disease (COVID) persistent cough in the Omicron era. We conducted a pooled analysis comparing 3 different groups: 1) a prospective cohort of post-COVID cough (> 3 weeks; n = 55), 2) a retrospective cohort of post-COVID cough (> 3 weeks; n = 66), and 3) a prospective cohort of non-COVID chronic cough (CC) (> 8 weeks; n = 100). Cough and health status was assessed using patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Outcomes, including PROs and systemic symptoms, were longitudinally evaluated in the prospective post-COVID cough registry participants receiving usual care. A total of 121 patients with post-COVID cough and 100 with non-COVID CC were studied. Baseline cough-specific PRO scores did not significantly differ between post-COVID cough and non-COVID CC groups. There were no significant differences in chest imaging abnormality or lung function between groups. However, the proportions of patients with fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) ≥ 25 ppb were 44.7% in those with post-COVID cough and 22.7% in those with non-COVID CC, which were significantly different. In longitudinal assessment of the post-COVID registry (n = 43), cough-specific PROs, such as cough severity or Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) scores, significantly improved between visits 1 and 2 (visit interval: median 35 [interquartile range, IQR: 23-58] days). In the LCQ score, 83.3% of the patients showed improvement (change ≥ +1.3), but 7.1% had worsened (≤ -1.3). The number of systemic symptoms was median 4 (IQR: 2-7) at visit 1 but decreased to median 2 (IQR: 0-4) at visit 2. In summary, post-COVID persistent cough was similar in overall clinical characteristics to CC. Current cough guideline-based approaches may be effective in most patients with post-COVID cough. Measurement of FeNO levels may also be useful for cough management.",

The endotypes of CRS were investigated by measuring interleukin (IL)-5, interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-17A, IL-22, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, matrix metalloproteinase-9, eotaxin-3, eosinophil cationic protein, myeloperoxidase (MPO), human neutrophil elastase (HNE), periostin, transforming growth factor-β1, total immunoglobulin E (IgE), and staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE)-specific IgE. We performed hierarchical cluster analysis and evaluated the phenotype, comorbidities, and Lund-Mackay computed tomography (LM CT) score in each cluster.Five clusters and 3 endotypes were extracted from 244 CRS patients: cluster 1 had no upregulated mediators compared to the other clusters (mild mixed inflammatory CRS); clusters 2, 3, and 4 had higher concentrations of neutrophil-associated mediators including HNE, IL-8, IL-17A, and MPO (T3 CRS); and cluster 5 had higher levels of eosinophil-associated mediators (T2 CRS). SE-specific IgE was undetectable in T3 CRS and had low detectable levels (6.2%) even in T2 CRS. The CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) phenotype and LM CT scores showed no significant differences between T2 and T3 CRS, while the incidence of comorbid asthma was higher in T2 CRS than T3 CRS. In T3 clusters, higher levels of neutrophilic markers were associated with disease severity and CRSwNP phenotype.In Koreans, there is a distinct T3 CRS endotype showing a high proportion of CRSwNP and severe disease extent, along with T2 CRS.",

    "abstract": "Severe asthma is associated with high morbidity and healthcare utilization; however, treatment options for these patients are limited. This study aimed to determine the therapeutic effects of biologics in clinical practice. This multicenter, retrospective cohort study included 136 patients who received biologics for at least 4 months between September 2017 and July 2022 at 25 medical centers affiliated with the Korean Severe Asthma Registry (KoSAR). The study evaluated the treatment effects, including acute exacerbation rates, maintenance of oral corticosteroid dosages, lung function, quality of life, blood eosinophil count, and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels, by comparing measurements before and after 4 months of biologic treatment. Responses for each medication was evaluated based on the Global Evaluation of Treatment Effectiveness score, and any adverse reactions were summarized. With the administration of biologics over the course of 4 months, there was a reduction in asthma acute exacerbations, a significant improvement in lung function, and a significant decrease in daily maintenance dose of oral steroid. Blood eosinophil counts decreased in the mepolizumab and reslizumab groups, while FeNO levels decreased only in the dupilumab group. The Asthma Control Test, Quality of Life Questionnaire for Adult Korean Asthmatics, and the EuroQol-visual analogue scale scores showed a significant improvement. Most patients (80.15%) responded to the biologic treatment. Meanwhile, non-responders often had chronic rhinosinusitis as a comorbidity, exhibited lower lung function, and required higher doses of oral steroids. No severe adverse events were reported. Biologics are highly effective in Korean patients with Type 2 severe asthma, significantly reducing acute exacerbation rates and doses of oral corticosteroids, while also improving lung function. Therefore, it seems beneficial to administer biologics without any restrictions to patients exhibiting Type 2 severe asthma.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD) is multifactorial, involving a dynamic interplay between genetic susceptibility, skin-barrier dysfunction, microbiome alterations, and immune dysregulation, whereas food allergy (FA) arises from the interplay of transcutaneous sensitization to food allergens and failure in the induction of oral tolerance. Skin epicutaneous sensitization is commonly involved in the development of AD and FA. Although clinical trials have been conducted to prevent AD or FA by applications of emollients on the skin after birth, the results are not consistent. For more effective preventive strategies, reliable biomarkers are required to identify high-risk individuals. Skin tape stripping (STS) is a non-invasive technique for identifying these biomarkers in the skin. By analyzing the stratum corneum collected via STS, researchers can gain molecular or cellular insights into the early pathogenesis and potential progression of AD and FA. This review aims to elucidate the critical aspects of AD and FA, underlying their pathogenesis, early manifestations, and STS's potential as a tool for identifying predictive non-invasive biomarkers in infants prior to onset of clinical disease.",

This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of combining dupilumab with subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) for severe AD refractory to standard treatments. This was a single-center retrospective analysis assessing patients with severe AD treated with combined dupilumab and SCIT, dupilumab, or SCIT alone at the Severance Hospital, Seoul, Korea. The inclusion criteria encompassed severe AD diagnosis, specific immunoglobulin (Ig) E levels to house dust mite allergens, and treatment follow-up for at least 18 months. Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) scores, serum biomarker levels, and adverse event records were regularly collected. Forty-eight patients with AD were analyzed, showing significant improvement in EASI scores and favorable changes in serum biomarkers over 144 weeks. The combination therapy led to a sustained reduction in AD severity, a significant reduction in total IgE and specific IgE levels, and an increment in allergen-specific IgG4. All patients experienced only mild and temporary side effects, not requiring treatment discontinuation. Combining dupilumab with SCIT offers a promising therapeutic option for patients with severe, treatment-refractory AD, reducing disease severity and inducing favorable immunological changes without increasing adverse effects.",

This study investigated the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the risk of IHD in individuals with asthma, particularly regarding COVID-19 severity. Using the Korean National Health Insurance Service claims database, we identified individuals with asthma who had recovered from COVID-19 between October 8, 2020, and December 31, 2021 (n = 8,011) and 1:1 propensity score-matched controls (n = 8,011). The incidence and risk of IHD were compared between the two groups. Overall, during a median follow-up of 95 days (interquartile range, 34-213 days; range, 1-448 days), which includes a median of 14 lag days, the COVID-19 cohort did not show a higher risk of IHD (hazard ratio [HR], 2.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99-4.48) compared to matched controls. However, when the severity of COVID-19 was considered, the severe COVID-19 cohort exhibited a higher risk of IHD (HR, 4.89; 95% CI, 1.86-12.84) than matched controls; in contrast, the non-severe COVID-19 cohort showed no significantly increased risk of IHD (HR, 1.64; 95% CI, 0.73-3.70). Severe COVID-19 is associated with an increased long-term risk of IHD in adults with asthma, emphasizing the importance of cardiovascular events monitoring to improve asthma treatment outcomes in the era of COVID-19.",

However, the detailed allergen profile of crayfish remains unknown, with only four allergen groups reported in the WHO/IUIS allergen nomenclature database. In this study we aimed to identify novel allergens based on the Procambarus clarkii genome and to reveal its allergen profile for developing better diagnostic tools and treatments. We assembled the crayfish genome using both long-read and short-read sequencing data and identified putative allergens using the BLAST algorithm based on sequence homology. We employed bioinformatics tools to investigate the expression levels, gene structure, and synteny of these putative allergens. We also applied indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay by using patients' sera to determine allergenicity and utilized proteomic methods to identify novel allergens. We identified a total of 11 putative allergen groups, including all isoforms or homologs for each allergen group based on the genome and three putative allergens by using 2-dimensional (2D) mass spectrometry. We identified 2 novel allergens, pPro c 3.0301 and pPro c 6.0201, with immunoglobulin E reactivity of 33.3% and 20%, respectively. By providing a comprehensive understanding of the complete allergen profile, our study presents a foundation for comprehending P. clarkii-associated allergy. The knowledge could facilitate the implementation of a components-resolved diagnostic test and preventive immunotherapy based on molecular allergens for crayfish allergy.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophilic asthma (NA) is associated with more severe symptoms and poor responsiveness to inhaled corticosteroid therapy. Macrophages are the most abundant immune cells in the airway, but the role of macrophages in NA pathogenesis has not been fully studied. We hypothesized that dysregulation of peroxisome metabolism in macrophages may drive NA. We retrieved microarray datasets from the GEO Gene Expression Omnibus database by using induced sputum samples from eosinophilic and neutrophilic asthma patients as well as healthy controls. We identified key molecules in NA and validated the expression of the key genes in our cohort of asthma patients using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining was performed to detect the expression and localization of the key molecule in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells from asthma patients and the murine model of neutrophilia-dominant allergic airway inflammation. The expression of the key molecule was also examined in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) by quantitative PCR and western blotting. Enoyl-CoA hydratase and 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (EHHADH), sterol carrier protein 2, and peroxisomal biogenesis factor 14 were identified as the key molecules and were downregulated in patients with NA or severe asthma. The peroxisomal fatty acid metabolism pathway was significantly downregulated in NA. In our cohort of asthma patients, the expression of EHHADH, a key enzyme of the peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation, was significantly decreased in non-eosinophilic asthma patients and positively correlated with airflow limitation. EHHADH was primarily expressed in macrophages in BAL cells. EHHADH was downregulated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced M1-like macrophages in mouse BMDMs. Fenofibrate, an agonist of the peroxisome pathway, significantly inhibits LPS-induced macrophage M1 polarization. EHHADH expression and the peroxisome metabolism pathway are downregulated in macrophages in patients with NA. This downregulation may contribute to macrophage M1 polarization and neutrophilic airway inflammation in asthma.",

This study evaluated the therapeutic potential and underlying mechanisms of inotodiol in eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis (ECRS). An ECRS mouse model was established using female BALB/c mice. Forty mice were categorized into 4 groups: the control group (n = 10), ECRS group treated with solvent (n = 10), ECRS group treated with inotodiol 20 mg/kg (n = 10), and ECRS group treated with dexamethasone 10 mg/kg (n = 10). The nasal lavage fluid and tissue samples from mice were analyzed for cytokine and chemokine expression as well as for the severity of mucosal inflammation. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, histopathological staining, and immunofluorescence techniques were employed. The human eosinophil cell line (EoL-1) and dispersed nasal polyp cells (DNPCs) were used to assess inotodiol-induced eosinophil apoptosis in vitro via immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and proteome profiler antibody array analysis. Inotodiol significantly reduced the secretion of T2 cytokine and mast cell tryptase as well as the expression of Th cytokines, chemokines, and proinflammatory/inflammatory cytokines in ECRS mice. Furthermore, it suppressed mucosal inflammatory features such as polyp formation, epithelial thickening, and eosinophil infiltration. Inotodiol treatment reduced mast cell activation and increased eosinophil apoptosis in the nasal mucosa of ECRS mice. Notably, inotodiol also induced apoptosis in EoL-1 cells and DNPCs, which may contribute to its anti-inflammatory effects. Inotodiol could be a potential therapeutic agent for ECRS by modulating immune responses and reducing mucosal inflammation.",

We aimed to examine the trajectories of asthma and allergic comorbidities and determine whether these trajectories differ according to clinical asthma phenotypes from birth to adolescence. We enrolled 958 children with physician-diagnosed asthma from the Korean childhood Asthma Study (KAS) cohort. Children with asthma were classified using hierarchical cluster analysis. Information on the diagnosis and treatment of allergic diseases before cohort entry was collected through linkage with national claims data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service. In the KAS cohort, approximately half had a history of atopic dermatitis (AD) before infancy, with its prevalence gradually decreasing during adolescence. The prevalence of allergic rhinitis (AR) increased with age. The prevalence of asthma increased during early childhood and decreased during adolescence. According to the natural progression of asthma, AD, and AR trajectories, 4 distinctive phenotypes were identified using latent class analysis: \"almost controlled,\" \"early-onset asthma with AD and late-onset AR,\" \"early-onset asthma only,\" and \"intermediate-onset asthma and late-onset AR.\" Four distinct clinical trajectory patterns of asthma, AD, and AR were identified among the 4 cluster phenotypes based on baseline characteristics. Cluster 1 comprised male-dominant, atopic asthma with early-onset AD and late-onset AR. Cluster 2 included early-onset, atopic asthma with AD\" persistent into adolescence. Cluster 3 encompassed \"puberty-onset, female-dominant atopic asthma\" with early-onset and low remission rates. Cluster 4 comprised \"early-onset asthma with less atopic features\" and the lowest comorbidities of AD and AR. The longitudinal trajectories of asthma and allergic comorbidities in Korean children can be classified into distinct clusters. Most phenotypes exhibited early-onset asthma with a varying prevalence of comorbidities. The persistence of AD, rather than its onset age, determines the phenotype.",

We sought to identify the clinical phenotypes of ABO and compare them to asthma alone or bronchiectasis alone. In this retrospective cohort study, we extracted electronic medical records from 292 inpatients with ABO, 901 inpatients with asthma alone, and 1,192 inpatients with bronchiectasis alone who were hospitalized between 2015 and 2020. We phenotyped ABO using 2-step unsupervised clustering analysis by using an independent cohort (n = 76). Compared to asthma or bronchiectasis alone, ABO exhibited greater disease severity and worse clinical outcomes. We identified 3 ABO phenotypes: asthma-dominant ABO (ABO-A, n = 100) with more prominent asthma symptoms; bronchiectasis-dominant ABO (ABO-B, n = 89) with more pronounced features of bronchiectasis; and co-existence of asthma and severe bronchiectasis (ABO-S, n = 103) with worse clinical outcomes. Compared to ABO-B, both ABO-A and ABO-S were associated with significantly higher blood neutrophil ratios (55.8% vs. 59.1% vs. 64.4%, P < 0.001), poorer lung function (FEV1% predicted: 79.1% vs. 67.5% vs. 50.1%, P < 0.001), longer hospital stay (6.0 vs. 7.0 vs. 7.0 days, P = 0.004), and higher risks of hospitalization within the next 2 years (ABO-A: hazards ratio [HR], 3.76, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-12.62, P = 0.032; ABO-S: HR, 4.05, 95% CI, 1.14-14.36, P = 0.031).

This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of YH as an anti-IgE immunomodulator compared with omalizumab (Oma). To evaluate the in vitro efficacy of YH in human mast cells, YH was treated with various methods, and the changes were confirmed through flow cytometry, immunoblot analysis, and immunocytochemistry. To evaluate the ex vivo efficacy of YH, the expression of FcεRIα on the surface of blood basophils was measured in 64 subjects with allergic diseases by flow cytometry. Serum soluble FcεRIα, CD23, and Mas-Related G-Protein Coupled Receptor Member X2 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The YH-administered group exhibited significantly lower expression of FcεRIα on peripheral basophils compared to the Oma-administered group up to 14 days post-administration. YH directly suppressed FcεRIα expression on the surface of LAD2 cells, as it was bound to IgE-unbound FcεRIα and migrated into the cells by actin-dependent endocytosis, then was recycled by FcRn binding in the lysosome in vitro. Serum soluble FcεRIα levels were increased in the YH-administered group compared to the other groups and showed a positive correlation with serum-free IgE. YH represents a new therapeutic agent for IgE-mediated allergic disease. Further studies are needed to evaluate its additional effects on the FcεRIα-mediated autoimmune mechanism.",

Here, we sought to explore the effect of PAF on the nasal epithelial barrier in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Human nasal epithelial cells (hNECs) were pre-treated with Apafant, a PAF receptor (PAFR) inhibitor, or MCC950, an NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome inhibitor, before PAF stimulation. The nasal epithelial barrier function was assessed by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and sodium fluorescein flux. Additionally, the expression of mRNAs and proteins of tight junctions were assessed. PAF significantly decreased TER and enhanced the fluorescein flux permeability in air-liquid interface cultures of hNECs, while also downregulating the expression of ZO-1, occludin, claudin-1, and claudin-4. However, the disruptive effect of PAF on the nasal epithelial barrier was attenuated by MCC950, but not by Apafant. Furthermore, MCC950 inhibited PAF-induced NLRP3 activation and its downstream molecules, including caspase-1, ASC, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-18. Our findings indicate that PAF has the potential to disrupt the nasal epithelial barrier in CRSwNP and may be linked to NLRP3 activation, while PAFR is not essential for this process. This discovery helps to explain why PAFR antagonists are ineffective in blocking PAF-mediated inflammation in clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Chronic cough, which affects 5%-18% of adults, has traditionally been considered a symptom defined by its duration. However, recent advances in understanding the pathophysiology of chronic cough have prompted the concept that chronic cough may exist as a distinct clinical entity driven by neuronal dysregulation and cough hypersensitivity. This evolving perspective recognizes various treatable traits and clinical characteristics which support the notion of cough as a disease entity and beyond that of a symptom-based classification. Initially developed for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the treatable traits approach has now been extended to chronic cough management, offering a more personalized treatment model. It focuses on identifying modifiable traits that significantly impact patient outcomes. However, challenges remain in implementing this model, including the need for trait validation, biomarker development, staff training, and the integration of new therapies. Despite these challenges, the treatable traits approach provides a promising framework for refining chronic cough management strategies and improving patient care.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the prevalence of asthma and its risk factors in Korean children in 2022, comparing the prevalence with previous data to identify trends in the prevalence of childhood asthma over time. This nationwide cross-sectional study enrolled 4,038 children aged 6-7 years and 4,269 children aged 12-13 years from 213 randomly selected elementary schools in 2022. The prevalence of asthma in 2022 was compared with those in 1995, 2000, and 2010, with subgroup comparisons classified by gender. A modified International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire assessed asthma prevalence with environmental factors. The prevalence of ''asthma diagnosis ever' in children aged 6-7 years was 9.1%, 9.4%, and 10.4% in 1995, 2000, and 2010, respectively, which was decreased in 2022 (2.1%, P < 0.001). The prevalence of 'current asthma' in children aged 6-7 years showed fluctuations (3.5%, 2.0%, 4.2%, and 0.6% in 1995, 2000, 2010, and 2022, respectively) without showing a significant trend. The prevalence of 'asthma diagnosis ever' and 'current asthma' in children aged 6-7 years was significantly higher in males than in females. The prevalence of 'asthma diagnosis ever' in children aged 12-13 years was 3.1% in 1995, with a significant increasing trend in 2000 (5.8%) and 2010 (7.5%), followed by a decrease in 2022 (3.4%). Male sex, a history of bronchiolitis in early life, allergic rhinitis diagnosis ever, and atopic dermatitis diagnosis ever were associated with 'asthma diagnosis ever' in children aged 6-7 years. For children aged 12-13 years, male sex and history of bronchiolitis in early life were independently associated with 'asthma diagnosis ever.' Childhood asthma prevalence has decreased, varying by asthma definition. The study's findings provide important information for establishing prevention and management strategies of childhood asthma.",

    "abstract": "Mepolizumab, an interleukin-5 antagonist, is globally recognized for its efficacy in randomized controlled trials for the treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma. The present study explored its real-world effectiveness and safety in a Korean cohort, filling a critical gap in current research. This multi-center retrospective study used data from the Korean Severe Asthma Registry, involving 67 patients treated with mepolizumab for uncontrolled severe asthma between September 2017 and July 2022. We assessed the effects of treatment on acute exacerbations, oral corticosteroid (OCS) maintenance dose, lung function, and quality of life. The notable findings included a marked reduction in the proportion of patients experiencing acute exacerbations, with 73.0% of patients reporting no exacerbations during the 6-month treatment period. At baseline, 31.8% of patients had reported no exacerbations over the prior 12 months. The OCS maintenance doses also decreased substantially, with only 3.2% of patients requiring OCS after 6 months. Additionally, there was an improvement in lung function. No severe adverse reactions were reported in this study, highlighting the safety of mepolizumab. This study confirmed that mepolizumab reduced exacerbations and OCS use, with additional improvements seen in asthma control, lung function, and patient-reported quality of life. These real-world findings support broader applications and reinforce the need for further research to optimize treatment strategies. Despite certain limitations, such as the small sample size and retrospective design, this study significantly contributes to the understanding of the real-world efficacy and safety of mepolizumab.",

The protective effect was assessed as the disappearance of aspirin-induced bronchospasm after 12 weeks of treatment. The results were compared according to the patients' clinical and physiological parameters.The decline in FEV1 following aspirin challenge was significantly reduced from 28.6+/-1.9% to 10.2+/-1.7% (P=0.0001) after 12 weeks of montelukast treatment. However, 14 subjects (30%) still showed a positive response (>15% decline in FEV1) to aspirin challenge. Grouping the subjects into good and poor responders according to post-treatment responses revealed that the pretreatment aspirin-induced FEV1 decline was significantly greater in the poor responders and that the triggering dose of aspirin and the induction time for a positive response were lower and shorter, respectively, in the poor responders. Histories of aspirin hypersensitivity and sinusitis were more prevalent among the poor responders than among the good responders.Twelve weeks of treatment with montelukast protected against aspirin-induced bronchospasm in 70% of the AIA cases. A poor response was associated with more severe aspirin-induced bronchospasms before treatment and a history of aspirin hypersensitivity or sinusitis.A severe response to aspirin challenge may be a predictor of poor responsiveness to leukotriene antagonist treatment.",

    "abstract": "THREE DIISOCYANATES CAN CAUSE OCCUPATIONAL ASTHMA (OA): toluene diisocyanate (TDI), 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI), and 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI). We analyzed potential biomarkers of isocyanate-induced OA, based on investigated immunologic, genetic, neurogenic, and protein markers, because there is no serological testing method. The prevalence of serum IgG to cytokeratin (CK)18 and CK19 in TDI-OA was significantly higher than in controls, although the prevalence of these antibodies was too low for them to be used as biomarkers. Another candidate biomarker was serum IgG to tissue transglutaminase (tTG), because the prevalence of serum specific IgG to tTG was significantly higher in patients with TDI-OA than in controls. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602-DPB1*0501 haplotype may be used as a genetic marker for TDI-OA in Koreans via enhanced specific IgE sensitization in exposed subjects. The genetic polymorphisms of catenin alpha 3, alpha-T catenin (CTNNA3) were significantly associated with TDI-OA. Additionally, examining the neurokinin 2 receptor (NK2R) 7853G>A and 11424 G>A polymorphisms, the NK2R 7853GG genotype had higher serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels than the GA or AA genotypes among Korean workers exposed to TDI. To identify new serologic markers using a proteomic approach, differentially expressed proteins between subjects with MDI-OA and asymptomatic exposed controls in a Korean population showed that the optimal serum cutoff levels were 69.8 ng/mL for ferritin and 2.5 µg/mL for transferrin. When these two parameters were combined, the sensitivity was 71.4% and the specificity was 85.7%. The serum cytokine matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) level is a useful biomarker for identifying cases of TDI-OA among exposed workers. Despite these possible biomarkers, more effort should be focused on developing early diagnostic biomarkers using a comprehensive approach based on the pathogenic mechanisms of isocyanate-induced OA.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory infections can cause wheezing episodes in children and can influence the onset and severity of asthma via complex and intersecting mechanisms.Infections can trigger atopic asthma, and atopy can cause wheezing during airway infections and modify the course of airway infections.Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M.pneumoniae), primarily recognized as a causative agent of community-acquired pneumonia, has recently been linked to asthma.Infections with M. pneumoniae can precede the onset of asthma, exacerbate asthmatic symptoms, and cause difficulties with asthma management. 1 The clinical association between M. pneumoniae infection and exacerbation of asthma symptoms has been suspected for longer than two decades; however, the nature of the correlation is still far from clear.In 1970, Berkovich et al. 2 provided the first prospective study showing serological evidence of infection with either M. pneumoniae or a respiratory virus in 27 of 84 (32%) asthma patients.Huhti et al. 3 analyzed 63 patients after severe episodes of acute asthma and found that 19% had associated viral or mycoplasma infections.Biscardi et al. 4 reported that 20% (24/119) of the patients with previously diagnosed asthma had simultaneous acute M. pneumoniae infection and asthma exacerbation; of 51 patients experiencing their first episode, acute infection with M. pneumoniae was identified in 26 (50%) of the patients.Therefore, based on the current literature, M. pneumoniae appears to be an important trigger for the acute exacerbation of asthma, accounting for 3.3%-50% of exacerbations.Several recent studies have implicated M. pneumoniae infection in the pathophysiology of asthma in subsets of patients.In two of the most influential studies, Kraft et al. 5 and Martin et al. 6 used polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) to detect M. pneumoniae in the lower pulmonary airways in 25 of 55 (45%) adult patients with chronic stable asthma, compared with 1 of 11 (9%) controls.Using serology and PCR, Esposito et al. 7 found M. pneumoniae significantly more often in children with acute episodes of wheezing than in controls, and infection was signifi-",

    "abstract": "Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) has attracted a great deal of attention because of its association with increased asthma severity. However, oral aspirin challenge (OAC) to diagnose AERD is a time-consuming procedure, and some patients experience serious complications. Thus, we evaluated diagnostic values of non-invasive clinical parameters to predict AERD in asthmatic patients.A total of 836 Korean subjects were recruited from an asthma cohort. They underwent OAC, and clinical parameters including the history of aspirin hypersensitivity, nasal polyposis, and chronic sinusitis of aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA) and AERD asthmatic patients were compared.Significant differences (P<0.01) were found in eight parameters: age at diagnosis, body mass index, FEV1%, PC20, history of urticaria, nasal polyps, chronic sinusitis, and history of aspirin hypersensitivity. After logistic regression analysis based on the eight clinical parameters, nasal polyps, history of aspirin intolerance, sinusitis, and log [PC20 methacholine] remained significantly associated with AERD (P<0.05). The sensitivity and specificity of the history of aspirin hypersensitivity to predict AERD were 64.7% and 92.0%, respectively, and the positive and negative predictive values were 56.9% and 94.1%, respectively. Overall, the accuracy of the test was 88.2%. The accuracy of the tests for nasal polyps and chronic sinusitis were 67.3% and 60.4%, respectively.Among clinical parameters associated with AERD, the history of aspirin hypersensitivity has the best positive and negative predictive values for the oral aspirin challenge test. Because the false-positive and -negative rates were still high, additional non-invasive methods are needed to reduce the rate of false outcomes.",

The incidence was calculated on the basis of industry, occupation, sex, age, and region. In addition, the distribution of causal agents was determined.During the study period, 236 cases of work-related asthma were reported, with 77 cases from more than 1 source. A total of 22.0% (n=52) were reported by occupational physicians, 52.5% (n=124) by allergy and chest physicians, 24.2% (n=57) by regional surveillance systems, and 43.2% (n=102) by workers' compensation schemes. The overall average annual incidence was 3.31 cases/million workers, with a rate of 3.78/million among men and 2.58/million among women. The highest incidence was observed in the 50-59-year age group (7.74/million), in the Gyeonggi/Incheon suburb of Seoul (8.50/million), in the furniture and other instrument manufacturing industries (67.62/million), and among craft and related trades workers (17.75/million). The most common causal agents were isocyanates (46.6%), flour/grain (8.5%), metal (5.9%), reactive dyes (5.1%), and solvents (4.2%).The incidence of work-related asthma in Korea was relatively low, and varied according to industry, occupation, gender, age, and region. Data provided by workers' compensation schemes and physician reports have been useful for determining the incidence and causes of work-related asthma.",

    "abstract": "The oil spill from the Heibei Spirit in December 2007 contaminated the Yellow Coast of South Korea. We evaluated the respiratory effects of that spill on children who lived along the Yellow Coast.Of 662 children living in the area exposed to the oil spill, 436 (65.9%) were enrolled as subjects. All subjects completed a modified International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire. A health examination, including a skin prick test, pulmonary function test, and methacholine bronchial provocation test (MBPT), was administered. The children were assigned to two groups: those who lived close to the oil spill area and those who lived far from the oil spill area.The children who lived close to the oil spill area showed a significantly lower forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), an increased prevalence of 'asthma ever' (based on a questionnaire), and 'airway hyperresponsiveness' (based on the MBPT) than those who lived far from the oil spill area (FEV1; P=0.011, prevalence of 'asthma ever' based on a questionnaire; P=0.005, prevalence of 'airway hyperresponsiveness' based on the MBPT; P=0.001). The onset of wheezing after the oil spill was significantly higher in children who lived close to the oil spill area than in those who lived far from the oil spill area among the 'wheeze ever' group (P=0.002). In a multiple logistic regression analysis, male sex, family history of asthma, and residence near the oil spill area were significant risk factors for asthma (sex [male/female]: odds ratio [OR], 2.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.31-4.91; family history of asthma [No/Yes]: OR, 3.77; 95% CI, 1.83-7.75; exposure group [low/high]; OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.27-4.65).This study suggests that exposure to an oil spill is a risk factor for asthma in children.",

We retrospectively analyzed the fourth Korean National Health and Nutrition Survey database, performed in 2008 using nationwide stratified random sampling to obtain a representative cohort of the Korean population. We evaluated the association between both self-reported ever-asthmatics and wheezers and concomitant diseases such as arthritis, hypertension, gastrointestinal (GI) ulcers, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, rhinitis, depression, stroke, and obesity in subjects aged ≥40 years. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify concomitant diseases independently associated with asthma, after adjustment for age, gender, income, cigarette smoking, and other chronic diseases. Of the total of 4,445 subjects, 2,596 (58.4%) were female and the mean age was 58.3 years. Of the 4,445 subjects, 195 (4.4%) had been diagnosed with asthma at some point, and 444 (10%) were wheezers. Multivariate analysis showed that arthritis (odds ratio [OR] 1.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.26-2.42), rhinitis (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.14-2.78), depression (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.05-2.07), and obesity (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.08-2.40) were significantly associated with self-reported ever-asthma, and arthritis (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.19-1.909), hypertension (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.07-1.67), GI ulcers (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.05-2.08), rhinitis (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.16-2.19), depression (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.51-2.48), and obesity (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.17-2.09) were significantly associated with wheezers.

Several FLG mutations, including 3321delA, E2422X, K4671X, S2554X, and R501X, occur frequently in Chinese and Japanese populations. The association between three FLG null mutations and AD in Korean children was investigated.

The FLG null mutation E2422X was not detected in any patients with AD or control subjects. The R501X null mutation was detected in only one child with AD (0.1%). Children with AD had the 3321delA deletion significantly more frequently (2.4%) than the control subjects (0.0%, P<0.001). Children with AD also had a significantly higher combined allele frequency of the three FLG null mutations (2.6%) than the controls (0.0%, P<0.001).

When the patients with AD were divided into allergic AD and non-allergic AD patient groups, these two groups did not differ in terms of the frequency of 3321delA.

Furthermore, it is unclear whether high-ventilation sport background exacerbates dysfunction and symptoms.Seventeen active females (measure of the maximum volume of oxygen [VO(2max)]: 49.6±6.6 mL·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹) completed on different days in random order 5 blinded running trials at 0°C, -5°C, -10°C, -15°C, and -20°C (humidity 40%) in an environmental chamber. Distance, heart rate, and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were measured within each trial; forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow at 25%-75% (FEF₂₅₋₇₅), and forced expiratory flow at 50% (FEF₅₀) were measured pre- and post-test (3, 6, 10, 15, and 20 minutes). Respiratory symptoms and global effort were measured post-test spirometry.Mean decreases were found in FEV1 (4%-5% at 0°C, -5°C, -10°C, and -15°C; 7% at -20°C). FEF₂₅₋₇₅ and FEF₅₀ decreased 7% and 11% at -15°C and -20°C, respectively. Post-exertion spirometry results were decreased most at 3 to 6 minutes, recovering back to baseline at 20 minutes. Respiratory symptoms and global effort significantly increased at -15°C and -20°C with decreased heart rate. High-ventilation sports decreased function more than low-ventilation participants but had fewer symptoms.These results indicate that intense exercise at cold air temperatures up to -20°C is achievable; however, greater effort along with transient acute bronchoconstriction and symptoms of cough after exercising in temperatures colder than -15°C are likely. It is recommended that individuals cover their mouth and reduce exercise intensity to ameliorate the effects of cold weather exercise.",

    "abstract": "Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has been widely used in China to treat allergic rhinitis (AR). However, several studies have produced conflicting data with regard to the efficacy of the medicine. Our aim was to perform a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to evaluate the relative efficacy of CHM.We systematically searched the PubMed, Medline, and Springer electronic databases up to March 2017 for RCTs comparing the efficacy of CHM versus placebo for the treatment of patients with AR. Total nasal symptoms and quality of life were assessed through pooling mean difference (MD) with its 95% confidence interval (CI). Moreover, sensitivity and subgroup analyses according to control design and quality of life assessment were performed to evaluate the source of heterogeneity.Eleven RCTs were enrolled in the meta-analysis. Assessment of overall heterogeneity indicated significant heterogeneity among the individual studies (I²=100%, P<0.00001), and thus ransomed effects model was used to pool data. CHM was found to significantly enhance quality of life compared with placebo (MD=-0.88, (95% CI: -1.55, -0.21); P=0.01). The symptom of itchy nose, sneezing or total nasal symptoms scores were not significantly improved after CHM treatment, although the improvement in itchy nose just failed to reach significance (MD=0.09, (95% CI: 0.00, 0.18); P=0.06).This study suggests that CHM appears to improve the quality of life of AR patients.

    "abstract": "Obesity is associated with metabolic dysregulation, but the underlying metabolic signatures involving clinical and inflammatory profiles of obese asthma are largely unexplored. We aimed at identifying the metabolic signatures of obese asthma.Eligible subjects with obese (n = 11) and lean (n = 22) asthma underwent body composition and clinical assessment, sputum induction, and blood sampling. Sputum supernatant was assessed for interleukin (IL)-1β, -4, -5, -6, -13, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and serum was detected for leptin, adiponectin and C-reactive protein. Untargeted gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS)-based metabolic profiles in sputum, serum and peripheral blood monocular cells (PBMCs) were analyzed by orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA) and pathway topology enrichment analysis. The differential metabolites were further validated by correlation analysis with body composition, and clinical and inflammatory profiles.Body composition, asthma control, and the levels of IL-1β, -4, -13, leptin and adiponectin in obese asthmatics were significantly different from those in lean asthmatics. OPLS-DA analysis revealed 28 differential metabolites that distinguished obese from lean asthmatic subjects. The validation analysis identified 18 potential metabolic signatures (11 in sputum, 4 in serum and 2 in PBMCs) of obese asthmatics. Pathway topology enrichment analysis revealed that cyanoamino acid metabolism, caffeine metabolism, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, pentose phosphate pathway in sputum, and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, glycerolipid metabolism and pentose phosphate pathway in serum are suggested to be significant pathways related to obese asthma.GC-TOF-MS-based metabolomics indicates obese asthma is characterized by a metabolic profile different from lean asthma. The potential metabolic signatures indicated novel immune-metabolic mechanisms in obese asthma with providing more phenotypic and therapeutic implications, which needs further replication and validation.",

    "abstract": "might have on those processes.Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays a central role in host defense. 5Though mononuclear phagocytic cells are the primary source of IL-6, it is also produced by a number of other cell types, including lymphocytes, granulocytes, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, mast cells, and fibroblasts. 6IL-6 is traditionally considered an activator of acute phase responses and a lymphocyte stimulatory factor. 7Recent evidence has shown that IL-6 secreted by cells of the innate immune system can induce expansion of Th2 effector cell populations. 8More-Purpose: Based on the close relationship between histamine and interleukin 6 (IL-6), we hypothesized that histamine may regulate the production of cytokines, such as IL-6, during allergic inflammation.Here, we examined the role of histamine in IL-6 production and histamine receptor activity in nasal fibroblasts, along with the mechanisms underlying these effects.Methods: Experiments were performed using nasal fibroblasts from 8 normal patients.RT-PCR was used to identify the major histamine receptors expressed in nasal fibroblasts.Fibroblasts were then treated with histamine with or without histamine-receptor antagonists, and monitored for IL-6 production using an ELISA.Four potential downstream signaling molecules, p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and NF-κB, were evaluated by Western blot, and a luciferase reporter assay.Results: Elevated expression was seen for all histamine receptors, with IL-6 protein levels increasing significantly following histamine stimulation.Among the histamine-receptor specific antagonists, only the H1R antagonist significantly decreased IL-6 production in histaminestimulated nasal fibroblasts.Histamine increased the expression level of phosphorylated p38 (pp38), pERK, and pJNK, as well as NF-κB induction.The H1R antagonist actively suppressed pp38 and NF-κB expression in histamine-induced nasal fibroblasts, but not pERK and pJNK.The p38 inhibitor strongly attenuated IL-6 production in histamine-stimulated nasal fibroblasts.Conclusions: The data presented here suggest that antihistamines may be involved in the regulation of cytokines, such as IL-6, due to the role of histamine as an inflammatory mediator in nasal fibroblasts.",

Our previous study found no difference in the number of blood iNKT cells between asthma patients and controls. However, few studies have examined the function of blood iNKT cells in human asthma.Twenty asthma patients and eight controls were included in this study. Blood iNKT cells were identified using double staining with anti-Vα24 and anti-Vβ11 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or with 6B11 and anti-Vβ11 mAbs. Intracellular IL-4, IL-10, and IFN-γ cytokines were stained in blood iNKT cells using their respective mAbs and isotypes. In addition, their relationships with clinical parameters were analyzed.The number of Vα24+Vβ11+ iNKT cells or 6B11+Vβ11+ iNKT cells did not differ between asthma patients and controls. However, among Vα24+Vβ11+iNKT cells, the proportion of IL-4+iNKT cells was increased in asthma patients compared to controls (7.0±3.0% vs 0.5%±0.4%, P<0.05). There were no differences in the proportions of IL-10+or IFN-γ+iNKT cells between the groups. The proportion of IL-4+ cells among 6B11+Vβ11+iNKT cells inversely correlated with FEV1, expressed as a percentage predicted value in asthma patients (Rs=-0.64, P<0.05, n=19).Blood iNKT cells are thought to be Th2-like, and IL-4-producing iNKT cells may be associated with lung function in human asthma.",

    "abstract": "The previously reported Japanese clinical scoring study (JESREC) suggests that chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) can be divided into 4 subtypes according to the degree of eosinophilic CRS (ECRS) and offers the information regarding the prognosis of CRS to clinicians. However, this scoring system has not yet been validated by an immunological study and needs to provide treatment guidelines based on underlying immunologic profiles. We investigated the immunologic profile of each CRS subgroup according to the JESREC classification and suggest its clinical application. A total of 140 CRS patients and 20 control subjects were enrolled. All patients were classified into 4 groups according to the JESREC (non-, mild, moderate and severe ECRS). Nasal tissues were analyzed for mRNA expression of major cytokines (IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-22, IL-23p19, IFN-γ, periostin, thymic stromal lymphopoietin [TSLP] and ST2), major chemokines (CCL11, CCL24, CXCL1 and CXCL2), transcription factors (T-bet, GATA3, RORC and FOXP3) and COL1A1 for type I collagen. Protein levels of 3 major cytokines (IL-5, IL-17A and IFN-γ) were also measured by multiplex immunoassay. Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to investigate the overall profile of multiple mediators. The moderate/severe ECRS showed up-regulation of type 2-related mediators (IL-5, IL-13, periostin, TSLP and ST-2), whereas INF-γ (type 1 cytokine) and CXCL1 (neutrophil chemokine) expressions were increased in non-/mild ECRS compared with moderate/severe ECRS. The JESREC classification reflected an immunological endotype. In PCA data, PCA1 indicates a relative type 2 profile, whereas PCA2 represents a type 1/type 17-related profile. In this analysis, mild ECRS was indistinguishable from non-ECRS, whereas moderate to severe ECRS showed a distinct distribution compared with non-ECRS. The JESREC classification could be divided into 2 categories, non-/mild vs. moderate/severe ECRS based on underlying immunological analyses. The CRS clinical scoring system from the JESREC study reflects an inflammatory endotype. However, the immunologic profile of mild ECRS was similar to that of non-ECRS. Therefore, we propose type 2-targeted medical treatment for moderate to severe ECRS and type 1/type 17-targeted for non-ECRS and mild ECRS as the first treatment option.",

Scheme 3: Cockroach allergen challenge was performed as in scheme 1 and CpG-ODN was post-treated at day 21.Then, BAL cell count, flow cytometric analysis of alveolar macrophages, regulatory T cells, and lung tissue histology, Th1 and Th2 cytokines, serum IgE, cockroach specific IgE, IgG1/IgG2a ratio, and airway hyper-responsiveness were evaluated.Results: Mice with repeated intra-nasal exposure to CpG-ODN showed a dramatic decrease in eosinophilic inflammation, goblet cell hyperplasia, and airway hyper-responsiveness with reduction of IL-13, IL-5, and serum IgE, cockroach specific IgE and IgG1/IgG2a ratio.This inhibitory function might be related to the up-regulation of IL-10 and CD4 + Foxp3 + regulatory T cells in the lung.Interestingly, one-time challenge of CpG-ODN either prior or posterior to cockroach extract exposure could modulate airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness via increase of Th1 response.Conclusions: Collectively, our data suggest that CpG-ODN treatment modulates Th2 inflammation in the lung by induction of regulatory T cells or Th1 response in a cockroach-induced asthma model.",

HBECs were obtained during bronchoscopy from 10 patients with asthma (6 atopic and 4 non-atopic) and from healthy controls (n=9) and grown as undifferentiated cultures. HBECs were infected with parainfluenza virus (PIV)-3 (MOI 0.1) and rhinovirus (RV)-1B (MOI 0.1), or treated with medium alone. The cell supernatants were harvested at 8, 24, and 48 hours. IFN-α, CXCL10 (IP-10), and RANTES (CCL5) were analyzed by using Cytometric Bead Array (CBA), and interferon (IFN)-β and IFN-λ1 by ELISA. Gene expression of IFNs, chemokines, and IFN-regulatory factors (IRF-3 and IRF-7) was determined by using quantitative PCR. PIV3 and RV1B infections increased IFN-λ1 mRNA expression in HBECs from asthmatics and healthy controls to a similar extent, and virus-induced IFN-λ1 expression correlated positively with IRF-7 expression. Following PIV3 infection, IP-10 protein release and mRNA expression were significantly higher in asthmatics compared to healthy controls (median 36.03-fold). No differences in the release or expression of RANTES, IFN-λ1 protein and mRNA, or IFN-α and IFN-β mRNA between asthmatics and healthy controls were observed. However, when asthmatics were divided according to their atopic status, HBECs from atopic asthmatics (n=6) generated significantly more IFN-λ1 protein and demonstrated higher IFN-α, IFN-β, and IRF-7 mRNA expressions in response to PIV3 compared to non-atopic asthmatics (n=4) and healthy controls (n=9). In response to RV1B infection, IFN-β mRNA expression was lower (12.39-fold at 24 hours and 19.37-fold at 48 hours) in non-atopic asthmatics compared to atopic asthmatics. The immune response of HBECs to virus infections may not be deficient in asthmatics, but seems to be modified by atopic status.",

This study assessed the prevalence and clinical characteristics of DRESS syndrome caused by antituberculosis drugs.The electronic medical records of a cohort consisting of adult patients diagnosed with tuberculosis between July 2006 and June 2010 were reviewed and retrospectively inspected. We searched the surveillance system for adverse drug reactions and the electronic medical records to identify patients who reported severe cutaneous adverse reactions to antituberculosis drugs. These patients were then re-assessed using a European Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions to Drugs and Collection of Biological Samples (RegiSCAR) scoring system. Clinical characteristics, including the symptoms and latency of DRESS syndrome, the therapeutic dosage and period of steroids, and the final duration of tuberculosis therapy, were examined.Of the 1,253 adult patients with tuberculosis receiving antituberculosis drugs, 15 were identified as potential cases of DRESS syndrome (prevalence of 1.2%). Ethambutol was the most frequently used drug (53.5%), followed by rifampicin (26.7%), pyrazinamide (20.0%), streptomycin (13.3%), and isoniazid (6.7%). The median latency after day 1 of antituberculosis medication was 42 days. The median daily dose of steroids, expressed in prednisone-equivalent units, was 33-mg/day, and the median dosing period was 14 days. The duration of tuberculosis treatment was 76 days longer than the standard treatment period of 180 days. There was a significant difference in the peak eosinophil counts of DRESS syndrome patients according to RegiSCAR scores. Moreover, there was a significant quantitative correlation between the RegiSCAR score and peak eosinophil count. A negative correlation was also found between the RegiSCAR score and latency.This study confirmed the prevalence of DRESS syndrome in a cohort of adult patients with tuberculosis.",

    "abstract": "Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a complex immunological condition, and novel experimental modalities are required to explore various clinical and pathophysiological endotypes; mere evaluation of nasal polyp (NP) status is inadequate. Therefore, we collected patient nasal secretions on filter paper and characterized the proteomes.We performed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS)/MS in the data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and data-independent acquisition (DIA) modes. Nasal secretions were collected from 10 controls, 10 CRS without NPs (CRSsNP) and 10 CRS with NPs (CRSwNP). We performed Orbitrap MS-based proteomic analysis in the DDA (5 controls, 5 CRSsNP and 5 CRSwNP) and the DIA (5 controls, 5 CRSsNP and 5 CRSwNP) modes, followed by a statistical analysis and a hierarchical clustering to identify differentially expressed proteins in the 3 groups.We identified 2,020 proteins in nasal secretions. Canonical pathway analysis and gene ontology (GO) evaluation revealed that interleukin (IL)-7, IL-9, IL-17A and IL-22 signaling and neutrophil-mediated immune responses like neutrophil degranulation and activation were significantly increased in CRSwNP compared to control. The GO terms related to the iron ion metabolism that may be associated with CRS and NP development.Collection of nasal secretions on the filter paper is a practical and non-invasive method for in-depth study of nasal proteomics. Our proteomic signatures also support that Asian NPs could be characterized as non-eosinophilic inflammation features. Therefore, the proteomic profiling of nasal secretions from CRS patients may enhance our understanding of CRS endotypes.",

    "abstract": "Although severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions (SCARs) are rare, they are associated with high morbidity and mortality, and thus early diagnosis and treatment are critical for improving prognoses. However, few studies have reported the characteristics of SCARs in children. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics, current management and prognosis of pediatric SCARs.We analyzed pediatric data in the Korean SCARs registry, which was built retrospectively in 2016 with SCAR cases treated in 34 tertiary referral university hospitals during 2010-2015. Using these cases, we descriptively analyzed detailed data regarding etiology, clinical and laboratory features, treatment strategies, and prognosis.Forty-seven pediatric SCAR cases from 15 tertiary referral hospitals were included. The median patient age was 10 (interquartile range, 3-15.5) years and 68.1% (n = 32) were males. The culprit drug was identified in 95.7% (n = 45) of the patients; antibiotics (44.7%) and antiepileptic drugs (19.1%) were the most common and second most common culprits, respectively. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) cases presented with the largest area of skin involvement without permanent sequelae. Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) cases involved relatively small areas of skin but serious sequelae in two children. Of 4 patients with toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), 1 died. Of all patients assessed, 36 (76.6%) received systemic steroids and 21 (44.7%) received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Thirteen (27.7%) received both systemic steroids and IVIG. Cyclosporine was administered to only 1 patient along with a systemic steroid.In patients with pediatric SCARs, including those with DRESS, SJS and TEN, clinical presentations were variable. Thus, there was no clear continuous disease spectrum. Although the mortality rate was low (2.1%), clinical suspicion may be the best tool for proactive SCAR management.",

This study assessed the activation status of neutrophils in adult asthmatics, and the therapeutic potential of FTY720, a synthetic sphingosine-1-phosphate analog, on activated neutrophils using an in vitro stimulation model.We isolated peripheral blood neutrophils (PBNs) from 59 asthmatic patients (including 20 aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [AERD] and 39 aspirin-tolerant asthma [ATA] groups). PBNs were stimulated with N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and their activation status was determined based on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cell surface expression of CD11b, interleukin (IL)-8 and matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)-9 release. PBNs were primed with FTY720 to evaluate its anti-inflammatory action.In vitro PBN stimulation with fMLP or LPS induced a significant increase in ROS/CD11b/IL-8/MMP-9 levels (P < 0.05 for all). In asthmatics, fMLP-induced ROS level was significantly correlated with values of forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity (r = -0.278; P = 0.036), maximal mid-expiratory flow (r = -0.309; P = 0.019) and PC20 methacholine (r = -0.302; P = 0.029). In addition, ROS levels were significantly higher in patients with AERD and in those with severe asthma than in those with ATA or non-severe asthma (P < 0.05 for all). FTY720 treatment could suppress ROS/CD11b levels, and LPS-induced IL-8 and MMP-9 levels (P < 0.05 for all). Responders to FTY720 treatment had significantly higher neutrophil counts in sputum (P = 0.004).Our findings suggest a useful in vitro PBN stimulation model for evaluating the neutrophil functional status and the therapeutic potentials of neutrophil-targeting candidates in asthmatics.",

Due to their cargo, EVs are considered fingerprints of the parent cell, which are detectable in body fluids. We studied the composition and function of bacterial microbiota-derived EVs genes in urine to evaluate whether they have specific characteristics concerning allergic airway disease. Methods Subjects were from elementary school surveys and classified into 3 groups according to questionnaires and sensitization to aeroallergens: the allergic airway group (AA, n = 16), atopic controls (AC, n = 7) and healthy controls (HC, n = 26). The bacterial EVs were isolated from voided urine samples, their nucleic acid was extracted for 16S ribosomal RNA pyrosequencing and then characterized using α-diversity, β-diversity, network analysis, intergroup comparison of bacterial composition and predicted functions, and correlation with total immunoglobulin E (IgE), eosinophils% and fractional exhaled NO. Results The compositional α-diversity was the highest in AA, while functional α-diversity was the highest in HC. AA had a distinct clustering with the least intersample variation. Klebsiella, Haemophilus, members from Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae, and the pathways of sphingolipid and glycerolipid metabolism, and biosynthesis of peptidoglycan and lysine were the highest in AA and positively correlated with total IgE or eosinophil%. Genetic information processing function contributed to 48% of the intergroup variance and was the highest in AA. Diaphorobacter, Acinetobacter, and the pathways of short-chain fatty acids and anti-oxidants metabolism, lysine and xenobiotic degradation, and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis were the lowest in AA and negatively correlated with total IgE or eosinophil%. The bacterial composition and function in AC were closer to those in HC. The bacterial network was remarkably dense in HC. Conclusions The bacterial microbiota-derived EVs in urine possess characteristic features in allergic airway disease with a remarkable correlation with total IgE and eosinophil%. These findings suggest that they may play important roles in allergic airway diseases.",

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been a rise in the interest to understand the composition of indoor dust due to its association with lung diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. Furthermore, it has been found that bacterial extracellular vesicles (EVs) within indoor dust particles can induce pulmonary inflammation, suggesting that these might play a role in lung disease.We performed microbiome analysis of indoor dust EVs isolated from mattresses in apartments and hospitals. We developed diagnostic models based on the bacterial EVs antibodies detected in serum samples via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in this analysis.Proteobacteria was the most abundant bacterial EV taxa observed at the phylum level while Pseudomonas, Enterobacteriaceae (f) and Acinetobacter were the most prominent organisms at the genus level, followed by Staphylococcus. Based on the microbiome analysis, serum anti-bacterial EV immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgG1 and IgG4 were analyzed using ELISA with EV antibodies that targeted Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The levels of anti-bacterial EV antibodies were found to be significantly higher in patients with asthma, COPD and lung cancer compared to the healthy control group. We then developed a diagnostic model through logistic regression of antibodies that showed significant differences between groups with smoking history as a covariate. Four different variable selection methods were compared to construct an optimal diagnostic model with area under the curves ranging from 0.72 to 0.81.The results of this study suggest that ELISA-based analysis of anti-bacterial EV antibodies titers can be used as a diagnostic tool for lung disease. The present findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of lung disease as well as a foundation for developing a novel diagnostic methodology that synergizes microbial EV metagenomics and immune assays.",

    "abstract": "Anaphylaxis is an immediate allergic reaction characterized by potentially life-threatening, severe, systemic manifestations. While studies have evaluated links between serious illness and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), few have investigated PTSD after anaphylaxis in adults. We sought to investigate the psychosocial burden of recent anaphylaxis in Korean adults.A total of 203 (mean age of 44 years, 120 females) patients with anaphylaxis were recruited from 15 university hospitals in Korea. Questionnaires, including the Impact of Event Scale-Revised-Korean version (IES-R-K), the Korean version of the Beck Anxiety Inventory (K-BAI), and the Korean version of the Beck Depression Inventory (K-BDI), were administered. Demographic characteristics, causes and clinical features of anaphylaxis, and serum inflammatory markers, including tryptase, platelet-activating factor, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and C-reactive protein, were evaluated.PTSD (IES-R-K ≥ 25) was noted in 84 (41.4%) patients with anaphylaxis. Of them, 56.0% had severe PTSD (IES-R-K ≥ 40). Additionally, 23.2% and 28.1% of the patients had anxiety (K-BAI ≥ 22) and depression (K-BDI ≥ 17), respectively. IES-R-K was significantly correlated with both K-BAI (r = 0.609, p < 0.0001) and K-BDI (r = 0.550, p < 0.0001). Among the inflammatory mediators, tryptase levels were lower in patients exhibiting PTSD; meanwhile, platelet-activating factor levels were lower in patients exhibiting anxiety and depression while recovering from anaphylaxis. In multivariate analysis, K-BAI and K-BDI were identified as major predictive variables of PTSD in patients with anaphylaxis.In patients with anaphylaxis, we found a remarkably high prevalence of PTSD and associated psychological distresses, including anxiety and depression. Physicians ought to be aware of the potential for psychological distress in anaphylactic patients and to consider psychological evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Recent studies have demonstrated that macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is of importance in asthmatic inflammation. The role of MIF in modulating airway remodeling has not yet been thoroughly elucidated to date. In the present study, we hypothesized that MIF promoted airway remodeling by intensifying airway smooth muscle cell (ASMC) autophagy and explored the specific mechanisms. Methods MIF knockdown in the lung tissues of C57BL/6 mice was conducted by instilling intratracheally adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors (MIF-mutant AAV9) into mouse lung tissues. Mice genetically deficient in the autophagy marker ATG5 (ATG5+/-) was used to detect the role of autophagy in ovalbumin (OVA)-asthmatic murine models. Moreover, to block the expression of MIF and CD74 in vitro models, inhibitors, antibodies and lentivirus transfection techniques were employed. Results First, MIF knockdown in the lung tissues of mice showed markedly reduced airway remodeling in OVA murine mice models. Secondly, ASMC autophagy was increased in the OVA-challenged models. Mice genetically deficient in the autophagy marker ATG5 (ATG5+/-) that were primed and challenged with OVA showed lower airway remodeling than genetically wild-type asthmatic mice. Thirdly, MIF can induce ASMC autophagy in vitro. Moreover, the cellular source of MIF which promoted ASMC autophagy was macrophages. Finally, MIF promoted ASMC autophagy in a CD74-dependent manner. Conclusions MIF can increase asthmatic airway remodeling by enhancing ASMC autophagy. Macrophage-derived MIF can promote ASMC autophagy by targeting CD74.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE Dupilumab is recommended to be administered biweekly to treat adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Real clinical practice data on the clinical efficacy of monthly dupilumab therapy are limited. We analyzed real clinical practice data on the clinical efficacy of monthly dupilumab therapy and predictive markers for favorable clinical responses to the therapy. METHODS Medical records of 57 adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD who received dupilumab therapy every 4 weeks for 16 weeks were analyzed retrospectively. Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) were recorded at baseline and week 16. Clinical responses to monthly dupilumab therapy were defined as the proportion of patients with decreased EASI scores of at least 50% or 75% from baseline at week 16 (EASI-50 or EASI-75). Blood eosinophil counts and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were measured at baseline and week 16. RESULTS Monthly dupilumab therapy showed EASI-50 and EASI-75 clinical responses in 48 (84.2%) and 27 (47.4%) of 57 patients at week 16, respectively. The percentage decrease in EASI scores from baseline at week 16 was significantly inversely correlated with baseline blood eosinophil count (correlation coefficient [r] = -0.405, P = 0.002) and baseline serum LDH level (r = -0.466, P < 0.001). The EASI-75 response rate was higher in patients with low (< 500/µL, 73.3%) than in those with high (≥ 500/µL, 37.5%) baseline blood eosinophil counts (P = 0.032), and was higher in patients with low (< 400 U/L, 55.6%) than those with high (≥ 400 U/L, 10.0%) baseline serum LDH levels (P = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS Monthly dupilumab therapy was clinically effective in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD in real clinical practice. Baseline blood eosinophil count and serum LDH level could be predictive markers for clinical response to dupilumab therapy.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to explore time trends in the prevalence of atopic dermatitis (AD) according to age in Korean children. We observed changes in the estimated annual prevalence of AD using data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) and Statistics Korea between 2003 and 2018. In each year, the highest prevalence was evident among children aged 12 to 23 months, and then the prevalence decreased with age. The annual prevalence of AD in Korean children under the age of 18 slightly increased from 4.0% in 2003 to 4.5% in 2018. During this period, the prevalence in children aged 6 to 18 years increased from 1.9% in 2003 to 3.1% in 2018, while that of infants aged less than 24 months substantially decreased. Among children who were born in 1991, 1997, 2000, 2003 and 2006, the slopes of decreasing trend lines over age 6 were similar. Comparing children born in 2009 and 2012 with those born before 2006, the more recent the birth year, the higher the prevalence of AD over age 6. In conclusion, time trends of the annual prevalence of AD in Korean children from 2003 through 2018 were different according to age group. These results suggest that AD development during infancy is decreasing whereas either a late-onset AD or early-onset, persistent phenotype is likely to increase. Different strategies according to age are required for more effective prevention and treatment of AD in Korean children.",

    "abstract": "The molecular links between metabolism and inflammation that drive different inflammatory phenotypes in asthma are poorly understood. We aimed to identify the metabolic signatures and underlying molecular pathways of different inflammatory asthma phenotypes.In the discovery set (n = 119), untargeted ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) was applied to characterize the induced sputum metabolic profiles of asthmatic patients with different inflammatory phenotypes using orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), and pathway topology enrichment analysis. In the validation set (n = 114), differential metabolites were selected to perform targeted quantification. Correlations between targeted metabolites and clinical indices in asthmatic patients were analyzed. Logistic and negative binomial regression models were established to assess the association between metabolites and severe asthma exacerbations.Seventy-seven differential metabolites were identified in the discovery set. Pathway topology analysis uncovered that histidine metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism as well as phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis were involved in the pathogenesis of different asthma phenotypes. In the validation set, 24 targeted quantification metabolites were significantly expressed between asthma inflammatory phenotypes. Finally, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (adjusted relative risk [adj RR] = 1.000; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.000-1.000; P = 0.050), allantoin (adj RR = 1.000; 95% CI = 1.000-1.000; P = 0.043) and nicotinamide (adj RR = 1.001; 95% CI = 1.000-1.002; P = 0.021) were demonstrated to predict severe asthma exacerbation rates.Different inflammatory asthma phenotypes have specific metabolic profiles in induced sputum. The potential metabolic signatures may identify therapeutic targets in different inflammatory asthma phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophilic asthma is associated with asthma exacerbation, steroid insensitivity, and severe asthma. Interleukin (IL)-24 is overexpressed in asthma and is involved in the pathogenesis of several allergic inflammatory diseases. However, the role and specific mechanism of IL-24 in neutrophilic asthma are unclear. We aimed to elucidate the roles of IL-24 and IL-37 in neutrophilic asthma, the relationships with IL-17A and the mechanisms regulating neutrophilic asthma progression.Purified human neutrophils were isolated from healthy volunteers, and a cell coculture system was used to evaluate the function of IL-24 in epithelium-derived IL-17A-dependent neutrophil migration. IL-37 or a small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting IL-24 was delivered intranasally to verify the effect in a murine model of house dust mite (HDM)/lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neutrophilic asthma.IL-24 enhanced IL-17A production in bronchial epithelial cells via the STAT3 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways; this effect was reversed by exogenous IL-37. Anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibodies reduced neutrophil chemotaxis induced by IL-24-treated epithelial cells in vitro. Increased IL-24 and IL-17A expression in the airway epithelium was observed in HDM/LPS-induced neutrophilic asthma. IL-37 administration or IL-24 silencing attenuated neutrophilic asthma, reducing IL-17A levels and decreasing neutrophil airway infiltration, airway hyperresponsiveness, and goblet cell metaplasia. Silencing IL-24 inhibited T-helper 17 (Th17) immune responses, but not Th1 or Th2 immune responses, in the lungs of a neutrophilic asthma model.IL-24 aggravated neutrophilic airway inflammation by increasing epithelium-derived IL-17A production, which could be suppressed by IL-37. Targeting the IL-24/IL-17A signaling axis is a potential strategy, and IL-37 is a potential candidate agent for alleviating neutrophilic airway inflammation in asthma.",

    "abstract": "Oral corticosteroids (OCS) are commonly used in patients with severe asthma, but they are associated with several adverse events. We estimated the prevalence of patients with OCS-dependent asthma in a large nationwide registry for severe asthma and delineated their clinical characteristics.This cross-sectional study analyzed enrollment data of the patients recruited in the Korean Severe Asthma Registry (KoSAR) from 2010 to 2019. The clinical characteristics of patients were compared according to OCS dependency, which was defined as maintenance OCS treatment lasting at least 6 months during the 12 months prior to enrollment.Among the 562 patients with severe asthma, 121 (21.5%) patients were defined as having OCS-dependent asthma. Compared with the OCS-independent group, the OCS-dependent group was older at symptom onset and had a higher prevalence of anxiety, worse lung function, and used more medication than the control group. Despite the higher doses of daily ICS and 6-month cumulative OCS, the OCS-dependent group reported greater consumption of relievers and a higher prevalence of unscheduled emergency room visits and repeated OCS bursts. Although anti-interleukin-5 was more commonly prescribed for patients with OCS-dependent asthma, only a limited proportion of patients with severe asthma received biologics.One-fifth of patients with severe asthma had OCS-dependency, which was associated with a greater disease burden compared to those with OCS-independent asthma. Active intervention including initiation of biologics and regular assessment of OCS-induced morbidities is warranted to reduce the use of OCS and its potential adverse effects.",

Clinical biomarkers have predictive value for the classification of CRSwNP. We aimed to evaluate the application of artificial neural network (ANN) modeling in distinguishing different endotypes of CRSwNP based on clinical biomarkers.Clinical parameters were collected from 109 CRSwNP patients, and their predictive ability was analyzed. ANN and logistic regression (LR) models were developed in the training group (72 patients) and further tested in the test group (37 patients). The output variable was the diagnosis of eCRSwNP, defined as tissue eosinophil count > 10 per high-power field. The receiver operating characteristics curve was used to assess model performance.A total of 15 clinical features from 60 healthy controls, 60 eCRSwNP and 49 non-eCRSwNP were selected as candidate predictors. Nasal nitric oxide levels, peripheral eosinophil absolute count, total immunoglobulin E, and ratio of bilateral computed tomography scores for the ethmoid sinus and maxillary sinus were identified as important features for modeling. Two ANN models based on 4 and 15 clinical features were developed to predict eCRSwNP, which showed better performance, with the area under the receiver operator characteristics significantly higher than those from the respective LR models (0.976 vs. 0.902, P = 0.048; 0.970 vs. 0.845, P = 0.011). All ANN models had better fits than single variable prediction models (all P < 0.05), and ANN model 1 had the best predictive performance among all models.Machine learning models assist clinicians in predicting endotypes of nasal polyps before invasive detection. The ANN model has the potential to predict eCRSwNP with high sensitivity and specificity, and is superior to the LR model. ANNs are valuable for optimizing personalized patient management.",

    "abstract": "Various therapeutic approaches, including supplemental nutritional support, have been tried for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). Previous studies have reported the role of vitamin D in the treatment of AD with inconsistent results. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of vitamin D in the treatment of AD, with considerations on the heterogeneities of AD. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation for AD treatment, published before June 30, 2021 were identified in the PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library databases. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation system. This meta-analysis included 5 RCTs with 304 cases of AD. We found that vitamin D supplementation did not decrease AD severity, even when AD was classified as severe vs non-severe. However, vitamin D supplementation was found to be effective in the treatment of AD in RCTs that included both children and adults, but not in those that included only children. Geographic location was associated with a significant difference in the therapeutic effect of vitamin D supplementation. Moreover, vitamin D supplementation of > 2,000 IU/day decreased AD severity, but supplementation ≤ 2,000 IU/day did not. Vitamin D supplementation, in general, was not effective for the treatment of AD. However, vitamin D supplementation might provide a therapeutic effect depending on the geographic location and dose of supplementation. The results of the present meta-analysis suggest that vitamin D supplementation might be targeted for patients with AD who may benefit from vitamin D supplementation.",

Therefore, this study investigated the association between AD and subsequent CVDs in adults newly diagnosed with AD.Datasets from the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort in South Korea from 2002 to 2015 were analyzed. The primary outcome was new-onset CVD, which included angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, stroke, or any revascularization procedure. The crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated in the AD group compared with the matched control group using the Cox proportional hazards regression models.A total of 40,512 individuals with AD were matched with 40,512 control subjects without AD. The overall incidence of CVDs was 2,235 (5.5%) and 1,640 (4.1%) in the AD and matched control groups, respectively. In the adjusted model, AD was associated with an increased risk of CVDs (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.33-1.52), angina pectoris (adjusted HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.36-1.63), myocardial infarction (adjusted HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.15-1.70), ischemic stroke (adjusted HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.20-1.49), and hemorrhagic stroke (adjusted HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.05-1.52). Most of the subgroup and sensitivity analysis results were consistent with those of the main analysis.The current study found that adult patients newly diagnosed with AD were at significantly increased risk for subsequent CVDs, suggesting the need to consider early prevention strategies for CVDs targeting patients with AD.",

Patients were assessed for demographics, history of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), asthma duration, acute exacerbation frequency, and lung function at baseline and then were prospectively followed up for 2 years. Serum total IgE and SE-sIgE levels were measured at baseline. Airflow obstruction was defined as forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio < 0.7 at baseline and FAO was defined as FEV1/FVC ratio < 0.7 over the 2-year follow-up.At baseline, the prevalence of airflow obstruction was 29.1%. Patients with airflow obstruction were significantly more likely to be male, and have a positive smoking history, comorbid CRS, and higher levels of SE-sIgE than those without airflow obstruction. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that airflow obstruction was significantly associated with current smoking and SE-sIgE sensitization at baseline. After the 2-year follow-up, baseline SE-sIgE sensitization was consistently related to FAO. Meanwhile, the number of exacerbations per year was significantly correlated with SE-sIgE levels.Baseline SE-sIgE sensitization was significantly associated with the number of asthma exacerbations and FAO after the 2-year follow-up in elderly asthmatics. These findings warrant further investigation of the direct and mediating roles of SE-sIgE sensitization on airway remodeling.",

Although numerous studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of probiotics on atopic dermatitis (AD) development, few have examined preventive and therapeutic effects of prebiotics on the onset and progression of AD.In this study, we investigated therapeutic and preventive effect of prebiotics, including β-glucan and inulin, using an oxazolone (OX)-induced AD-like mouse model. Prebiotics were orally administered 2 weeks after the end of sensitization period (therapeutic study) and 3 weeks before the initial sensitization (prevention study). The physiological and histological alterations in the skin and gut of the mice were investigated.In the therapeutic study, the severity of skin lesions and inflammatory responses were effectively reduced after administering β-glucan and inulin, respectively. The expression level of calprotectin was significantly decreased by approximately 2-fold (P < 0.05) in the skin and gut of prebiotics-treated mice compared to the control. In addition, epidermal thickness and the number of infiltrated immune cells were markedly reduced in the dermis of prebiotics-treated mice compared <strike>with</strike> to those in the OX-induced mice (P < 0.05). These findings were same as in the prevention study. Importantly, pre-administration of β-glucan and inulin prevented the progression of AD by promoting the growth of good bacteria in the gut of OX-induced AD mice. However, the co-administration of β-glucan and inulin did not show enhanced preventive effects on these alterations.Prebiotics has a therapeutic effect on AD in OX-induced AD mouse model. Moreover, our study suggests that prebiotics prevents the development of AD and this effect is associated with a change in gut microbiome.",

The EQ-5D index of CC patients was significantly lower than that of non-cough controls or healthy controls (0.82 ± 0.14 vs 0.92 ± 0.14/0.96 ± 0.08; P < 0.001, respectively). The index was also associated with older age (≥ 60 years), female sex, and comorbidities such as asthma or depression. Among the patients with CC, the index was significantly lower in patients with RUCC than in those with newly referred CC, being treated with codeine or cough neuromodulators, or with cough-related fatigue. In Spearman analyses, the EQ-5D index correlated with cough-specific quality of life and cough severity scores, not with throat sensation or cough trigger scores.The HRQoL impairment of CC patients was associated with older age, female sex, and comorbidities but it was also affected by cough severity, complications, treatments, and treatment responses. Longitudinal studies are warranted to further understand and improve the HRQoL of CC patients.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate skills in handling inhalers and factors associated with these skills among patients with asthma who had undergone treatment at special asthma and allergy clinics in Korea. We enrolled 78 subjects who used Turbuhaler and 145 who used Diskus for asthma control at special clinics in 10 university hospitals and visually assessed their skills in handling these inhalers. We also evaluated skills in 137 subjects who had used pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs) for symptom relief. Age, sex, duration of asthma and inhaler use, smoking status, monthly income, highest grade completed in school and previous instruction for handling inhalers were also measured to evaluate their association with overall inhaler skills. Performance grade was inadequate for 12.8% of participants using Turbuhaler, 6.2% for Diskus, and 23.4% for pMDIs. The success rates for each step in handling the inhalers were relatively high except for the \"exhale slowly to residual volume\" step, in which success rates ranged from 24.2% to 28.5%. Older age, male sex, lower educational grade, and absence of previous instruction for handling inhalers were associated with inadequate inhaler technique in univariate analysis; however, only older age and absence of previous instruction remained significant independent risk factors in multivariate analysis. Among Korean asthmatic patients in special asthma and allergy clinics, skills in handling their inhalers were mostly excellent; meanwhile, older age and absence of previous instruction for handling inhalers were associated with inadequate techniques.",

The concentration of house dust mite (HDM) allergens in beds also shows seasonal variation. This study examined the relationship between seasonal differences in the prevalence of EIB and sensitization to HDMs in patients with asthma.The medical records of 74 young adult male patients with asthma-like symptoms who underwent bronchial challenge with methacholine, 4.5% saline and exercise, and allergen skin prick tests, were reviewed. The subjects were divided into summer (n=27), spring/fall (n=26) and winter (n=21) groups according to the season during which they underwent testing.The positive responses to exercise differed according to season (48.1% in summer, 73.1% in spring/fall, and 90.5% in winter; P<0.01). In addition, the prevalence of positive responses to HDM (70.4%, 88.5%, and 95.2%, respectively; P<0.05) and pollen skin tests (37.0%, 19.2%, and 0%, respectively; P<0.01) also showed significant seasonal differences. Severe responses to 4.5% saline showed a similar trend, although it was not statistically significant (44.4%, 50.0%, and 71.4%, respectively; P=0.07). Skin test reactivity to HDMs was significantly related to maximal fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) following exercise (r=0.302, P<0.01) and the index of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to 4.5% saline (r=-0.232, P<0.05), but not methacholine (r=-0.125, P>0.05).Positive skin test reactions to HDMs and EIB occurred in winter, spring/fall, and summer in decreasing order of frequency.

However, the prevalence of toxocariasis in the general population is rarely reported.We investigated the seroprevalence of Toxocara larval antibody among asymptomatic people who attended Samsung Medical Center for a health checkup, including low-dose chest computed tomography (CT) between March 2012 and December 2013. A total of 633 people (400 men and 233 women) were prospectively recruited.The Toxocara-seropositive rate was 51.2% using the current cutoff value based on Toxocara enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (67.0% for men and 24.0% for women). In the multivariate-adjusted model, age (odds ratio [OR], 1.08; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 1.04-1.11), male sex (OR, 3.47; 95% CI, 2.26-5.33), rural residence (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.05-2.30), and history of raw liver intake (OR, 8.52; 95% CI, 3.61-20.11) were significantly associated with Toxocara seropositivity. When subjects were divided into 3 groups using cutoff values base on weak positive and strong positive control optical densities (ODs), the ORs for peripheral blood eosinophilia and serum hyperIgEaemia were 0.31 (95% CI, 0.02-2.89) in the weakpositive group and 36.64 (95% CI, 11.73-111.42) in the strong positive group compared to the seronegative group.

Regarding treatment, 49.1% of RW infants received inhaled corticosteroids, 55.7% oral corticosteroids, 26.3% antileukotrienes, 22.9% antibiotics ≥4 times mainly for common colds, wheezing, and pharyngitis, and 57.5% paracetamol ≥4 times. Tobacco smoking during pregnancy, household income per month <1,000 USD, history of parental asthma, male gender, and nursery school attendance were significant risk factors for higher prevalence and severity of RW, whereas breast-feeding for at least 3 months was a significant protective factor. Pneumonia and admissions for pneumonia were significantly higher in infants with RW as compared to the whole sample (3.5-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively).RW affects 1.6 out of 10 infants during the first year of life, with a high prevalence of severe episodes, frequent visits to the Emergency Department, and frequent admissions for wheezing. Besides the elevated prescription of asthma medications, there is an excessive use of antibiotics and paracetamol in infants with RW and also in the whole sample, which is mainly related to common colds.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate asthma control in elderly individuals and identify the factors that predict poor control. A retrospective, observational study evaluating 108 elderly individuals with asthma (59 females: ≥60 years, mean age: 70.5 years) was conducted at Ajou University Hospital from October 2010 to March 2011. Subjects were classified into two groups according to scores on the asthma control test (ACT). Group I consisted of 38 patients with ACT scores ≤19 (poor controllers) and group II included 70 patients with ACT scores >19 (controllers). Clinical data was analyzed. Spirometry was performed, and the ACT and asthma quality-of-life survey were completed. Medication possession ratios were calculated to evaluate compliance. Of the 108 enrolled subjects, 54.6% were female, 7.5% were obese, and 49.0% were atopic. The mean age of the patients was 70.5, and the average of time patients had suffered from asthma was 15.5 years. Comorbid conditions were found in more than 80% of the patients. Allergic rhinitis was most common comorbid condition; this was followed by cardiovascular disease and degenerative arthritis (76.9%, 65.7%, and 51.9%, respectively). Many patients (35.2%) were in poorly controlled states characterized by significantly lower asthma quality of life scores (P<0.001) and higher admission rates (P=0.034). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a history of pulmonary tuberculosis was a predictor of poorly controlled asthma in elderly individuals even after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, lung function and other comorbidities (OR=4.70, CI=1.06-20.81, P=0.042). The asthma of more than one-third of elderly individuals with this condition was poorly controlled, and a history of pulmonary tuberculosis may have contributed to this outcome. Proper evaluation and management of comorbid conditions in elderly patients with asthma is essential for the achievement of better control of the disease and a higher quality of life for those who suffer from it.",

    "abstract": "Purpose:The role of PM10 in the development of allergic diseases remains controversial among epidemiological studies, partly due to the inability to control for spatial variations in large-scale risk factors.This study aims to investigate spatial correspondence between the level of PM10 and allergic diseases at the sub-district level in Seoul, Korea, in order to evaluate whether the impact of PM10 is observable and spatially varies across the subdistricts.Methods: PM10 measurements at 25 monitoring stations in the city were interpolated to 424 sub-districts where annual inpatient and outpatient count data for 3 types of allergic diseases (atopic dermatitis, asthma, and allergic rhinitis) were collected.We estimated multiple ordinary least square regression models to examine the association of the PM10 level with each of the allergic diseases, controlling for various sub-district level covariates.Geographically weighted regression (GWR) models were conducted to evaluate how the impact of PM10 varies across the sub-districts.Results: PM10 was found to be a significant predictor of atopic dermatitis patient count (P<0.01), with greater association when spatially interpolated at the sub-district level.No significant effect of PM10 was observed on allergic rhinitis and asthma when socioeconomic factors were controlled for.GWR models revealed spatial variation of PM10 effects on atopic dermatitis across the sub-districts in Seoul.The relationship of PM10 levels to atopic dermatitis patient counts is found to be significant only in the Gangbuk region (P<0.01),along with other covariates including average land value, poverty rate, level of education and apartment rate (P<0.01).Conclusions: Our findings imply that PM10 effects on allergic diseases might not be consistent throughout Seoul.GIS-based spatial modeling techniques could play a role in evaluating spatial variation of air pollution impacts on allergic diseases at the sub-district level, which could provide valuable guidelines for environmental and public health policymakers.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Nasal cytology is important in the diagnosis and treatment of nasal inflammatory diseases.Treatment of allergic rhinitis (AR) according to nasal cytology has not been fully studied.We plan to explore the individualized treatment of AR according to nasal cytology.Methods: Nasal cytology from 468 AR patients was examined for inflammatory cell quantity (grade 0-5) and the percentage of neutrophils and eosinophils.Results were subdivided into the following categories: AR(Eos), eosinophil ≥50% of the whole inflammatory cells; AR(Neu), neutrophils ≥90%; AR(Eos/Neu), 10%≤ eosinophil <50%; AR(Low), grade 0/1 inflammatory cell quantity.Nasal cytology-guided treatment was implemented: all AR(Eos) patients (n=22) and half of the AR(Neu) patients (AR[Neu1], n=22) were treated with mometasone furoate spray and oral loratadine.Another half of the AR(Neu) patients (AR[Neu2], n=22) were treated with oral clarithromycin.Visual analog scale (VAS), symptom scores, and nasal cytology were evaluated 2 weeks before and after treatment.Results: There were 224/468 (47.86%)AR(Eos), 67/468 (14.32%)AR(Neu), 112/468 (23.93%)AR(Eos/ Neu), and 65/468 (13.89%)AR(Low) of the AR patients studied.There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics among these subgroups, except that the nasal blockage score was higher in AR(Eos) patients than in AR(Neu) patients (1.99 vs 1.50, P=0.02).Comparing AR(Eos) patients with AR(Neu1) patients 2 weeks after treatment, nasal symptoms and VAS were significantly lower in AR(Eos) patients, except for nasal blockage symptoms (P<0.05 of nasal itching and sneezing; P<0.01 for nasal secretion, total scores, and VAS).Comparing AR(Neu1) with AR(Neu2) patients, nasal symptoms, and VAS were significantly lower in AR(Neu2), except for nasal blockage and nasal itching symptoms (P<0.05 for nasal secretions, sneezing, total score, and VAS).Conclusions: Nasal cytology may have important value in subtyping AR and optimizing AR treatment.Treating neutrophils is very important in AR patients with locally predominant neutrophils.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have outlined mechanisms by which Mycoplasma pneumonia (M. pneumonia) infection may promote allergic lung inflammation and airway remodeling, and increasing evidence from human studies suggests that atypical bacterial infections contribute to asthma exacerbation, chronic asthma, and disease severity with changes in cytokine expression. The present study evaluated changes in serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin (IL)-5 in atopic children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia.We recruited a total of 72 children with pneumonia. The patients were divided into 4 groups: atopic children with M. pneumonia pneumonia (group I, n=24), non-atopic children with M. pneumonia pneumonia (group II, n=23), atopic children with viral pneumonia (group III, n=13), and non-atopic children with viral pneumonia (group IV, n=12). Serum levels of IL-5, IL-13, VEGF, and tumor necrosis factor-α were measured at admission and at recovery using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.Serum levels of VEGF and IL-5 were elevated in group I compared with the other groups at both admission phase and clinical recovery phase. In group I, serum levels of VEGF and IL-5 were higher at recovery phase than at admission phase (VEGF: 1,102.2±569.4 vs. 874.9±589.9 pg/mL, respectively; IL-5: 150.5±63.9 vs. 120.2±46.7 pg/mL, respectively).The serum levels of VEGF and IL-5 were more increased in atopic children with M. pneumonia pneumonia than in the other groups. In this group, the serum levels of VEGF and IL-5 were more increased at recovery phase than at admission phase. The results of this study suggest that increases in VEGF and IL-5 may contribute to the development of hypersensitivity during M. pneumonia infection. These cytokines may act through their respective pro-inflammatory pathways to aggravate the allergic status and induce airway hypersensitivity during M. pneumonia pneumonia in atopic children.",

    "abstract": "Childhood allergies are a serious problem, as they may lead to lifetime chronic disease. Determination of total and specific IgE levels is known to be a diagnostic tool for allergic sensitization; however, IgE levels are affected by various factors, such as age, sex, ethnicity, and geographic area. Thus, we evaluated the distribution of total and specific serum IgE levels against seven inhalant allergens in preschool children and examined their association with allergic diseases in Seoul, Korea. Total/specific serum IgE determination and skin prick tests for seven common allergens were performed on 509 children aged 3 to 6 years from 16 child care centers in Seoul, Korea. Demographic characteristics were surveyed from parents using a modified International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire. A diagnosis of atopic dermatitis was made by physicians. The geometric mean of total IgE was 80.48±3.80 kU/L in preschool children. IgE levels were higher in boys (boys, 102.34±3.52 kU/L; girls, 62.37±3.93 kU/L; P<0.001) and atopic subjects (atopic, 158.00±3.35 kU/L; non-atopic, 52.75±3.44 kU/L; P<0.001). An increased prevalence of atopy was associated with a high monthly household income (P=0.004) and higher maternal education level (above university-level education; P=0.009), as well as increased total IgE levels (P=0.036). Physician-diagnosed atopic dermatitis was associated with sensitization to inhalant allergens. Total IgE levels were very high as compared with those in previous reports from other countries. The most common sensitized allergen was Dermatophagoides farinae, and the positive response rate peaked at age 3 years and was maintained thereafter, particularly in boys. Specific IgE levels for seven inhalant allergens varied with age in preschool children. Although further investigations are needed with a broad range of ages and various allergens, the distribution of the total and specific serum IgE levels in preschool children might help to serve as a reference value to diagnose atopy.",

Detection of MRMP was based on specific point mutations in domain V of the 23S rRNA gene. The medical records of enrolled patients were reviewed retrospectively, and the clinical courses and laboratory data were compared.The macrolide resistance rate of M. pneumoniae was 51.1% (48/94) in the 2011 epidemic, and 87.2% (136/156) in the 2015 epidemic.

Overall severity of MRMP or macrolide-susceptible M. pneumoniae (MSMP) pneumonia over 2 epidemics was not significantly changed. However, the proportion of patients who had a fever lasting more than 72 hours after initiation of macrolides and who received corticosteroid treatment were higher in MRMP pneumonia during 2 epidemics.The macrolide resistance rate of M. pneumoniae has risen rapidly over 2 recent, consecutive epidemics, and this has been associated with a prolonged clinical course and increased use of corticosteroids to treat pediatric M. pneumoniae pneumonia.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Egg is the most common food allergen in infants.However, the natural course of egg allergy has not been fully elucidated.This study aimed to describe clinical characteristics and to identify prognostic factors associated with tolerance acquisition of immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated egg allergy in children.Methods: Children who underwent more than 1 follow-up egg white-specific immunoglobulin E (EWsIgE) test between November 2005 and November 2015 at -Severance Children's Hospital were assessed.Children were diagnosed as having IgE-mediated egg allergy based on immediate allergic reaction after egg consumption and an EWsIgE level of > 0.35 kU/L.The children were divided into \"tolerant\" and \"persistent\" groups according to tolerance acquisition defined as egg consumption without adverse allergic reactions.Results: Of 124 participants, egg allergy resolved in 101 (81.5%) children.The persistent group had more atopic dermatitis (P = 0.039), and more wheat (P = 0.009) and peanut (P = 0.012) allergies compared to the tolerant group.The EWsIgE levels at diagnosis (EWsIgE diag ) were higher in the persistent group than in the tolerant group (P = 0.001).The trend of the EWsIgE levels in the tolerant group decreased markedly over time compared to the persistent group (P < 0.001).In predicting egg allergy tolerance acquisition, the reduction rate of EWsIgE level after 12 months from diagnosis (ΔEWsIgE 12mo ) tended to be more accurate than EWsIgE diag (area under the curve: 0.835 vs. 0.731).When ΔEWsIgE 12mo was ≥ 30%, tolerance acquisition was more frequent than that of < 30% (91.9% vs. 57.9%;P < 0.001).Conclusions: ΔEWsIgE 12mo can be used as an early independent predictor of tolerance acquisition of IgE-mediated egg allergy in children.",

The objective of this study was to compare epinephrine use between pediatric and adult patients who were treated with anaphylaxis in the emergency department (ED).The data were retrieved from the National Sample Cohort of South Korea, which contains claim data from the National Health Insurance Service. We included patients who visited the ED with a discharge code of anaphylaxis between 2004 and 2013. We assessed prescription information of epinephrine, antihistamine and systemic steroid, previous medical history and discharge disposition from the ED. The study population was categorized based on age at the visit.A total of 175 pediatric and 1,605 adult patients with anaphylaxis were identified. Only 42 (24%) of the pediatric patients were treated with epinephrine, while 592 (36.9%) of the adult patients were treated with epinephrine (P = 0.001). Furthermore, the pediatric patients were less likely to be treated with systemic steroid than the adult patients (6.9% vs. 12.3%, P = 0.047). The odds ratios for the administration of epinephrine relative to the baseline in the 19-65 age group were 0.34 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15-0.67), 0.56 (95% CI, 0.28-1.03) and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.45-1.33) in the < 7, 7-12 and 13-18 age groups, respectively.The pediatric patients with anaphylaxis experienced a lower rate of epinephrine injection use than the adult patients and the injection use decreased as age decreased.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing epidemiological evidence of an association between childhood obesity and atopic dermatitis, but little is known about the underlying mechanism(s). In the present study, we used a rat model of atopic dermatitis to assess whether juvenile obesity, induced by reduction of litter size, aggravated the signs of atopic dermatitis and, if so, whether this aggravation was associated with changes in plasma concentration of adipokines, such as leptin and adiponectin. Dermatitis was induced by neonatal capsaicin treatment. Body weight, dermatitis score, serum IgE, skin nerve growth factor (NGF), serum leptin and adiponectin, and cytokine mRNA expression in the skin lesion were compared between small (SL, 5 pups) and large litters (LL, 15 pups). The body weight of juvenile rats up to 6 weeks of age was significantly heavier in the SL group, compared with those in the LL group. The SL group showed more robust development of dermatitis, and higher levels of serum IgE and skin NGF than the LL group. Additionally, the SL group demonstrated higher levels of leptin and pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA but lower levels of adiponectin than the LL group. These results suggest a causal link between a decrease in immunological tolerance, induced by juvenile obesity, and aggravation of atopic dermatitis.",

Microarrays were used for genome-wide methylation analysis.Results: Prenatal exposure to indoor PM2.5 increased the susceptibility of lower RTIs (LRTIs) in infancy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=2.11).In terms of combined exposure to both indoor PM2.5 and ETS, prenatal exposure to both pollutants increased susceptibility to LRTIs (aOR=6.56);however, this association was not found for postnatal exposure.The Nrf2 GG (aOR=23.69),GSTM1 null (aOR=8.18),and GSTP1 AG or GG (aOR=7.37)genotypes increased the combined LRTIs-promoting effects of prenatal exposure to the 2 indoor pollutants.Such effects of prenatal indoor PM2.5 and ETS exposure were not found for upper RTIs.Conclusions: Prenatal exposure to both indoor PM2.5 and ETS may increase susceptibility to LRTIs.This effect can be modified by polymorphisms in reactive oxygen species-related genes.",

    "abstract": "Allergic rhinitis (AR) has become a global issue for a large part of the general population. Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) has been used extensively to treat persistent allergic rhinitis (PAR). Although systematic reviews have confirmed the effectiveness of SLIT for the treatment of AR, a considerable number of studies using extracts of house dust mites (HDMs) for immunotherapy found no consensus on basic treatment parameters and questioned the efficacy of SLIT.In this study, we evaluated SLIT for PAR by a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library database searches were performed for RCTs on the treatment of PAR by SLIT that assessed clinical outcomes related to efficacy through May 2016. Descriptive and quantitative information was abstracted. An analysis was performed with standardized mean differences (SMDs) under a fixed or random effects model. Subgroup analyses were performed. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I² metric.In total, 25 studies were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis for symptom scores and 15 studies for medication scores. SLIT was significantly different from the controls for symptom scores (SMD=1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.74 to 0.73; P<0.001). For medication scores, significant differences for SLIT were also observed versus the controls (SMD=-1.39; 95% CI=-1.90 to -0.88; P<0.001).Our meta-analysis indicates that SLIT provided significant symptom relief and reduced the need for medications in PAR. In this study, significant evidence was obtained despite heterogeneity with regard to the use of mite extract. Specifically, the mite extract used was provided by the patients with PAR. Furthermore, to confirm both the objective outcomes and the effective doses of HDM allergen extracts, experimental data should be obtained from large high-quality population-based studies.",

    "abstract": "Asthma in the elderly has different clinical features including more severe phenotypes with higher comorbidities. Epithelial cells are known to initiate innate/adaptive immune responses in asthmatic airways. We investigated clinical features and epithelial derived cytokine levels in elderly asthmatics compared to non-elderly asthmatics in a cross-sectional cohort of adult asthmatics in order to further understand its pathogenic mechanisms.A total of 1,452 adult asthmatics were enrolled from a single tertiary hospital and were classified into 2 groups: 234 elderly (≥ 60 years at initial diagnosis) and 1,218 non-elderly (< 60 years at initial diagnosis) asthmatics. Asthma-related clinical parameters were compared between the 2 groups. Serum levels of epithelial cell-derived cytokines including interleukin (IL)-31, IL-33, IL-8, eotaxin-2, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) and periostin were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Significantly higher prevalence rates of late-onset asthma (onset age ≥ 40 years) and severe asthma, as well as the lower rate of atopy, blood/sputum eosinophil counts, total immunoglobulin E and eosinophil cationic protein levels were noted in elderly asthmatics compared to non-elderly asthmatics (P < 0.05, respectively). The forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1, % predicted) level tended to be lower in elderly asthmatics (P = 0.07). In addition, serum IL-33 and IL-31 levels were significantly lower in elderly asthmatics, while no differences were found in the serum level of IL-8, eotaxin-2, TGF-β1 or periostin. Among elderly asthmatics, subjects with severe asthma had lower FEV1 (% predicted) value, but showed significantly higher serum levels of eotaxin-2 and TGF-β1, than those with non-severe asthma (P < 0.05 for each).These findings suggest that age-related changes of epithelial cell-derived cytokines may affect clinical phenotypes and severity of elderly asthma: decreased levels of IL-33 and IL-31 may contribute to less Th2 phenotype, while increased levels of eotaxin-2 and TGF-β1 may contribute to severity.",

Given the importance of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) in inflammation, this study focused on the role of NF-κB in the pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNPs) in Asian patients.A total of 46 patients were enrolled in this study (22 diagnosed with CRSwNPs, 10 with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps [CRSsNP], and 14 control subjects). Nasal polyps and uncinate tissues (UTs) were collected and the tissues prepared for hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemistric (IHC) analysis. Total RNA was isolated for real-time polymerase chain reaction for p65, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and eotaxin.In the CRSwNPs group, 50% of nasal polyps were non-eosinophilic. IHC revealed a significantly higher fraction of NF-κB p65-positive cells in nasal polyps of the CRSwNPs group than in the UTs of control and CRSsNP groups. No difference in NF-κB p65-positive cell fraction was observed between eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic nasal polyps. The mRNA expression of p65, IL-6, IL-8, and eotaxin was significantly higher in nasal polyps of the CRSwNPs than in the UTs of control and CRSsNP group. However, no difference in expression was observed between eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic nasal polyps, with the exception of IL-1β expression.Elevated expression of NF-κB- and NF-κB-associated inflammatory cytokines suggests NF-κB as the key factor for CRSwNPs pathogenesis in Asian patients. Understanding NF-κB-associated mechanisms will provide a deeper insight into CRSwNPs pathogenesis and ultimately improve therapeutic strategies for CRSwNPs.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: This study aimed to systemically review literature relating to factors that could potentially predict a favorable response to cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment for chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU).Methods: A systematic literature review was done according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis recommendations.Results: A total of 13 studies (404 patients with CSU and 200 healthy patients) were included.There were only 1 randomized controlled trial (RCT) and 12 non-RCTs.Our systematic review showed that positive autologous serum skin test results, positive baseline basophil histamine release assays, positive baseline basophil activation test responses, elevated baseline plasma D-dimer levels, elevated baseline serum interleukin (IL)-2, IL-5, and tumor necrosis factoralpha (TNF-α) levels, and low baseline serum IgE levels might assist in predicting favorable CsA responses in CSU patients.Decreased plasma D-dimer levels; and decreased serum IL-2, IL-5, and TNF-α levels were reported to be correlated with clinical improvement after CsA treatment.Conclusions: Since most positive results were from non-RCT articles and some data were still inconsistent, this systematic review identified no reliable practical biomarker for predicting CsA treatment response in patients with CSU.There were no positive predictors with good consistency and mechanical plausibility.",

We compared the 2 systems using sera from 260 Korean allergy patients suffering from asthma (26.5%), allergic rhinitis (42.3%), atopic dermatitis (67.7%), and food allergy (18.1%). We compared sIgE-measurement results for 7 inhalant allergens, 5 food allergens, and 4 microorganism allergens. Overall, 1,799 paired assay results were analyzed. Except mugwort and alternaria, most of the allergen-sIgE results showed intra-class correlation coefficients of >0.5. Inter-assay class associations were reliable for most allergens (gamma=0.858-0.987, P<0.001). Passing-Bablok regression analysis showed multiple differences in intercept and slope. The inter-method concordance was moderate to substantial for most allergens (κ=0.713-0.898, P<0.001). The PROTIA™ Allergy-Q® EIA system exhibited good detection performance compared to the ImmunoCAP® FEIA system in Korean allergic patients. However, because of methodological differences between the 2 assays, careful clinical implication is required for the interpretation of Allergy-Q® EIA results.",

PEDF possesses powerful anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, antiangiogenic, and antifibrosis properties. It has been reported that PEDF can regulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. This study aimed to evaluate whether recombinant PEDF protein could attenuate allergic airway inflammation and airway remodeling via the negative regulation of VEGF using a murine model of chronic ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma and BEAS-2B human bronchial epithelial cells.In an in vivo experiment, mice sensitized with OVA were chronically airway challenged with aerosolized 1% OVA solution for 8 weeks. Treated mice were given injections of recombinant PEDF protein (50 or 100 μg/kg body weight) via the tail vein. In an in vitro experiment, we investigated the effects of recombinant PEDF protein on VEGF release levels in BEAS-2B cells stimulated with IL-1β.Recombinant PEDF protein significantly inhibited eosinophilic airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and airway remodeling, including goblet cell hyperplasia, subepithelial collagen deposition, and airway smooth muscle hypertrophy. In addition, recombinant PEDF protein suppressed the enhanced expression of VEGF protein in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in OVA-challenged chronically allergic mice. In the in vitro experiment, VEGF expression was increased after IL-1β stimulation. Pretreatment with 50 and 100 ng/mL of recombinant PEDF protein significantly attenuated the increase in VEGF release levels in a concentration-dependent manner in BEAS-2B cells stimulated by IL-1β.These results suggest that recombinant PEDF protein may abolish the development of characteristic features of chronic allergic asthma via VEGF suppression, providing a potential treatment option for chronic airway inflammation diseases such as asthma.",

The transmembrane glycoprotein CD93 is involved in endothelial cell migration, angiogenesis, leukocytes extravasation, apoptosis, innate immunity and inflammation. Relationships between the serum level of soluble CD93 (sCD93) and acute myocardial infarction/premature MI/inflammatory arthritis/skin sclerosis have recently been reported. We hypothesized that sCD93 would be elevated during the acute phase of asthma. We measured the serum level of sCD93 in 57 patients with asthma exacerbation and 57 age-and gender-matched healthy controls. Additionally, sCD93 was reassessed at the time of discharge from the hospital. Clinical characteristics and peak expiratory flow (PEF) of the patients were assessed. The primary outcome was the comparison of serum level of sCD93 between asthmatics and healthy subjects. The sCD93 values ranged from 128 to 789 ng/mL in asthmatics (345.83±115.81) and from 31 to 289 ng/mL in control subjects (169.46±62.43). The difference between the 2 groups was statistically significant (P<0.001). The association between sCD93 and asthma remained significant after adjusting for age, sex, and BMI. The differences between asthmatics and controls remained significant on the last day of hospital stay. The association between sCD93 and PEF was not significant. In conclusion, the serum level of soluble CD93 is increased in patients with asthma exacerbation. It also showed that serum levels of sCD93 decreased with treatment of asthma attack. The clinical usefulness of determination of sCD93 as a biomarker of asthma requires further studies.",

To improve disease control and reduce economic burden, a large sample survey among this patient population is indispensable. This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of such patients.A retrospective study was conducted on patients hospitalized for asthma exacerbation in 29 hospitals of 29 regions in mainland China during the period 2013 to 2014. Demographic features, pre-admission conditions, exacerbation details, and outcomes were summarized. Risk factors for exacerbation severity were analyzed.There were 3,240 asthmatic patients included in this study (57.7% females, 42.3% males). Only 28.0% used daily controller medications; 1,287 (39.7%) patients were not currently on inhaled corticosteroids. Acute upper airway infection was the most common trigger of exacerbation (42.3%). Patients with severe to life-threatening exacerbation tended to have a longer disease course, a smoking history, and had comorbidities such as hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and food allergy. The multivariate analysis showed that smoking history, comorbidities of hypertension, COPD, and food allergy were independent risk factors for more severe exacerbation. The number of patients hospitalized for asthma exacerbation varied with seasons, peaking in March and September. Eight patients died during the study period (mortality 0.25%).Despite enhanced education on asthma self-management in China during recent years, few patients were using daily controller medications before the onset of their exacerbation, indicating that more educational efforts and considerations are needed. The findings of this study may improve our understanding of hospital admission for asthma exacerbation in mainland China and provide evidence for decision-making.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE Anti-tuberculosis drugs (ATDs) can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). Underlying tuberculous infection and co-administration of multiple drugs may contribute to the complexity of ATD-related SCARs. This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of ATD-related SCARs. METHODS We analyzed ATD-related SCAR cases in 2010-2015, selected from a web-based Database of the Korean Registry of SCAR. RESULTS Among 783, 53 patients with ATD-induced SCARs were enrolled, including 12 with SJS/TEN (22.6%) and 41 with DRESS (77.4%). When comparing the ATD and non-ATD groups, the prevalence of DRESS patients was higher in the ATD group than in the non-ATD group (77.4% vs. 45.8%, P < 0.001). Among patients with ATD-related SCARs, those with SJS/TEN were significantly older, had higher intensive care unit admissions, and had higher mortality than those with DRESS (70.5 vs. 50.0 years, P < 0.001; 41.7% vs. 6.1%, P = 0.010; and 33.3% vs. 2.5%, P = 0.003, respectively). ATDs were challenged in 14 cases. The ATD associated most often with SCAR cases was rifampin (81.8%), followed by isoniazid (66.7%), ethambutol (50.0%), pyrazinamide (33.3%). Six patients (42.9%) had hypersensitivity reactions to 2 or more drugs. CONCLUSIONS DRESS was more common among the ATD-related SCAR cases. Although treatment with most ATDs carries the risk of SCAR development, the use of rifampin was most frequently involved in the occurrence of SCARs. Multiple hypersensitivity was frequently observed in ATD-related SCARs.",

However, they are not established in clinical practice because a large variability of response in healthy subjects limits their diagnostic value. There is a paucity of studies that have investigated CPT reference ranges in healthy subjects. This systematic review describes the variability of the responses to CPTs in healthy subjects and factors that influence it. A new analysis of 134 healthy subjects was conducted to create reference ranges for single-breath capsaicin CPT by calculating the interquartile ranges for the provocative concentration of capsaicin to induce 2 and 5 coughs. Female subjects had a more sensitive cough reflex than male counterparts. The ability of CPTs to distinguish various respiratory diseases from healthy subjects was also reviewed. Cough sensitivity was consistently heightened in the following groups: unselected patients with chronic, refractory, or recurrent cough, unexplained chronic cough, gastro-esophageal reflux-associated cough, cough-variant asthma, lower airway symptoms induced by chemical irritants, and fibrotic interstitial lung diseases. In the following groups, hypersensitivity of the cough reflex was present in those individuals whose symptom profile was predominated by cough: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, and sarcoidosis. In the following conditions, patients usually cough in order to expectorate mucus from their airways, not because of a hypersensitive cough reflex arc: productive cough, asthma, upper airway cough syndrome, COPD, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, and chronic respiratory infections. CPTs have the potential to identify patients with chronic respiratory symptoms due to cough reflex hypersensitivity, thereby providing a targeted approach for therapy.",

Additionally, the dysfunctional epithelial barrier is influential in allowing allergens and irritants to penetrate the skin or mucosa, leading to the release of proinflammatory cytokines and mediators to drive type 2 tissue inflammation and the onset of allergy. There are numerous factors related to skin, airway, and gut epithelial barriers dysfunction, and genetic predispositions are also present.

It is involved in the celery-birch-mugwort-spice syndrome and cross-reactivities were reported with latex. Several allergens have been described, but only 2 are referenced in the World Health Organization/International Union of Immunological Societies allergen data bank, a thaumatin-like protein and a profilin. A patient allergic to bell/chili pepper, peach, orange and Japanese cedar pollen was clinically and biologically analyzed including direct and competitive immunoblots and basophil activation tests (BATs) with allergenic source extracts and recombinant gibberellin-regulated proteins (GRPs). The patient was shown to be sensitized to Cap a 7, the GRP of Capsicum annuum newly described herein. Cross-reactivities were demonstrated between various GRPs from bell/chili pepper, peach, orange and Japanese cedar pollen either in native form in the different extracts or as recombinant allergens. A similar immunoglobulin E reactivity was found also in Capsicum chinense and against snakin-1, the GRP from potato. The patient showed a positive BAT with recombinant Cry j 7, Pru p 7 and Cap a 7, but not with recombinant snakin-1. Despite the ubiquitous nature of GRPs in plants and the immunochemical cross-reactivity observed between different GRPs, clinically relevant sensitization to this protein family seems restricted to some allergenic sources, often associated with Cupressaceae pollen allergy, and to some patients, therefore reflecting very specific and peculiar mechanisms of conditional sensitization.",

    "abstract": "Immunoglobulin (Ig) E and IgG anti-thyroid autoantibodies (AAbs) play important roles in the immunopathogenesis of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). To date, association of IgE and IgG AAbs with Chinese CSU patients has not been fully investigated. We aimed to explore prevalence rates of IgE and IgG AAbs in Chinese CSU patients and their association with clinical and laboratory parameters. Serum IgE and IgG AAbs against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin (TG), total IgE (tIgE) and specific IgEs were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, chemiluminescence microparticle immunoassay and immunoblotting. Meta-analyses and literature review were conducted. The meta-analyses indicated that CSU cases were 4.98, 6.90 and 6.68 times more likely to have positive anti-TPO IgE, anti-TPO IgG and anti-TG IgG (all P < 0.001) compared with controls, respectively, and revealed a positive correlation between the prevalence rates of anti-TPO IgE and anti-TPO IgG (r = 0.53, P = 0.025). A total of 1,100 Chinese Han adult CSU patients and 1,100 ethnicity-, age- and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited from 15 centers. Prevalence rates of anti-TPO IgE, anti-TPO IgG, anti-TG IgE or anti-TG IgG in the patients were all significantly higher than those in the controls. Significant correlations were observed between prevalence rates of anti-TPO IgE and anti-TPO IgG (r = 0.297, P < 0.001) as well as between those of anti-TG IgE and anti-TG IgG in the patients (r = 0.137, P < 0.001). Patients with anti-TPO IgE or anti-TPO IgG had significantly lower tIgE levels (P < 0.001). Positive anti-TPO IgE, positive anti-TPO IgG and tIgE < 40 IU/mL were independent predictors of antihistamine-refractory cases. In conclusion, the prevalence rates of IgE and IgG AAbs in Chinese CSU patients are significantly elevated and reciprocally correlated. This study verifies the results of previous case-control studies of CSU patients from other populations and ethnicities.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades, the concept of severe asthma has evolved from an umbrella term encompassing patients with high-intensity treatment needs to a clinical syndrome with heterogeneous, albeit distinct, pathophysiological processes. Biased and unbiased cluster approaches have been used to identify several clinical phenotypes. In parallel, cellular and molecular approaches allow for the development of biological therapies, especially targeting type 2 (T2) cytokine pathways. Although T2-biologics have significantly improved clinical outcomes for patients with severe asthma in real-world practice, questions on the proper use of biologics remain open. Furthermore, a subset of severe asthma patients remains poorly controlled. The unmet needs require a new approach. The \"treatable traits\" concept has been suggested to address a diversity of pathophysiological factors in severe asthma and overcome the limitations of existing treatment strategies. With a tailored therapy that targets the treatable traits in individual patients, better personalized medical care and outcomes should be achieved.",

This review discusses the different approaches to managing young children with wheezy illnesses presented in recently published global guidelines. Four major guidelines published since 2007 are considered. Helpful approaches are presented to assist the clinician to decide whether a clinical diagnosis of asthma can, or should be made in a young child with a recurrent wheezy illness and which treatments would be appropriate, dependent on risk factors, age of presentation, response to initial treatment and safety considerations. Each of the guidelines provide useful information for clinicians assessing young children with recurrent wheezy illnesses. There are differences in classification of the disease and treatment protocols. Although a firm diagnosis of asthma may only be made retrospectively in some cases and there are several effective guidelines to initiating treatment. Consistent review of the need for ongoing treatment with a particular pharmacological modality is essential, since many children with recurrent wheezing in infancy go into spontaneous remission. It is probable that newer biomarkers of airway inflammation will assist the clinician as to when to initiate and when to continue pharmacological treatment in the future.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is usually present not only in the skin lesions of atopic dermatitis (AD) but also in the atopic dry skin. SA discharges various toxins and enzymes that injure the skin, results in activation of epidermal keratinocytes, which produce and release IL-18. IL-18 that induces the super Th1 cells secreting IFN-γ and IL-13 is supposed to be involved in development of AD and its pathogenesis. Indeed, the number of SA colonies on the skin surface and the serum IL-18 levels in patients with AD significantly correlated with the skin scores of AD lesions. Also, there is strong positive correlation between the skin scores and serum IL-18 levels in DS-Nh mice (P<0.0001, r=0.64), which develop considerable AD-like legions when they are housed under conventional conditions, but develop skin legions with less severity and less frequency under specific pathogens free (SPF) conditions. Therefore, they are well-known as model mice of AD, in which SA is presumed to be critical factor for the development of AD lesions. Also, theses DS-Nh mice pretreated with Cy developed more remarkable AD-like lesions in comparison with non-treated ones. The levels of INF-r and IL-13 in the supernatants of the lymph node cell cultures stimulated with staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) or ConA were increased in the Cy-treated mice, although the serum levels of total IgE were not. In this experiment, we revealed that Cy-treated mice, to which CD25 +CD4 + reguratory T cells taken from non-treated ones had been transferred, developed the AD-like legions with less severity and less number of SA colonies on the skin surface. Therefore, it is presumed that CD25 +CD4 + reguratory T cells might be involved in the suppression of super Th1 cells which are induced by IL-18 and are involved in the development of AD-like lesions rather than IgE production. The efficient induction of CD25 +CD4 + reguratory T cells is expected for the new type of treatment of AD. We also found that farnesol (F) and xylitol (X) synergistically inhibited biofilm formation by SA, and indeed the ratio of SA in total bacteria at sites to which the FX cream containing F and X had been applied was significantly decreased 1 week later, accompanied with improvement of AD, when compared with that before application and at placebo sites. Therefore, the FX cream is a useful skin-care agent for atopic dry skin colonized by SA. The nerve growth factor (NGF) in the horny layer (the horn NGF) of skin lesions on the cubital fossa was collected by tape stripping and measured using ELISA in AD patients before and after 2 and 4 weeks treatments. Simultaneously, the itch and eruptions on the whole body and on the lesions, in which the horn NGF was measured, were recorded, and also the peripheral blood eosinophil count, serum LDH level and serum total IgE level were examined. The level of NGF was significantly higher in AD patients than in healthy controls, correlated with the severity of itch, erythema, scale/xerosis, the eosinophil count and LDH level, and also significantly decreased after treatments with olopatadine and/or steroid ointment for 2 and 4 weeks. Therefore, the measurement of the NGF by this harmless method seems to be useful to assess the severity of AD and the therapeutic effects on AD. In AD patients, C-fiber in the epidermis increase and sprout, inducing hypersensitivity, which is considered to aggravate the disease. Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A), an axon guidance molecule, is a potent inhibitor of neurite outgrowth of sensory neurons. We administered recombinant Sema3A intracutaneously into the skin lesions of NC/Nga mice, an animal model of AD, and investigated the effect of Sema3A on the skin lesions and their itch. Sema3A dose-dependently improved skin lesions and attenuated the scratching behavior in NC/Nga mice. Histological examinations revealed a decrease in the epidermal thickness, the density of invasive nerve fibers in the epidermis, inflammatory infiltrate including mast cells and CD4 +T cells, and the production of IL-4 in the Sema3A-treated lesions. Because the interruption of the itch-scratch cycle likely contributes to the improvement of the AD-like lesions, Sema3A is expected to become a promising treatment of patients with refractory AD.",

AD patients were divided into two groups: 1) AD with egg allergy, consisting of 96 patients with egg allergies as determined by egg-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) reactivity; and 2) AD without egg allergy, consisting of 89 patients without egg allergies.

    "abstract": "Purpose: Several lines of evidence indicate that the Hippo/Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) pathways might play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma.To investigate the possible role of the Hippo/YAP1 pathway in the pathogenesis of asthma or its phenotypes.Methods: The levels of gene expressions of the members of the Hippo/YAP1 were compared.The presence of the proteins of the YAP1 and FRMD6 were analyzed with Western blot in induced sputum of 18 asthmatic subjects and 10 control subjects.Fourteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the YAP1 gene were genotyped in 522 asthmatic subjects and 711 healthy controls.The results were evaluated with traditional frequentist methods and with Bayesian network-based Bayesian multilevel analysis of relevance (BN-BMLA).Results: The mRNA of all the members of the Hippo/YAP1 pathway could be detected in the induced sputum of both controls and cases.A correlation was found between YAP1 mRNA levels and sputum bronchial epithelial cells (r=0.575,P=0.003).The signal for the FRMD6 protein could be detected in all sputum samples while the YAP1 protein could not be detected in the sputum samples, of the healthy controls and severe asthmatics, but it was detectable in mild asthmatics.The rs2846836 SNP of the YAP1 gene was significantly associated with exercise-induced asthma (odds ratio [OR]=2. 1 [1.3-3.4];P=0.004).The distribution of genotypes of rs11225138 and certain haplotypes of the YAP1 gene showed significant differences between different asthma severity statuses.With BN-BMLA, 2 SNPs, genetic variations in the FRMD6 gene proved to be the most relevant to exercise-induced asthma and allergic rhinitis.These 2 SNPs through allergic rhinitis and exercise-induced asthma were in epistatic interaction with each other.Conclusions: Our results provided additional evidence that the FRMD6/Hippo/YAP1 pathway plays a role in the pathogenesis of asthma.If additional studies can confirm these findings, this pathway can be a potential novel therapeutic target in asthma and other inflammatory airway diseases.",

    "abstract": "The rising incidence of allergic disorders in developed countries is unexplained.Exposure to traffic related air pollutants may be an important cause of wheezing and asthma in childhood.Experimental evidence from human studies suggests that diesel exhaust particles, constituents of fine particulate matter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5), may act to enhance IgE mediated aeroallergen sensitization and Th2 directed cytokine responses.To date, epidemiologic investigations indicate that children living in close proximity to heavily travelled roads are more likely to be atopic and wheeze.The Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study (CCAAPS) birth cohort study was initiated to test the hypothesis that early high exposure to traffic related air pollutants is associated with early aeroallergen sensitization and allergic respiratory phenotypes.Using an exposure cohort design, more than 700 infants born to atopic parents were recruited at age 1 living either less than 400 meters (high traffic pollutant exposure) or greater than 1,500 meters (low exposure) from a major road.Children were medically evaluated and underwent skin prick testing with aeroallergen at screening, and re-evaluated sequentially at ages 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7.In this study, both proximity and land use regression (LUR) models of traffic air pollutant exposure have been assessed.Proximity to stop and go traffic with large concentrations of bus and truck traffic predicted persistent wheezing during infancy.The LUR model estimated elemental carbon attributable to traffic (ECAT) as a proxy for diesel exhaust particulate exposure.High ECAT was significantly associated with wheezing at age 1 as well as persistent wheezing at age 3. High mold exposure predicted a well defined asthma phenotype at age 7.",

    "abstract": "Airway inflammation, bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR), and bronchodilator response (BDR) are representative characteristics of asthma. Because allergic rhinitis (AR) is a risk factor for asthma development, we evaluated these 3 characteristics in AR using measurement of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), a methacholine challenge test (MCT), and impulse oscillometry (IOS).This study included 112 children with asthma (asthma group), 196 children with AR (AR group), and 32 control subjects (control group). We compared pulmonary function parameters and FeNO levels among the 3 groups. The AR group was subdivided into 2 categories: the AR group with BHR and the AR group without, and again pulmonary function and FeNO levels were compared between the 2 subgroups.FeNO levels were more increased in the AR and asthma groups than in the control group; within the AR group, FeNO was higher in the AR group with BHR than in the AR group without. The BDR was more increased in the AR group than in the control group when percent changes in reactance at 5 Hz (Δ X5) and reactance area (Δ AX) were compared. In the AR group, however, there was no difference in Δ X5 and Δ AX between the AR group with BHR and the AR group without.Reversible airway obstruction on IOS and elevated FeNO levels were observed in children with AR. Because elevated FeNO levels can indicate airway inflammation and because chronic inflammation may lead to BHR, FeNO levels may be associated with BHR in AR. IOS can be a useful tool for detecting lower airway involvement of AR independent of BHR assessed in the MCT.",

    "abstract": "Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is characterized by the excessive production of mucus. However, the molecular mechanism underlying mucin overproduction in CRS with or without nasal polyps (CRSwNP and CRSsNP, respectively) is poorly understood. This study was conducted to assess the importance of the transcription factor FoxA2 in mucin production and to investigate the targeting of FoxA2 as a potential therapeutic strategy for mucus hypersecretion in CRS patients. We enrolled 15 CRSwNP patients, 15 CRSsNP patients, and 10 normal controls in this study. The expression levels of FoxA2, MUC5AC, and MUC5B in inflamed and healthy nasal tissues were examined via immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and the levels of several proinflammatory cytokines in nasal secretions were measured via FlowCytomix analysis. In addition, the expression of MUC5AC and FoxA2 was determined in polyp-derived epithelial cells and NCI-H292 cells after in vitro stimulation. FoxA2 was significantly down-regulated, and MUC5AC and MUC5B were significantly up-regulated in both the CRSwNP and CRSsNP patients compared to the controls (P<0.05), and the protein level of FoxA2 was negatively associated with the IL-6 level in the CRS patients (P<0.05). IL-6 significantly increased MUC5AC expression but inhibited FoxA2 expression in vitro (P<0.05). Transfection with a FoxA2 expression plasmid significantly decreased MUC5AC promoter activity (P<0.05) and inhibited IL-6-induced MUC5AC production (P<0.05). In addition, clarithromycin significantly alleviated IL-6-induced FoxA2 suppression and decreased MUC5AC expression in vitro (P<0.05). Our findings suggest that FoxA2 may be considered a therapeutic target for the modulation of mucus hypersecretion in CRS patients.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Omalizumab, an anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) monoclonal antibody, has proved to be effective for the treatment of severe asthma.However, there is no direct evidence of effectiveness of omalizumab in Korean patients with severe asthma.We sought to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of omalizumab in Korean adult patients suffering from severe asthma and to identify predictors of favorable response.Methods: A retrospective analysis of electrical medical records was performed on severe allergic asthmatic patients with omalizumab treatment group (OT group) for more than 6 months between March 2008 and February 2016.Propensity score matching was applied to define the standardized treatment control group (STC group) treated without omalizumab.Asthma-related outcomes were compared between the 2 groups, and analyzed before and after omalizumab use in the OT group.Responders to treatment were defined as patients showing >50% reduction in asthma exacerbations and/or systemic steroid requirement during the outcome period.Results: One hundred twenty-four patients with severe asthma (62 in the OT group; 62 in the STC group) were enrolled in the study.Proportion of patients having the reduction of asthma exacerbation (53.2% vs 35.5%, P=0.015) and the rate of responders (67.7% vs 41.9%, P=0.007) were significantly higher in the OT group than in the STC group.Significant reductions were noted in asthma exacerbation (P=0.006),hospitalization (P=0.009),hospitalization days (P=0.006),systemic corticosteroid requirements (P=0.027), and sputum eosinophil count (P=0.031) in OT group compared with STC group.There were no significant differences in changes of forced expiratory volume in the 1 second (FEV1) levels between the 2 groups.No predictors of responders were found for omalizumab treatment.Conclusions: Omalizumab can reduce exacerbations/hospitalization/systemic steroid burst in Korean adult patients with severe asthma.",

    "abstract": "Immunological mechanisms underlying asthma exacerbation have not been elucidated. The aim of this study was to assess the associations of various asthma exacerbation traits with selected serum microRNA (miRNA) expression and T-cell subpopulations.Twenty-one asthmatics were studied during asthma exacerbation (exacerbation visit [EV] and the follow-up visit [FV] at 6 weeks). At both visits, spirometry was performed, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) was measured, and nasopharyngeal and blood samples were collected. In nasopharyngeal samples, respiratory viruses were assayed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and bacterial cultures were performed. Serum miRNAs were assayed with real-time PCR. T-cell surface markers, eosinophil progenitors and intracellular cytokines were assessed by flow cytometry.Two-thirds of patients had moderate or severe exacerbation and the FV, overall improvement in asthma control was observed. The mean expression of serum miRNA-126a, miRNA-16 and miRNA-21 was significantly lower at the EV than at the FV. At EV, miRNA-29b correlated with FeNO (r = 0.44, P < 0.05), and 5 of 7 miRNA tested correlated with pulmonary function tests. The number of cluster of differentiation (CD)45+CD4+interleukin (IL)4+ cells was significantly higher at the EV than at the FV, and positive correlations of T-regulatory cells and eosinophil progenitors with asthma control was found. At the EV, serum miRNAs negatively correlated with the number of T cells expressing IL-4, IL-17, IL-22 and interferon gamma, while at the FV both positive and negative correlations with T-cell subsets were observed. No association of detected pathogen (viruses and bacteria) in nasopharyngeal fluid with clinical, functional and immunological parameters was found.Epigenetic dysregulation during asthma exacerbation could be related to respiratory function, airway inflammation and T-cell cytokine expression.",

    "abstract": "Molecular mechanisms leading to asthma is still ill-defined. Though the function of microRNAs (miRNAs) in asthma was previously reported, the involvement of miR-155 in important features of this disease remains unknown. The present study was designed to uncover the probable involvement of miR-155-5p in the proliferation and migration of IL-13-induced human bronchial smooth muscle cells (BSMCs) and the intrinsic regulatory mechanism. The effects of different concentrations of IL-13 on the proliferation and migration of BSMCs as well as the expression of miR-155-5p and its predicted target transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-activated kinase 1/MAP3K7-binding protein 2 (TAB2) were investigated. The effects of miR-155-5p on the proliferation and migration of interleukin (IL)-13-induced BSMCs was determined in vitro using BSMCs transfected with miR-155 mimic/inhibitor and induced by a high concentration of IL-13. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was employed for determining the expression of miR-155-5p and TAB2. Western blotting was applied to analyze the expression of TAB2 at the protein level. Cell proliferation and migration were assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and Transwell assays, respectively. The proliferation and migration of BSMCs were dose-dependently increased with IL-13 treatment. Contrariwise, IL-13 dose-dependently inhibited the expression of miR-155-5p in BSMCs. Mechanistic studies showed that inhibition of miR-155-5p further promoted the stimulatory effects of IL-13, whereas overexpression of miR-155 significantly inhibited these effects. In silico studies and luciferase reporter assays indicated that TAB2 was a negatively regulated miR-155-5p target. These results suggested that miR-155-5p-inhibit the IL-13-induced proliferation and migration of BSMCs by targeting TAB2 and that the IL-13/miR-155/TAB2 pathway could serve as a therapeutic target for pulmonary diseases, especially asthma.",

This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the BAT for fish allergy.We performed a retrospective review of patients with fish allergy who underwent the BAT using a panel of fish extracts (15 kinds) to examine the differential reactivity to several species of fish. The BAT score for each extract was expressed as the ratio of CD203chigh% with the extract to that with anti-IgE antibody. Clinical reactivity to each fish was confirmed by positive oral food challenge or a typical history of fish-induced immediate allergy symptoms. Receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic performance.Fifty-one patients with fish allergy were analyzed. Using extracts of 15 species of fish, the BAT was performed a total of 184 times on the patients. Clinical allergy to each species of fish was confirmed in 90 (48.9%) of those tests. ROC analysis yielded high areas under the curve for the BAT scores for the 5 most common fish species (0.72-0.88). The diagnostic accuracy ranged from 0.74 to 0.86. Using a tentative cutoff value of 0.3 deduced from the ROC analyses of the 5 fish species, the accuracy for other fish allergic reactions was generally high (0.6-1.0), except the fish tested in a small number of patients.The BAT score based on CD203c expression may be useful for fish allergy diagnosis, especially since a large variety of fish can be tested by the BAT using fish extracts prepared by a simple method.",

Results:The histopathologic changes showed markedly thickened bones with significant increase in osteoblast numbers in OVA/SEB-treated mice compared to the phosphatebuffered saline-treated mice.The structural changes in bone on micro-CT were consistent with the histopathological features.The expression of RUNX2 and IL-13 was increased by the administration of OVA/SEB and showed a positive correlation.RUNX2 expression mainly co-localized with osteoblasts.Bioinformatic analysis using human CRS transcriptome revealed that IL-13-induced bony changes via RUNX2.Treatment with resveratrol, a candidate drug against osteitis, diminished the expression of IL-13 and RUNX2, and the number of osteoblasts in OVA/SEB-treated mice.Conclusions: In the present study, we found the histopathological and radiographic evidence of osteogenesis using a previously established murine eosinophilic CRS NP model.This animal model could provide new insights into the pathophysiology of neo-osteogenesis and provide a basis for developing new therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is a complex inflammatory disease of the nasal and paranasal sinus mucosa. The disease is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, structural changes in the mitochondria, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. This study investigated whether there are functional and morphological changes in the mitochondria in the epithelial cells of nasal polyps (NPs) and Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B (SEB)-stimulated nasal epithelial cells.In all, 30 patients with CRSwNP and 15 healthy subjects were enrolled. Mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) and changes in mitochondrial functions and structures were investigated in the uncinate tissue (UT) of healthy controls, the UT or NPs of CRSwNP patients, and human nasal epithelial cells with or without SEB stimulation.Oxidative phosphorylation complexes showed various responses following SEB stimulation in the nasal epithelial cells, and their expressions were significantly higher in the NPs of patients with CRSwNP than in the UT of controls. Generation of mtROS was increased following SEB exposure in nasal epithelial cells and was reduced by pretreatment with MitoTEMPO, which is used as an mtROS scavenger. In the tissues, mtROS was significantly increased in the NPs of CRSwNP patients compared to the UT of controls or CRSwNP patients. The expressions of fusion- and fission-related molecules were also significantly higher in SEB-exposed nasal epithelial cells than in non-exposed cells. In tissues, the expression of fission (fission mediator protein 1)- and fusion (membrane and mitofusin-1, and optic atrophy protein 1)-related molecules was significantly higher in the NPs of CRSwNP patients than in UT of controls or CRSwNP patients. Transmission electron microscopy revealed elongated mitochondria in SEB-exposed nasal epithelial cells and epithelial cells of NPs.Production of mtROS, disrupted mitochondrial function, and structural changes in nasal epithelial cells might be involved in the pathogenesis of CRSwNP.",

    "abstract": "It is difficult to assess airway obstruction using spirometry in adult asthmatic patients with preserved lung function. Impulse oscillometry (IOS) can detect not only airway resistance but also reactance. Therefore, IOS may be useful in assessing pulmonary function in such patients. We investigated the applicability of IOS for asthma patients with preserved lung function.Between 2015 and 2018, 1,248 adult asthmatic patients suspected of having asthma who visited the Allergy and Asthma Center of Severance Hospital underwent both spirometry and IOS. Consequently, 784 patients had asthma, 111 had chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) or asthma-COPD overlap, and 7 had parenchymal lung disease. The remaining 346 patients had chronic cough without underlying lung or airway disease. Among the 784 asthmatic patients, 191 with decreased lung function (predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] < 80%) were excluded. Propensity score matching was performed to adjust baseline characteristics between 346 non-asthmatic and 593 asthmatic patients with preserved lung function. Subsequently, we compared the spirometry and IOS parameters between the 329 asthmatic and 329 non-asthmatic patients.Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the area of reactance (AX) was associated with asthma with preserved lung function. In receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) of AX (AUC = 0.6823) for asthma was not significantly different from that of FEV1 (AUC = 0.6758). However, the AUC of a combination of AX and FEV1 (AUC = 0.7437) for asthma was significantly higher than that of FEV1 alone. The cutoff value of AX was 0.51 kPa/L in univariate ROC analysis.AX is associated with adult asthma with preserved lung function. Performing spirometry together with IOS is more beneficial than performing spirometry alone for diagnosing asthma in adult patients with preserved lung function.",

We retrospectively reviewed the usefulness of flow cytometry (FCM) as a quick tool for immunophenotyping and functional assays in patients suspected to have PIDs at a single tertiary care institute.Between January 2001 and June 2018, patients suspected of having PIDs were subjected to FCM tests, including lymphocyte subset analysis, detection of surface- or intracellular-target proteins, and functional analysis of immune cells, at Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea. The genetic diagnosis was performed using Sanger or diagnostic exome sequencing.Of 60 patients diagnosed with definite or probable PID according to the European Society of Immune Deficiencies criteria, 24 patients were provided with useful information about immunological dysfunction after initial FCM testing. In 10 patients, the PID diagnosis was based on abnormal findings in FCM testing without genetic tests. The FCM findings provided strong evidence for the diagnosis of severe combined immunodeficiency (n = 6), X-linked chronic granulomatous diseases (CGD) (n = 6), leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 (n = 3), X-linked agammaglobulinemia (n = 11), autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome-FASLG (n = 1), and familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 2 (n = 1), and probable evidence for autosomal recessive-CGD (n = 2), autosomal dominant-hyper-immunoglobulin E (IgE)-syndrome (n = 1), and STAT1 gain-of-function mutation (n = 1). In PIDs derived from PIK3CD (n = 2), LRBA (n = 2), and CTLA4 mutations (n = 3), the FCM test provided useful evidence of immune abnormalities and a tool for treatment monitoring.The initial application of FCM, particularly with known protein targets on immune cells, would facilitate the timely diagnosis of PIDs and thus would support clinical decisions and improve the clinical outcome.",

Thirty percent of clinically well-characterized HDM allergic patients (n = 98) whose immunoglobulin E (IgE) reactivity profiles had been determined with an extensive panel of purified HDM allergens (Der f 1, 2; Der p 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, 18, 21, 23 and 37) showed IgE reactivity to Der p 20. IgE reactivity to Der p 20 was more frequently associated with lung symptoms. AKs were detected in several invertebrates with specific antibodies and Der p 20 showed IgE cross-reactivity with AK from shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei).

    "abstract": "PURPOSE Evidence supporting a link between indoor formaldehyde exposure and atopic dermatitis (AD) in humans is limited. The purpose of this longitudinal study was to investigate whether AD symptoms in children could be affected by indoor formaldehyde levels in ordinary households. METHODS Fifty-five children with moderate-to-severe AD aged under 18 years were enrolled as a panel. They were followed up from February 2019 through February 2020. Indoor formaldehyde levels of patients' houses and their AD symptoms were repeatedly measured on a daily basis. The generalized linear mixed model was utilized for statistical analysis. Subdivision analysis was performed by stratifying patients by sex, body mass index, presence of parental allergy, and indoor environments including mold/dampness, temperature, and relative humidity (RH). RESULTS A total of 4,789 person-days of AD symptom data were collected. The average concentration of formaldehyde was 13.6 ± 16.4 ppb, with the highest value found in spring (18.1 ± 20.6 ppb). Higher levels of formaldehyde were observed when there was parental smoking, increased indoor temperature over 25.5°C, or RH over 60% (P < 0.0001). When the effect size was compared between each season after controlling for ambient particulate matter, temperature, and RH, an increase in 10 ppb of formaldehyde increased AD symptoms by 79.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 19.6-168.4) in spring and by 39.9% (95% CI, 14.3-71.2) in summer. AD symptoms in children aged 6-18 years appeared to increase significantly, whereas there was no significant increase in children under 6 years. When indoor temperature was over 25.5°C, an increase in formaldehyde by 10 ppb increased AD symptoms by 17.8% (95% CI, 3.9-33.6). CONCLUSIONS Indoor formaldehyde can exacerbate AD symptom in children with moderate-to-severe AD, particularly in spring and summer, even at allowable levels. Thus, minimizing exposure to indoor formaldehyde may be needed for the proper management of AD in children.",

Piperacillin-tazobactam (PT) allergy has been suspected to be an exception to this, but existing literature is scarce. We investigate the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, testing outcomes and predictive value of ST in patients referred for suspected PT allergies. Methods The records of all patients referred for suspected PT allergy testing and prescription rates of PT in all Hong Kong public hospitals (2015-2019) were analyzed. Results There was an increase in both PT prescriptions and number of newly reported PT allergies between 2015 and 2019. The majority (91.1%) of patients with suspected PT allergy had at least 1 underlying medical co-morbidity or immunosuppressant use leading to increased risk of infections. Thirty-six patients with suspected PT allergy completed ST. Two patients had positive ST, and 32/34 patients with negative ST underwent drug provocation testing (DPT). Nine of these patients were diagnosed with PT allergy based on positive DPT. Overall, 11/34 (32.4%) were diagnosed with PT allergy and the NPV of ST was 71.9%. Conclusions There is growing utilization of PT and corresponding cases of suspected allergies. The majority of suspected PT allergies had increased risk for recurrent infections. Unlike other penicillin allergy, there is a high rate of genuine PT allergy (up to 30%) and a poor NPV of ST (up to 70%). DPT remains the gold standard for accurate diagnosis, and all patients with a suspected allergy should undergo thorough allergy workup.",

    "abstract": "Tumor necrosis factor-like ligand 1A (TL1A), especially its secreted form, has been shown to contribute to eosinophilic inflammation and mucus production, cardinal features of asthma, through its receptor, death receptor 3 (DR3). However, the role of the TL1A-DR3 axis in asthma, especially in terms of airway remodeling, has not yet been fully understood.The present study investigated the expression and secretion of TL1A in the lung and human bronchial epithelial cells. DR3 small interfering RNA (siRNA), TL1A siRNA, and truncated plasmids were used respectively to identify the function of the TL1A-DR3 axis in vitro. To further validate the roles of the TL1A-DR3 axis in asthma, we collected airway biopsies and sputa from asthmatic patients and constructed a mouse model following rTL1A administration, DR3 knockdown, and TL1A knockout, the asthma-related inflammatory response and the pathological changes in airways were analyzed using various experimental methods. Associated signaling pathways downstream of TL1A knockout in the mouse model were analyzed using RNA sequencing.TL1A, especially its non-secreted form (nsTL1A) was involved in the remodeling process in asthmatics' airways. Knockdown of TL1A or its receptor DR3 decreased the expression of fibrosis-associated protein in BEAS-2B cells. Reversely, overexpression of nsTL1A in airway epithelial cells facilitated the transforming growth factor-β-induced remodeling progress. In the asthma mouse model, activating the TL1A-DR3 axis contributes to airway inflammation, remodeling, and tissue destruction. Reciprocally, DR3 knockdown or TL1A knockout partly reverses airway remodeling in the asthma model induced by ovalbumin.Our results confirm differential TL1A expression (including its secreted and non-secreted form) in asthma, which modulates remodeling. The shared mechanism of action by which nsTL1A and secreted TL1A exert their effects on asthma development might be mediated via the nuclear factor-κB pathway. The TL1A-DR3 axis presents a promising therapeutic target in asthma.",

Recently, a missing mutant wheat cultivar at 1B chromosome Glu-B3 and closely linked Gli-B1 loci was bred. This cultivar (ω5D) has a deficiency in ω-5 and γ-gliadins as well as some low-molecular-weight glutenins. We evaluated specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE) reactivity of the ω5D in WDEIA patients compared to wild-type cultivar.Serum samples from 14 WDEIA and 7 classic wheat allergy patients were used to compare the allergenicity of ω5D and wild-type cultivars using immunoglobulin E immunoblotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and ImmunoCAP inhibition assays.Immunoblotting revealed that ω5D extracts had less sIgE binding to gliadins and glutenins in WDEIA sera than wild-type extracts. Immunoblot inhibition assay for gliadin sIgE reactivity also showed that ω5D gliadins had less allergenicity than wild-type gliadins. ELISA inhibition assay showed stronger allergenicity of gliadins than glutenins, although they had cross-reactivity. This assay also showed that the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of ω5D extracts against gliadin- or glutenin-sIgE reactivity were approximately 4-fold higher in WDEIA patients than those of wild-type extracts. The inhibition capacity of ω5D gliadins against recombinant ω-5 gliadin-sIgE reactivity was also lower in WDEIA patients than that of wild-type.The allergenicity of the ω5D cultivar is markedly lower for WDEIA patients in the sIgE inhibition tests. These results suggest that the ω5D cultivar may be a safe alternative for WDEIA patients.",

This study aimed to find the function of these antibodies in the formation of eosinophil extracellular traps (EETs), contributing to the development of SA.Patients with SA (n = 11), those with patients with nonsevere asthma (NSA, n = 41), and healthy controls (HCs, n = 26) were recruited to evaluate levels of epithelial antigens and autoantigen-specific antibodies. Moreover, the significance of epithelial autoantigen-specific antibodies in association with EET production was investigated ex vivo and in vivo.Significantly higher levels of serum cytokeratin (CK) 18 and CK18-specific IgG were observed in patients with SA than in those with NSA (P = 0.001 and P = 0.031, respectively), while no differences were found in serum CK19 or CK19-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG). Moreover, levels of serum CK18 were positively correlated with total eosinophil counts (r = 0.276, P = 0.048) in asthmatics, while a negative correlation was noted between levels of serum CK18 and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) %. In the presence of CK18-specific IgG, peripheral eosinophils from asthmatics released EETs, which further increased CK18 production from airway epithelial cells. In severe asthmatic mice, CK18 expression and CK18-specific IgG production were enhanced in the lungs, where EET treatment enhanced CK18 expression and CK18-specific IgG production, either of which was not suppressed by dexamethasone.These suggest that EETs could enhance epithelial autoantigen (CK18)-induced autoimmune responses, further stimulating EET production and type 2 airway responses, which is a new therapeutic target for SA.",

In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential role and mechanism of CST1 in eosinophilic inflammation in asthma.Bioinformatics analysis on Gene Expression Omnibus datasets were used to explore the expression of CST1 in asthma. Sputum samples were collected from 76 asthmatics and 22 control subjects. CST1 mRNA and protein expression in the induced sputum were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and western blotting. The possible function of CST1 was explored in ovalbumin (OVA)-induced eosinophilic asthma. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to predict the possible regulated mechanism of CST1 in bronchial epithelial cells. Overexpression or knockdown of CST1 was further used to verify potential mechanisms in bronchial epithelial cells.CST1 expression was significantly increased in the epithelial cells and induced sputum of asthma. Increased CST1 was significantly associated with eosinophilic indicators and T helper cytokines. CST1 aggravated airway eosinophilic inflammation in the OVA-induced asthma model. In addition, overexpression of CST1 significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of AKT and the expression of serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade B, member 2 (SERPINB2), while knockdown using anti-CST1 siRNA reversed the trend. Furthermore, AKT had a positive effect on SERPINB2 expression.Increased sputum CST1 may play a key role in the pathogenesis of asthma through involvement in eosinophilic and type 2 inflammation through activation of the AKT signaling pathway, further promoting SERPINB2 expression.

    "abstract": "Zonulin is a regulator of epithelial and endothelial barrier function. It regulates intestinal permeability through disrupting tight junctions. Defective epithelial barrier function is a hallmark of airway inflammation in asthma. This study aimed to investigate the role of zonulin in the pathogenesis of severe asthma. We enrolled 56 adult patients with asthma (29 severe asthma and 27 mild-to-moderate asthma) and 33 normal controls. The clinical data, sera, and lung tissues of the patients were provided by the Cohort for Reality and Evolution of adult Asthma in Korea (COREA) and the Biobank of Soonchunhyang University Bucheon Hospital, South Korea. Serum zonulin levels were estimated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and zonulin expression in the bronchial tissue was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. The serum zonulin levels were significantly higher in patients with severe asthma (51.98 ± 19.66 ng/mL) than in those with mild-to-moderate asthma and normal controls (26.35 ± 13.70 vs. 17.26 ± 10.29 ng/mL, P < 0.001). They significantly correlated with percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (%FEV1) (r = -0.35, P = 0.009). The zonulin expression in the bronchial epithelium was greater in patients with severe asthma. A serum zonulin cutoff value to distinguish between severe and mild-to-moderate asthmatics was 38.83 ng/mL. Zonulin may play an important role in the pathogenesis of severe asthma, and serum zonulin could be a potential biomarker for severe asthma.",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of anaphylaxis is based on the clinical history. The utility of tryptase measurements in clinical setting is limited. Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor-X2 (MRGPRX2) is expressed in mast cells and is involved in the degranulation of these cells. We evaluated the potential of MRGPRX2 as a diagnostic biomarker in patients with iodinated contrast media (ICM)-induced immediate hypersensitivity reactions (IHRs). A total of 173 patients with documented ICM-induced IHR within 4 months from registration were enrolled and skin tests for the culprit ICM were performed. The time interval was evaluated as the duration between the onset of ICM-induced IHR and the measurement of serum MRGPRX2 levels. Serum MRGPRX2 concentration was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Of the 173 patients, 33 and 140 were included in the anaphylaxis and non-anaphylaxis groups, respectively. Serum MRGPRX2 levels were significantly higher in the anaphylaxis than in the non-anaphylaxis group (29.9 ± 24.1 vs. 20.7±17.5, P = 0.044). Serum MRGPRX2 showed a moderate predictive ability for anaphylaxis, with an area under the curve of 0.61 (P = 0.058). When groups were classified based on the time interval, T1(0-2months) and T2 (2-4months), patients with anaphylaxis had higher MRGPRX2 levels compared to the non-anaphylaxis group in the T2 group (36.5±19.2 vs. 20.5±19.0, P = 0.035). This pilot study shows that serum MRGPRX2 is a potential long-term biomarker for predicting anaphylaxis, particularly ICM-induced anaphylaxis. Further studies are needed to determine the role of MRGPRX2 in anaphylaxis in a larger population of patients with various drug-induced IHRs.",

The aim of this study was to compare the chemokine production induced by HRVs in airway epithelial cells with that induced by other respiratory viruses, and to investigate synergistic interactions between HRVs and HDMs on the induction of inflammatory chemokines in vitro. A549 human airway epithelial cells were infected with either rhinovirus serotype 7, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-A2 strain, or adenovirus serotype 3 and analyzed for interleukin (IL)-8 and regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) release and mRNA expression. Additionally, activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB and activator protein (AP)-1 were evaluated. The release of IL-8 and RANTES was also measured in cells stimulated simultaneously with a virus and the HDM allergen, Der f1. HRV caused greater IL-8 and RANTES release and mRNA expression compared with either RSV or adenovirus. NF-κB and AP-1 were activated in these processes. Cells incubated with a virus and Der f1 showed an increased IL-8 release. However, compared with cells incubated with virus alone as the stimulator, only HRV with Der f1 showed a statistically significant increase. IL-8 and RANTES were induced to a greater extent by HRV compared with other viruses, and only HRV with Der f1 acted synergistically to induce bronchial epithelial IL-8 release. These findings may correspond with the fact that rhinoviruses are identified more frequently than other viruses in cases of acute exacerbation of asthma.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of nasal polyposis (NP) is unclear. Eosinophils and mast cells are considered to play important roles in this process. In addition, the levels of Th2-type cells are increased, irrespective of the atopic status of the patient with NP. In this context, we and others have shown high levels of thymus and activation-related chemokine/CCL17, macrophage-derived chemokine, eotaxin, and RANTES in patients with NP. Forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) plays a key role in CD4+CD25+ regulatory T-cell function and represents a specific marker for regulatory T cells (Tregs). Decreased expression of FOXP3 has been reported in allergic diseases. The present study was designed to evaluate the presence and potential roles of Tregs, defined by the expression of FOXP3 protein, in NP.Using immunohistochemistry, we estimated the numbers of FOXP3+ cells in the epithelium and lamina propria of the NPs of 17 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with NP and the nasal mucosa of 15 patients with allergic rhinitis (AR). The number of FOXP3+ cells in NPs was compared with that in the nasal mucosa of patients with AR, and the numbers of FOXP3+ cells in atopic and non-atopic NP were also compared.The number of FOXP3+ cells in the lamina propria of patients with NP was significantly lower than that in the nasal mucosa of the AR patients (2.79 vs. 5.99, P=0.008). There was no statistically significant difference noted for the numbers of FOXP3+ cells between the epithelium of the NP and the nasal mucosa (3.60 vs. 2.39, P=0.180). Furthermore, the numbers of CD4+FOXP3+ cells were lower in NPs than in the allergic nasal mucosa. There was no difference in the number of FOXP3+ cells between the atopic and non-atopic NP patients.Fewer Tregs (i.e., decreased FOXP3 expression) are found in NPs than in the nasal mucosa of AR patients. As the severity of eosinophilic, Th2-type inflammation and the levels of inflammatory mediators are much higher in NPs than in the nasal mucosa of AR patients, an inverse co-relationship may exist between these parameters and the number of Tregs. The deficiency of Tregs in NP may account for the more pronounced Th2-type inflammation seen in these patients.",

We investigated the usefulness of color 3D imaging of respiratory impedance in asthma using MostGraph.Whole-breath and within-breath respiratory system resistance (Rrs) and reactance (Xrs) were measured in 78 patients with asthma. Color 3D images were classified into three patterns: the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-like pattern (high values of Rrs and Xrs with a marked respiratory cycle and frequency dependence), the asthma pattern (moderately high Rrs over the entire frequency and a respiratory cycle with slight Xrs changes), and a normal-like pattern (low Rrs and Xrs with few within-breath changes). The classification was performed by three researchers, who were unaware of the clinical information, and the clinical characteristics were compared among the three groups.Color 3D imaging provided a COPD-like pattern in 25 patients, an asthma pattern in 39 patients, and a normal-like pattern in 14 patients. Patients with the COPD-like pattern were predominantly female with a higher body mass index, lower forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC), and higher Rrs and Xrs values (whole-breath and within-breath variation). Those with the normal pattern had higher FEV1 and FVC, and a lower single-breath nitrogen washout slope. There were no differences in asthma control or exhaled nitric oxide levels among the three groups.These results suggest that color 3D imaging of respiratory impedance may show asthma phenotypes.",

To compare the efficacy of the addition of montelukast to low-dose inhaled budesonide (MON-400BUD) versus increasing the dose of inhaled steroid (800BUD) on asthma control in older asthmatics. A randomized, open-label, parallel-designed trial was conducted for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the rate of patients who reached \"well-controlled asthma status\" after the 12-week treatment period. Additionally, asthma exacerbations, sputum inflammatory cells, asthma control test (ACT) and physical functioning scale (PFS), and adverse reactions were monitored. Twenty-four (36.9%) and 22 (34.9%) subjects in the MON-400BUD (n=65) and 800BUD (n=63) groups had well-controlled asthma at the end of the study, respectively. The numbers of asthma exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroid treatment (20 vs 9, respectively, P=0.036) and the development of sore throat (22 vs 11, respectively, P=0.045) were significantly higher in the 800BUD group than in the MON-400BUD group. Body mass index and changes in ACT, FEV1%, 6-min walk distance and PFS from baseline were all significant determinants for distinguishing subjects with well-controlled and partly controlled asthma from those with uncontrolled asthma (P<0.05) at the end of the study. The efficacy of 12-week treatment with MON-400BUD in older asthmatics was comparable to that of 800BUD on asthma control but associated with reduced frequency of asthma exacerbations requiring oral steroids and sore throat events. Changes in ACT and PFS can be useful predictors of asthma control status in older patients.",

    "abstract": "There is growing evidence that nasal airway remodeling occurs in allergic rhinitis (AR). Although angiogenesis is an important component of airway remodeling in asthma, its involvement in AR has been little studied. Furthermore, information regarding the role of potent angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), in the nasal airway remodeling process is limited. This study was conducted to investigate the role of VEGF and PDGF in nasal airway remodeling, and to assess the preventive effects of anti-angiogenic drugs on this process in a murine AR model. Mice were systemically sensitized and subjected to inhalation of ovalbumin (OVA) twice a week for 3 months. Control mice were challenged with phosphate buffered saline, while the treatment group received SU1498, a VEGF receptor inhibitor, and/or AG1296, a PDGF receptor inhibitor, via intraperitoneal injection 4 hours prior to each OVA inhalation. Staining using hematoxylin and eosin, Masson's trichrome, and periodic acid-Schiff were separately performed to assess eosinophil infiltration, subepithelial fibrosis, and goblet cell hyperplasia, respectively, in the nasal airway. Immunohistochemical staining for matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) was also conducted. Repetitive intranasal inhalation of OVA resulted in significant increases in eosinophil infiltration, subepithelial fibrosis, goblet cell count, and MMP-9/TIMP-1 expression. Administration of SU1498 or AG1296 prevented these abnormal responses. The results of this study suggest that a causal relationship may exist between angiogenic factors and nasal airway remodeling in AR. Inhibition of VEGF or PDGF receptors may, in turn, suppress the remodeling process through the regulation of MMP-9/TIMP-1 expression.",

Should Der p2 be internalized by human airway epithelium, it has the theoretical propensity to potentiate epithelium activation. This study aimed to demonstrate the internalization of Der p2 by airway epithelium and to investigate the effects of Der p2 on MD2 expression and epithelium activation. Internalization of recombinant, enhanced green fluorescent protein-labelled Der p2 (rDer p2-EGFP) into human airway epithelium (BEAS-2B) was tracked by laser confocal microscopy and confirmed by immunoblotting. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunoblotting, and immunohistochemical staining were used to determine the effect of Der p2 on MD2 expression in vitro and ex vivo. Expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding receptors/cytokines was measured by RT-PCR. Secretion of interleukin-6/interleukin-8 (IL-6/IL-8) was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Internalization of Der p2 by BEAS-2B was confirmed by confocal microscopy and immunoblotting using rDer p2-EGFP and rDer p2, respectively. Expression of MD2 protein was increased in BEAS-2B and human nasal polyp airway epithelium cultured with rDer p2. Recombinant Der p2-cultured BEAS-2B caused little spontaneous IL-6/IL-8 secretion but significantly augmented by TLR ligand LPS. IL-6 secretion was up-regulated after MD2 transfection. Internalization of Der p2 was reduced by TLR2 RNA knockdown. Dexamethasone, calcitriol, anti-MD2/anti-TLR2 antibodies, and signalling inhibitors significantly reduced LPS+Der p2-induced IL-6/IL-8 secretion. Human airway epithelium may internalize Der p2, which potentiates the response to environmental proinflammatory stimuli through MD2 and TLRs. This study highlights a novel mechanism and alleviates IL-6/IL-8 secretion in mite-induced airway inflammation.",

A total of 119 children underwent an assessment that included FeNO measurements, spirometry, methacholine challenge, and measurement of blood eosinophil count, serum total IgE, and serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP). We also examined sensitization to five classes of aeroallergens (house dust mites, animal danders, pollens, molds, and cockroach) using skin prick testing. The children were divided into three groups according to their sensitization profiles to these aeroallergens (non-sensitized, mono-sensitized, and poly-sensitized). The geometric means (range of 1 SD) of FeNO were significantly different between the three groups (non-sensitized, 18.6 ppb [10.0-34.7 ppb]; mono-sensitized, 28.8 ppb [16.6-50.1 ppb]; and poly-sensitized, 44.7 ppb [24.5-81.3 ppb], P=0.001). FeNO levels were correlated with serum total IgE concentrations, peripheral blood eosinophilia, and serum ECP levels to different degrees. FeNO levels vary according to the profile of atopy, as determined by positive skin prick test results to various classes of aeroallergens. FeNO is also moderately correlated with serum total IgE, blood eosinophilia, and serum ECP. These results suggest that poly-sensitized asthmatic children may have the highest risk of airway inflammation.",

NPDFs were stimulated with TGF-β1, with or without delphinidin, and the expression levels of α-SMA, fibronectin, and collagen type I were determined by RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and collagen assay. The expression of α-SMA protein was measured by immunocytochemical staining. Mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-κB activation induced by TGF-β1 were determined by Western blot analysis. The transcriptional activity of NF-κB was measured by luciferase assay. The expression levels of α-SMA, fibronectin, and collagen type I increased in TGF-β1-stimulated NPDFs. In TGF-β1-induced NPDFs, delphinidin inhibited the expression of α-SMA, fibronectin, and collagen. Inhibitors of MAPK and NF-κB blocked the expression of α-SMA, fibronectin, and collagen type I. Delphinidin suppressed the activation of MAPK and NF-κB induced by TGF-β1 stimulation. These results suggest that delphinidin may inhibit TGF-β1-induced myofibroblast differentiation and ECM production through the MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway in NPDFs.",

This study investigated the effects of anti-IL-9 antibody on oral tolerance (OT) in a mouse model of allergic rhinitis (AR). BALB/c mice were divided into 4 groups: the control, AR, OT, and OT with anti-IL-9 antibody (OT+IL9AB) groups. Ovalbumin (OVA) was used for sensitization and challenge. Mice in the OT and OT+IL9AB groups were fed OVA for immunotherapy. During immunotherapy, OT+IL9AB mice were injected with anti-IL-9 antibody. Allergic symptoms, tissue eosinophil counts, and serum OVA-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) were measured. The mRNA expressions of cytokines and transcription factors of T cells of nasal mucosa were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The protein levels of GATA3, ROR-γt, and Foxp3 in nasal mucosa were determined by Western blot. CD4⁺CD25⁺Foxp3⁺ T cells in the spleen were analyzed by flow cytometry. Administration of anti-IL-9 antibody decreased allergic symptoms, OVA-specific IgE levels, and eosinophil counts. In addition, it inhibited T-helper (Th) 2 responses, but had no effect on Th1 responses. Protein levels of ROR-γt and mRNA levels of PU.1 and ROR-γt were reduced by anti-IL-9 antibody. Anti-IL-9 antibody increased Foxp3 and IL-10 mRNA expression, Foxp3 protein, and induction of CD4⁺CD25⁺Foxp3⁺ T cells. Anti-IL-9 antibody decreased allergic inflammation through suppression of Th2 and Th17 cells. Anti-IL-9 antibody enhanced the tolerogenic effects of regulatory T cells. These results suggest that anti-IL-9 antibody might represent a potential therapeutic agent for allergen immunotherapy in patients with uncontrolled allergic airway disease.",

    "abstract": "Sorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor with clinical activity against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and renal cell carcinoma. Administration of sorafenib carries a variety of adverse cutaneous reactions. Common adverse effects induced by sorafenib include hand-foot skin reactions, facial erythema, splinter subungual hemorrhage, and alopecia. Although erythema multiforme (EM) related to sorafenib has been reported, delayed-type cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions are rare in patients treated with sorafenib and there has been no case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) reported so far. We recently experienced 3 cases of delayed-type cutaneous hypersensitivity related to administration of sorafenib. The first case was a 47-year female had targetoid erythematous rashes on her arms 12 days after starting sorafenib for HCC. The rashes spread from the arms to the trunk rapidly except for the hands and feet, and erosive lesions developed in the oral mucosa and lips. She was diagnosed as SJS. The second case was an 81-year-old male had maculopapular eruptions with multiple targetoid lesions on the trunk, arms, and legs 10 days after starting sorafenib for his HCC. There was no evidence of mucosal involvement. He was diagnosed with EM. The last one was a 20-year-old female developed generalized maculopapular eruptions in the whole body 10 days after starting sorafenib for the treatment of HCC. All 3 patients completely recovered after discontinuation of sorafenib.",

We describe two adult patients who were diagnosed as having recurrent anaphylaxis witnessed by multiple physicians based on recurrent laryngeal symptoms. The claimed cause was foods in one and drugs in the other. We questioned the diagnosis because of absent documentation of objective findings to support anaphylaxis, and the symptoms occurred during skin testing though the test sites were not reactive. Our initial skin testing with placebos reproduced the symptoms without objective findings. Subsequent skin tests with the suspected allergens were negative yet reproduced the symptoms without objective findings. Disclosing the test results markedly displeased one patient but reassured the other who subsequently tolerated the suspected allergen. In conclusion, these 2 patients' symptoms and evaluation were not supportive of their initial diagnosis of recurrent anaphylaxis. The compatible diagnosis was Munchausen stridor which requires psychiatric evaluation and behavior modification, but often rejected by patients.",

    "abstract": "Although atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) has no apparent direct effect on human health, it does have direct effects on plants. The present study evaluated the influence of increased CO₂ levels on the concentration of allergens from common ragweed pollen by setting up a chamber study to model future air conditions and a field study to evaluate current air conditions. For the chamber study, we established 20 ragweed plants in an open-top chamber under different CO₂ levels (380-400, 500-520, 600-620, and 1,000-1,100 parts per million [ppm]). For the field study, we established ragweed plants in rural (Pocheon, Gyeonggi-do; mean CO₂ 320±54.8 ppm) and urban (Gangnam, Seoul; mean CO₂ 440±78.5 ppm) locations. Seeds of the common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) were obtained from Daejin University. The Amb a 1 protein content of pollen extracts was quantified using a double sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In our chamber study, the median concentration of Amb a 1 in pollen increased with increasing in CO₂ concentration (1.88 ng/μg in 380-400 ppm CO₂; 3.14 ng/μg in 500-520 ppm CO₂; 4.44 ng/μg in 600-620 ppm CO₂; and 5.36 ng/μg in 1,000-1,100 ppm CO₂). In our field study, we found no significantly different concentration of Amb a 1 between the pollen extracts at the Pocheon (mean±standard deviation, 1.63±0.3 ng/μg pollen in 320±54.8 ppm CO₂) and the Gangnam (2.04±0.7 ng/μg pollen in CO₂ in 440±78.5 ppm CO₂) locations, although the concentration of Amb a 1 was increased in the Gangnam than in the Pocheon locations. Our results suggest that future increases in CO₂ levels to more than 600 ppm will significantly elevate the Amb a 1 content in common ragweeds, although the current different CO₂ levels do not cause differences in the Amb a 1 content of ragweed pollen.",

In the mouse model, the clinical appearance including bronchial hyperresponsiveness, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis and total immunoglobulin E were significantly suppressed by PAR2-ant or NAC. Moreover, TSLP levels in the lung were suppressed by the same treatments in the lung. Claudin-1 was also degraded by GCE, and was restored by PAR2-ant or NAC.ROS generation and epidermal tight junction degradation are triggered by protease, followed by the induction of TSLP in allergic asthma.

In these candidate genes, 90 SNPs were genotyped using MassARRAY technology from 311 asthmatic children and 360 healthy controls of the Hungarian (Caucasian) population. Moreover, gene expression levels were measured by RT PCR in the induced sputum of 13 asthmatics and 10 control individuals. t-tests, chi-square tests, and logistic regression were carried out in order to assess associations of SNP frequency and expression level with asthma. Permutation tests were performed to account for multiple hypothesis testing. The frequency of 4 SNPs in 2 genes differed significantly between asthmatic and control subjects: SNPs rs2240572, rs2240571, rs3735222 in gene SCIN, and rs32588 in gene PPARGC1B. Carriers of the minor alleles had reduced risk of asthma with an odds ratio of 0.64 (0.51-0.80; P=7×10(-5)) in SCIN and 0.56 (0.42-0.76; P=1.2×10(-4)) in PPARGC1B.

Several studies have yielded conflicting results regarding the 2 asthma-related risk factors: antibiotic usage during infancy and/or a history of bronchiolitis during early life and the development of asthma.

The TLR4 polymorphism rs1927911 was genotyped in 1,395 middle school students from two areas using the TaqMan assay.Bronchiolitis in the first 2 years of life, antibiotic exposure during the first year of life, and parental history of asthma were independent risk factors for the development of asthma. When combined, antibiotic use and a history of bronchiolitis increased the risk of asthma (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 4.64, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.09-6.97, P value for interaction=0.02). In subjects with CC genotype of TLR4, antibiotic exposure and a history of bronchiolitis during infancy, the risk of asthma was increased, compared to subjects without these risk factors (aOR: 5.72, 95% CI: 1.74-18.87).Early-life antibiotic exposures and a history of bronchiolitis are risk factors for asthma in young adolescents. Polymorphisms of TLR4 modified the influence of these environmental factors. Reducing antibiotic exposure and preventing bronchiolitis during infancy may prevent the development of asthma, especially in genetically susceptible subjects.",

Therefore, we developed a rapid, robust, inexpensive screening method using SYBR® Green real time PCR to detect the HLA-B*58:01 allele. A total of 119 samples were tested. The assay has a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 69.15%-100%), a specificity of 100% (95% CI: 96.67%-100%), a positive predictive value of 100% (95% CI: 69.15%-100%) and a negative predictive value of 100% (95% CI: 96.67%-100%). HLA-B*58:01 genotyping results showed 100% agreement with those obtained from Luminex SSO/SBT/SSP. The lowest limit of detection of this method is 0.8 ng/μL of DNA.

    "abstract": "Since the airways are constantly exposed to various pathogens and foreign antigens, various kinds of cells in the airways-including structural cells and immune cells-interact to form a precise defense system against pathogens and antigens that involve both innate immunity and acquired immunity.Accumulating evidence suggests that innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) play critical roles in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis, defense against pathogens and the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, especially at body surface mucosal sites such as the airways.ILCs are activated mainly by cytokines, lipid mediators and neuropeptides that are produced by surrounding cells, and they produce large amounts of cytokines that result in inflammation.In addition, ILCs can change their phenotype in response to stimuli from surrounding cells, which enables them to respond promptly to microenvironmental changes.ILCs exhibit substantial heterogeneity, with different phenotypes and functions depending on the organ and type of inflammation, presumably because of differences in microenvironments.Thus, ILCs may be a sensitive detector of microenvironmental changes, and analysis of their phenotype and function at local sites may enable us to better understand the microenvironment in airway diseases.In this review, we aimed to identify molecules that either positively or negatively influence the function and/or plasticity of ILCs and the sources of the molecules in the airways in order to examine the pathophysiology of airway inflammatory diseases and facilitate the issues to be solved.",

    "abstract": "CD4⁺T cells are essential in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma. We have previously demonstrated that microRNA-1165-3p (miR-1165-3p) was significantly reduced in T-helper type (Th) 2 cells and that miR-1165-3p was a surrogate marker for atopic asthma. Little is known about the mechanisms of miR-1165-3p in the regulation of Th2-dominated allergic inflammation. We aimed to investigate the associations between Th2 differentiation and miR-1165b-3p in asthma as well as the possible mechanisms.CD4⁺ naïve T cells were differentiated into Th1 or Th2 cells in vitro. MiR-1165-3p was up-regulated or down-regulated using lentiviral systems during Th1/Th2 differentiation. In vivo, the lentiviral particles with the miR-1165-3p enhancer were administered by tail vein injection on the first day of a house dust mite -induced allergic airway inflammation model. Allergic inflammation and Th1/Th2 differentiation were routinely monitored. To investigate the potential targets of miR-1165-3p, biotin-microRNA pull-down products were sequenced, and the candidates were further verified with a dual-luciferase reporter assay. The roles of a target protein phosphatase, Mg2+/Mn2+-dependent 1A (PPM1A), in Th2 cell differentiation and allergic asthma were further explored. Plasma PPM1A was determined by ELISA in 18 subjects with asthma and 20 controls.The lentivirus encoding miR-1165-3p suppressed Th2-cell differentiation in vitro. In contrast, miR-1165-3p silencing promoted Th2-cell development. In the HDM-induced model of allergic airway inflammation, miR-1165-3p up-regulation was accompanied by reduced airway hyper-responsiveness, serum immunoglobulin E, airway inflammation and Th2-cell polarization. IL-13 and PPM1A were the direct targets of miR-1165-3p. The expression of IL-13 or PPM1A was inversely correlated with that of miR-1165-3p. PPM1A regulated the signal transducer and activator of transcription and AKT signaling pathways during Th2 differentiation. Moreover, plasma PPM1A was significantly increased in asthmatic patients.MiR-1165-3p negatively may regulate Th2-cell differentiation by targeting IL-13 and PPM1A in allergic airway inflammation.",

BIP3, a monoclonal antibody originally raised against birch pollen, recognizes HMW allergens in birch and mugwort pollens, celery, and Apiaceae spices.Our aim was to generate mimotopes using BIP3 for immunization against the HMW allergens relevant in the celery-mugwort-birch-spice cross reactivity syndrome.Methods: Mimotopes were selected from a random-peptide display library by BIP3 and applied in IgE inhibition assays.The 3 phage clones with the highest inhibitory capacity were chosen for immunization of BALB/c mice.Mouse immune sera were tested for IgG binding to blotted birch pollen extract and used for inhibiting patients´ IgE binding.Furthermore, sera were tested for binding to Api g 5, to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as a second glycoprotein, or to non-glycosylated control allergen Phl p 5 in ELISA, and the specific Api g 5-specific IgG titers were determined.Results: Three rounds of biopanning resulted in phage clones exhibiting 7 different sequences including 1 dominant, 1-6-cyclo-CHKLRCDKAIA.Three phage clones had the capacity to inhibit human IgE binding and induced IgG to the HMW antigen when used for immunizing BALB/c mice.The induced BIP3-mimotope IgG reached titers of 1:500 specifically to Api g 5, but hardly reacted to glycoprotein HRP, revealing a minor role of carbohydrates in their epitope.Conclusions: The mimotopes characterized in this study mimic the epitope of BIP3 relevant for Api g 5, one of the cross-reactive HMW allergens relevant in the celery-mugwort-birch-spice syndrome.BIP3 mimotopes may be used in the future for hyposensitization in this clinical syndrome by virtue of good and specific immunogenicity.",

    "abstract": "It is generally assumed that allergic asthma originates primarily through sensitization via the respiratory mucosa, but emerging clinical observations and experimental studies indicate that skin exposure to low molecular weight (LMW) agents, i.e. \"chemicals,\" may lead to systemic sensitization and subsequently develop asthma when the chemical is inhaled. This review aims to evaluate the accumulating experimental evidence that adverse respiratory responses can be elicited upon inhalation of an LMW chemical sensitizer after previous sensitization by dermal exposure. We systematically searched the PubMed and Embase databases up to April 15, 2017, and conducted forward and backward reference tracking. Animal studies involving both skin and airway exposure to LMW agents were included. We extracted 6 indicators of \"selective airway hyper-responsiveness\" (SAHR)-i.e. respiratory responses that only occurred in previously sensitized animals-and synthesized the evidence level for each indicator into strong, moderate or limited strength. The summarized evidence weight for each chemical agent was graded into high, middle, low or \"not possible to assess.\" We identified 144 relevant animal studies. These studies involved 29 LMW agents, with 107 (74%) studies investigating the occurrence of SAHR. Indicators of SAHR included physiological, cytological/histological and immunological responses in bronchoalveolar lavage, lung tissue and airway-draining lymph nodes. Evidence for skin exposure-induced SAHR was present for 22 agents; for 7 agents the evidence for SAHR was inconclusive, but could not be excluded. The ability of a chemical to cause sensitization via skin exposure should be regarded as constituting a risk of adverse respiratory reactions.",

We aimed to validate an airway disease biomarker panel of 4 systemic inflammatory biomarkers, α2-macroglobulin, ceruloplasmin, haptoglobin and hemopexin, to establish their relationship to airway disease diagnosis and inflammatory phenotypes and to identify an optimized biomarker panel for disease differentiation. Methods Participants with COPD or asthma were classified by inflammatory phenotypes. Immunoassay methods were used to measure levels of validation biomarkers in the sera of participants with disease and non-respiratory disease controls. Markers were analyzed individually and in combination for disease differentiation and compared to established biomarkers (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and white blood cell/blood eosinophil count). Results The study population comprised of 141 COPD, 127 severe asthma, 54 mild-moderate asthma and 71 control participants. Significant differences in ceruloplasmin, haptoglobin and hemopexin levels between disease groups and between systemic inflammatory phenotypes were observed. However, no differences were found between airway inflammatory phenotypes. Hemopexin was the best performing individual biomarker and could diagnose COPD versus control participants (area under the curve [AUC], 98.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 96.7%-99.9%) and differentiate COPD from asthmatic participants (AUC, 97.0%; 95% CI, 95.4%-98.6%), outperforming established biomarkers. A biomarker panel, including hemopexin, haptoglobin and other established biomarkers, could diagnose asthma versus control participants (AUC, 87.5%; 95% CI, 82.8%-92.2%). Conclusions Hemopexin can be a novel biomarker with superior diagnostic ability in differentiating COPD and asthma. We propose an anti-inflammatory axis between the airways and systemic circulation, in which hemopexin is a protective component in airway disease.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRs) are small non-coding RNA molecules of around 18-22 nucleotides that are key regulators of many biologic processes, particularly inflammation. The purpose of this study was to determine the association of circulating miRs from asthmatic children with seasonal variation in allergic inflammation and asthma symptoms.We used available small RNA sequencing on blood serum from 398 children with mild-to-moderate asthma from the Childhood Asthma Management Program. We used seasonal asthma symptom data at the study baseline and allergen affection status from baseline skin prick tests as primary outcomes. We identified differentially expressed (DE) miRs between pairs of seasons using DESeq2. Regression analysis was used to identify associations between allergy status to specific seasonal allergens and DE miRs in 4 seasons and between seasonal asthma symptom data and DE miRs. We performed pathway enrichment analysis for target genes of the DE miRs using DAVID.After quality control, 398 samples underwent differential analysis between the 4 seasons. We found 52 unique miRs from a total of 81 DE miRs across seasons. Further investigation of the association between these miRs and sensitization to seasonal allergens using skin prick tests revealed that 26 unique miRs from a total of 38 miRs were significantly associated with a same-season allergen. Comparison between seasonal asthma symptom data revealed that 2 of these 26 miRs also had significant associations with asthma symptoms in the same seasons: miR-328-3p (P < 0.03) and let-7d-3p (P < 0.05). Enrichment analysis showed that the most enriched pathway clusters were Rap1, Ras, and MAPK signaling pathways.Our results show seasonal variation in miR-328-3p and let-7d-3p are significantly associated with seasonal asthma symptoms and seasonal allergies. These indicate a potentially protective role for let-7d-3p and a deleterious role for miR-328-3p in asthmatics sensitized to mulberry. Further work will determine whether these miRs are drivers or results of the allergic response.",

    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a highly prevalent and potentially serious sleep disorder, requires effective screening tools. Saliva is a useful biological fluid with various metabolites that might also influence upper airway patency by affecting surface tension in the upper airway. However, little is known about the composition and role of salivary metabolites in OSA. Therefore, we investigated the metabolomics signature in saliva from the OSA patients and evaluated the associations between identified metabolites and salivary surface tension.We studied 68 subjects who visited sleep clinic due to the symptoms of OSA. All underwent full-night in-lab polysomnography. Patients with apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) < 10 were classified to the control, and those with AHI ≥ 10 were the OSA groups. Saliva samples were collected before and after sleep. The centrifuged saliva samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry (ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; UPLC-MS/MS). Differentially expressed salivary metabolites were identified using open source software (XCMS) and Compound Discoverer 2.1. Metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA) was performed using MetaboAnalyst 5.0. The surface tension of the saliva samples was determined by the pendant drop method.Three human-derived metabolites (1-palmitoyl-2-[5-hydroxyl-8-oxo-6-octenoyl]-sn-glycerol-3-phosphatidylcholine [PHOOA-PC], 1-palmitoyl-2-[5-keto-8-oxo-6-octenoyl]-sn-glycerol-3-phosphatidylcholine [KPOO-PC], and 9-nitrooleate) were significantly upregulated in the after-sleep salivary samples from the OSA patients compared to the control group samples. Among the candidate metabolites, only PHOOA-PC was correlated with the AHI. In OSA samples, salivary surface tension decreased after sleep. The differences in surface tension were negatively correlated with PHOOA-PC and 9-nitrooleate concentrations. Furthermore, MSEA revealed that arachidonic acid-related metabolism pathways were upregulated in the after-sleep samples from the OSA group.This study revealed that salivary PHOOA-PC was correlated positively with the AHI and negatively with salivary surface tension in the OSA group. Salivary metabolomic analysis may improve our understanding of upper airway dynamics and provide new insights into novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets in OSA.",

These led to the initiation of this study, which reported the demographic characteristics, manifestations, and long-term outcomes on a large series of consecutive RCC/UCC patients, providing a guideline-led real-world clinical experience.Retrospective baseline information was obtained from Clinical Research Database (January 2016 to May 2021). At least 6 months after the last clinic visit, included subjects were prospectively followed up.Three hundred and sixty-nine RCC and UCC patients (199 females, 53.9%) were analyzed. The median cough duration was 24.0 (12.0-72.0) months. Laryngeal symptoms were reported in 95.9% of the patients. The common triggers for coughing were talking (74.9%), pungent odors (47.3%), eating (45.5%), and cold air (42.8%). RCC was considered in 38.2%, and the remainder of 228 patients had UCC, with an equal sex distribution (P = 0.66). Among the 141 RCCs, 90.8% (128) had refractory reflux cough, which was more responsive to current treatments (P < 0.01). Although most features and test results between RCC and UCC were similar, UCC was more commonly inappropriately treated (P < 0.01). Nineteen (7.7-41.1) months after the final clinic visit, 31.2% still coughed persistently, while 68.8% reported cough improvement or remission. RCC reported more favorable treatment outcomes (including cough improvement, control, and spontaneous remission) than UCC (P < 0.01). Coughs with long duration before the initial cough clinic visit (P < 0.01), frequent urinary incontinence (P < 0.01), and being sensitive to \"talking\" (P < 0.01) or \"cold air\" (P < 0.01) were less likely to be solved.The current treatments only improve cough symptoms in two-thirds of patients.

In this report we discuss the first case of anaphylaxis that developed after an oral intake of ginseng, confirmed by an open oral challenge, a skin prick test (SPT), and a basophil activation test (BAT). A 44-year-old man experienced rhinorrhea and nasal stiffness, followed by respiratory difficulty with wheeze and abdominal pain 10 minutes after oral intake of fresh ginseng. He had suffered from episodes of allergic rhinitis during the spring season for several years. Upon presentation, a physical examination, chest radiograph, and routine laboratory tests were unremarkable. Total serum IgE level was 41 IU/mL. The SPT results showed strong positive responses to alder, birch pollens, and ginseng extracts (1:500 w/v). The methacholine bronchial challenge test revealed a positive result at PC20 of 5.83 mg/mL. The open oral challenge was performed using 50 g of fresh ginseng and showed immediate onset of facial flushing, cough, respiratory difficulty with wheeze, and abdominal pain combined with a significant decrease in FEV1 levels (54% from the baseline). Serum-specific IgE and IgG4 antibodies were not detectable by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. BAT showed a remarkable increase in the expression of CD203c and CD63 with the addition of ginseng extract in a dose-dependent manner, while no changes were noted in the controls. In conclusion, oral intake of Korean ginseng could induce anaphylaxis, which is mediated by non-IgE-dependent direct activation of basophil/mast cells.",

Interleukin-10 (IL-10)-producing regulatory B cells (Br1s) play a role in immune tolerance to food allergens. In addition, IFN-γ shows tolerogenic effects on allergen-induced Br1 responses. Eleven patients that were allergic to cow's milk and 12 milk-tolerant subjects were selected by double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) and clinical characteristics. The immunomodulatory effects of IFN-γ on allergen-specific Br1 responses were evaluated in 6 milk allergy patients and 8 milk-tolerant subjects. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from subjects were stimulated with casein and/or IFN-γ and analyzed by flow cytometry. IFN-γ had no effect on total cell counts or the proportion of Br1 cells in PBMCs. IFN-γ stimulation did not change total Br1 cell counts or the percentage of Br1s among CD5(+) B cells in the milk allergy or the milk-tolerant groups. In the milk allergy group, Br1 counts were not different between the control and the casein stimulation but significantly increased in the IFN-γ + casein stimulated cells, and the Br1 fractions were decreased after casein stimulation and recovered in the addition of IFN-γ for stimulation. In the milk-tolerant group, Br1 counts increased in the casein stimulated cells and in the IFN-γ + casein stimulated cells, but the increase was significantly less when IFN-γ was added, and the Br1 fractions were increased after casein stimulation and IFN-γ + casein stimulation, that was not significant when IFN-γ was added. IFN-γ-induced allergen-specific Br1 responses in the PBMCs of milk allergy patients play a role in milk allergen-specific tolerance induction in vitro. Further investigations into the molecular immunological mechanisms underlying the induction of allergen-specific Br1 responses are needed.",

However, much is not understood regarding the diagnosis and treatment of severe asthma and ACOS. To evaluate the current perceptions of severe asthma and COPD among asthma and COPD specialists, we designed an e-mail and internet-based questionnaire survey.Subjects were selected based on clinical specialty from among the members of the Korean Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Clinical Immunology and the Korean Academy of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases. Of 432 subjects who received an e-mail invitation to the survey, 95 subjects, including 58 allergists and 37 pulmonologists, responded and submitted their answers online.The specialists estimated that the percentage of severe cases among total asthma patients in their practice was 13.9%±11.0%. Asthma aggravation by stepping down treatment was the most common subtype, followed by frequent exacerbation, uncontrolled asthma despite higher treatment steps, and serious exacerbation. ACOS was estimated to account for 20.7% of asthma, 38.0% of severe asthma, and 30.1% of COPD cases. A history of smoking, persistently low forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and low FEV1 variation were most frequently classified as the major criteria for the diagnosis of ACOS among asthma patients. Among COPD patients, the highly selected major criteria for ACOS were high FEV1 variation, positive bronchodilator response, a personal history of allergies and positive airway hyperresponsiveness. Allergists and pulmonologists showed different assessments and opinions on asthma phenotyping, percentage, and diagnostic criteria for ACOS.Specialists had diverse perceptions and clinical practices regarding severe asthma and ACOS patients. This heterogeneity must be considered in future studies and strategy development for severe asthma and ACOS.",

In our current study, we replicated the associations between candidate susceptibility loci and AD.A total of 885 Korean subjects (425 AD patients and 460 unaffected controls) were genotyped for 17 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from previous GWASs and meta-analyses of AD and from immune-related genes.Several SNPs showed significant associations with AD in the case-control analysis (minimum P=0.005 at rs17389644), suggesting that these polymorphisms may be related to this disease. In addition, several SNPs showed significant signals (minimum P=0.004 at rs6473227) in severe AD compared to unaffected controls. In additional linear regression analysis, a few genotypes appeared to have potential effects on the SCORing AD (SCORAD) values (minimum P=0.003 at rs13361382 on TMEM232) and immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels (minimum P<0.0001 at rs4713555 near HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQA1) in AD patients.Our replication and extended study provide additional supporting information on the genetic associations (especially, variants in TMEM232 and nearby to IL21 and HLA-DRB1/HLA-DQA1) related to AD, its clinical severity and IgE involvement.",

The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of TolDC administration in a mouse model of allergic airway inflammation caused by mite extract.Mouse bone marrow-derived TolDCs were induced by incubation with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and dexamethasone, and then characterized by flow cytometry and cytokine production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). For the in vivo model of Blomia tropicalis-induced allergy, mice transplanted with antigen-pulsed TolDCs were sensitized intraperitoneally with B. tropicalis mite extract (BtE) adsorbed to aluminium hydroxide. After challenge by nasal administration of BtE, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), lungs, spleen and serum were collected for analysis.Induction of TolDCs was efficiently achieved as shown by low expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II, programmed death-ligand (PD-L) 2 and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and up-regulation of interleukin (IL)-10, upon LPS stimulation in vitro. Transplantation of 1 or 2 doses of BtE-pulsed TolDCs reduced the number of inflammatory cells in BALF and lungs as well as mucus deposition. Moreover, compared to saline-injected controls, TolDC-treated mice showed lower serum levels of anti-BtE immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies as well as reduced Gata3 and IL-4 gene expression in the lungs and decreased IFN-γ levels in the supernatant of splenocyte cultures Transplantation of TolDCs increased the percentage of the regulatory T cells in the spleen and the lungs.Preventive treatment with TolDCs protects against dust mite-induced allergy in a mouse model, reinforcing the use of tolerogenic dendritic cells for the management of allergic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite that infects humans and animals via congenital or postnatal routes, and it is found worldwide. Modulation of the immune system by parasite infection is proposed to suppress allergic inflammation. Growing evidences have shown that interleukin (IL)-10-producing regulatory B cells (B(regs)) and CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (T(regs)) induced by parasite infection play a critical role in allergic or autoimmune diseases because these cells regulate negatively cellular immune responses and inflammation. Currently, the role of IL-10-producing regulatory B cells in host immune response during T. gondii infection is unknown. In this study, we investigate whether T. gondii infection can suppress the development of unrelated atopic dermatitis (AD)-like lesions. AD is a chronically relapsing inflammatory skin disease accompanied by severe itching; for this, we used NC/Nga mice, a well-known experimental model of systemic AD. Repeated exposure to Dermatophagoides farinae crude extract (DfE), known as a major environmental allergen, evokes AD-like skin lesions in NC/Nga mice under specific pathogen-free conditions. NC/Nga mice were intraperitoneally infected with 10 cysts of T. gondii. T. gondii infection significantly ameliorated AD-like skin lesions in NC/Nga mice. The subpopulation of B(regs) and T(regs) in the AD mice was expanded in the course of T. gondii infection. In addition, T. gondii infection inhibited Th2 and enhanced Th1 immune response in the DfE-treated AD mice. We have experimentally demonstrated for the first time that T. gondii infection ameliorated AD-like skin lesions in a mouse model of AD. Our study could in part explain the mechanisms of how parasite infection prevents the development of allergic disorder. Therefore, these immunemechanisms induced by T. gondii infection may be beneficial for the host in terms of reduced risk of allergic immune reactions.",

We aimed to develop novel, questionnaire-based diagnostic criteria for childhood AD, which can detect more comprehensive AD including non-flexural type.The draft version of questionnaire to detect childhood AD was prepared to be used for preliminary hospital- (n=1,756) and community-based (n=1,320) surveys. From analysis, the Reliable Estimation of Atopic dermatitis of ChildHood (REACH) was derived and verified in derivation (n=1,129) and validation (n=1,191) sets by community-based surveys.The REACH consists of 11 questions including 2 major and 9 minor criteria. AD is diagnosed as the major group of 'eczema on the antecubital or popliteal fossa' to fulfill the 2 major criteria (2M), and the minor group of 'eczema on the non-antecubital or popliteal fossa' to fulfill the 1 major plus 4 or more minor criteria (1M+4m). In the validation set, the overall 1-year AD prevalence by the REACH was estimated as 12.3% (95% CI, 10.5%-14.2%), and the REACH showed a sensitivity of 75.2%, a specificity of 96.1%, and an error rate of 6.4%. The REACH demonstrated better diagnostic performance than the ISAAC in terms of the number of misclassification (10.0%).We propose the REACH as new full, questionnaire-based diagnostic criteria for childhood AD in epidemiological surveys. Further studies are warranted to validate the REACH in different populations or countries in the context of large-scale, epidemiological surveys.",

The objective of this study was to investigate the associations between breast-feeding and the risk of AD in early childhood in Korea.We combined the fourth and fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data collected from 2007 to 2012 and analyzed 2,015 children at 1 to 3 years old. Regression analysis was used to determine the association of the following variables: AD, feeding types, duration of breast-feeding, and others.The annual prevalence of exclusive breast-feeding and AD decreased. Parents with allergic diseases preferred breast-feeding and extended duration of feeding compared with those without. In multiple logistic regression analyses, exclusive breast-feeding in feeding type I (P=0.070; adjusted odds ratio [OR]=1.990), exclusive breast-feeding in feeding type II (P=0.095; adjusted OR=1.495) and breast-feeding duration (P=0.430; adjusted OR=1.013) were not significantly related to AD.Breast-feeding was not found to be associated with an occurrence of AD in young children. Rather, parents with histories of allergic diseases tended to prefer breast-feeding and extend its duration. To clarify the role of breast-feeding in the development of AD, a nation-wide prospective study is needed.",

    "abstract": "There is an unmet need for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD), leading to variation in management strategies. To investigate distinct features and treatment modalities according to physicians' specialties, we collected data on the current treatment approach to moderate-to-severe AD among allergists, pediatric allergists and dermatologists in Korea.This questionnaire-based study was administered to physicians from the Korean Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Clinical Immunology (KAAACI), Korean Academy of Pediatric Allergy and Respiratory Disease (KAPARD), and Korean Atopic Dermatitis Association (KADA).A total of 93 physicians participated in the study; 64.5% were pediatric allergists and 31.2% were dermatologists. The major patient age groups were \"less than 5 years\" for 100% of pediatric allergists and \"6-12 years old\" for 38% of dermatologists. The proportion of patients with moderate-to-severe AD was higher for dermatologists and allergists compared to pediatric allergists. Physicians agreed on the necessity of education including demonstration of basic skin care and application of topical therapies (88.2%), nutritional consultation (83.9%) and psychological counseling (75.3%). However, less than half were able to educate and counsel their patients in real practice. There were noticeable differences in first-line treatment among physician groups. For pediatric allergists, the order of preferred systemic treatment was wet wrap therapy, systemic corticosteroids and oral cyclosporin. Dermatologists ranked cyclosporin, phototherapy, and systemic corticosteroids as first-line treatment regimens. Major reported barriers to proper management were steroid phobia, unproven complementary and alternative medicine, lack of education, and the unreasonable insurance system.Our findings suggest there are distinct differences in moderate-to-severe AD treatment according to physicians' specialties. Medical policy changes along with governmental supports are required in order to implement the ideal approach in real practice. For moderate-to-severe AD, a consensus on the approach to optimal management should be reached for the best outcomes, based on further randomized controlled trials.",

The increasing prevalence of AD demands new therapeutic approaches for treating the disease. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of the ointment form of TECA, AST and a TECA + AST combination in a mouse model of AD to see whether a combination of the reduced doses of 2 compounds could have a synergistic effect.An AD-like lesion was induced by the topical application of 5% PA to the dorsal ear and back skin of an Hos:HR-1 mouse. After AD induction, TECA (0.5%), AST (0.5%) and the TECA (0.25%) + AST (0.25%) combination ointment (20 μg/cm²) were spread on the dorsum of the ear or back skin 3 times a week for 4 weeks. We evaluated dermatitis severity, histopathological changes and changes in protein expression by Western blotting for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclocxygenase (COX)-2, and nuclear factor (NF)-κB activity. We also measured the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6 and immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the blood of AD mice by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).PA-induced skin morphological changes and ear thickness were significantly reduced by TECA, AST and TECA + AST treatments, but these inhibiting effects were more pronounced in the TECA + AST treatment. TECA, AST and the TECA+AST reatments inhibited the expression of iNOS and COX-2; NF-κB activity; and the release of TNF-α, IL-6 and IgE. However, the TECA+AST treatment showed additive or synergistic effects on AD.Our results demonstrate that the combination of TECA and AST could be a promising therapeutic agent for AD by inhibiting NF-κB signaling.",

Interleukin (IL)-35-induced regulatory T (iTr35) cells are a new subset of regulatory T cells with immunoregulatory properties. These cells can significantly suppress Th2 responses in seasonal allergic rhinitis. However, it remains unknown whether iTr35 cells are involved in the immunoregulation of allergic asthmatic individuals after specific allergen exposure.The iTr35 cell frequency in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was measured in patients with allergic asthma as well as in asymptomatic and healthy subjects. The difference in naïve CD4⁺ T cell conversion to iTr35 cells in vitro during allergen stimulation was also investigated. The effects of iTr35 cells on naïve CD4⁺ T cell differentiation into Th2 cells, CD4⁺CD25- T (Teff) cell proliferation and Th2 cytokine production in vitro were assessed.Significantly reduced iTr35 cell frequencies and IL-35 expression levels were found in asthmatic patients with Derp1 allergy compared with asymptomatic and healthy subjects. Moreover, the circulating iTr35 cell proportion and IL-35 expression level in asthmatic patients gradually decreased with disease severity. Patients with allergic asthma had reduced transformation of naïve CD4⁺ T cells into iTr35 cells and IL-35 production after allergen exposure compared with asymptomatic and healthy subjects. Most importantly, iTr35 cells inhibited allergen-driven differentiation of naïve CD4⁺ T cells into Th2 cells, Teff cell proliferation and Th2 cytokine production in an IL-35-dependent manner.The results of our study suggest that iTr35 cells may play an important role in preventing Th2 responses to allergens by secreting IL-35 and that iTr35 cells may be a potential new immune regulator of allergic asthma.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the interaction between airborne fungi and nasal fibroblasts in TSLP mRNA and protein expression.Inferior turbinate and nasal polyp fibroblasts were stimulated with Alternaria and Aspergillus, respectively, for 48 hours, and TSLP mRNA and protein expressions were measured. The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was performed for the Toll-like receptor (TLR) mRNA expression of the nasal fibroblasts. To determine the role of TLR in the induction of TSLP, the fibroblasts were transfected with siRNA against TLR2 and TLR5.Alternaria induced TSLP mRNA and protein expression in both inferior turbinate and nasal polyp fibroblasts. The nasal polyp fibroblasts responded more strongly to the fungi. TLR2 and TLR5 mRNA expressions were significantly increased with fungal stimulation and TSLP production was significantly inhibited by siRNA against TLR2.The results of this study show that TSLP expression could be induced in nasal fibroblasts by exposure to Alternaria and that TLR2 may be involved in the process. The promotion of TSLP production in nasal fibroblasts by airborne fungi may facilitate the development or exacerbation of Th2-type nasal inflammation, especially in CRS with nasal polyps.",

Each patient was followed up using a diary card, on which a symptom score, rescue medication score, and adverse events (AEs) were recorded.All allergic rhinitis symptoms improved after 3 years of SLIT (P<0.05), and the rescue medication score decreased with time (P<0.05). The incidence of AEs associated with SLIT was 31% (51 of 164 patients) during the first month of therapy, and there were no severe AEs. The dropout rate was 19.5% (32 of 164 patients) during the first month, 34% (56 of 164 patients) after 6 months, and 41% (68 of 164 patients) after 1 year of SLIT. The 3-year compliance rate was approximately 40% (65 of 164 patients). The most common causes of dropout during the first month of SLIT were high cost and inconvenience. The improvement in allergic symptoms was the most common cause of dropout after 6 months.Allergic symptoms significantly decreased after 1 year of SLIT treatment, and this effect was sustained after 2 or 3 years of treatment. By increasing compliance through patient education, the 3-year use of SLIT for house dust mite allergies may be effective in the management of allergic rhinitis.",

    "abstract": "Hypersensitivity to fungi is associated with rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma. For some fungi, such as Alternaria alternata (A. alternata), the symptoms of asthma are persistent, increasing disease severity and the risk of fatal outcomes. There are a large number of species of fungi but knowledge of them remains limited. This, together with the difficulties in obtaining adequate standardized extracts, means that there remain significant challenges in the diagnosis and immunotherapy of allergy associated with fungi. The type of indoor fungi related to asthma/allergy varies according to geographic, climatic, and seasonal factors, making their study difficult. The aim of this study was to determine hypersensitivity to indoor fungi in a population from Cuenca, Spain.Thirty-five patients with symptoms compatible with rhinitis or asthma who showed clear worsening of their symptoms in their homes or workplace were included. In vivo and in vitro tests were made with a battery of fungal allergens, including the species isolated in the home or workplace.Ulocladium botrytis (U. botrytis) and A. alternata were the most representative species as a source of home sensitization. These species showed very high concordance in skin tests, specific IgE, and histamine release. The allergen Alt a 1, which was recognized in all patients, was detected in A. alternata, U. botrytis, and Stemphylium botryosum (S. botryosum).U. botrytis and A. alternata were the most representative species as a source of home sensitization. Alt a 1 was recognized in all patients and may be considered a non-species-specific allergen that could be used as a diagnostic source of sensitization to some species of the Pleosporaceae family.",

    "abstract": "Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a disease that is primarily seen in adults and is comparatively rare in children. Consequently, only a few studies have focused on the pathogenesis of the disease in children. This study investigated the possible role of metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in the pathogenesis of CSU in children. The study group was composed of 54 children with CSU; 34 healthy children comprised the control group. The demographic and clinical features of the study group were extensively evaluated, and laboratory assessments were also performed. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to evaluate levels of plasma MMP-9. Disease activity was quantified using the urticaria activity score (UAS). The median value of plasma MMP-9 was 108.9 ng/mL (interquartile range, 93.3-124.1) in the CSU group and 87.8 ng/mL (69.4-103.0) in the control group. The difference between the 2 groups was statistically significant (P<0.001). Also, MMP-9 levels showed a significant positive correlation with UAS (rho=0.57, P<0.001). Twenty-six percent of patients had positive autologous serum skin test (ASST) results. Neither UAS nor plasma MMP-9 levels were significantly different between ASST-positive and -negative patients (P>0.05). Plasma MMP-9 levels were elevated in children with CSU and were positively correlated with disease activity. MMP-9 may be both a good biomarker of disease activity and a potential therapeutic target in CSU.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Asthma control in older asthmatics is often less effective, which may be attributed to small airway dysfunction and poor inhalation technique.We compared the efficacy of 2 inhalers (fluticasone propionate/formoterol treatment using a pressurized metered-dose inhaler [p-MDI group] vs. fluticasone propionate/salmeterol treatment using a dry powder inhaler [DPI group]) in older asthmatics.Methods: We conducted a 12-week, randomized, open-label, parallel-designed trial in older patients (over 55 years old) with moderate-to-severe asthma, and compared the efficacy and safety for asthma control between the 2 groups.Subgroup analyses on disease duration and air trapping were performed.Clinical parameters, including changes in lung function parameters, inhaler technique and adherence, were compared with monitoring adverse reactions between the 2 groups.Results: A total of 68 patients underwent randomization, and 63 (30 in the p-MDI group and 33 in the DPI group) completed this study.The p-MDI group was non-inferior to the DPI group with regard to the rate of well-controlled asthma (53.3% vs. 45.5%,P < 0.001; a predefined non-inferiority limit of 17%).In subgroup analyses, the proportion of patients who did not reach well-controlled asthma in the p-MDI group was non-inferior to that in the DPI group; the difference was 12.7% among those with a longer disease duration (≥ 15 years) and 17.5% among those with higher air-trapping (RV/TLC ≥ 45%), respectively (a predefined non-inferiority limit of 17%, P < 0.001).No significant differences were observed in lung function parameters, inhalation techniques, adherence and adverse reactions between the 2 groups.Conclusion: These results suggest that the p-MDI group may be comparable to the DPI group in the management of older asthmatics in aspects of efficacy and safety.",

    "abstract": "A defective epithelial barrier has been demonstrated in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Lactobacilli are shown to restore epithelial barrier defects in gastrointestinal disorders, but their effect on the airway epithelial barrier is unknown. In this study, hence, we evaluated whether the nasopharyngeal isolates Lacticaseibacillus casei AMBR2 and Latilactobacillus sakei AMBR8 could restore nasal epithelial barrier integrity in CRSwNP.Ex vivo trans-epithelial tissue resistance and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran 4 kDa (FD4) permeability of nasal mucosal explants were measured. The relative abundance of lactobacilli in the maxillary sinus of CRSwNP patients was analyzed by amplicon sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The effect of spray-dried L. casei AMBR2 and L. sakei AMBR8 on epithelial integrity was investigated in vitro in primary nasal epithelial cells (pNECs) from healthy controls and patients with CRSwNP as well as in vivo in a murine model of interleukin (IL)-4 induced barrier dysfunction. The activation of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) was explored in vitro by using polyclonal antibodies.Patients with CRSwNP had a defective epithelial barrier which positively correlated with the relative abundance of lactobacilli-specific amplicons in the maxillary sinus. L. casei AMBR2, but not L. sakei AMBR8, increased the trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of pNECs from CRSwNP patients in a time-dependent manner. Treatment of epithelial cells with L. casei AMBR2 promoted the tight junction proteins occludin and zonula occludens-1 reorganization. Furthermore, L. casei AMBR2 prevented IL-4-induced nasal permeability in vivo and in vitro. Finally, the beneficial effect of L. casei AMBR2 on nasal epithelial cells in vitro was TLR2-dependent as blocking TLR2 receptors prevented the increase in TEER.A defective epithelial barrier in CRSwNP may be associated with a decrease in relative abundance of lactobacilli-specific amplicons. L. casei AMBR2 would restore nasal epithelial integrity and can be a novel therapeutic strategy for CRSwNP.",

    "abstract": "Three observations drove this study. First, 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase-like protein (OASL) is a negative regulator of type I interferon (IFN). Second, type I IFN plays a central role during virus infections and the pathogenesis of various diseases, including asthma. Third, influenza A virus (IAV) causes non-eosinophilic asthma. To evaluate the potential relationships between OASL, type I IFN, and pulmonary innate immune cells in IAV-induced acute airway inflammation by using Oasl1-/- mice.Asthma was induced in wild-type (WT) and Oasl1-/- mice with IAV or ovalbumin (OVA). Airway hyperreactivity (AHR) and immune cell infiltration in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids were measured. The immune cells in the lungs were analyzed by flow cytometry. To investigate the ability of type I IFN to shape the response of lung type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), IFN-α was treated intratracheally. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) sorted from bone marrow and ILC2s sorted from lungs of naive mice were co-cultured with/without interferon-alpha receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR-1)-blocking antibodies.In the IAV-induced asthma model, Oasl1-/- mice developed greater AHR and immune cell infiltration in the BAL fluids than WT mice. This was not observed in OVA-induced asthma, a standard model of allergen-induced asthma. The lungs of infected Oasl1-/- mice also had elevated DC numbers and Ifna expression and depressed IAV-induced ILC2 responses, namely, proliferation and type 2 cytokine and amphiregulin production. Intratracheal administration of type I IFN in naïve mice suppressed lung ILC2 production of type 2 cytokines and amphiregulin. Co-culture of ILC2s with pDCs showed that pDCs inhibit the function of ILC2s by secreting type I IFN.OASL1 may impede the IAV-induced acute airway inflammation that drives AHR by inhibiting IAV-induced type I IFN production from lung DCs, thereby preserving the functions of lung ILC2s, including their amphiregulin production.",

    "abstract": "Dupilumab was the first biological drug to be approved for adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD), and its use is growing exponentially worldwide. Though its therapeutic efficacy and favorable safety profile have been demonstrated, data on real-world long-term experience with the drug are only beginning to accumulate. Herein, we present a retrospective analysis of Korean patients with moderate-to-severe AD who were treated with dupilumab. We observed excellent overall treatment efficacy with the mean Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score decreased from 28.2 to 3.2 at week 52. Notably, the therapeutic effect was maintained despite the considerable number of patients requiring an increase in treatment intervals due to the financial burden in a real clinical setting. In contrast to the previous reports, paradoxical head and neck erythema/dermatitis was rare in our study group, and pre-existing dermatitis in the very region, as well as in the hands, responded well to dupilumab treatment. Additionally, we were able to discontinue dupilumab treatment for two patients who achieved complete clearance of AD symptoms (EASI and Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA] scores of 0) for more than three months. There have been no flare-up events of AD in these patients; with topical corticosteroids alone, one of them has been completely disease-free for 43 weeks and the other has been maintaining an IGA score of 1 for 66 weeks. Furthermore, conjunctivitis was again confirmed to be the most frequent side effect associated with dupilumab, and it generally responded well to conventional conjunctivitis treatment.",

Here, an interleukin (IL)-17/neutrophil-dominant ovalbumin (OVA)/polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C)) mouse model was used to evaluate the effect of different-sized titanium dioxide (TiO2) particles on the eyes and the nose. We also examined whether IL-17-neutralizing antibody (IL-17Ab) treatment could reverse TiO2 effects.The nasal cavities and conjunctival sacs of each mouse were challenged with OVA and Poly(I:C) to induce neutrophil-dominant inflammation and then exposed to micro- and nano-TiO2. Subsequently, IL-17Ab was administered to investigate the role of IL-17 and inflammatory parameters.Micro- and nano-TiO2 resulted in significant decreases in tear-break-up time and increases in corneal damage. Airborne micro-TiO2 also increased nasal rubbing and sneezing counts compared with the OVA/Poly(I:C). Micro-TiO2 exposure increased infiltration of neutrophils and IL-17A+ cells in the conjunctival tissues and the nasal mucosae. In addition, these increased symptoms and inflammation in the eyes and the nose by micro-TiO2 exposure were inhibited by the IL-17Ab, suggesting IL-17 dependency.TiO2 aggravated IL-17-induced eye and nose inflammation and the IL-17Ab alleviated inflammation in the OVA/Poly(I:C) mouse model. These results may help develop a therapeutic modality for PM exposure and provide evidence for PM-associated diseases.",

Knowing the factors that exacerbate or increase the contagiousness of a virus could be a key to pandemic prevention.

The number of viral infections was defined as the total number of virus-infected patients hospitalized for respiratory symptoms. We analyzed the association between the number of viral infections/week and the average concentrations of atmospheric substances including particulate matter (PM)10, PM2.5, O₃, NO₂, CO, SO₂, and allergenic pollen) for that week. The cross-correlation coefficient between the weekly measures of pollens and viral infections was checked to determine which time point had the most influence. The association of atmospheric substances in that time, with the number of viral infections/week was investigated using multiple linear regression analysis to identify factors with the greatest influence.In spring the tree pollen average concentration one week earlier (t-1) had the greatest correlation with the average virus infection of a given week (t) (ρXY (h) =0.5210). The number of viral infections showed a statistically significant correlation with especially tree pollen concentration of 1 week prior (adj R²=0.2280). O₃ concentration was correlated to the number of viral infections within that week (adj R²=0.2552) in spring, and weed pollen and CO concentration correlated (adj R²=0.1327) in autumn.Seasonal co-exposure to air pollutants and allergenic pollens may enhance respiratory viral infection susceptibility in children. Therefore, reducing the concentrations of air pollutants and pollens may help prevent future epidemics.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of chronic urticaria (CU) is increasing worldwide, and it imposes a major burden on patients. Few studies have evaluated the efficacy of second-line treatments of CU, particularly for patients being considered for costly third-line treatments such as omalizumab. We compared the efficacy and safety of second-line treatments of CU refractory to standard doses of nonsedating H1-antihistamines (nsAHs).This 4-week, prospective, randomized, open-label trial divided patients into 4 treatment groups: 4-fold updosing of nsAHs, multiple combination of 4 nsAHs, switching to other nsAHs, and adjunctive H2-receptor antagonist. The clinical outcomes included urticaria control status, symptoms, and rescue medication use.This study included 109 patients. After 4 weeks of second-line treatment, urticaria was well-controlled, partly controlled, and uncontrolled in 43.1%, 36.7%, and 20.2% of patients, respectively. Complete control of CU was achieved in 20.4% of patients. Among the patients with high-dose nsAHs, the proportion with well-controlled status was higher compared to the patients who received standard doses (51.9% vs. 34.5%, P = 0.031). No significant difference was observed in the proportion of well-controlled cases between the updosing and combination treatment groups (57.7% vs. 46.4%, P = 0.616). However, increasing the dose of nsAHs 4-fold was associated with a higher rate of complete symptom control compared to multiple combination treatment with 4 nsAHs (40.0% vs. 10.7%, P = 0.030). Logistic regression analysis confirmed the higher efficacy of updosing of nsAHs for complete control of CU compared to the other treatment strategies (odds ratio, 0.180; P = 0.020).In patients with CU refractory to standard doses of nsAHs, both updosing of nsAHs 4-fold and multiple combination treatment with 4 nsAHs increased the rate of well-controlled cases without causing significant adverse effects. Updosing of nsAHs is more effective for complete CU control than combination treatment.",

RA incidence was assessed using person-years at risk, and the hazard ratio (HR) was examined using the Cox proportional hazards model.The incidence of RA (per 1,000 person-years) was 6.51 for those with CRS, 6.55 for those with CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP), and 5.96 for those with CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). We found that CRS individuals had a significantly increased risk of subsequent RA development with an adjusted HR of 1.41, regardless of the phenotype (adjusted HR was 1.42 in CRSsNP and 1.37 in CRSwNP patients). Moreover, the risk of developing RA over time was relatively higher within the first 4 years after the diagnosis of CRS.Our nationwide population-based cohort study suggests that CRS may be associated with a subsequent increase in RA events, regardless of the phenotype. Therefore, physicians should consider RA risk when diagnosing and treating CRS patients.",

We evaluated the effects of atopy on clinical profiles and airway inflammation in Korean asthmatics. We retrospectively enrolled 1,492 asthmatics from the Cohort for Reality and Evolution of Adult Asthma in Korea (COREA) cohort who had undergone skin prick tests for aeroallergens. The patients' clinical characteristics, lung function, PC20, and sputum and blood inflammatory cell counts were compared based on the presence or absence of atopy. Atopy was defined as one or more positive reactions (A/H ratio >1) on a skin prick test. Among 11 aeroallergens, house dust mites (Dermatophagoides farinae and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus) were the most prevalent cause of a positive skin prick test. As compared with non-atopic asthmatics, atopic asthmatics showed early onset of the disease. Atopic patients with asthma had a higher FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC as compared with non-atopic patients with asthma. In addition, asthmatics without atopy had more uncontrolled asthma (P=0.001) and severe rhinitis (P<0.05) as compared with atopic asthmatics. Smoking, as measured in pack years, was higher in the non-atopic asthmatics than in the atopic asthmatics. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was higher in non-atopic asthmatics than in the atopic asthmatics and patients with non-atopic asthma had a higher sputum neutrophil count than did those with atopic asthma. Our data indicate that atopic asthmatics had an early onset of disease and high IgE levels, while the non-atopic asthmatics had decreased lung function and a high sputum neutrophil count, suggesting that a different approach is needed to treat atopic asthma.",

Their clinical and radiological findings were similar to those of acute interstitial pneumonia, but there were some differences in the pathological findings. Unclassified interstitial pneumonia with fibrosis is characterized by histological findings of centrilobular distribution of alveolar damage and bronchiolar destruction with bronchiolar obliteration. This report describes two different series of familial cases of unclassified interstitial pneumonia with fibrosis, which developed almost simultaneously in the spring. Some of the individual cases showed rapidly progressive respiratory failure of unknown cause, with comparable clinical courses and similar radiological and pathological features, including lung fibrosis. Each family member was affected almost simultaneously in the spring, different kinds of viruses were detected in two patients, and all members were negative for bacterial infection, environmental and occupational agents, drugs, and radiation. These findings implicate a viral infection and/or processes related to a viral infection, such as an exaggerated or altered immune response, or an unknown inhaled environmental agent in the pathogenesis of unclassified interstitial pneumonia with fibrosis.",

OVA-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum and interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13, and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) and Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining was performed on lung tissues. In addition, immunohistochemical staining for IL-4, IL-5, MUC5AC, and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-α) was conducted.Serum IgE levels were significantly higher in group 4 than in group 3 (P<0.05). IL-4 and IL-5 in BALF were significantly higher in group 4 than in group 3 (P<0.05, respectively). Based on H&E staining, inflammatory cell numbers were significantly greater in group 4 than in the other groups (P<0.05).

Data on provocation and threshold tests, clinical courses, and laboratory work-up were analyzed and compared with data reported by studies in temperate countries.Of 1,063 chronic urticaria patients, 27 (2.5%) were diagnosed with ColdU, with a mean age of symptom onset of 34.8 years. Half of the patients had a history of atopy, and 1 (3.7%) had a history of anaphylaxis. All patients were positive to 1 of 3 provocation tests: an ice cube test; TempTest 4.0; or a tray filled with ice, salt and water. Thirteen patients underwent the ice cube test, and all had positive results. TempTest was performed on 15 patients, 8 of whom had positive results, with a mean critical temperature threshold (CTT) of 21.0°C. All of the 7 patients who had a negative TempTest result later produced positive results to the immersion of their hand and forearm in a tray filled with ice, salt, and water. All patients were treated with H₁-antihistamines, the vast majority (96.3%) being non-sedating H₁-antihistamines. Some (14.8%) needed to be administered oral corticosteroids, ciclosporin, or omalizumab. Six patients (22.2%) were in remission. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve demonstrated 5-year and 10-year remission rates of 13.8% and 42.6%, respectively.The rate of anaphylaxis in patients with ColdU in a tropical country was lower than those reported by other studies conducted intemperate climates. On the other hand, the number of female patients, mean age at symptom onset, atopy rate, rate of concomitant chronic spontaneous urticaria and mean CTT were higher.",

Group A was composed of 17 children (78±49.6 months) with anaphylaxis after ingestion of milk. Group B was composed of 62 children (73.1±38.6 months) without a history of anaphylaxis, but with less severe symptoms (gastrointestinal and/or skin symptoms). All patients from Group B had a positive open challenge with cow's milk. All patients underwent an allergic evaluation and blood samples were collected to test for IgE to recombinans of milk (nBos d 4, 5, 8).A significant difference in nBos d 8 emerged with higher levels in Group A (median [IQR]=2.80 [0.91-16.1]) than B (0.65 [0.24-1.67]; P=0.006), whereas there were no statistically significant differences for nBos d 4 and 5. The recombinants' sum was higher in Group A than B: 8.39 [2.72-41.39] vs 3.04 [1.85-7.31] kUA/L; P=0.044. The recombinant nBos d 8 was superior to the other recombinants in identifying children at risk for anaphylaxis, with an area under the curve of 0.718 (95% CI, 0.57-0.86, P=0.006). Considering a cutoff of 1.8 kUA/L, nBos d 8 had the most favorable sensitivity and specificity ratio (sensitivity=0.65, specificity=0.77) with an odd ratio of 6.02 (95% C.I: 1.89-19.23).This study suggested 2 phenotypes of allergic children, \"high-anaphylaxis-risk\" and \"milder-risk\". These types can be differentiated through measuring the level of IgE to nBos d 8.",

    "abstract": "We previously demonstrated seasonal variation in sensitization to aeroallergens in a small group of patients with exercise-induced asthma. This study was performed to confirm the relationship in a much larger population. The charts of 1,891 patients who received allergy skin prick tests were reviewed retrospectively. The test results from subjects aged ≤60 years were compared between the groups classified according to the season when the patients received the tests (spring: March-May, summer: June-August, fall: September-November, winter: December-February). The data from 25 respiratory allergy patients who received the tests two or more times and showed a positive response at least once were analyzed longitudinally. The most prevalent among 29 tested aeroallergens were house dust mites (HDMs) Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and D. farinae. The skin sensitization rates to D. pteronyssinus (23.2% vs. 32.1%, P=0.004) and D. farinae (22.2% vs. 30.2%, P=0.009) were significantly lower in the summer and higher in the fall (38.3% vs. 26.6% and 35.6% vs. 25.3%; P=0.001 respectively) than those in other seasons in patients with a respiratory allergy (n=1,102). The sensitization rates to weed pollens in the fall (13.9% vs. 8.3%, P=0.006) and to Aspergillus fumigatus in the winter (2.9% vs. 0.7%, P=0.005) were significantly higher. In patients with non-respiratory allergy such as urticaria/anaphylaxis (n=340), the D. farinae sensitization rate was significantly lower in the summer also but higher in the spring. The trend of the HDM sensitization rate being lower in the summer and higher in the fall was observed in the longitudinal study. Skin sensitivity to aeroallergens such as HDMs, pollens, and molds demonstrates seasonal variation in respiratory allergy patients. Non-respiratory allergy patients also showed seasonal variation in sensitivity to aeroallergens, which might be related to the \"priming\" effect of allergens.",

However, it is possible for 1 drug antigen to induce 2 or more simultaneous immunologic reactions. Here, we report a case of a serum-sickness-like reaction and anaphylaxis induced concurrently by rifampin. A 25-year-old male presented with high fever and a maculopapular rash with vesicles on the hands, which developed 2 weeks following regular administration of anti-tuberculosis drugs for tuberculous meningitis, including rifampin. Elevated liver enzymes, peripheral neuropathy, and decreased serum C3 and C4 levels were found. Interestingly, these symptoms were accompanied by severe hypotension. A serum-sickness-like reaction was considered after excluding other potential causes for the fever. A drug provocation test showed that the fever developed after oral administration of rifampin, suggesting that rifampin was the cause of the allergic reaction. However, hypotension, epigastric discomfort, and diarrhea also accompanied these symptoms, indicating that IgE-mediated type I hypersensitivity could be part of the serum sickness-like reaction. An intradermal skin test clearly showed an immediate positive reaction to rifampin. This case was diagnosed as concurrent serum-sickness-like reaction and anaphylaxis induced by rifampin. One drug may therefore induce combined allergic reactions via 2 or more simultaneous hypersensitivity responses.",

We confirmed the increased concentration of IgE reactive epitopes in non-primate mammalian organs, which may be rich in α-gal proteins in lymphatic and endothelial tissues. All confirmed ticks associated with this disorder in the literature and in our case belonged to the hard tick family. We hypothesize that hard tick saliva is enriched with blood-type substances, such as oligosaccharides, from the non-primate mammal victim's blood after days to weeks of blood sucking, which sensitizes humans through the injection route while blood sucking.",

Furthermore, since companies adopt their own units for expression of allergenicity, the allergen concentrations of individual reagents cannot be compared easily. We sought to measure and compare the allergenicities of 3 commercially available house dust mite (HDM) SLIT regents and a subcutaneous immunotherapy reagent. We measured the HDM allergenic potency of the maintenance dosages of three SLIT reagents: Staloral® (300 index of reactivity [IR] /mL, recommended maintenance dosage [MD]: 120 IR), SLITone® (1,000 standard therapeutic unit [STU]/mL, recommended MD: 200 STU), Wolwopharma® (100 µg/mL, recommended MD: 20 µg), and subcutaneous immunotherapy regents of Hollister-Stier (10,000 allergy unit [AU] /mL). The allergenic potency was assessed by measuring the total protein concentrations, mite group 1 and 2 allergens using 2-site ELISA, and an inhibition test against IgE specific to Dermatophagoides farinae and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. The protein content of the Wolwopharma® reagent was 1.5-261.4 times higher than that of the other 2 SLIT reagents. The concentration of group 1 major allergens in Staloral® (132.03 µg/mL) was 33- to 44.5-fold higher than in SLITone® (4.00 µg/mL) and Wolwopharma® (2.97 µg/mL). The concentration of group 2 major allergen was also 8.9- to 10.5-fold higher in Staloral® (15.7 µg/mL) than in SLITone® (1.8 µg/mL) or Wolwopharma® (1.5 µg/mL). An ELISA inhibition study against HDM-specific IgE showed that the allergen potency of Staloral® reagent is 8.5-fold and 21-fold higher than that of SLITone® or Wolwopharma®, respectively. The differences between the maintenance dosages are further exaggerated by the differences in the recommended volumes of SLIT reagents. The allergen potencies of commercially available HDM SLIT reagents are markedly different. Consensus regarding the optimal allergen concentration for SLIT reagents used to treat HDM respiratory allergies is needed.",

Here, we compared FeNO values obtained using NOV and NObreath® (NOB) systems to derive a correction equation for children.Eighty-eight participants (age 7-15 years) who were diagnosed with atopic bronchial asthma and visited Sagamihara National Hospital as outpatients between January and April of 2017 were included. We measured FeNO values obtained using NOB and NOV, and analyzed them using Wilcoxon tests and Altman-Bland plots.The median age of the participants was 11.5 years, and the scored Asthma Control Test (ACT) or Childhood ACT (C-ACT) was 25 (interquartile range, 24-25) or 26 (24-27). NOB and NOV values were significantly different (31 [14-52] versus 36 [20-59] ppb; P = 0.020) and strongly correlated (r = 0.92). An equation to convert NOB values into NOV values was derived using linear regression as follows: log NOV = 0.7329 × log NOB + 0.4704; NOB for 20, 40, 58, 80 and 100 ppb corresponded to NOV for 27, 44, 59, 73 and 86 ppb. Thus, NOB < 58 ppb suggested NOB < NOV, whereas NOB > 58 ppb suggested NOB > NOV.NOB and NOV values were strongly correlated.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated with particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5), and cytokines in the supernatants were examined.Mild nasal symptoms were reported by some participants during the haze episode. Objective measures of nasal patency demonstrated that nasal airway resistance was significantly increased from baseline levels, while nasal cavity volume and minimum cross-sectional area were significantly decreased. Similarly, the levels of nasal and exhaled NO, eotaxin, interleukin (IL)-5, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 17, IL-8, substance P, nerve growth factor and vasoactive intestinal peptides in nasal secretions were significantly increased from baseline values following the haze episode. In contrast, the levels of interferon-γ, IL-10, transforming growth factor-β and neuropeptide Y were significantly decreased. Incubation with 0.1-10 μg/mL PM2.5 significantly increased release of IL-1β, IL-4, IL-5, IL-8 and IL-10 from PBMCs.Short-term haze exposure may lead to nasal inflammation and hypersensitivity in healthy subjects predominantly by Th2 cytokine-mediated immune responses.",

Recent use of analgesics or antipyretics and current cat ownership were associated with the risk of mild persistent AR. Sensitizations to Dermatophagoides Pteronyssinus (Der p), Japanese hop and cat were associated with moderate to severe persistent AR. Children with moderate to severe AR had a higher risk of current asthma and BHR compared to mild AR cases (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 5.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.77-15.62). Moderate to severe AR with allergic sensitization was associated with the highest risk of BHR (aOR, 11.77; 95% CI, 3.40-40.74).Moderate to severe-persistent AR is more closely related to respiratory comorbidities and sensitizations than mild AR.

    "abstract": "Recent studies have revealed the pathogenic role of interleukin (IL)-22 in atopic dermatitis and asthma. However, little is known about the role of IL-22 in the pathophysiology of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. We aimed to investigate the expression of IL-22 and its pathogenic function in type 2 immune reactions of nasal polyps (NP).Protein levels of inflammatory mediators were determined by multiplex immunoassay, and principal component analysis (PCA) was performed. Immunofluorescence analysis and mast cell culture were used to determine the cellular sources of IL-22. Normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells were stimulated using IL-22 in combination with diverse cytokines, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) was measured.IL-22 expression was not up-regulated in NP compared with control tissues, but IL-22-high NP revealed distinct features characterized by type 2 inflammatory cytokines such as chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL)-11, CCL-24, and IL-5 on the PCA. Additionally, IL-22 positively correlated with type 2 immune mediators and the disease severity in NP. For the localization of the cellular sources of IL-22 in eosinophilic NP, it was expressed in cells mostly composed of eosinophil peroxidase-positive cells and partially of tryptase-positive cells. The human mast cell line, LAD2 cells, released IL-22 mediated by immunoglobulin E. Moreover, IL-22 receptor subunit alpha-1 (IL-22Ra1) expression was significantly increased in NP. IL-22Ra1 was up-regulated with poly(I:C) stimulation in NHBE cells. Furthermore, TSLP production was enhanced when stimulated with a combination of IL-13, poly(I:C), and IL-22. Treatment with anti-IL-22Ra1 also inhibited IL-22-induced enhancement of TSLP production.IL-22 was associated with type 2 inflammatory reactions in NP. The IL-22/IL-22Ra1 axis was enhanced and might be involved in type 2 inflammatory reactions via TSLP production in NP.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Pet-derived allergens are the common indoor inhalant allergens. Among them, cat and dog allergens constitute more than 80% of animal allergic patients, which greatly affect the quality-of-life of patients and increase the burden of social health care. The aim of this study was to identify Cat-Niemann pick type C2 (NPC2) protein, a homologue of Can f 7, as a new allergen. Methods Cat-NPC2 complementary DNA (cDNA) was cloned and optimized for amplification and expression in Escherichia coli. Then, recombinant Cat-NPC2 (rCat-NPC2) was purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography. The allergenicity was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western blot and basophil activation test (BAT). Based on the sequence similarity, the cross-reactivity between Cat-NPC2 and Can f 7 was investigated by inhibition ELISA. Circular dichroism spectroscopy and homology modeling were used to characterize the structure of Cat-NPC2. Results The cDNA sequence of Cat-NPC2 was cloned with a 450-bp open reading frame coding for 149 amino acids (GenBank MN_737596). The condon-optimized NPC2 gene was subcloned and expressed in E. coli with a molecular weight of 18.9 kDa. The native Cat-NPC2 was detected in cat dander extracts. The allergenicity determined by ELISA, western blot and BAT suggested at least 14.5% cat-allergic patients displayed high specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) recognition of Cat-NPC2. The predicted structure of Cat-NPC2 was found to consist of 7 β-strands arranged in 2 β-sheets. An ELISA based assay showed that rCat-NPC2 bound to cholesterol in a dose dependent manner. Based on the structure and sequence similarities, IgE cross-reactivity was demonstrated between Cat-NPC2 and Can f 7/Der f 2. Conclusions In the study, a novel cat allergen, belonging to the NPC2 protein family, was identified and characterized at both molecular and immunological levels. The study will offer a deeper understanding of cat allergens and improve a component-resolved diagnosis in pet allergy.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of allergen avoidance in the prevention of allergic symptoms in previously sensitized patients and newborns that have the potential to develop allergies. We performed online searches of articles published from January 1980 to December 2012 in PubMed and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and selected articles involving randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and allergen avoidance. The parameters used to determine allergenic potential in newborns included the risk ratio (RR) of eczema, asthma, rhinitis, wheeze, and cough. The methods employed to evaluate previously sensitized patients were the standardized mean difference (SMD) of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). Data quality was assessed using the Jadad scale. A total of 14 RCTs were identified. Meta-analysis demonstrated that allergen avoidance for newborns did not reduce the subsequent incidence of allergic diseases (eczema, P=0.21; rhinitis, P=0.3; cough, P=0.1) but significantly reduced the incidence of asthma and wheezing in high-risk infants (asthma, P=0.03; wheeze, P=0.0004). However, previously sensitized patients who reduced their exposure to known allergens did not show improvement in their lung functions (FEV1, P=0.3; PEFR morning, P=0.53; PEFR evening, P=0.2; PEFR, P=0.29). Allergen avoidance may not always be successful in preventing allergic symptoms. However, rigorous methodological studies are required to confirm this hypothesis.",

The purpose of this study is to compare morning salivary cortisol levels in persistent asthma patients according to their disease severities and control status. Total 206 adult asthma patients were recruited from four university hospitals. Spirometry, questionnaire of Asthma Quality of Life (AQOL) and Asthma Control Test (ACT) were completed, and saliva samples were collected prospectively to measure morning cortisol level. The mean patient age was 56.5±15.3 years with mean asthma duration of 9.1±11.1 years. Sixty five patents (31.6%) were classified as mild persistent asthma, and 141 patients (68.4%) were classified as moderate persistent asthma according to the Expert Panel Report 3. The mean predicted FEV1 was 88.8%±18.4%, and the methacholine PC20 was 9.6±8.5 mg/mL in all study population. The mean ACT score for all patients was 19.9±3.6, and there were 71 (34.5%) patients in poorly controlled and 135 (65.5%) in well controlled asthma. The poorly controlled asthma patients were characterized by significantly lower FEV1 (84.6%±17.6% vs 91.1%±18.5%, P=0.018), lower AQOL scores (46.0±13.9 vs 73.8±26.3, P<0.001), and lower salivary cortisol levels (0.14±0.08 vs 0.18±0.11 µg/dL, P=0.04) compared to well controlled asthma. The ACT score was significantly related to salivary cortisol levels (P=0.034) after adjusting for age. There was no significant difference in salivary cortisol levels (0.17±0.12 vs 0.16±0.08, P=0.725) when analyzed according to the dose of used corticosteroid and lung function. Asthma control status affects morning salivary cortisol level. Measuring the morning salivary cortisol level might be a simple and new way to assess asthma control status.",

B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) inhibitors, ABT-199 (4 mg/kg) and ABT-737 (4 mg/kg), were intranasally given to TDI-exposed TLR4-/- mice after each challenge.TDI exposure led to increased airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), granulocyte flux, bronchial epithelial shedding and extensive submucosal collagen deposition, which were unexpectedly aggravated by TLR4 deficiency. Following TDI challenge, TLR4-/- mice exhibited down-regulated interleukin-17A and increased colony-stimulating factor 3 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), while WT mice did not. In addition, TLR4 deficiency robustly suppressed the expression of NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 and NLR family CARD domain containing 4, decreased caspase-1 activity in TDI-exposed mice, but had no effect on the level of high mobility group box 1 in BALF. Flow cytometry revealed that TDI hampered both neutrophil and eosinophil apoptosis, of which neutrophil apoptosis was further inhibited in TDI-exposed TLR4-/- mice, with marked up-regulation of Bcl-2. Moreover, inhibition of Bcl-2 with either ABT-199 or ABT-737 significantly alleviated neutrophil recruitment by promoting apoptosis.These data indicated that TLR4 deficiency promoted neutrophil infiltration by impairing its apoptosis via up-regulation of Bcl-2, thereby resulting in deteriorated AHR and airway inflammation, which suggests that TLR4 could be a negative regulator of TDI-induced neutrophilic inflammation.",

    "abstract": "The spectrum of allergic diseases includes atopic dermatitis (AD), allergic rhinitis (AR), and asthma. To date, the association between allergic diseases and psoriasis has not yet been completely evaluated. This study was conducted to determine the risk of psoriasis in patients with allergic diseases. A health screening database, a sub-dataset of the Korean National Health Insurance Service database, was used. All 9,718,722 subjects who underwent health examination in 2009 at age over 20 were included. Subjects with allergic diseases including AD (n = 35,685), AR (n = 1,362,713), asthma (n = 279,451) and control subjects without all three allergic diseases (n = 8,210,042), without AD (n = 9,683,037), without AR (n = 8,356,009) and without asthma group (n = 9,439,271) were analyzed. The subjects were tracked using their medical records during the 8-year period from 2010 to 2017 to identify those who developed psoriasis. Multivariate Cox regression models were used to assess the risk of psoriasis. The incidence probability of psoriasis was analyzed through the Kaplan-Meier method. The incidence of psoriasis per 1,000 person-years was 9.57, 3.78, and 4.28 in the AD, AR, and asthma groups, respectively. The AD group exhibited a significantly increased risk of developing psoriasis compared to subjects without AD (hazard ratio [HR], 3.18; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 3.05-3.31; P < 0.001) after adjustment for confounding factors. The risk of psoriasis was significantly increased in the AR group compared to subjects without AR (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.31-1.34; P < 0.001) and asthma group compared to subjects without asthma (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.27-1.33; P < 0.001). Allergic diseases, particularly AD, may be a risk factor for psoriasis.",

    "abstract": "Patients with severe eosinophilic asthma (SEA) suffer from frequent asthma exacerbations, where eosinophils are major effector cells in airway inflammation, and anti-interleukin (IL)-5 becomes an effective treatment modality to control eosinophilic inflammation of SEA. Fifteen patients with SEA who had been treated with anti-IL5 (reslizumab, 100 mg monthly intravenously) for 6 months at Ajou University Hospital (Suwon, Korea) were enrolled in this study. Clinical parameters, including total blood eosinophil count (TEC), FEV1%, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels, and serum biomarkers such as eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), periostin (PON), and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), were analyzed. EDN levels and TEC decreased significantly after 1 month of treatment (P < 0.05 for both), while no changes were noted in FeNO/PON/TGF-β1 levels. FEV1% increased after 2 months of treatment (P < 0.05). A positive correlation was observed between TEC and EDN levels (r = 0.60, P = 0.02). Significant negative correlations were noted between age and TEC/EDN levels (r = -0.57, P = 0.02 and r = -0.56, P = 0.03, respectively). Baseline TEC was higher in the EDN-responder group (≥75% decrease) than in the non-responder group (P = 0.06) with a positive correlation between %reduction in EDN and TEC (r = 0.67, P = 0.01). The onset age was younger and asthma duration was longer in the FEV1%-non-responder group (<12% increase) than in the FEV1%-responder group (P = 0.07 and P = 0.007, respectively). In conclusion, changes in the serum EDN level may be a potential biomarker for monitoring eosinophilic inflammation after anti-IL5 treatment in SEA, which is affected by onset age and asthma duration.",

This study aimed to investigate the natural course of CU in children and identify the factors that influence its prognosis.We evaluated 77 children diagnosed with CU, who were monitored for at least 48 months. Subjects were classified as either chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) or other CU, and the clinical features were compared. Remission was defined as having no symptoms without treatment for more than 1 year. The remission rate was analyzed, and the factors influencing the prognosis were investigated.The average age of the study population was 5.96 ± 4.06 years, and 64 (83.1%) patients had CSU. The remission rates at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and 4 years after symptom onset were 22.1%, 40.3%, 52.0%, 63.7%, and 70.2%, respectively, for children with CU. For children with CSU, these values were 23.4%, 43.7%, 56.2%, 68.7%, and 75.0%, respectively. The total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels were positively correlated with disease duration (r = 0.262, P = 0.021); no other factors were associated with the duration of the disease.A high proportion of children with CU were classified as CSU. No indicators, except for total IgE were found to predict the timing of spontaneous remission. The CU remission rate identified in this study is expected to be used as one of the reference data for the progress of CU in patients.",

We aimed to investigate the epigenomic distribution of DNA 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and the role of TET2 in CD4+ T cells of allergic rhinitis (AR).The hMeDIP-seq was performed to identify sequences with 5hmC deposition in CD4+ T cells of AR patients. Tet2-deficient or wild type mice were stimulated with ovalbumin (OVA) to develop an AR mouse model. The histopathology in nasal mucosae, Th1/Th2/Treg/Th17 cell percentage, concentrations of Th-related cytokines, expression of Tets and differential hydroxymethylated genes (DhMG), and the global deposition of 5hmC in sorted CD4+ T cells were detected.Epigenome-wide 5hmC landscape and DhMG in the CD4+ T cells of AR patients were identified. Tet2 depletion did not led to spontaneous inflammation. However, under the stimulation of allergen, OVA, loss of Tet2 resulted in the exacerbation of allergic inflammation, which was characterized by severer allergic symptoms, more inflammatory cells infiltrating the nasal lamina propria, sharper imbalances between Th1/Th2 and Treg/Th17 cells, and excessive secretion of OVA-specific IgE and Th2-related cytokines. Moreover, altered mRNA production of several DhMG and sharp decrease in 5hmC deposition were also observed in Tet2-deficient OVA-exposed mice.TET2 may regulate DNA 5hmC, DhMG expressions, and CD4+ T cell balance in AR.",

Thus, asthma in those of chronological age ≥ 65 years is not rare. Elderly asthma (EA) imposes considerable burdens in terms of mortality and morbidity, and expenditure. However, clinicians lack knowledge of EA and thus often prescribe inappropriate management. In this review, we ask 3 key questions frequently encountered during EA diagnosis and treatment: 1) Is EA different?; 2) How can we appropriately diagnose EA?; 3) Are there management strategies specific to EA? Based on recent studies, we provide tentative answers as follows: 1) late-onset EA differs in clinical features and pathogenetic mechanisms from non-EA, and thus further phenotypic and endotypic characterization of EA is needed; 2) both over- and under-diagnosis of asthma in the elderly can be reduced if the objective diagnostic tests are appropriately performed; 3) cautious prescription of ICS to selected EA patients should be encouraged, and a multifaceted approach which involves increasing medical awareness and inhaler use proficiency and adherence, seeking the assistance of caregivers, and correcting micronutrient deficiencies is required to reduce acute exacerbations in EA patients.",

This study aimed to investigate the expressions of ERα and ERβ as well as their mechanisms in airway remodeling and mucus production in asthma.The expressions of ERα and ERβ in the airway epithelial cells of bronchial biopsies and induced sputum cells were examined by immunohistochemistry. The associations of ERs expressions with airway inflammation and remodeling were evaluated in asthmatic patients. In vitro, the regulations of ERs expressions in human bronchial epithelial cell lines were examined using western blot analysis. The epidermal growth factor (EGF)-mediated ligand-independent activation of ERα and its effect on epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) were investigated in asthmatic epithelial cells by western blot, immunofluorescent staining, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.ERα and ERβ were expressed on both bronchial epithelial cells and induced sputum cells, and the expressions showed no sex difference. Compared to controls, male asthmatic patients had higher levels of ERα on the bronchial epithelium, and there were cell-specific expressions of ERα and ERβ in induced sputum. The expression of ERα in the airway epithelium was inversely correlated to forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) % and FEV1/forced vital capacity. Severe asthmatic patients had significantly greater levels of ERα in the airway epithelium than mild-moderate patients. ERα level was positively correlated with the thickness of the subepithelial basement membrane and airway epithelium. In vitro, co-stimulation of interleukin (IL)-4 and EGF increased the expression of ERα and promoted its nuclear translocation. EGF activated the phosphorylation of ERα via extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathways. ERα knockdown alleviated EGF-mediated EMTs and mucus production in airway epithelial cells of asthma.ERα contributes to asthmatic airway remodeling and mucus production through the EGF-mediated ligand-independent pathway.",

This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of claudin-3 for epithelial barrier dysfunction in CRSwNP.In this study, TJ protein levels were evaluated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescent, and immunohistochemistry staining in control subjects and CRSwNP patients. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was created to assess the predictive value of TJ breakdown in clinical outcomes. In vitro, human nasal epithelial cells were cultured at the air-liquid interface to analyze the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) level.The expression levels of occludin, tricellulin, claudin-3, and claudin-10 were decreased (all P < 0.05), and those of claudin-1 was increased (P < 0.05) in CRSwNP patients as compared to healthy subjects. Additionally, claudin-3 and occludin levels were negatively correlated with the computed tomography score in CRSwNP (all P < 0.05), and the ROC curve indicated that the claudin-3 level had the most predictive accuracy in evaluating epithelial barrier disruption (area under the curve = 0.791, P < 0.001). Finally, the time-series analysis showed the highest correlation coefficient between TER and claudin-3 (cross-correlation function = 0.75).In this study, we suggest that claudin-3 could be a valuable biomarker for predicting nasal epithelial barrier defects and disease severity in CRSwNP.",

Patient records with EADs of interest were identified between January 1, 2015, and June 30, 2018.Overall, 1,326,645 patients were included; 74.4% had 1 EAD, 20.5% had ≥ 2 EADs, and 5.1% had ≥ 3 EADs. Higher rates of disease overlap were associated with older age. Higher blood eosinophil counts were also observed in patients with a greater number of overlapping conditions, suggesting a common role for eosinophilic inflammation in the pathogenesis of multiple diseases. Furthermore, greater disease overlap was associated with higher disease severity in most cohorts.Results from this study have implications for quantifying unmet needs and can be used to inform treatment guidelines and raise the awareness of eosinophilic inflammation and EAD overlap among healthcare professionals from a range of disease specialties.",

Several biomarkers for particular asthma phenotypes have been documented. These are generally identified from transcriptomics and proteomics protocols and tend to be biased to T2-high phenotypes.

    "abstract": "Korean allergology has made great progress in keeping pace with global scientific advances in spite of a short history. Outstanding academic and scientific researches have been performed in a variety of allergy fields in Korea. Epidemiologic studies revealed increasing prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases and considerable morbidity and mortality in Korea. Novel inhalant allergens such as citrus red mite and two-spotted spider mite as causes of asthma and allergic rhinitis have been discovered and reported in Korea. Bidirectional translational researches have been performed and are underway to elucidate the pathogenesis of asthma and allergy, mechanisms of airway inflammation and remodeling, and new therapeutic modalities for asthma and allergic diseases. Experimental asthma models of different phenotypes according to exposed levels of lipopolysaccharide or double-stranded RNA suggested the crucial role of the innate immunity in the development of allergic airway inflammation and a new insight for asthma pathogenesis, in which both Th1 and Th2 inflammation are involved. In the field of genetic researches, numerous genetic associations with asthma and asthma-related phenotypes, such as atopy, IgE production, and airway hyperresponsiveness, have been demonstrated in Korean population. The Easy Asthma Management (EAM) program, a computer-assisted asthma management program, is anticipated to facilitate the achievement of more successful clinical outcomes by filling the gaps between guidelines and actual practices. The Integration of these multi-disciplinary allergy research resources and translation of scientific achievements to the bedside and society will lead to better allergy and asthma control in Korea.",

    "abstract": "Gastro-esophageal reflux (GER), particularly non-acid reflux, is common in infants and is a known cause of chronic respiratory symptoms in infancy. Recent guidelines recommended empirical acid suppression therapy and the head-up position in patients with suspected GER. However, the efficacy of the upright position in relieving GER and reflux-related respiratory symptoms in infants is unclear. We conducted this study to investigate the efficacy of the upright position on GER and reflux-related respiratory symptoms in infants with chronic respiratory symptoms.Thirty-two infants (21 male; median age, 5 months; range, 0 to 19 months) with unexplained chronic respiratory symptoms underwent multi-channel intraluminal esophageal impedance and pH monitoring. We retrospectively compared the frequencies of GER and reflux-related symptoms according to body position.A mean of 3.30 episodes of reflux per hour was detected. Overall, refluxes were more frequent during the postprandial period than the emptying period (3.77 vs. 2.79 episodes/hour, respectively; P=0.01). Although there was no significant difference in the total refluxes per hour between the upright and recumbent positions (6.12 vs. 3.77 episodes, P=0.10), reflux-related respiratory symptoms per reflux were significantly fewer in infants kept in an upright position than in a recumbent position during the postprandial period (3.07% vs. 14.75%, P=0.016). Non-acid reflux was the predominant type of reflux in infants, regardless of body position or meal time.The upright position may reduce reflux-related respiratory symptoms, rather than reflux frequency. Thus, it may be a useful non-pharmacological treatment for infantile GER disease resistant to acid suppressants.",

    "abstract": "Allergic sensitization is a risk factor for the development of bronchial asthma. This study was conducted to investigate clinical manifestations according to sensitized allergens in adult Korean patients with bronchial asthma. In total, 523 adult patients who were diagnosed with bronchial asthma between March 2002 and March 2008 were included in the study. All patients underwent skin prick tests for approximately 45 allergens or a specific IgE test. Sensitized allergens were grouped into the following categories: house dust mites, fungus, pollen, and animal dander. Atopy was defined as a positive skin prick test response or the presence of a specific IgE to one or more allergens. Of the 523 patients, 295 (56%) were sensitized to one or more allergens. A younger median age, greater proportion of males, higher eosinophil counts, and higher total IgE levels were observed in the atopic asthma group compared to the non-atopic asthma group. The PC20 value was negatively correlated with eosinophil counts and total IgE in the atopic asthma group. In the subgroup analysis, patients sensitized to Cladosporium showed poorer pulmonary function and a higher response to bronchodilators. In addition, patients sensitized to Alternaria showed severer bronchial hyperresponsiveness than non-atopic patients with asthma. Finally, a gradual increase in the number of sensitized allergens was noted with increasing age, eosinophil counts, and total IgE levels. We suggest the need for identifying the existence of atopy and exact offending allergens at the time of asthma diagnosis, since significant differences in sex, age, blood test results, and lung function were observed according to atopy and sensitized allergens.",

However, all asthmatics do not respond to the same extent to a given medication. Available data suggest that a substantial range of individual variability, as much as 70%, may be due to genetic characteristics of each patient. Pharmacogenomics offers the potential to optimize medications for individual asthmatics by using genetic information to improve efficacy or avoid adverse effects. The best-studied case of the potential contribution of pharmacogenomics to treatment response in asthma comes from studies on human beta2 adrenergic receptors. In addition, genetic variation in beta2-adrenergic receptor (Arg16Gly) may predict response to anticholinergics for the treatment of asthma. In case of inhaled corticosteroids, a recent investigation using a traditional SNP-based approach identified a gene for corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 as a potential marker of response. Another major pathway that has been investigated is the pathway underlying response to cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist. It is likely that in the near future, pharmacogenomic approaches based on individual genetic information will be introduced into an asthma treatment guideline and this guideline will allow us to identify those who have the best chance to respond to a specific medication.",

    "abstract": "Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) is typically measured by bronchial challenge tests that employ direct stimulation by methacholine or indirect stimulation by adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP). Some studies have shown that the AMP challenge test provides a better reflection of airway inflammation, but few studies have examined the relationship between the AMP and methacholine challenge tests in children with asthma. We investigated the relationship between AMP and methacholine testing in children and adolescents with atopic asthma. The medical records of 130 children with atopic asthma (mean age, 10.63 years) were reviewed retrospectively. Methacholine and AMP test results, spirometry, skin prick test results, and blood tests for inflammatory markers (total IgE, eosinophils [total count, percent of white blood cells]) were analyzed. The concentration of AMP that induces a 20% decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] (PC20) of methacholine correlated with the PC20 of AMP (r(2)=0.189, P<0.001). No significant differences were observed in the levels of inflammatory markers (total eosinophil count, eosinophil percentage, and total IgE) between groups that were positive and negative for BHR to methacholine. However, significant differences in inflammatory markers were observed in groups that were positive and negative for BHR to AMP (log total eosinophil count, P=0.023; log total IgE, P=0.020, eosinophil percentage, P<0.001). In contrast, body mass index (BMI) was significantly different in the methacholine positive and negative groups (P=0.027), but not in the AMP positive and negative groups (P=0.62). The PC20 of methacholine correlated with FEV1, FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC), and maximum mid-expiratory flow (MMEF) (P=0.001, 0.011, 0.001, respectively), and the PC20 of AMP correlated with FEV1, FEV1/FVC, and MMEF (P=0.008, 0.046, 0.001, respectively). Our results suggest that the AMP and methacholine challenge test results correlated well with respect to determining BHR. The BHR to AMP more likely implicated airway inflammation in children with atopic asthma. In contrast, the BHR to methacholine was related to BMI.",

Allergic rhinitis and asthma often coexist as chronic inflammatory diseases of the upper and lower airways, respectively, and have an impact on each other. In fact, inhaled corticosteroids reduce seasonal eosinophilia systemically in the circulation and locally in the nasal mucosa, as well as attenuate seasonal nasal symptoms. We report a case of EOM associated with adult-onset asthma that improved following optimal asthma therapy after changing the treatment from inhaled fluticasone propionate (FP) (200 µg b.i.d.) to a combination of FP/salmeterol (250/50 µg b.i.d.).

Protein extracts from the sera of seven patients with peanut-specific IgE levels >15 kU(A)/L were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunolabeling. A densitometer was used to quantify and compare the allergenicity of each protein. The density of Ara h 1 was reduced by treatment with pH 1.0, 3.0, or 5.0 acetic acid, or commercial vinegar. Ara h 2 remained largely unchanged after treatment with pH 5.0 acetic acid, and was decreased following treatment with pH 1.0, 2.3, or 3.0 acetic acid. Ara h 3 and Ara h 6 appeared as a thick band after treatment with pH 1.0 acetic acid and commercial vinegar. IgE-binding intensities to Ara h 1, Ara h 2, and Ara h 3 were significantly reduced after treatment with pH 1.0 acetic acid or commercial vinegar.

Exposure to wheat flour can cause IgE sensitization and respiratory symptoms in bakery workers. Therefore, we hypothesized that IL-4 and IL-4Rα single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may be involved in the pathogenic mechanism of baker's asthma. Clinical and genetic data from 373 bakery workers were analyzed. A survey questionnaire, spirometry, and skin prick tests with wheat flour were performed. Serum-specific IgE, IgG1, and IgG4 to wheat flour were determined using ELISA. Five candidate IL-4 (-729 T>G, 589 T>C, and 33 T>C) and IL-4Rα (Ile75Val A>G and Gln576Arg A>G) SNPs were genotyped and analyzed. Workers with the G allele of IL-4Rα Ile75Val A>G had a significantly higher prevalence of work-related lower respiratory symptoms than those with the AA genotype (P=0.004, 16.0% vs. 2.9%). In the skin prick test, workers with the AA genotype of IL-4Rα Gln576Arg A>G had a significantly higher positive rate to wheat flour (P=0.015, 8.2% vs. 1.1%) than those with AG/GG genotype. No significant associations were found in the three genetic polymorphisms of IL-4. For the predicted probabilities, workers with the AA genotype of Gln576Arg A>G had a higher prevalence of IgG1 and IgG4 in response to wheat flour, according to increased exposure intensity (P=0.001 for IgG1 and P=0.003 for IgG4). These findings suggest that the IL-4Rα Ile75Val and Gln576Arg polymorphisms may be associated with work-related respiratory symptom development.",

Therefore, we surveyed the prescription patterns of AIT by allergy specialists in Korea.We emailed a questionnaire on AIT prescription patterns to the 690 members of the Korean Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Clinical Immunology with clinical practice experience. All returned answers were evaluated.The response rate was 21.0%. Only 69.0% of the respondents performed AIT in practice. Hindrance factors for performing AIT in the practice included a lack of facilities (21%), lack of practical experience during their subspecialty or postgraduate educational training programs (15.8%), no need for AIT because of sufficient pharmacotherapy (14.5%), insufficient economic profits (14.5%), and risks for adverse reactions (13.2%). Ninety-two allergy specialists (82%) performed AIT subcutaneously subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) and 20 allergy specialists (18%) performed it sublingually sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT). Only 8 specialists performed both SCIT and SLIT. The allergens used for SCIT were house dust mites (98.9%), pollens (72.8%), and animal dander (23.9%). SLIT was prescribed only for house dust mites. Twenty-eight physicians (30.4%) observed anaphylactic reactions during SCIT. Eight physicians (40.0%) who prescribed SLIT observed adverse reactions, including local reactions, but none of them observed anaphylactic reactions.In this survey, 69.0% of the respondents performed AIT in clinical practice. SCIT prescription is more popular than SLIT. The Lack of facilities and clinical education is a critical barrier to performing AIT.

Results: Among the 259 patients, 210 underwent a single sputum examination, and the remaining 49 underwent 2 to 4 sputum examinations.Virus was detected in 68 of the 259 exacerbated episodes and in 11 of the 64 stable episodes.Among the exacerbated episodes, RV was the most frequently detected virus, followed by influenza A, parainfluenza, RSV A/B, and ADV.Among the 11 stable episodes, RV was most frequently detected.Detection rates of these viruses did not differ between the 2 groups (P>0.05).Thirty-five patients underwent the virus examination at 2 episodes of exacerbation, while 14 patients underwent at each time of exacerbated and stable episodes.Virus detection rate at the second examination was significantly higher in cases with 2 exacerbation episodes than in those with initial exacerbation and sequential stable episodes (P=0.003).A seasonal pattern was noted in the detection rates of RV (September to December), IFV (January to April), PIV (May to September), and RSV A/B (September to April).Conclusions: Respiratory viruses were identified in approximately 20% of LRTI irrespective of the presence of asthma exacerbation.RV and IFV A/B were most frequently detected.A group of patients experienced frequent viral infections followed by asthma exacerbations.",

On the other hand, the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) converts glucose to intermediate products like UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, which is critical for post-translational modifications of proteins, such as protein glycosylation. These 2 pathways are well known to contribute to glucose metabolism, but recent studies indicate modulation of these pathways can alter immune system function. In this review article, the authors present results suggesting how cellular metabolism, including glycolysis and the HBP, occurs in immune cells, and the immunologic significances of such activities. In addition, they provide a review of the literature on the effects of glycolysis and the HBP on various autoimmune, immunologic, and allergic diseases.

Although in vitro systems have been developed to model these different subsets, there has been limited investigation into the functional characteristics of the 2 major MC subsets. Here, we report the immunologic characterization of 2 MCs subsets developed in vitro from bone marrow progenitors modeling MMCs and CTMCs. We grew bone marrow for 4 weeks in the presence of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, interleukin (IL)-9, IL-3, and stem cell factor (SCF) to generate MMCs, and IL-4, IL-3, and SCF to generate CTMCs. CTMCs and MMCs differed in growth rate and protease content, but their immune characteristics were remarkably similar. Both subsets responded to immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated activation with signaling, degranulation, and inflammatory cytokine release, although differences between subsets were noted in IL-10. CTMCs and MMCs showed a similar toll-like receptor (TLR) expression profile, dominated by expression of TLR4, TLR6, or both subsets were responsive to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but not poly(I:C). CTMCs and MMCs express receptors for IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), and respond to these cytokines alone or with modified activation in response to IgE cross-linking. The results of this paper show the immunologic characterization of bone marrow-derived MMCs and CTMCs, providing useful protocols for in vitro modeling of MC subsets.",

    "abstract": "Purpose:The data on the differences between sputum autoantibodies (Sp-Abs) and serum autoantibodies (Se-Abs) in reflection of autoimmune responses to lungs is still lacking.Methods: Ten types of Abs were investigated in matched Se and Sp samples collected from recruited subjects.Correlations between Ab levels and airway inflammatory parameters and measures of pulmonary function were assessed.The network-based and inter-correlated analysis was performed to explore the patterns of Sp-and Se-Ab profiles.Results: Fifty stable asthmatic patients and 24 healthy volunteers were recruited for our study, 15 with mild asthma, 18 with moderate asthma and 17 with severe asthma.The concentrations of Sp-Ab against U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (Sp-anti-U1-SnRNP), Sp-Ab against Smith antigen and Se-Ab against thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) in severe asthmatics and Sp-anti-U1-SnRNP in moderate asthmatics were significantly higher compared to healthy controls and mild asthmatic subjects (P < 0.05).Sp-anti-U1-SnRNP levels were positively correlated with the dose of inhaled corticosteroids, Sp eosinophil counts and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (r = 0.326, P = 0.022; r = 0.356, P = 0.012; r = 0.241, P = 0.025, respectively) and negatively correlated with Sp neutrophil counts (r = -0.308,P = 0.031) with adjustment for age.Spearman's correlation matrix showed multiple intercorrelations among Sp-Abs and Se-Abs (P < 0.05) while only the levels of Ab against DNA topoisomerase and anti-TPO in Se were correlated with those Sp-Ab counterparts (P < 0.05).The network-based analysis defined 2 clusters: clusters 1 and 2 contained 10 Sp-Abs and 10 Se-Abs, respectively.Conclusions: This study observes that Sp-Abs are more associated with clinical parameters and the severity of disease in asthma compared to Se-Abs.Targeting on Sp-Abs which are the hallmark of the localized autoimmune event might help us better understand the role of autoimmunity in the pathological mechanism of asthma.",

    "abstract": "Childhood asthma has a considerable social impact and economic burden, especially in severe asthma. This study aimed to identify the proportion of childhood asthma severity and to evaluate associated factors for greater asthma severity.This study was performed on 667 children aged 5-15 years with asthma from the nationwide 19 hospitals in the Korean childhood Asthma Study (KAS). Asthma was classified as mild intermittent, mild persistent, and moderate/severe persistent groups according to the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program recommendations. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to identify the associated factors for greater asthma severity.Mild persistent asthma was most prevalent (39.0%), followed by mild intermittent (37.6%), moderate persistent (22.8%), and severe persistent asthma (0.6%). Onset later than 6 years of age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.69 for mild persistent asthma; aOR, 1.92 for moderate/severe persistent asthma) tended to increase asthma severity. Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (aOR, 1.53 for mild persistent asthma; aOR, 1.85 for moderate/severe persistent asthma), and current dog ownership with sensitization to dog dander (aOR, 5.86 for mild persistent asthma; aOR, 6.90 for moderate/severe persistent asthma) showed increasing trends with greater asthma severity. Lower maternal education levels (aOR, 2.32) and no usage of an air purifier in exposure to high levels of outdoor air pollution (aOR, 1.76) were associated with moderate/severe persistent asthma.Modification of identified environmental factors associated with greater asthma severity might help better control childhood asthma, thereby reducing the disease burden due to childhood asthma.",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronically relapsing inflammatory skin disease that causes severe pruritus and sleep disturbance.1,2 Most cases of AD occur in infants and children younger than five years of age.2 AD is caused by the interplay between various genetic and environmental factors. The gene encoding filaggrin (FLG) has been most consistently reported as being responsible for AD,3 although Korean children have a lower frequency of FLG mutations than European populations.4,5 Environmental factors such as physical trauma, allergens, and environmental tobacco smoke are also known to contribute to the development of AD.2,6 However, the exact pathogenesis is still under investigation. Because of its high prevalence, low quality of life, and possible progression to asthma, AD is regarded as one of the major health problems in children.\r\n\r\nFor global epidemiologic research into asthma and allergies, the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) program was initiated in 1991 by establishing a standardized methodology of a questionnaire survey.7 Since then, ISAAC Phases One, Two, and Three have been conducted worldwide to estimate the regional and international prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases and to investigate the temporal trends in symptom prevalence of allergic diseases in children.8 The prevalence of AD was also evaluated using the ISAAC protocol. The lifetime prevalence of AD is 10%-20% in children and 1%-3% in adults.2 A study involving children aged 6-7 years from 35 countries (n=187,943) and children aged 13-14 years from 55 countries (n=302,159) was conducted to examine the change in prevalence between Phases One and Three. This study showed an increasing prevalence of AD in many developing countries, although the epidemic of eczema had reached a plateau or was decreasing in some countries with previously high prevalence rates.9\r\n\r\nThe first nationwide, population-based, cross-sectional study on AD prevalence in Korea was conducted in 1995 by the Korean Academy of Pediatric Allergy and Respiratory Diseases with a Korean version of the ISAAC questionnaire.10 At that time, children aged 6-12 years from 34 elementary schools (n=27,404) and children aged 12-15 years from 34 middle schools (n=15,481) were randomly selected for the analysis. Symptom prevalence of flexural eczema in the last 12 months was 7.3% in 6-12 years olds and 3.9% in 12-15 years olds.\r\n\r\nThe second and third nationwide surveys were conducted using the same ISAAC protocol in 2000 and 2010, respectively.11,12 In 2010, a stratified two-stage cluster-sampling design was used to randomly select children aged 6-7 years or 12-13 years. Among 4,003 children aged 6-7 years, the prevalence of 'itchy eczema, ever' was 27.0%, and the prevalence of 'itchy eczema, last 12 months' was 20.6%. Among 4,112 adolescents aged 12-13 years, the prevalence of 'itchy eczema, ever' and 'itchy eczema, last 12 months' was 19.9% and 13.1%, respectively. When AD prevalence was compared between 2000 and 2010, the lifetime prevalence of itchy eczema in children aged 6-7 years increased from 17.1% to 27.0%, and that of itchy eczema in the last 12 months increased from 13.4% to 20.6%. Children aged 12-13 years demonstrated a similar trend of increasing prevalence of eczema: from 8.4% to 19.9% for 'itchy eczema, ever' and from 6.7% to 13.1% for 'itchy eczema, last 12 months.' Therefore, we noted that the prevalence of AD is still increasing in Korean children, but it is not clear why the prevalence has increased during the past 10 years.\r\n\r\nThe ISAAC survey in Korean children was a very important turning point that drew attention to AD in Korea by revealing its high prevalence rate, especially in infants. However, a questionnaire survey is a limited method for epidemiologic studies because of the possibility of recall bias and sampling error. To overcome this issue, the use of national statistics was attempted in order to estimate AD prevalence in Korea from 2003 through 2008.13 This could be an alternative method because the National Health Insurance Corporation in Korea has covered all parts of medical fees for the whole population as a compulsory social insurance system. The authors found that the prevalence of physician-diagnosed AD in children aged less than 18 years in 2008 was 6.9%,13 a slight decrease from 7.2% in 2003. However, national statistics data still have a limitation in diagnostic accuracy due to inter-observer variability.\r\n\r\nIn this issue of the AAIR journal, Lee et al.14 report the prevalence of AD in Korean children using data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. They analyzed 8,947 children aged 18 years or younger across the country and demonstrated that 13.5% of children had ever been diagnosed with AD by a physician. Importantly, the authors have provided another method to examine AD prevalence in a general population, although it should be noted that this is not the first nationwide, population-based study on AD prevalence.10,11,13 In addition, the authors provided a lifetime prevalence of AD rather than point prevalence and were dependent on parental reports for the diagnosis of AD, showing that methodological limitations of the previous studies still remain.\r\n\r\nDetermination of the true prevalence of AD is crucial to evaluate the current status and prepare an appropriate strategy for primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention of AD. However, we need to understand the limitations of epidemiologic studies and that the different methodologies used so far are complementary and do not replace one another. We also have to recognize the necessity of prevalence studies performed on a regular basis in order to cope with common pediatric diseases such as AD.",

A 57-year-old female experienced repeated episodes of well-demarcated erythematous patches covering her entire body. She denied taking any medications, but she thought that the lesions appeared after consuming pork and/or fish. An oral provocation test showed positive results for doxycycline and erythromycin, commonly used antibiotics in live-stock farming and in the fishing industry. Because of the antibiotics' thermostability, cooking does not guarantee the elimination of residual drugs. From the patient's history, we concluded that doxycycline and erythromycin contained in the pork and fish that she ate were the cause of the FDE.",

However, few studies have revealed their seasonal specificity for allergic rhinitis symptoms. An ARIA (Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma) classification of allergic rhinitis was recently introduced and its clinical validation has not been well proved. The aim of this study was to evaluate the seasonal specificity of seasonal allergens and to validate the ARIA classification with the conventional seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis (SAR/PAR) classification.Two hundred twenty six patients with allergic rhinitis were included in this study. The patients were classified according to the sensitized allergens and the ARIA classifications. A questionnaire survey was performed and the data on the seasonal symptom score, the severity of symptoms and the SNOT (sinonasal outcome test)-20 score was obtained and the data was analyzed and compared between the conventional SAR/PAR classification and the ARIA classification.Seasonal pollens (tree, grass, weed) were not specific to the pollen peak season and the patients' symptoms were severe during spring and autumn regardless of the offending pollens. More than 60% of the patients with SAR showed persistent symptoms and 33% of the patients with perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR) had intermittent symptoms, showing the lack of association between the SAR/PAR/PAR+SAR classification and the ARIA classification. The ARIA classification showed better association not only with the symptomatic score, but also with the SNOT-20 score, which showed better validity than the conventional SAR/PAR classifications.Seasonal pollens were not specific to their season of prevalence in terms of the severity of symptoms, and the ARIA classification showed better representation of allergic symptoms and quality of life (SNOT-20 score) than did the SAR/PAR classification.",

We observed the following 4 major findings in these 3 patients during the long-term follow-up after AIGT. (1) Two of the 3 patients showed a long-term clinical improvement for more than 36 weeks after AIGT with a maximum decrease in clinical severity score greater than 80% from baseline.

(3) No significant side effect was observed during the 2 years of follow-up period after the AIGT in all 3 patients. (4) Serum levels of IgG anti-idiotype antibodies to the F(ab')₂ fragment of autologous IgG administered for the treatment were not significantly changed after AIGT in all 3 patients. These findings suggest that AIGT has long-term favorable effects on both clinical severity and laboratory parameters in selected patients with severe recalcitrant AD. Further studies are required to evaluate the clinical usefulness and therapeutic mechanism of AIGT for AD.",

    "abstract": "Allergic rhinitis (AR) is one of the most common chronic allergic respiratory diseases worldwide. Various practical guidelines for AR have been developed and updated to improve the care of AR patients; however, up to 40% patients remain symptomatic. The unmet need for AR care is one of the greatest public health problems in the world. The gaps between guideline and real-world practice, and differences according to the region, culture, and medical environments may be the causes of unmet needs for AR care. Because there is no evidence-based AR practical guideline reflecting the Korean particularity, various needs are increasing. The purpose of the study was to evaluate whether existing guidelines are sufficient for AR patient management in real practice and whether development of regional guidelines to reflect regional differences is needed in Korea. A total of 99 primary physicians comprising internists, pediatricians, and otolaryngologists (n=33 for each) were surveyed by a questionnaire relating to unmet needs for AR care between June 2 and June 16 of 2014. Among 39 question items, participants strongly agreed on 15 items that existing guidelines were highly insufficient and needed new guidelines. However, there was some disagreement according to specialties for another 24 items. In conclusion, the survey results demonstrated that many physicians did not agree with the current AR guideline, and a new guideline reflecting Korean particularity was needed.",

The purpose of our study was to investigate the clinical course of CSU in the Korean adult population. Each patient in the CSU group who was defined by disease codes between 2003 and 2007 was tracked whether he or she went into remission or not until 2013. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was carried out to analyze remission, and log-rank tests were performed for between-group comparisons. Demographic differences between subjects who went into remission 1 year after the initial diagnosis and those who did not were analyzed using χ² tests. A total of 13,969 subjects were included in the CSU group. The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year remission rates of CSU were 21.5%, 33.0%, 38.9%, 42.6%, and 44.6%, respectively. The proportion of subjects in the 65+ age group (P=0.050) and with male gender (P=0.002) was significantly higher among subjects who did not go into remission 1 year after the initial diagnosis.

Probiotics have immunomodulatory effects by balancing Th1/Th2 immunity and enhancing regulatory T-cell activity. In this study, we analyzed the effects of OIT, probiotics alone, and probiotics administered simultaneously with OIT in a mouse model of egg allergy.C3H/HeJ mice were sensitized by intragastric administration of ovomucoid (OM) with cholera toxin. For the OIT regime, increasing doses of OM were administered orally to sensitized mice. Lactobacillus casei variety ramnosus (Lcr35) was also administered. The mice were divided into 4 groups: control (no OIT), OIT, Lcr35, and OIT plus Lcr35 (OIT + Lcr35). The effects of OIT and Lcr35 treatment were estimated based on the symptom score, rectal temperature, serum levels of OM-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)E, IgA, IgG1, and IgG2a immediately after and 2 weeks after ceasing treatment and histological staining of the small intestine.The severity of anaphylaxis decreased in all treatment groups. Simultaneous administration of Lcr35 and OIT decreased the severity of anaphylaxis compared to controls and the OIT group. The protective effects were sustained 2 weeks after ceasing treatment in all treatment groups. A significant decrease in OM-specific IgA, IgG1, and IgG2a levels was observed in both the OIT and OIT plus Lcr35 groups. However, a significant decrease in the OM-specific IgE level was observed only in OIT plus Lcr35 treated mice and was sustained 2 weeks after ceasing treatment. Mucin amounts in the small intestine decreased after OIT, OIT plus Lcr35, and Lcr35 treatment with the lowest in the OIT plus Lcr35 group.Lcr35 treatment during OIT had some synergic effect for protection against anaphylaxis in a mice model of egg allergy.

    "abstract": "Purpose ImmunoCAP® (ImmunoCAP) and IMMULITE® 2000 3gAllergy™ (3gAllergy) systems are major quantitative allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE) assay methods. Due to the heterogeneous nature of allergenic extracts and differences in the assay format, quantitation of allergen-sIgEs is not expected to correlate well between different methods. However, we have recently reported good agreement between the methods in the diagnosis of egg allergy. This study aimed to determine and correlate the predictive values of sIgE by the two systems in the diagnosis of milk and wheat allergies. Methods Children who had undergone oral food challenge (OFC) for the diagnosis of milk and wheat allergies were enrolled. The OFCs were performed to diagnose either true allergy in the 1-year-old group (A) or tolerance in the 2- to 6-year-old group (B). Milk, casein and β-lactoglobulin, and wheat and ω-5 gliadin sIgE values were measured using the 2 systems. The predictive accuracy of each sIgE for the OFC outcome was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The probability of a positive OFC outcome was estimated by logistic regression analysis. Results A total of 395 patients were recruited from 7 primary care clinics and 19 hospitals in Japan. Milk and wheat OFCs were performed for 87 and 102 group A patients, and 124 and 82 group B patients, respectively. ROC analysis yielded similar areas under the curve for the 2 assays (0.7-0.9). The log-transformed sIgE data showed a strong linear correlation with the estimated probabilities (R > 0.9). Conclusions The 2 systems may be interchangeable for diagnosis of milk and wheat allergies in young children.",

The aim of this study was to assess the therapeutic potential of the TLR9 pathway inhibitor chloroquine in CRS mice.The expression of type I interferons (IFNs) in human CRS tissues was evaluated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), western blotting, and immunofluorescence. Mice were divided into 4 treatment groups: the control, nasal polyp (NP), chloroquine treatment (NP + Chlq), and dexamethasone treatment (NP + Dexa) groups. The effects of chloroquine on polyp formation and mucosal inflammation were examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The expression levels of type I IFN, B-cell activating factor (BAFF), TLR9, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and proinflammatory cytokine expression levels were assessed using qPCR, western blot, or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.IFN-α and IFN-β mRNA levels were significantly higher in patients with eosinophilic NPs (EPs) than in healthy individuals or non-EP patients. The polyp score, epithelial thickness, mucosal thickness, and the number of eosinophils in nasal mucosa were significantly higher in the NP group compared with the control, NP + Chlq, and NP + Dexa groups. NP + Chlq or NP + Dexa significantly suppressed the induction of type I IFN and BAFF expression in the NP group; these treatments also significantly suppressed the induction of TLR9, HMGB1, interferon regulatory factors, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and Th cytokine expression in the NP group. The secreted levels of anti-dsDNA Immunoglobulin G (IgG) were significantly higher in the NP group than in the control, NP + Chlq, and NP + Dexa groups. There were significant positive correlations between BAFF and mRNA levels of IFN-α/β/the protein levels of anti-dsDNA IgG.Chloroquine may be used for the treatment of patients with eosinophilic CRS.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a complex disease caused by interplay of genes and environment on the genome of an individual. Copy number variations (CNVs) are more common compared to the other variations that disrupt genome organization. The effect of CNVs on asthma subgenome has been less studied compared to studies on the other variations. We report the assessments of CNV burden in asthma genes of normal cohorts carried out in different geographical areas of the world and discuss the relevance of the observation with respect to asthma pathogenesis. CNV analysis was performed using Affymerix high-resolution arrays, and various bioinformatics tools were used to understand the influence of genes on asthma pathogenesis. This study identified 61 genes associated with asthma and provided various mechanisms and pathways underlying asthma pathogenesis. CCL3L1, ADAM8, and MUC5B were the most prevalent asthma genes. Among them, CCL3L1 was found across all 12 populations in varying copy number states. This study also identified the inheritance of asthma-CNVs from parents to offspring creating the latent period for manifestation of asthma. This study revealed CNV burden with varying copy number states and identified susceptibility towards the disease manifestation. It can be hypothesized that primary CNVs may not be the initiating event in the pathogenesis of asthma and additional preceding mutations or CNVs may be required. The initiator or primary CNVs sensitize normal cohorts leading to an increased probability of accumulating mutations or exposure to allergic stimulating agents that can augment the development of asthma.",

The current understanding and attitude of Chinese ENT (ear, nose, and throat) specialists in regards to SIT is unclear. This study investigates current trends in the awareness and application status of SIT among Chinese ENT specialists. We performed a nationwide, cross-sectional survey with a specially designed questionnaire given to 800 ENT specialists in China. A member of the trained research group conducted face-to-face interviews with each respondent. Most of the respondents considered AR (96.0%) and allergic asthma (96.0%) the most suitable indications for SIT. Of all respondents, 77.0% recommended the application of SIT as early as possible; in addition, SIT was considered 'relatively controllable and safe' by most respondents (80.6%). The highest allergen-positive rate in AR was associated with house dust mite (47.7%) and obvious differences existed among geographical regions. Conventional subcutaneous immunotherapy was the most highly recommended treatment option (96.2%). 'The high cost of SIT' (86.6%) and 'lack of patient knowledge of SIT' (85.2%) were probably the main reasons for the lower clinical use of SIT in China. Most cases showed that the opinions of Chinese ENT specialists appeared to be in agreement with recent SIT progress and international guidelines; however, many areas still need to enhance the standardization and use of SIT in China. Clinical guidelines for SIT require improvement; in addition, Chinese ENT specialists need continuing medical education on SIT.",

The present study was aimed to investigate the effects of KR62980 on nasal symptoms and immunopathological profiles in allergic nasal mucosa in murine allergic rhinitis model. BALB/c mice were sensitized and challenged intranasally with ovalbumin (OVA). KR62980 was administered intraperitoneally or orally 3 hours before each intranasal OVA challenge. Administration of KR62980 significantly decreased the number of nasal rubbing, nasal sneezing, ova-specific IgE and total IgE in serum, secretion of Interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-17 from the spleen and eosinophilic infiltration in the nasal mucosa. KR62980 decreased the expression of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10 mRNAs in the nasal mucosal tissue, while, it elevated the level of IL-10 and IFN-γ in splenocyte culture. KR62980 seemed to decrease IL-17 level in local and systemic level even though it did not reach to statistical significance. The anti-inflammatory effect was more definite when the KR62980 was administered intraorally than intraperitoneally. A novel PPAR-γ ligand, KR62980 can attenuate OVA-induced allergic inflammation in mice mainly through modulation of Th2 cytokines. This finding suggests that PPAR-γ might have a role in the treatment of allergic rhinitis.",

He has a history of chronic gastroenteritis that responds well to antihistamine drugs but not proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and prokinetic agents.

    "abstract": "Purpose: Clinical features of peanut allergy can range from localized to systemic reactions.Because peanut and birch pollen have cross-reactivity, peanut can lead to localized allergic reaction in Fagales pollen-sensitized oral allergy syndrome (OAS) patients without peanut sensitization per se.The purpose of this study was to discriminate true peanut food allergy from cross-reactive hypersensitivity in birch-sensitized peanut allergy.Methods: Birch-sensitized (n=81) and peanut anaphylaxis patients (n=12) were enrolled.Peanut-related allergic reactions and sensitization profiles were examined.Specific IgE to Fagales tree pollens (birch, oak), peanut, and their component allergens (Bet v 1, Bet v 2, Ara h 1, Ara h 2, Ara h 3, Ara h 8, and Ara h 9) were evaluated.Based on these specific IgEs and clinical features, the patients were classified into 4 groups: group 1 (Fagales pollen allergy without OAS), group 2 (Fagales pollen allergy with OAS), group 3 (OAS with peanut anaphylaxis), and group 4 (peanut anaphylaxis).Results: After peanut consumption, one-third of OAS patients experienced oral symptoms not associated with peanut sensitization.Ara h 1 or Ara h 2 was positive in peanut anaphylaxis patients, whereas Ara h 8 was positive in OAS patients.There were 4 patients with both peanut anaphylaxis and OAS (group 3).Both Ara h 2 and Ara h 8 were positive in these patients.Foods associated with OAS in Korea showed unique patterns compared to Westernized countries.Conclusions: Ara h 2 and Ara h 8 may be important component allergens for discriminating peanut allergy.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE Minimizing the future risk of asthma exacerbation (AE) is one of the main goals of asthma management. We investigated prognostic factors for risk of severe AE (SAE) in a real-world clinical setting. METHODS This is an observational study evaluating subjects who were diagnosed with asthma and treated with anti-asthmatic medications from January 1995 to June 2018. Risk factors for SAE were analyzed in 2 treatment periods (during the initial 2 years and the following 3-10 years of treatment) using the big data of electronic medical records. RESULTS In this study, 5,058 adult asthmatics were enrolled; 1,335 (28.64%) experienced ≥ 1 SAE during the initial 2 years of treatment. Female sex, higher peripheral eosinophil/basophil counts, and lower levels of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1; %) were factors predicting the risk of SAEs (P < 0.001 for all). Higher serum total immunoglobulin E levels increased the risk of SAEs among the patients having ≤ 2 SAEs (P = 0.025). Patients with more frequent SAEs during the initial 2 years of treatment had significantly higher risks of SAEs during the following years of treatment (P < 0.001, for all) (patients with ≥ 4 SAEs, odds ratio [OR], 29.147; those with 3 SAEs, OR, 14.819; those with 2 SAEs, OR, 9.867; those with 1 SAE, OR, 5.116), had higher maintenance doses of systemic steroids, and showed more gradual decline in FEV1 (%) and FEV1/forced vital capacity levels maintained during the following years of treatment (P < 0.001 for all). CONCLUSIONS Asthmatics having risk factors for SAEs (female sex, higher peripheral eosinophil/basophil counts, and lower FEV1) should be strictly monitored to prevent future risk and improve clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Oral immunotherapy (OIT) has emerged to build sustained unresponsiveness or tolerance in patients with egg allergy. However, it is important to increase compliance and ensure safety because OIT requires an extended period of time and has a risk of side effects like anaphylaxis. We aimed to show the feasibility and safety of OIT during the build-up phase using a home-based, up-dosing method in children with egg allergy. Sixteen patients aged 4 to 12 years with egg allergy were enrolled. Patients increased the dose of boiled egg white (EW) by 5% per day at home and 25% per month at the hospital, with a target dose of 40 g of boiled EW (4.0 g of EW proteins). A historical control group (n = 16) was matched for age, sex, and clinical characteristics for comparisons with the OIT group. Oral food challenge (OFC) tests were performed after completing the build-up phase. In the OIT group, 93.8% (15/16) of patients achieved desensitization, with only 1 patient discontinuing OIT before the maintenance phase due to repeated allergic reactions. Mild allergic reactions and anaphylaxis occurred in 12 (75.0%) and 2 patients (12.5%), respectively. However, there were no significant adverse reactions such as serious anxiety or life-threatening events that required discontinuation of treatment. On the contrary, only 1 patient (6.3%) in the control group passed an OFC of 40 g of boiled EW during the same period (P < 0.001). Our results suggest that home-based up-dosing protocols using boiled eggs may be safe and feasible for the build-up phase of OIT in children with egg allergy.",

The patients were randomly assigned to 4 treatment groups (2:2:1:1). The sub-analysis reported herewith was performed with the pooled groups of dupilumab and placebo from the 4 original treatment groups in the LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST study. The efficacy endpoints were annualized rate of severe exacerbation events during the 52-week study period and changes from baseline in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 in week 12. Asthma control, asthma quality of life and the effect of treatment on the levels of type 2 inflammatory biomarkers were assessed. The safety profile was also evaluated.In Korean patients, annualized severe exacerbation rates were reduced with dupilumab (n = 49) compared to placebo (n = 25) (0.259 vs 1.942) during the 52-week treatment period. The relative risk reduction with dupilumab was 87% (P < 0.001). Improvements in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 (mean difference of 0.24 L, P = 0.021) were observed in week 12 in dupilumab-treated patients. Additionally, improvements in asthma control and asthma-related quality of life were observed; the FeNO and serum immunoglobulin E levels were reduced. The incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events was comparable between the dupilumab and placebo group. A total of 11 patients from the dupilumab group reported 63 injection site reactions.Dupilumab, as an add-on therapy in severe asthma, is efficacious and has an acceptable safety profile in Korean patients.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02414854.",

However, specific description of phenotypes of AD depending on the comorbidities in early childhood is lacking. This study aimed to investigate whether the AD phenotype in early childhood is related to childhood asthma and to elucidate the mechanisms involved.Data on the first 3 years of life were collected prospectively from 1,699 children in the COhort for Childhood Origin of Asthma and allergic diseases (COCOA). We applied an unsupervised latent class analysis to the following five factors: food sensitization, inhalant sensitization, food allergy (FA), AD, and recurrent wheezing. The risks of developing FA, AD, allergic rhinitis (AR), and asthma in children aged 5-7 years were evaluated. Colonocyte transcriptome and ingenuity pathway analysis were performed.Four phenotypes were identified; no allergic diseases (78.4%), AD without sensitization (16.4%), FA with AD (2.9%), and AD with sensitization (7.8%). The FA with AD had the highest risk for FA, AR, and asthma and the highest cord blood immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels. In AD without sensitization and with sensitization, scoring of AD (SCORAD) in early childhood was higher than in FA with AD. Canonical pathway analysis with the colonocyte transcriptome revealed that the key pathway in FA with AD was 'Wnt/β-catenin Signaling.' The relative abundance of Wnt6 mRNA was positively correlated with food-specific IgE levels at 1 and 3 years.When FA is present in various phenotypes of AD at early life, regardless of severity of eczema, it may be associated with gut Wnt signaling and later development of asthma.",

Increased angiogenesis is a well-documented feature of airway remodeling in asthma. Angiogenesis refers to the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing endothelium. Angiogenesis can be initiated by endogenous angiogenic factors released from mesenchymal cells or inflammatory cells. Under physiological conditions, angiogenesis is controlled by an equilibrium between pro-endogenous and anti-endogenous angiogenic factors released from the extracellular matrix to become bioavailable. The presence of increased size and number of bronchial blood vessels indicates that angiogenesis plays a crucial role in tissue growth and remodeling in asthma. However, the diagnostic significance of circulating angiogenic factors in asthma remains unclear.

The questionnaire on AIT prescriptions and practical experiences was distributed to all members of the Korean Academy of Asthma Allergy and Clinical Immunology in June 2022. The responses were analyzed and compared with the results from 2009 and 2017. In total, 115 responses (10.1%) were collected; 58 (50.4%) from internal medicine, 34 (29.6%) from pediatricians, and 21 (18.3%) from otolaryngologists. The prescription rate for subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) was 53.8%, showing a decrease from those in 2009 and 2017; however, that for sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) increased steadily, reaching 17.9% in 2009, 40.3% in 2017, and 46.2% in 2022. The prescription rates for asthma and atopic dermatitis increased by 4.6% and 7.9%, respectively. The most frequently prescribed allergens for SCIT in 2022 were house dust mites (32.9%), pollen (30.6%), and animal dander (28.2%), with the rate for animal dander showing a significant increase from 10.3% in 2009. Most physicians (93%) used mixed allergens for SCIT, with 42.8% using a combination of 5 or more allergens. Fifty-eight (67.4%) respondents reported cases of anaphylaxis during SCIT and 36.2% reported systemic adverse reactions during SLIT. In conclusion, SLIT prescriptions, AIT for asthma and atopic dermatitis, and AIT with animal dander increased significantly from 2009 to 2022. Serial surveys of AIT practices are helpful in identifying the changes of real-world clinical practice of AIT.",

While ruminant TFAs may protect against allergies, the role of industrial TFAs remains unclear. This study evaluated the effects of industrial TFAs on FA in a murine model. 20 Balb/c mice were divided into 4 groups: control (standard diet), OVA (ovalbumin-sensitized, standard diet), TFAs (industrial TFA-enriched diet), and TFAs+OVA (TFA diet + OVA sensitization). After two weeks, OVA and TFAs+OVA groups underwent OVA sensitization/challenge. Symptoms (anal temperature drop, diarrhea), serum immunoglobulin E (tIgE, OVA-sIgE), cytokines, immune cell profiles, and gut microbiota were analyzed. The incidence rates of anal temperature drop and diarrhea, the serum levels of tIgE, OVA-sIgE, interleukin-4 were significantly higher in the OVA and TFAs+OVA groups compared to the control group. The TFAs+OVA group had a higher degree of anal temperature drop and diarrhea score, and higher serum levels of tIgE and OVA-sIgE compared to the OVA group. The expression of interferon-γ mRNA and the numbers of Th1 cells increased in the spleen of the TFAs and TFAs+OVA group compared to the control group, whereas the numbers of spleen Th2 cells were significantly elevated in the TFAs, OVA, and TFAs+OVA groups compared to the control group. In addition, the numbers of mast cells (MCs) in the esophagus and intestinal mucosa, and the serum concentrations of MCs protease-1 were significantly increased in TFAs, OVA, and TFAs+OVA groups compared to the control group. Cecal microflora among these groups exhibited distinct patterns of differential diversity and composition. Industrial TFAs may promote OVA-induced FA, Th1 and Th2-associated inflammation in mouse model, accompanied by the activation of MCs and intestinal microbiome dysbiosis.",

    "abstract": "In the 'Itch-Scratch cycle', scratching manifests in various ways and further provokes skin inflammation and alteration of the skin microbiota. However, there is an unmet demand for classifying and interpreting scratching behavior. We analyze patterns of scratching behavior expressed by patients with chronic pruritus. A survey was conducted on 206 adult patients with chronic pruritus for more than six weeks. Participants responded to a questionnaire about pruritus, including standard unidimensional-scale questions, as well as individualistic questions about sensory expression and quality of life. For scratching behavior, all patients answered questions about patterns, tools, situations, time spent, and scratched areas. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted to classify scratching behavior. Descriptive and exploratory factor analyses were used to identify the structure of the underlying factors measured by the questionnaire items. Among pruritic descriptors, 'unbearable' was the most common (84.5%). Of 206 participants, 190 (92.2%) responded that they scratched. The most common itch resolution methods were 'applying moisturizer', 'rubbing', and 'applying ointment'. The fingernails (89.3%) were the most frequently reported tool used for scratching. Participants reported most frequent scratching during sleep or rest. Among the pruritus-specific quality-of-life indicators, 'Lifelong' was the most stressful item related to all scratching behaviors. Regarding scratching differences by disease, patients with prurigo showed shorter scratching time with abnormal and aggressive behavior. We analyzed scratching behavior patterns in patients with chronic pruritus. Our findings support the need for education on the importance of applying moisturizer before sleep. The results are also important for helping patients with prurigo correct their abnormal and aggressive scratching behavior patterns, which can reduce quality of life and worsen symptoms.",

However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. Therefore, we evaluated whether the local nasal mucosa is regulated by neuroimmune signals during nasal allergic reactions. We identified genes that were differentially expressed between patients with AR and healthy controls using GSE46171 gene chip data. Expression levels of neuromedin U (NMU), NMU receptor 1 (NMUR1), and group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) in the nasal mucosa were determined the impacts of NMU on patients with AR were assessed. An AR animal model was established to observe the effects of local NMU intervention on local and systemic ILC2s in the nasal cavity. We identified 1,137 differentially expressed genes and focused on the neuropeptide NMU. NMU was widely distributed in the lamina propria of the nasal mucosa of patients with AR. NMUR1 was expressed at high levels in the lamina propria, basal layer, and glandular epithelium. Local ILC2 expression in the nasal mucosa of the AR group was elevated and positively correlated with NMU and NMUR1 expression. Using the AR model, we found that NMU significantly enhanced both local and systemic inflammatory responses in ovalbumin-sensitized mice and promoted activation of ILC2s to release additional type 2 inflammatory cytokines. However, this effect was blocked by an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway inhibitor, indicating that NMU activates ILC2s via the ERK pathway, contributing to AR pathogenesis. During nasal allergic reactions, local NMU increases significantly in the nasal cavity, activating ILC2s via the ERK pathway to release type 2 cytokines, thereby participating in or exacerbating the onset of AR. These findings lay the groundwork for exploration of diverse factors that contribute to AR and suggest new approaches to prevention and treatment.",

Study subjects were classified based on fungal sensitization and asthma severity. Clinical characteristics of patients with severe asthma were compared according to fungal sensitization status. The rate of skin test positivity to fungi was 14.1% and 7.1% in severe asthma (n = 270) and non-severe asthma (n = 2,605). Patients with SAFS were diagnosed with asthma earlier than those with severe asthma without fungal sensitization (SANFS) (P = 0.019), and had a lower body mass index compared to the SANFS group (P = 0.044). Factional exhaled nitric oxide levels and sputum eosinophilia/neutrophilia showed significant differences between the SAFS and SANFS groups (all P < 0.05). Patients with SAFS were more frequently treated with biologics (36.8% vs. 24.6%, P = 0.116) than those with SANFS. Multivariate analysis revealed that early diagnosed asthma was significantly associated with SAFS. The prevalence of fungal sensitization in severe asthma is approximately twice as high as in non-severe asthma. Early diagnosed asthma may be a risk factor for SAFS, and patients with SAFS face a greater burden of additional treatment compared to those with SANFS. SAFS has a distinct airway inflammation profile that differentiates it from SANFS.",

    "abstract": "Rhinoviruses (RVs) are the most frequent viral causes of respiratory infections worldwide and contribute substantially to a spectrum of respiratory diseases, including wheezing, asthma, and lower respiratory tract illnesses throughout the lifespan. Despite their substantial disease burden, vaccine development for RVs has been hindered for decades due to extensive serotypic diversity and limited cross-reactive immune responses. However, recent progress in structural virology, immune profiling, and antigen discovery─particularly through peptide array mapping and the identification of conserved neutralizing epitopes─has revived interest in the design of RV vaccines. Novel strategies targeting conserved B cell capsid domains, conserved T cell epitopes, and high-valent vaccine formulations have shown promise in preclinical models. This review summarizes the current understanding of RV infection epidemiology, risk stratification for early vaccine prioritization, and evolving vaccine development strategies, while highlighting critical gaps and the growing scientific momentum toward clinical translation. With continued innovation, RV vaccination may become a viable strategy to mitigate the longstanding and pervasive global health burden of RV infection.",

    "abstract": "Clinical remission (CR), an emerging treatment goal in asthma, was assessed by a post hoc analysis of a phase 3 study of mepolizumab in severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype (SA-EP). Asthmatic patients aged ≥ 12 years, with a blood eosinophil count of ≥ 150 cells/µL at screening (or ≥ 300 cells/µL in the previous year), receiving fluticasone propionate ≥ 500 µg/day or equivalent plus ≥ 1 controller medication, and experiencing ≥ 2 exacerbations in the previous year were randomised to receive add-on mepolizumab or placebo every 4 weeks for 52 weeks. CR was assessed using both 3- and 4-component definitions (at 1 year, no maintenance oral corticosteroids, no clinically significant exacerbations, and asthma control questionnaire-5 [ACQ-5] score ≤ 1.5 for both, plus change from baseline in pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second ≥ 0 mL for 4-component definition). At week 52, 41.6% (62/149) of mepolizumab-treated patients and 21.2% (32/151) of placebo-treated patients met the 4-component definition (odds ratio [OR], 2.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.59-4.41; P < 0.001), with a difference of 20.4% (95% CI, 9.1%-31.2%), and 54.4% (81/149) of mepolizumab-treated patients and 32.5% (49/151) of placebo-treated patients met the 3-component definition (OR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.55-3.96; P < 0.001), with a difference of 21.9% (95% CI, 10.5%-32.7%). Baseline characteristics potentially associated with CR in the mepolizumab group were lower ACQ-5 score and lower St George's Respiratory Questionnaire scores. A higher proportion of Chinese SA-EP patients treated with mepolizumab achieved CR compared to those receiving placebo. Certain baseline characteristics are potentially predictive of CR.

    "abstract": "Recent attention has been directed toward understanding how exposure to green areas in residential urban environments can impact asthma morbidity. Limited and inconsistent results have explored the link between exposure to greenness and asthma, highlighting the need for further research in this area. We analyzed airborne fungal microbiomes from urban forests and urban centers to better understand how airborne microorganisms affect asthma and allergic inflammatory responses. Fungi were isolated from air samples collected from 25 urban forests and 4 urban centers in Seoul Metropolitan City, and the diversity of fungal microbiomes was analyzed. The number of asthma episodes in each district in Seoul Metropolitan City was examined using data from the National Health Insurance. Allergic inflammatory responses of fungi from the urban forests and urban centers were measured using human mast cells (HMC-1) and an experimental asthma animal model. Fungal microbiome diversity in urban forests was significantly higher than in urban centers. A significant inverse correlation was observed between the number of urban forests per each district and asthma episodes among residents. Allergic inflammation in the activated HMC-1 cells and lungs of the asthma animal model was significantly suppressed by the fungal strains isolated from the urban forest samples compared to those from the urban centers. Fungal microbiome diversity, particularly from the urban forests, plays a role in reducing asthma morbidity and can modulate allergic inflammation. Residential proximity to urban forests was positively associated with current asthma, potentially indicating a role in reducing allergic inflammation through the diversity of the fungal microbial flora. These findings support the increasing public recognition of urban forest as an essential component of health-supportive environments.",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a prevalent chronic inflammatory disease that significantly burdens individuals and healthcare systems worldwide. The incidence of AD has risen sharply in both developed and emerging economies, necessitating an understanding of its complex etiological factors, including environmental influences and lifestyle changes. Generally, 2 primary preventive strategies for AD have been implemented so far: (1) the \"Inside Out\" approach that which involves allergen elimination, probiotic supplementation, fish oil supplementation, and vitamin D supplementation aim to regulate the immune system in pregnancy and early childhood and (2) the \"Outside In\" approach that focuses on improving skin barrier function through emollient use and environmental changes. Although current evidence suggests the potential benefits from these interventions, randomized controlled trials have revealed inconsistencies in their efficacy. It is imperative not only to explore the minute research gaps in existing studies, but also to develop novel interventional studies that consider individual and regional differences based on the epithelial barrier hypothesis, the biodiversity hypothesis, and the 'old friends' hypothesis evolved from the hygiene hypothesis. Ultimately, reversing the rising trend of AD prevalence will most likely require a multifaceted approach that integrates new scientific evidence and promote comprehensive lifestyle changes.",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic condition characterized not only by skin lesions but also by significant patient burden, impacting mental health and quality of life. The Atopic Dermatitis Control Tool (ADCT) is recommended as an assessment tool for evaluating the long-term management of AD. However, there is a scarcity of studies comparing the utility of ADCT in real-world clinical practice to that of the other existing AD evaluation tools. This study aimed to investigate long-term changes in the ADCT and examine its correlations with the other evaluation tools in AD patients undergoing dupilumab treatment. A retrospective study was conducted on 89 outpatients with AD who received treatment with dupilumab between April 2020 and March 2023. Patients underwent assessments using the ADCT and other evaluation tools before treatment initiation and at 1, 2, and 3 years following treatment commencement. Of the 89 patients, with a mean age of 28.7 years (range: 12 to 65 years), 68 (76.4%) were male. All 89 patients were followed for 1 year, 44 for 2 years, and 17 for 3 years. The mean total ADCT score decreased at year 1 (58.2% reduction, P < 0.001), with this reduction continuing at years 2 and 3 (73.8% and 75.3% reduction, respectively, P < 0.001). Furthermore, the distribution of patients achieving an Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) 90 and those with an ADCT < 7 during the dupilumab treatment period appeared almost identical. Moreover, this study established significant correlations between the ADCT score and the following parameters: EASI, body surface area, Dermatology Life Quality Index, Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale, and Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure. Our findings indicate that the ADCT can serve as a reliable tool for assessing long-term control of AD in real-world settings.",

To develop a product that is effective for suppressing asthma with minimal adverse reactions, we investigated whether the heat-killed body or culture supernatants of mycobacteria could also prevent asthma development.Female BALB/c mice were treated with live BCG, the heat-killed body, or culture supernatants of BCG or Mycobacterium tuberculosis intraperitoneally, while sensitizing and provoking with ovalbumin. Then they underwent a methacholine bronchoprovocation test, and the peribronchial inflammatory cell numbers and cytokine levels in splenocyte culture supernatants were assessed.The airway sensitivity to methacholine decreased significantly after treatment with not only live BCG (30.8 versus 10.0 mg/mL, P<0.001) but also with the culture supernatant (BCG, 23.0 mg/mL, P<0.05; M. tuberculosis, 20.5 mg/mL, P<0.05). In contrast, heat-killed mycobacteria did not effectively decrease airway sensitivity. The peribronchial eosinophil counts and the goblet cell proportions in total epithelial cells decreased significantly in most of the groups. The interferon-gamma/interleukin-5 ratios increased significantly in most of the treatment groups except for the heat-killed groups, and were significantly related to airway sensitivity (r=0.312, P<0.01) and peribronchial eosinophil counts (r=-0.416, P<0.001). Interleukin-17A level was inversely related to airway sensitivity (r=-0.212, P<0.05) and was significantly lower in the live BCG group than in the control (137+/-20 versus 308+/-57 pg/mL, P<0.05).BCG and mycobacteria culture supernatants may effectively prevent the development of asthma associated with altered Th1/Th2 cytokines and interleukin-17A levels.",

Currently available tests, such as skin testing or in vitro determination of beef-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE), do not provide an accurate diagnosis of beef allergy. The recent development of the basophil activation test (BAT) presents a new opportunity for the diagnosis of food allergies. Here, we report a 37-year-old woman with a history of recurrent generalised urticaria, nausea, vomiting and hypotension after ingestion of beef, suggesting a beef allergy. Although the skin prick test and serum specific IgE to beef, pork and milk allergens showed negative results using commercial kits, the BAT showed significant upregulation of CD203c in a dose-dependent manner compared to both non-atopic and atopic controls. To our knowledge, this is the first case study of beef allergy consisting of a non-IgE-mediated reaction. The detection of food allergies using direct basophil activation is suggested to complement conventional diagnostic tests.",

    "abstract": "Various therapeutic approaches have been suggested for preventing or reducing the adverse effects of topical glucocorticoids, including skin barrier impairment. Previously, we have shown that impairment of skin barrier function by the highest potency topical glucocorticoid, clobetasol 17-propinate (CP), can be partially prevented by co-application of a physiological lipid mixture containing pseudoceramide, free fatty acids, and cholesterol (multi-lamellar emulsion [MLE]). Skin atrophic effects of CP were also partially reduced by MLE. In this study, the preventive effects of MLE on the lowest potency topical glucocorticoid, hydrocortisone (HC), were investigated using animal models.Anti-inflammatory activity of topical HC was evaluated using a 12-O-tetradecanoylphobol-13-acetate-induced skin edema model. Topical steroid induced adverse effects were evaluated using hairless mouse.The results showed that the anti-inflammatory activity was not altered by co-application of either MLE or hydrobase. However, co-application of MLE and 1.0% HC showed less impairment in the epidermal permeability barrier function, skin hydration, and skin surface pH compared with hydrobase. Stratum corneum integrity, evaluated by measuring trans-epidermal water loss after repeated tape stripping, showed less damage with MLE co-application. Long-term application of topical HC induced skin atrophy, measured by a reduction in skinfold and epidermal thickness and in the number of epidermal proliferating cell nucleus antigen (PCNA)-positive keratinocytes. Co-application of MLE did not affect the skinfold or epidermal thickness, but the number of PCNA-positive keratinocytes was less decreased with MLE use.These results suggest that co-application of MLE is effective in reducing the local adverse effects of low-potency topical glucocorticoids and supports the therapeutic efficacy of physiological lipid mixtures on skin barrier function.",

Children aged 6 to 18 years with EIB were randomized in a 4-week, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial with montelukast or FP. Before and after treatment, treadmill exercise challenges were performed.

Both study groups displayed a similar postexercise maximum decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) before treatment as well as after treatment.

The Δ logarithmic sputum baseline and postexercise LTE(4)/FE(NO) ratio were significantly lower in the montelukast group than in the FP group (baseline; -0.09±0.21 vs. -0.024±0.03, P=0.045; postexercise, -0.61±0.33 vs. -0.11±0.28, P=0.023). These data indicate that the efficacy of montelukast for preventing a maximum decrease in FEV1 after exercise is significantly higher than that of FP, and the high LTE(4)/FE(NO) ratio is associated with a greater response to montelukast than to FP for EIB therapy. These results suggest that LTE(4) may play an important role in EIB.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a heterogeneous disease that responds to medications to varying degrees. Cluster analyses have identified several phenotypes and variables related to fixed airway obstruction; however, few longitudinal studies of lung function have been performed on adult asthmatics. We investigated clinical, demographic, and inflammatory factors related to persistent airflow limitation based on lung function trajectories over 1 year.Serial post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume (FEV) 1% values were obtained from 1,679 asthmatics who were followed up every 3 months for 1 year. First, a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using Ward's method to generate a dendrogram for the optimum number of clusters using the complete post-FEV1 sets from 448 subjects. Then, a trajectory cluster analysis of serial post-FEV1 sets was performed using the k-means clustering for the longitudinal data trajectory method. Next, trajectory clustering for the serial post-FEV1 sets of a total of 1,679 asthmatics was performed after imputation of missing post-FEV1 values using regression methods.Trajectories 1 and 2 were associated with normal lung function during the study period, and trajectory 3 was associated with a reversal to normal of the moderately decreased baseline FEV1 within 3 months. Trajectories 4 and 5 were associated with severe asthma with a marked reduction in baseline FEV1. However, the FEV1 associated with trajectory 4 was increased at 3 months, whereas the FEV1 associated with trajectory 5 was persistently disturbed over 1 year. Compared with trajectory 4, trajectory 5 was associated with older asthmatics with less atopy, a lower immunoglobulin E (IgE) level, sputum neutrophilia and higher dosages of oral steroids. In contrast, trajectory 4 was associated with higher sputum and blood eosinophil counts and more frequent exacerbations.Trajectory clustering analysis of FEV1 identified 5 distinct types, representing well-preserved to severely decreased FEV1. Persistent airflow obstruction may be related to non-atopy, a low IgE level, and older age accompanied by neutrophilic inflammation and low baseline FEV1 levels.",

Based on the findings of previous animal studies on toxic hepatitis, we selected the thioredoxin reductase 1 gene (TXNRD1) as a candidate marker of DILI for this genetic association study. Records from 118 patients with DILI were extracted from the database of the Adverse Drug Reaction Research Group in South Korea. Causative drugs included antituberculosis drugs (n=68, 57.6%), antibiotics (n=22, 18.6%), antiepileptic drugs (n=7, 5.9%), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (n=5, 4.2%), and others (n=16, 13.7%). Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TXNRD1 (rs10735393, rs4964287, rs4595619, rs10861201, rs11111997, rs4246270, and rs4246271) were scored in 118 DILI patients and in 120 drug-matched controls without liver injury. No differences were found between the frequencies of any of the 7 SNPs in the cases and controls; however, a significant association was found between a TTA haplotype composed of rs10735393, rs4964287, and rs4595619 and DILI using an allele model (odds ratio, 1.79; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-2.73; P=0.008; Bonferroni corrected P=0.024).

    "abstract": "Prostaglandin (PG) E2 is an immunomodulatory lipid mediator generated mainly via the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathway from arachidonic acid at sites of infection and inflammation. A positive feedback loop of PGE2 on COX-2 expression is critical for homeostasis during toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated inflammatory processes. The mechanism of PGE2-regulated COX-2 expression remains poorly understood. The low-molecular-weight stress protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) contributes to the anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic response against environmental stress. We explored the involvement of HO-1 on PGE2 regulation of LPS-induced COX-2 expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages. LPS-induced COX-2 expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages was enhanced by exogenous PGE2 or cyclic AMP (cAMP) analogue and was suppressed by a COX inhibitor (indomethacin), a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor (KT5720), and A kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) disruptors (Ht31 and RIAD). This result suggests that the stimulatory effects of endogenous and exogenous PGE2 on COX-2 expression are mediated by a cAMP-PKA-AKAP-dependent pathway. The induction of HO-1 was observed in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. This induction was suppressed by exogenous PGE2 and enhanced by blockage of the endogenous PGE2 effect by the PKA inhibitor or AKAP disruptors. In addition, HO-1 induction by the HO activator copper protoporphyrin suppressed LPS-induced COX-2 expression, which was restored by the addition of exogenous PGE2. The induction of HO-1 inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB p-65 nuclear expression and translocation. AKAP plays an important role in PGE2 regulation of COX-2 expression, and the suppression of HO-1 by PGE2-cAMP-PKA-AKAP signaling helps potentiate the LPS-induced COX-2 expression through a positive feedback loop in RAW 264.7 macrophages.",

However, its role in the pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis is unclear.The aim of this study was to evaluate the antiallergic effect of intranasally applied vitamin D in an allergic rhinitis mouse model. BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA) and alum before they were intranasally challenged with OVA. Then, they were intranasally administered 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (0.02 μg) or solvent. Allergic symptom scores, eosinophil infiltration, cytokine mRNA levels (interleukin [IL]-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13 and interferon-γ) in the nasal tissue, and serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE) and OVA-specific IgE, IgG1, and IgG2a were analyzed and compared with negative and positive control groups. Cervical lymph nodes (LNs) were harvested for flow cytometry analysis and cell proliferation assay.In the treatment group, allergic symptom scores, eosinophil infiltration, and mRNA levels of IL-4 and IL-13 were significantly lower in the nasal tissue than in the positive control group. The IL-5 mRNA level, serum total IgE, and OVA-specific IgE and IgG1 levels decreased in the treatment group; however, the difference was not significant. In the cervical LNs, CD86 expression had been down-regulated in CD11c⁺major histocompatibility complex II-high (MHCIIhigh) in the treatment group. Additionally, IL-4 secretion in the lymphocyte culture from cervical LNs significantly decreased.The results confirm the antiallergic effect of intranasal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. It decreases CD 86 expression among CD11c⁺MHCIIhigh cells and T-helper type 2-mediated inflammation in the cervical LNs. Therefore, topically applied 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 can be a future therapeutic agent for allergic rhinitis.",

A deep neural network (DNN)-based estimation model was developed to determine the concentration of oak pollen and overcome the shortcomings of conventional regression models.The DNN model proposed in this study utilized weather factors as the input and provided pollen concentrations as the output. Weather and pollen concentration data were used from 2007 to 2016 obtained from the Korea Meteorological Administration pollen observation network. Because it is difficult to prevent over-fitting and underestimation by using a DNN model alone, we developed a bootstrap aggregating-type ensemble model. Each of the 30 ensemble members was trained with random sampling at a fixed rate according to the pollen risk grade. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, we compared its performance with those of models of regression and support vector regression (SVR) under the same conditions, with respect to the prediction of pollen concentrations, risk levels, and season length.The mean absolute percentage error in the estimated pollen concentrations was 11.18%, 10.37%, and 5.04% for the regression, SVR and DNN models, respectively. The start of the pollen season was estimated to be 20, 22, and 6 days earlier than that predicted by the regression, SVR and DNN models, respectively. Similarly, the end of the pollen season was estimated to be 33, 20, and 9 days later that predicted by the regression, SVR and DNN models, respectively.Overall, the DNN model performed better than the other models. However, the prediction of peak pollen concentrations needs improvement. Improved observation quality with optimization of the DNN model will resolve this issue.",

    "abstract": "Influenza vaccine-associated anaphylaxis is a very rare allergic reaction to vaccines, but the most concerning and life-threatening adverse reaction. Although the safety of influenza vaccines has been well documented, occasional cases of anaphylaxis in vaccinated patients have been reported. In this study, we analyzed the immunoglobulin E (IgE) response to whole influenza vaccines in a pediatric case of delayed-onset anaphylaxis after influenza vaccination. The patient showed elevated specific IgE levels against whole influenza vaccines, especially with split virion from egg-based manufacturing process. Specific IgE levels to influenza vaccines showed decreased over. We evaluated a causal relationship between influenza vaccine and anaphylaxis event by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Delayed-onset anaphylaxis after influenza vaccination can occur in children without predisposing allergic diseases. In addition, the results suggested that formulation and production system of influenza vaccines could affect the probability of severe allergic reaction to vaccines.",

However, changes in maximal drug concentration and exposure time in blood through desensitization may alter other adverse reactions and efficacy of the drug. We investigated rapid desensitization for carboplatin in terms of severe adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and efficacy compared with the standard infusion.A retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who received carboplatin chemotherapy from 2017 to 2019. We compared serious adverse events (SAEs), ADRs according to organ classes, time to progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS).Of 108 desensitization procedures performed in 21 patients, 104 were successfully accomplished (96.3%). There were compared with 271 procedures in 41 patients who received the standard infusion method. There were 8 (7.7%) SAEs in the rapid desensitization group and 34 (12.5%) in the control group. One drug-related death occurred in the rapid desensitization group. In the rapid desensitized group, except for neutropenia, there was no statistically significant increase in SAEs and over grade 3 of ADRs according to organ classes compared with the control group. In the efficacy analysis, TTP and OS were similar in the 2 groups.Rapid desensitization of carboplatin can lower the risk of immediate hypersensitivity reactions without changing the inherent effect and severe ADRs.",

Occupational and non-occupational papain allergies have previously been documented; however, there are limited publications about papain allergy with its relative fruit allergy. Here, we present a case of occupational, IgE-mediated papain allergy with kiwi fruit and fig fruit allergy. A 53-year-old man suffered from rhinitis for several years, with the onset of his symptoms coinciding with the time he started to work at a sausage processing plant where papain is often used as a meat tenderizer. He began to experience symptoms of chest tightness, shortness of breath and wheezing shortly after starting work 5 years ago. Furthermore, he experienced several episodes of oral itching, and tongue and oropharyngeal angioedema after injestion of kiwi fruit and fig fruit. The patient had a lifelong history of allergic conjunctivitis, allergic rhinitis, and childhood asthma. Specific IgE was positive to kiwi fruit, papain and chymopapain (2.95 kUA/L, >100 kUA/L, and 95.0 kUA/L, respectively). Similar bands at 10-15 kDa in blotting with papain and kiwi fruit extracts were found. This patient showed a potential association between papain allergy and sensitization to kiwi fruit. We also reviewed 13 patients with papain allergy published in the literature, with 85% (11/13) of the patients sensitized through the respiratory tract, and 40% (4/11) having atopy. Further studies should focus on the determination of cross-reactive allergens between papain and its fruit relatives, and the prevalence of food allergy in patients with papain allergy should be investigated in a relatively large cohort.",

After accounting for children's genotypes, we observed interactive effects on children's IgE for maternal IL-13 130 genotypes (P=0.014) and maternal IL-4Ra 50 genotypes (P=0.0003) with \"Western or Eastern\" lifestyles/environments. With the adjustment for multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05, the interactive effect of the maternal IL-4Ra50 SNP was significant. Maternal genetic variants in IL-4/IL-13 pathway genes, such as IL-13 130 and IL-4Ra50, influenced IgE levels in school children that were independent of the children's genetic effects.

Electrolysis was carried out for 1% OMC containing 1% sodium chloride for 30 minutes with a voltage difference of 90 V, 0.23 A (30 mA/cm²). Protein assays, amino acid measurement, and mass spectrometry in untreated OMC and OMC on both the anode and cathode sides after electrolysis were performed. Moreover, 21 patients with IgE-mediated hen's egg allergy were evaluated by using the skin prick test (SPT) for untreated OMC and OMC after electrolysis. The allergic action of OMC was reduced after electrolysis on both the anode and cathode sides when evaluated by the SPT. The modifications of OMC on electrolysis caused the loss of 2 distinct peptide fragments (57E-63K and 123H-128R) as seen on matrix-associated laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The total free SH groups in OMC were increased on the cathode side. Although the regions of S-S broken bonds were not determined in this study, the change in S-S bonds in OMC on both the anode and cathode sides may reduce the allergenic activity.",

Previous studies have suggested that activation of the MC EP2 receptor prevents pathological changes in the murine models of allergic asthma. This work aimed to analytically validate the EP2 receptor on MCs as a therapeutic target.Murine MC lines and primary cultures, and MCs bearing the human immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor were subjected to IgE-mediated activation subsequent to incubation with selective EP2 agonists. Two molecularly unrelated agonists, butaprost and CP-533536, were tested either in vitro or in 2 in vivo models of allergy.The diverse range of MC populations was consistently inhibited through selective EP2 agonism in spite of exhibiting a heterogeneous phenotype. Such inhibition occurred in both mouse and human IgE (hIgE)-mediated activation. The use of molecularly unrelated selective EP2 agonists allowed for the confirmation of the specificity of this protective mechanism. This effect was further demonstrated in 2 in vivo murine models of allergy where MCs are a key to pathological changes: cutaneous anaphylaxis in a transgenic mouse model expressing the hIgE receptor and aeroallergen-induced murine model of asthma.Selective EP2 agonism is a powerful pharmacological strategy to prevent MCs from being activated through IgE-mediated mechanisms and from causing deleterious effects. The MC EP2 receptor may be an effective pharmacological target in allergic and other MC-mediated conditions.",

However, it is challenging to obtain-sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage samples from pediatric patients. Thus, we used voided urine to show that urine microbe-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in asthma are an available source for clinical research. Methods Five urine samples were obtained at 2-3-month intervals from each patient with asthma (n = 20), and a single voided urine sample were obtained from each healthy child (n = 20). After isolating EVs, 16S rDNA pyrosequencing was performed. The Chao1 index and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) were used to assess diversity. To predict microbiota functional capacities, Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States was used based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway database. Eight covariates were included in the EnvFit analysis to identify significant factors in the asthma group. Results The asthma group showed lower Chao1 bacterial richness, and PCoA-based clustering differed significantly. Two phyla, and 13 families and genera were enriched or depleted. Functional profiling revealed significant differences between the asthma and control groups. EnvFit analysis of correlation to age, sex, body mass index, infection, season, asthma phenotype, severity, and symptoms was not significant except for infections associated with visit 1 and the season of visit 2. Conclusions This study showed that microbe-derived EVs were constantly altered in the urine of children with asthma, consistent with the findings of previous studies indicating microbiome changes in the lung and gut. The urine may reflect the specific pattern of microbiome EVs in children with asthma.",

Cytokine levels in sinonasal tissues were detected with the Bio-Plex assay. The expression of coagulation and fibrinolytic markers was measured using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.Compared to control tissues and bilateral eosinophilic and noneosinophilic NPs, ACPs had higher levels of neutrophil infiltration and expression of myeloperoxidase (MPO), interleukin (IL)-8 and interferon (IFN)-γ. In total, 94.4% of ACPs demonstrated an eosinophil cationic protein/MPO ratio of < 1, compared to 79.0% of noneosinophilic and 26% of eosinophilic NPs. Principle component and multiple correspondence analyses revealed a neutrophilic and type 1 inflammation pattern in ACPs. Compared to control tissues, edema scores and fibrin deposition were increased, whereas d-dimer and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) levels were decreased in ACPs and bilateral NPs, with more prominent changes in ACPs even than in eosinophilic NPs. The tPA levels were negatively correlated with IFN-γ, IL-8, and MPO levels in ACPs. Neutrophils were the major cellular source of IFN-γ in ACPs, and the number of IFN-γ+ neutrophils was elevated in ACPs than in control tissues and bilateral eosinophilic and noneosinophilic NPs.ACPs are characterized by the neutrophilic and type 1 inflammation endotype. Neutrophil-derived IFN-γ is associated with reduced tPA production in ACPs.",

Potential immunoadjuvants were supplemented to enhance drug-induced mediator responses.Twenty-seven patients, including 9 acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), 10 drug reactions with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and 8 Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) were recruited. The average frequencies of drug-induced IL-22-, IFN-γ-, and GrB-releasing cells were 35.5±16.3, 33.0±7.1, and 164.8±43.1 cells/million PBMCs, respectively. The sensitivity of combined IFN-γ/IL-22/GrB ELISpot was higher than that of IFN-γ ELISpot alone for culprit drug detection in all SCAR subjects (77.8% vs 51.9%, P < 0.01). The measurement of drug-induced IL-22- and IFN-γ releasing cells confirmed the culprit drugs in 77.8% of AGEP. The measurement of drug-induced IFN-γ- and GrB-releasing cells confirmed the culprit drugs in 62.5% of SJS/TEN. Alpha-galactosylceramide supplementation significantly increased the frequencies of drug-induced IFN-γ releasing cells.The measurement of drug-induced IFN-γ-releasing cells is the key for identifying culprit drugs. The additional measurement of drug-induced IL-22-releasing cells enhances ELISpot sensitivity to identify drug-induced AGEP, while the measurement of drug-induced GrB-releasing cells could have a role in SJS/TEN. ELISpot sensitivity might be improved by supplementary alpha-galactosylceramide.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02574988.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Fusarium species are among prevalent airborne fungi and causative agents of human respiratory atopic disorders.We previously identified a 36.5-kDaF. proliferatum component recognized by IgE antibodies in 9 (53%) of the 17 F. proliferatum-sensitized atopic serum samples.The purpose of this study is to characterize the 36.5-kDaallergen of F. proliferatum.Methods: Characterization of allergens and determination of IgE cross-reactivity were performed by cDNA cloning/expression and immunoblot inhibition studies.Results: Based on the finding that the 36.5-kDaIgE-binding component reacted with the mouse monoclonal antibody FUM20 against fungal vacuolar serine protease allergens, the cDNA of F. proliferatum vacuolar serine protease (Fus p 9.0101) was subsequently cloned.Nine serum samples from respiratory atopic patients with IgE binding to the vacuolar serine protease allergen of Penicillium chrysogenum (Pen ch 18) also showed IgE-immunoblot reactivity to rFus p 9.0101.The purified rFus p 9.0101 can inhibit IgE and FUM20 binding to the 36.5-kDacomponent of F. proliferatum.Thus, a novel and important Fus p 9.0101 was identified.The rPen ch 18 can inhibit IgE binding to Fus p 9.0101.It indicates that IgE cross-reactivity between Fus p 9.0101 and Pen ch 18 also exists.Furthermore, neither rFus p 9.0101 K88A nor rPen ch 18 K89A mutants inhibited IgE binding to rFus p 9.0101.Lys88 was considered a critical core amino acid in IgE binding to r Fus p 9.0101 and a residue responsible for IgE cross-reactivity between Fus p 9.0101 and Pen ch 18 allergens.Conclusions: Results obtained from this study indicate that vacuolar serine protease may be a major allergen of F. proliferatum and an important IgE crossreactive pan-fungal allergen, and provide important bases for clinical diagnosis of fungal allergy.",

    "abstract": "Hereditary angioedema is a disease of congenital deficiency or functional defect in the C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) consequent to mutation in the SERPING1 gene, which encodes C1-INH. This disease manifests as recurrent, non-pitting, non-pruritic subcutaneous, or submucosal edema as well as an erythematous rash in some cases. These symptoms result from the uncontrolled localized production of bradykinin. The most commonly affected sites are the extremities, face, gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory system. When the respiratory system is affected by hereditary angioedema, swelling of the airway can restrict breathing and lead to life-threatening obstruction. Herein, we report a case of a 24-year-old woman with type 2 hereditary angioedema who presented with recurrent episodic abdominal pain and swelling of the extremities. She had no family history of angioedema. Although her C4 level was markedly decreased (3.40 mg/dL; normal range: 10-40 mg/dL), she presented with a very high C1-INH level (81.0 mg/dL; normal range: 21.0-39.0 mg/dL) and abnormally low C1-INH activity (less than 25%; normal range: 70%-130%). The SERPING1 gene mutation was confirmed in this patient. She was treated with prophylactic tranexamic acid, as needed, and subsequently reported fewer and less severe episodes. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of type 2 hereditary angioedema in Korea that was consequent to SERPING1 mutation and involved a significantly elevated level of C1-INH as well as a low level of C1-INH activity.",

    "abstract": "Studies have shown that Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Mp) infection can aggravate symptoms in asthmatics. However, the mechanism by which Mp infection exacerbates asthma remains unclear. Metabolomics can help identify the mechanism of Mp aggravating asthma in children, thereby providing more a potential target for improving clinical treatment programs. In this article, we analyzed the metabolic level of patients to explain how Mp aggravates asthma in children.We divided the subjects into the asthma, Mp infection, asthma combined with Mp infection and healthy groups. Patients' peripheral blood was collected for metabolic and interaction analysis. Cytokine levels were measured via serum and exhaled breath condensate (EBC).A total of 150 participating subjects were divided into four groups after exclusion. We found out that there were different metabolic pathways between the healthy and disease groups. The major pathways of both asthma and asthma combined with Mp infection were valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis; malate-aspartate shuttle was the main differential pathway for Mp infection. Moreover, even though three disease groups involved 81 metabolites at the same time, compared with asthma combined with Mp infection, 2 single disease groups still involved different amino acid pathways (phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis; valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis). Interaction analysis showed that Mp infection in asthmatic patients not only activated cytokines, but also activated Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2 and 6. Finally, the levels of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-8, IL-13 and tumor necrosis factor-α in EBC with asthma combined with Mp infection were significantly higher than the 2 single disease groups.Mp infection in asthmatic children can cause changes in the levels of various amino acids in the body, which were enriched in the pathways such as valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis. Palmitic acid can activate TLR2, and iloprost reduces IL-10 levels, ultimately leading to the increased airway inflammation.",

It is poorly understood why IFN-γ-secreting T lymphocytes persist for a long time when the respiratory viruses have been removed.Repeated pulmonary administration of IFN-γ and intraperitoneal injection with different inhibitors were used to study the effects of pulmonary IFN-γ in mice and guinea pigs.IFN-γ administration caused the increasing of IFN-γ-secreting T lymphocytes in both lung and blood, followed by the elevated physiological level of IFN-γ in the lung, the airway inflammation and the airway epithelial damage. IFN-γ administration also enhanced the cough sensitivity of guinea pigs. IFN-γ activated the STAT1 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways in lung tissues, released IFN-γ-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), and resulted in F-actin accumulation in lung-resident lymphocytes. The CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) inhibitor potently suppressed all the IFN-γ-induced inflammatory changes. The STAT1 inhibitor mitigated IFN-γ-secreting T lymphocytes infiltration by inhibiting T lymphocytes proliferation. F-actin accumulation and the ERK1/2 pathway contributed to pulmonary IFN-γ-induced augmentation of the airway inflammation and increasing of IFN-γ-secreting T lymphocytes in blood.High physiological levels of IFN-γ in the lung may cause pulmonary lymphocytic inflammation and cough hypersensitivity by increasing the number of IFN-γ-secreting T lymphocytes through the IP-10 and CXCR3 pathways.",

The clinical characteristics between BE with asthma and those without asthma were compared.Asthma was found in 22.4% of BE. BE with asthma had a higher body mass index (BMI) (P = 0.020), more dyspnea (P < 0.001), larger sputum volume (P = 0.015), and lower forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) (P < 0.001) than those without asthma. BE with asthma had a higher rate of previous pneumonia (P = 0.017) or measles (P = 0.037) than those without asthma. Regarding treatment, BE with asthma used inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting muscarinic antagonists, and leukotriene receptor antagonists more frequently than those without asthma. Although intergroup differences were not observed in disease severity of bronchiectasis (P = 0.230 for Bronchiectasis Severity Index and P = 0.089 for FACED), the Bronchiectasis Health Questionnaire (BHQ) scores indicating the quality of life, were significantly lower in BE with asthma than in those without asthma (61.6 vs. 64.8, P < 0.001). In a multivariable model adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, forced expiratory volume in 1 second %predicted, sputum volume, modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale ≥ 2, and the number of involved lobes, asthma was associated with lower BHQ scores (β-coefficient = -2.579, P = 0.014).BE with asthma have more respiratory symptoms, worse lung function, and poorer quality of life than those without asthma.

    "abstract": "Asthma is a frequent chronic inflammatory bronchial disease affecting more than 300 million patients worldwide, 70% of whom are secondary to allergy. The diversity of asthmatic endotypes contributes to their complexity. The inter-relationship between allergen and other exposure and the airway microbiome adds to the phenotypic diversity and defines the natural course of asthma. Here, we compared the mouse models of house dust mite (HDM)-induced allergic asthma. Allergic sensitization was performed via various routes and associated with outcomes. Mice were sensitized with HDM via the oral, nasal or percutaneous routes. Lung function, barrier integrity, immune response and microbiota composition were analyzed. Severe impairment of respiratory function was observed in the mice sensitized by the nasal and cutaneous paths. It was associated with epithelial dysfunction characterized by an increased permeability secondary to junction protein disruption. Such sensitization paths induced a mixed eosinophilic and neutrophilic inflammatory response with high interleukin (IL)-17 airway secretion. In contrast, orally sensitized mice showed a mild impairment of respiratory function. Epithelial dysfunction was mild with increased mucus production, but preserved epithelial junctions. Regarding lung microbiota, sensitization provoked a significant loss of diversity. At the genus level, Cutibacterium, Acinetobacter, Streptococcus and Lactobacillus were found to be modulated according to the sensitization pathway. An increase in theanti-inflammatory microbiota metabolites was observed in the oral-sensitization group. Our study highlights the strong impact of the sensitization route on the pathophysiology and the critical phenotypic diversity of allergic asthma in a mouse model.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a complex, heterogeneous chronic inflammatory airway disease with multiple phenotypes. There has been a great progress in managing asthma, but there are still unmet needs for developing uncontrolled asthma treatments. The present study aimed to determine the effectiveness of oleanolic acid acetate (OAA) from Vigna angularis against allergic airway inflammation and the underlying mechanism of action with a focus on mast cells.To investigate the effect of OAA in allergic airway inflammation, we used the ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized and challenged mice. To examine allergic airway inflammation associated with immune responses of mast cell activation in vitro, various types of mast cells were used. Systemic and cutaneous anaphylaxis models were used for mast cell-mediated hyper-responsiveness in vivo.OAA reduced OVA-induced airway inflammatory responses such as bronchospasm, increase of immune cell infiltration and serum immunoglobulin E and G1 levels. Especially, OAA decreased the mast cell infiltration, and β-hexosaminidase release as a mast cell activation marker in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. OAA inhibited mast cell degranulation in mast cell line (RBL-2H3) and primary cells (rat peritoneal mast cell and mouse bone marrow-derived mast cell). Mechanistically, OAA suppressed intracellular signaling pathways including the phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ and nuclear factor-κB, resulting from the suppression of intracellular calcium influx and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Further, oral administration of OAA attenuated mast cell-mediated systemic and cutaneous anaphylaxis.Our study showed that OAA can inhibit mast cell-mediated allergic reaction. Consequently, the application of OAA to mast cells for the allergic airway inflammation facilitate a new direction of treating allergic asthma.",

    "abstract": "A subset of asthmatics suffers from persistent airflow limitation, known as remodeled asthma, despite optimal treatment. Typical quantitative scoring methods to evaluate structural changes of airway remodeling on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) are time-consuming and laborious. Thus, easier and simpler methods are required in clinical practice. We evaluated the clinical usefulness of a simple, semi-quantitative method based on 8 HRCT parameters by comparing asthmatics with a persistent decline of post-bronchodilator (BD)-FEV1 to those with a BD-FEV1 that normalized over time and evaluated the relationships of the parameters with BD-FEV1.Asthmatics (n = 59) were grouped into 5 trajectories (Trs) according to the changes of BD-FEV1 over 1 year. After 9-12 months of guideline-based treatment, HRCT parameters including emphysema, bronchiectasis, anthracofibrosis, bronchial wall thickening (BWT), fibrotic bands, mosaic attenuation on inspiration, air-trapping on expiration, and centrilobular nodules were classified as present (1) or absent (0) in 6 zones.The Tr5 group (n = 11) was older and exhibited a persistent decline in BD-FEV1. The Tr5 and Tr4 groups (n = 12), who had a lower baseline BD-FEV1 that normalized over time, had longer durations of asthma, frequent exacerbations, and higher doses of steroid use compared to the Tr1-3 groups (n = 36), who had a normal baseline BD-FEV1. The Tr5 group had higher emphysema and BWT scores than the Tr4 (P = 8.25E-04 and P = 0.044, respectively). Scores for the other 6 parameters were not significantly different among the Tr groups. BD-FEV1 was inversely correlated with the emphysema and BWT scores in multivariate analysis (P = 1.70E-04, P = 0.006, respectively).Emphysema and BWT are associated with airway remodeling in asthmatics. Our simple, semi-quantitative scoring system based on HRCT may be an easy-to-use method for estimating airflow limitation.",

    "abstract": "The allergy epidemic has been attributed to environmental influences related to urbanization and the modern lifestyle. In this regard, various theories exploring the role of microbes (hygiene, old friends, microbiota, and biodiversity hypotheses), and the epithelial barrier (epithelial, dual allergen exposure and vitamin D hypotheses) have been proposed. These hypotheses have guided clinical studies that led to the formulation of intervention strategies during the proposed window of opportunity dubbed as the \"first thousand days.\" The most significant intervention is a paradigm shift from allergen avoidance to early introduction of allergenic foods, particularly egg and peanut, around 6 months of age for the prevention of food allergy. This recommendation has been adopted globally and included in allergy prevention guidelines. Other strategies with less robust clinical evidence include: encouraging a healthy balanced diet, rich in fish, during pregnancy; continuing allergenic food intake during pregnancy and lactation; vitamin D supplementation in pregnant women with asthma; discouraging social indications for caesarean section delivery; judicious use of antibiotics in early childhood; daily emollient use from birth in high risk babies; and avoiding cow's milk formula use in the first week of life. However, if early supplementation with cow's milk formula is required, continuing at least 10 mL of formula daily until age 2 months may be considered. Translating these strategies to public health and clinical practice is still a work in progress. Long-term population studies are crucial to assess the feasibility of these measures on allergy prevention.",

    "abstract": "Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a T helper type 2 (Th2)-mediated inflammatory disease. The E3 ligase tripartite motif-containing 24 (TRIM24) regulates the recruitment of acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein (CBP) to signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6). CBP mediates the acetylation of STAT6 and decreases its activity. To date, the precise role of TRIM24 in AR has not been fully interpreted. Herein, our study aimed to explore the functions of TRIM24 in AR.The expression of TRIM24 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and CD4+ T cells from patients with AR was measured. TRIM24-conditional knockout mice with TRIM24 deficiency in CD4+ T cells were generated. Wide-type (WT) AR mice and TRIM24-conditional knockout AR mice were established. Then, AR symptoms and interleukin (IL)-4 levels were compared. Further, the proliferation, activation and polarization of CD4+ T cells from WT mice and TRIM24 knockout mice after stimulation were determined. The effects of TRIM24 deficiency on STAT6 activities were also evaluated.Downregulated TRIM24 expression was detected in PBMCs and CD4+ T cells from patients with AR. TRIM24 conditional knockout mice had more sever AR symptoms with elevated IL-4 production. TRIM24-knockout CD4+ T cells had similar proliferation and activation when compared to WT CD4+ T cells, while they had enhanced Th2 polarization. TRIM24-knockout CD4+ T cells had decreased acetylation of STAT6 and enhanced STAT6 activities after IL-4 stimulation. The regulation of STAT6 activities by TRIM24 depended on TRIM24 N terminal RIGN domain and Lys383 acetylation site of STAT6.TRIM24 suppresses Th2-mediated AR by regulating the acetylation of STAT6.",

    "abstract": "Shellfish and fish are common causes of food allergy (FA) in Asia, with significant prevalence rates reported across various countries. This study aimed to identify the diagnostic decision points (DDPs) for shrimp, crab, and cod allergies in Korean children. We enrolled participants aged 18 years or younger with suspected shrimp, crab, or cod allergies through a retrospective review of medical records from a nationwide 14-center study between January 2018 and March 2022. FA was diagnosed using an open oral food challenge or a reproducible and convincing history with positive serum specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE) levels. The sIgE cut-off values for shrimp, crab, and cod were determined by analyzing receiver operating characteristic curves. Out of 266 children, 90 (33.8%) were confirmed to have a shrimp allergy. Crab allergies were found in 37 (39.8%) of 93 children. Of 66 children, 15 (22.7%) were found to be allergic to cod. The optimal sIgE cut-off values based on the largest area under the curve were 1.43, 3.25, and 2.05 kU/L for shrimp, crab, and cod, respectively. Levels of sIgE with more than 90% positive predictive value (PPV) were 33.8, 47.5, and 29.9 kU/L for shrimp, crab, and cod, respectively. Levels of sIgE with greater than 90% negative predictive value (NPV) were 0.36, 0.04, and 3.93 kU/L for shrimp, crab, and cod, respectively. Our results suggest that DDPs of sIgE levels with high PPV and NPV can be used to diagnose shrimp, crab, and cod allergies in Korean children.",

    "abstract": "Shrimp is a predominant allergic food in adults and adolescents. This study aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy of immunologic diagnosis in differentiating the clinical phenotypes of shrimp allergy. We enrolled 85 adults diagnosed with shrimp allergy based on clinical symptoms that occurred at least twice after shrimp ingestion and who had specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) results for shrimp extract, were enrolled in the study. Patients were classified into 2 groups: anaphylaxis (ANA) and non-ANA. Serum-specific IgEs to shrimp and recombinant tropomyosin from both house dust mite (HDM) and shrimp were measured using ImmunoCAP. Among the patients (mean age 38 years; 51.8% female), 32 were diagnosed with shrimp-induced ANA. The remaining 53 were classified into the non-ANA group, including 46 acute urticaria/angioedema and 7 isolated oropharyngeal manifestations. There were no significant differences in shrimp-specific IgE positivity (78.1% vs. 60.4%) or skin prick test (SPT) positivity (16.7% vs. 25.9%) between groups. However, specific IgE to shrimp extract was significantly higher in the ANA group. Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that a shrimp-specific IgE level > 0.7 kU/L was an appropriate cutoff for identifying ANA among patients with shrimp allergy (area under the curve 0.643, P = 0.028). No significant differences were observed in specific IgEs to recombinant shrimp and the HDM tropomyosin between the groups. The ANA group had a greater prevalence of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug hypersensitivity (31.3% vs. 7.5%, P = 0.006) and chronic urticaria (35.5% vs. 15.4%, P = 0.035). Patients with shrimp-induced ANA presented higher levels of specific IgE to shrimp extract compared to those with acute urticaria or localized oropharyngeal symptoms. Neither SPTs nor specific IgE tests for recombinant tropomyosin effectively differentiate ANA among shrimp allergy patients.",

    "abstract": "Gliadins are the primary triggers in wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis. Currently, there are no officially approved immune-modulating treatments for gliadin allergy. Recent in vivo studies have shown that hyaluronic acid based dissolving microarray patch (dMAP) could deliver house dust mite allergens through transdermal pathway and protect allergic asthma and atopic dermatitis in vivo. In this study, we explored the potential of dMAP for the transdermal delivery of gliadin proteins as a strategy to mitigate gliadin allergy. C3H/HeJ mice were sensitized to gliadin with cholera toxin via oral administration, followed by oral or intraperitoneal gliadin challenge. To evaluate the protective effects of transdermal immunotherapy (TDIT), gliadin-loaded dMAPs were applied twice a week to gliadin-sensitized mice for 4 weeks. Afterward, the mice were challenged with gliadin. The manufacturing process of dMAP did not alter the allergenicity of gliadin. TDIT significantly improved the anaphylaxis clinical score and stabilized core body temperature in the gliadin anaphylaxis model. It reduced mast cell protease-1 and gliadin-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE), and increased specific IgG₁, IgG2a and IgG2b levels. Ex vivo splenocyte study revealed that TDIT enhanced T helper type 1 (Th₁) cell population, interferon-γ expression, regulatory T cell population, and interleukin (IL)-10 expression, as well as suppressed Th₂ cell population and associated cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13). Furthermore, this TDIT preserved the structural integrity of small intestinal villi and reduced eosinophil and mast cell infiltration. Gliadin TDIT using dMAP mitigates gliadin-induced anaphylaxis in a murine model, offering a promising novel immune modulating treatment for gliadin-induced anaphylaxis.",

    "abstract": "Peanut anaphylaxis is a widespread challenge, particularly in children. We aimed to confirm the therapeutic effects of transdermal immunotherapy (TDIT) in a murine model of peanut anaphylaxis. We developed a biodegradable microneedle array patch (MAP) by incorporating peanut extract (PE) with hyaluronic acid. The allergenicity of the PE in MAP was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay inhibition. The peanut anaphylaxis model was made with BALB/c or C3H/Hej mouse strains. We measured anaphylaxis clinical scores, as well as the levels of mouse mast cell protease-1 (MCPT-1), PE-specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE), specific immunoglobulin G (sIgG)1, and sIgG2a in serum. T cell populations in the spleen and jejunum were examined using immunohistochemical stains with confocal microscopy. Histological analysis of the jejunum was performed. The production of T helper cell type 2 (Th2) and regulatory T cell (Treg) cytokines by stimulated splenocytes were also measured. The inhibitory capacity of the PE in MAP for PE sIgE was comparable to that of native PE. TDIT with 10 μg of PE-MAP recovered anaphylaxis score, sIgE, and the MCPT-1 levels, and enhanced sIgG1 and sIgG4 in serum. TDIT also reduced the recruitment of Th2 cells while increasing Treg and Th1 cells in both the spleen and jejunum. However, the efficacy of applying 10 μg of PE-MAP TDIT twice a week was more pronounced than applying once a week. Additionally, TDIT led to reduced production of Th2 cytokines (interleukin [IL]-4, IL-5, IL-13) and increased production of transforming growth factor-β by stimulated splenocytes. TDIT attenuated inflammation, mast cell infiltration, and villous damage in the jejunum. PE-MAP TDIT demonstrated therapeutic effects in peanut anaphylaxis, suggesting its potential for developing a novel TDIT for patients with peanut anaphylaxis.",

    "abstract": "Although atopic dermatitis (AD) in adults has been prevalent, there has been a paucity of previous studies on the metabolic markers linked to its development. We investigated whether plasma metabolomic biomarkers are associated with incident middle-adulthood to late-adulthood AD and identified its predictors. This study utilized data collected from the UK Biobank between 2006 and 2010. We prospectively analyzed metabolites in 79,414 participants aged 40 to 69 years, predominantly of European ancestry and free of AD, to assess the incidence of AD, which were collected using the International Classification of Diseases from hospital inpatient admission records from the baseline through 2022. The relationship between these metabolites and the incidence of AD was estimated using Cox proportional hazard models, and the predictive value of the metabolites for the incidence of middle-adulthood to late-adulthood AD was assessed. The incidence rate of middle-adulthood to late-adulthood AD was 7.81 per 10,000 person-years, and the median follow-up was 161 months. A total of 35 plasma metabolites included in lipoprotein lipids, fatty acids, amino acids, and biomarkers related to fluid balance were significantly linked to the risk of middle-adulthood to late-adulthood AD incidence. Significant non-linear associations of middle-adulthood to late-adulthood AD incidence were observed with triglycerides in medium very-low density lipoprotein, leucine, and the total concentration of branched-chain amino acids. The incorporation of the identified 35 metabolites with the covariates for middle-adulthood to late-adulthood AD risk prediction achieved an area under the curve of 0.71 (95% confidence interval, 0.67-0.75) and reclassification ability (net reclassification improvement = 21.4%, P < 0.001). Findings from this prospective study suggest that the identified plasma metabolites could better clarify the underlying metabolic vulnerabilities and improve risk prediction associated with the development of middle-adulthood to late-adulthood AD.",

Many patients still respond poorly to current medications that combine with surgical treatment strategies, resulting in uncontrolled outcomes. However, identifying uncontrolled CRSwNP remains challenging. We aimed to develop an effective predictive procedure to assess uncontrolled CRSwNP based on clinical features. The clinical features of 952 adult CRSwNP patients were subjected to a decision tree analysis, with the uncontrolled outcome at follow-up considered the positive predictive event. A predictive procedure was developed to categorized CRSwNP patients into 6 clusters with different uncontrolled rates. classification indicators were determined as the total computed tomography (CT) scores and age, as well as tissue and blood eosinophil counts . The uncontrolled rates in Clusters 1-6 were 2.75%, 12.31%, 21.28%, 33.16%, 13.54%, and 38.27%, respectively. Additionally, Cluster 1 patients had the lowest tissue and blood eosinophil count and ratio, and the lowest total CT score. Cluster 3 patients had the highest tissue eosinophil count and ratio. Cluster 5 patients >2-fold tissue eosinophil count and ratio than Cluster 2 patients. Cluster 6 patients had the highest value for blood eosinophil count and ratio, total CT score, and endoscopic score. After surgery, the primary disturbing symptoms were nasal congestion (11.01% in Cluster 1 patients and 22.31% in Cluster 2 patients), rhinorrhea/postnasal drip (27.66% in Cluster 3 patients), and olfactory dysfunction (43.68%, 26.56%, and 50.62% in Clusters 4-6 patients, respectively).

    "abstract": "Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are the foundation of asthma management, yet a subset of patients exhibits poor clinical response despite adequate treatment. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this heterogeneity is essential for developing targeted therapies. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 6 healthy controls, 6 ICS responders, and 4 ICS poor responders with asthma. We analyzed transcriptional profiles of immune cell subsets, focusing on CD14+ monocytes, and assessed signaling pathways using differential gene expression and receptor-ligand interaction analysis. ICS poor responders exhibited a reduced frequency of circulating CD14+ monocytes and upregulation of chemotaxis-related genes, including CCR1, CCL2, CCL7, and CXCL2. ANXA1 and its receptor FPR2, key regulators of anti-inflammatory responses, were downregulated in poor responders, while MIF and its receptors were upregulated. Receptor-ligand analysis identified T cells as a potential paracrine source of MIF signaling. Our findings highlight MIF-ANXA1 dysregulation in CD14+ monocytes as a key immune signature associated with poor ICS response in asthma.",

    "abstract": "The serum level of immunoglobulin (Ig)E has been reported to be elevated in patients with Kawasaki disease (KD). We investigated whether interleukin (IL)-21, rather than IL-4, could be related to elevated serum levels of IgE in KD.Sera from 48 patients with KD and 12 controls with high fever were collected to determine the level of IgE using an immunoassay system and the levels of IL-4 and IL-21 were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits.The median IL-21 level of KD patients was significantly elevated, at 499.5 pg/mL (range: <62.5-1,544 pg/mL), whereas that of controls was <62.5 pg/mL (<62.5-825 pg/mL; P<0.001). The median IL-4 level of KD patients was not elevated (4.0 pg/mL; 2.1-7.6 pg/mL). The median level of total IgE in KD patients was 58.0 IU/mL (5-1,109 IU/mL). No statistically significant correlation was found between IL-21 and total IgE levels (Spearman's R=0.2; P=0.19).Patients with KD have elevated levels of IL-21 in the serum. IL-21 may play a role in the pathogenesis of KD.",

The patient had negative responses to all common inhalant allergens, including capsaicin, by skin prick tests. The nasal provocation test with capsaicin showed that the nasal symptom score and eosinophil count increased 10 minutes after the provocation and decreased after 1 to 3 hours; no significant response was noted to house dust mite allergen. The patient's work-related rhinitis improved 1 month after she relocated and started pharmacological treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first case of OR caused by capsaicin exposure in the workplace. We provide evidence suggesting that OR may be mediated by a non-immunological mechanism.",

However, its role in the pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) remains largely unexplored. This study aimed to examine Hrd1 expression and B-cell accumulation and their possible roles in CRSwNP.Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting were used to assess gene and protein expression in nasal tissue extracts. Cells isolated from nasal tissues and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were characterized by flow cytometry. Local antibody production was measured in tissue extracts with a Bio-Plex assay. Additionally, changes in Hrd1 expression in response to specific inflammatory stimuli were measured in cultured dispersed polyp cells.Nasal polyps (NPs) from patients with eosinophilic CRSwNP (ECRS) had increased levels of Hrd1, B-cells and plasma cells compared with NPs from patients with non-eosinophilic CRSwNP (non-ECRS) or other control subjects (P < 0.05). The average Hrd1 levels in B-cells in NPs from ECRS patients were significantly higher than those from non-ECRS patients and control subjects (P < 0.05). NPs also contained significantly increased levels of several antibody isotypes compared with normal controls (P < 0.05). Interestingly, Hrd1 expression in cultured polyp cells from ECRS patients, but not non-ECRS patients, was significantly increased by interleukin-1β, lipopolysaccharide and Poly(I:C) stimulation, and inhibited by dexamethasone treatment (P < 0.05).Differential Hrd1 expression and B-cell accumulation between the ECRS and non-ECRS subsets suggests that they can exhibit distinct pathogenic mechanisms and play important roles in NP.",

The purpose of this study was to examine the prognosis of patients with hyperresponsiveness to boiled egg yolk. Data from 121 patients with egg allergy who underwent oral food challenge (OFC) with boiled egg yolk between January 2012 and December 2013 were analyzed retrospectively. The proportion of patients who could consume heated whole egg 3 years after OFC was 15.4% in the OFC-positive group and 75.8% in the OFC-negative group. Hyperresponsiveness to boiled egg yolk in early life might lead to prolonged egg allergy in children.

The LTL was measured from both cord blood and 1-year peripheral blood, and their LTLs were compared between subject groups. Finally, the proportion of AD development was examined in the subject groups that are reclassified based on subjects' exposure to prenatal stress and there LTL.Cord-blood LTL was shorter in prenatally stressed infants than in unstressed ones (P = 0.026), which difference was still significant when subjects became 1 year old (P = 0.008). LTL of cord blood, as well as one of the 1-year peripheral blood, was not different according to later AD development at 1 year (P = 0.915 and 0.174, respectively). Shorter LTL made no increase in the proportion of later AD development in either prenatally high-stressed or low-stressed groups (P = 1.000 and 0.473, respectively).Cord-blood LTL may reflect subjects' exposure to maternal prenatal stress. However, the LTL shortening is not a risk factor of increasing AD development until the age of 1, and a longer investigation may be necessary for validation. Currently, the results doubt the role of LTL shortening as a marker for risk assessment tool for the prenatal stress associated with AD development in the offspring.",

Practical indicators that distinguish these categories are lacking. We aimed to explore the diagnostic value of the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and forced expiratory flow at 25% and 75% of pulmonary volume (FEF25-75) in specifically identifying CVA and NAEB in these patients.Consecutive AR patients with chronic cough were screened and underwent induced sputum, FeNO, nasal nitric oxide, spirometry, and methacholine bronchial provocation testing. All patients also completed gastroesophageal reflux disease questionnaires.Among 1,680 AR patients, 324 (19.3%) were identified with chronic cough, of whom 316 (97.5%) underwent etiology analyses. Overall, 87 (27.5%) patients had chronic cough caused by NAEB, 78 (24.7%) by CVA, 16 (5.1%) by GERC, and 81 (25.6%) by UACS. Patients with either NAEB or CVA (n = 165, in total) were further assigned to a common group designated as CVA/NAEB, because they both responded to corticosteroid therapy. Receiver operating characteristic curves of FeNO revealed obvious differences among CVA, NAEB, and CVA/NAEB (area under the curve = 0.855, 0.699, and 0.923, respectively). The cutoff values of FeNO at 43.5 and 32.5 ppb were shown to best differentiate CVA and CVA/NAEB, respectively. FEF25-75 was significantly lower in patients with CVA than in those with other causes. A FEF25-75 value of 74.6% showed good sensitivity and specificity for identifying patients with CVA.NAEB, CVA, and UACS are common causes of chronic cough in patients with AR. FeNO can first be used to discriminate patients with CVA/NAEB, then FEF25-75 (or combined with FeNO) can further discriminate patients with CVA from those with CVA/NAEB.",

Results: Exposure to home renovation during the prenatal period was associated with significantly higher levels of CB IgE only in neonates from atopic mothers, and the effect of renovation exposure on CB IgE levels persisted from 31 months before birth.Furthermore, prenatal exposure to home renovation increased the risk of CB IgE response interacting with polymorphisms of NRF2 and GSTP1 genes only in neonates from atopic mothers.Conclusions: Maternal atopy modified the effect of prenatal exposure to home renovation on CB serum IgE response as well as the interaction between the exposure and neonatal genes involved in the oxidative stress pathway.These findings suggest that the genetically susceptible offspring of atopic mothers may be more vulnerable to the effect of prenatal exposure to home renovation on the development of allergy.",

    "abstract": "The β2 integrins are expressed exclusively on leukocytes and participate in many immune and inflammatory processes. This subfamily comprises four heterodimeric glycoproteins with a common β-subunit, designated β2 (CD18). Spontaneous mutations of the CD18 gene result in leukocyte adhesion deficiency type I (LAD-I). Low level of CD18 expression has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. We here describe a child with recurrent skin infections without pus formation, persistent gingivitis and periodontitis. His blood counts showed persistent leukocytosis (neutrophilia). CD11b expression was defective on neutrophils, while that of CD18 was normal. So, our patient represents a mild variant of LAD-I with possible dysfunctional CD18. Moreover, he developed psoriasis with reduced CD18 expression on CD4(+) T-cells. Psoriasiform dermatitis has been described before in association with LAD-I, however, clinically and histologically confirmed psoriasis in association with LAD-I has been described only in CD18 hypomorphic mice. Therefore, our patient represents the first clinically and histopathologically documented association between LAD-I and psoriasis in humans. It lends support to the role of β2 integrins in the etiopathogenesis of psoriasis.",

This study aimed to identify Per a 2 linear IgE-binding epitopes and its distribution in the body of a cockroach.Methods: The cDNA of Per a 2 was used as a template and combined with oligonucleotide primers specific to the target areas with appropriate restriction enzyme sites.Eleven overlapping fragments of Per a 2 covering the whole allergen molecule, except 20 residues of signal peptide, were generated by PCR.Mature Per a 2 and overlapping deletion mutants were affinity-purified and assayed for IgE reactivity by immunoblotting.Three synthetic peptides comprising the B cell epitopes were evaluated by direct binding ELISA.Rabbit anti-Per a 2 antibody was used for immunohistochemistry. Results: Human linear IgE-binding epitopes of Per a 2 were located at the amino acid sequences 57-86, 200-211, and 299-309.There was positive IgE binding to 10 tested Per a 2-allergic sera in 3 synthetic peptides, but none in the controls.Immunostaining revealed that Per a 2 was localized partly in the mouth and midgut of the cockroach, with the most intense staining observed in the hindgut, suggesting that the Per a 2 allergen might be excreted through the feces.Conclusions: Information on the IgE-binding epitope of Per a 2 may be used for designing more specific diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to cockroach allergy.",

Because the nose and bronchus are one airway, the nasal provocation test would be more specific for predicting the bronchial responses to HDM than the skin test.The allergy skin prick test and nasal and bronchial provocation tests using HDM (Dermatophagoides farinae) were performed in 41 young men (age, 19-28 years) who wanted military certification for asthma. The nasal responses to HDM was scored according to the severity of rhinorrhea, sneezing, and nose itching.The prevalence of a positive skin prick test to HDM did not significantly differ between patients with (n=24) and without (n=17) an early airway reaction (EAR; 79.2% vs 70.6%, P=0.534). However, the prevalence of a positive nasal test was significantly higher in the airway responders than in the others (37.5% vs 0%, P=0.005).

To clarify a potential relationship, we performed the present meta-analysis to integrate the results of studies examining the association of organic dust exposure with asthma.A comprehensive literature search in the electronic databases including EMBASE, PubMed and Cochrane Library databases (up to August 2018) was conducted. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for organic dust exposure and asthma were retrieved and pooled to generate summary effect estimates in Revman 5.2.Database searches retrieved 1,016 records. A total of 17 studies containing 3,619 cases and 6,585 controls were finally included in our meta-analysis. The summary estimates suggested that organic dust exposure was positively associated with asthma (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.26-1.75; P < 0.00001), whether among population-based case-control studies (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.13-1.35; P < 0.00001) or hospital-based case-control studies (OR, 2.79; 95% CI, 1.27-6.12; P = 0.01).

We also investigated the therapeutic effect of an intranasal steroid on OD.Forty BALB/c mice were divided into 5 groups (n = 8 for each). The control group was sensitized intraperitoneally (i.p.) and challenged intranasally (i.n.) with saline. Mice in the AR group got i.p. and i.n. ovalbumin (OVA) administration for AR induction. The LAR group was challenged i.n. with 1% OVA for inducing local nasal allergic inflammation, without inducing the systemic allergy. The OD group got an i.p. methimazole administration (75 mg/kg) to induce total destruction of olfactory mucosa. Mice in the intranasal budesonide group received i.n. budesonide (12.8 μ per time, 30 minutes after the i.n. OVA challenge) while using OVA to cause systemic allergies. We conducted a buried-food pellet test to functionally assess the degree of OD in each group by measuring the time taken until finding hidden food. We evaluated the damage to olfactory epithelium using histopathologic evaluation and compared the degree of olfactory marker protein (OMP) expression in olfactory epithelium using immunofluorescent staining.Mice of the AR (81.3 ± 19.8 seconds) and LAR groups (66.2 ± 12.7 seconds) spent significantly more time to detect the pellets than the control group (35.6 ± 12.2 seconds, P < 0.01). After treatment, the intranasal budesonide group exhibited significantly better results (35.8 ± 11.9 seconds) compared with the AR and LAR groups (P < 0.01). The AR and LAR groups showed considerable olfactory epithelial damage and suppression of OMP expression compared with the control group. In the intranasal budesonide group, the olfactory lesions and OMP expression had improved substantially.OD may be caused by olfactory epithelial damage and suppression of OMP expression in nasal allergic inflammation and could be reversed using an intranasal steroid.",

Studies have found that the prevalence of asthma has significantly increased in recent years, which has become particularly pronounced in developed countries. With rapid urbanization in China in the last 3 decades, the prevalence of asthma has increased significantly in urban areas. As changes in genetic backgrounds of human populations are limited, environmental exposure may be a major factor that is responsible for the increased prevalence of asthma. This review focuses on environmental components of farms and rural areas that may have protective effects in reducing the development of asthma. Farm and rural related microorganism- and pathogen-associated molecular patterns are considered to be important environmental factors that modulate host's innate and adaptive immune system to induce protection effects later in life. Environmental microbial-related immunotherapy will also be discussed as the future research direction for the prevention of allergic asthma.",

    "abstract": "Recent findings on the mechanism of allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) have revisited the role of immunoglobulin G (IgG) as the development of specific blocking IgG antibodies appeared critical for the successful suppression of T-helper 2 (Th2)-biased allergic responses. Consequently, any form of molecular AIT-promoting potent allergen-specific neutralizing antibodies would be preferred to conventional administration of allergen extracts. The potent immunogenicity of virus-like particles (VLPs) could be harnessed for that purpose. The particle size (20-200 nm) optimizes uptake by antigen-presenting cells as well as lymphatic trafficking. Moreover, the display of antigens in repetitive arrays promotes potent B cell activation for the development of sustained antibody responses. The presentation of self-antigens on the particle surface was even capable to break B cell tolerance. In this review, we describe the immunomodulatory properties of the 3 VLP-based strategies designed so far for the treatment of allergic disease: VLP packaged with CpG motifs as well as chimeric particles displaying pro-Th2/Th2 cytokines or allergens (full-length or B cell epitopes).",

Methods We performed a systematic review of randomized, cohort, nested-case control, cross-sectional studies by using Meta-analyses of Observational Studies in Epidemiology statement. Four major databases, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Search Manager, and the Web of Science Core Collection as well as meta-analysis were used. Studies comparing incidence, prevalence and intraocular pressure (IOP) between patients who were treated with and without ICSs were included. A random-model meta-analysis was performed using the inverse variance method. Results Out of 623 studies screened, 18 with 31,665 subjects were finally included. No significant difference between the 2 groups was observed for crude glaucoma incidence (odds ratio [OR], 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86-1.04; P = 0.26; I² = 0%; P for heterogeneity = 0.57) as a primary endpoint, adjusted glaucoma incidence (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.65-1.24; P = 0.64), crude prevalence (OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 0.23-14.19; P = 0.57), adjusted prevalence (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.50-2.96; P = 0.66), IOP change during ICS treatment (mean difference [MD] +0.01 mmHg; 95% CI, -0.19-0.20; P = 0.95), and single measurement IOP (MD +0.37 mmHg; 95% CI, -0.24-0.97; P = 0.23). Time-to-event analysis for glaucoma development as one of the secondary endpoints (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.28-0.96) suggested a reverse association between ICS and glaucoma.

    "abstract": "Drug-induced hypersensitivity pneumonitis results from interactions between pharmacologic agents and the human immune system.We describe a 54-year-old man with hypersensitivity pneumonitis caused by cephalosporins with identical R1 side chains.The patient, who complained of cough with sputum, was prescribed ceftriaxone and clarithromycin at a local clinic.The following day, he complained of dyspnea, and chest X-ray revealed worsening of inflammation.Upon admission to our hospital, antibiotics were changed to cefepime with levofloxacin, but his pneumonia appeared to progress.Changing antibiotics to meropenem with ciprofloxacin improved his symptoms and radiologic findings.Antibiotics were de-escalated to ceftazidime with levofloxacin, and his condition improved.During later treatment, he was mistakenly prescribed cefotaxime, which led to nausea, vomiting, dyspnea and fever, and indications of pneumonitis on chest X-ray.We performed bronchoalveolar lavage, and the findings included lymphocytosis (23%), eosinophilia (17%), and a low cluster of differentiation (CD) 4 to CD8 ratio (0.1), informing a diagnosis of drug-induced pneumonitis.After a medication change, his symptoms improved and he was discharged.One year later, he was hospitalized for acute respiratory distress syndrome following treatment with ceftriaxone and aminoglycosides for an upper respiratory tract infection.After steroid therapy, he recovered completely.In this patient, hypersensitivity reaction in the lungs was caused by ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and cefepime, but not by ceftazidime, indicating that the patient's hypersensitivity pneumonitis was to the common R1 side chain of the cephalosporins.",

Activating transcription factor 6β (ATF6B) is known to regulate ATFα-mediated ER stress response. The aim of this study is to investigate the associations of ATF6B genetic variants with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) and its major phenotype, % decline of FEV1 by aspirin provocation. Four common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ATF6B were genotyped and statistically analyzed in 93 AERD patients and 96 aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA) as controls. Logistic analysis revealed that 2 SNPs (rs2228628 and rs8111, P=0.008; corrected P=0.03) and 1 haplotype (ATF6B-ht4, P=0.005; corrected P=0.02) were significantly associated with % decline of FEV1 by aspirin provocation, whereas ATF6B polymorphisms and haplotypes were not associated with the risk of AERD. Although further functional and replication studies are needed, our preliminary findings suggest that ATF6B may be related to obstructive phenotypes in response to aspirin exposure in adult asthmatics.",

    "abstract": "Most cells from different organisms release extracellular vesicles (EVs) to the extracellular environment. The term EV is a broad one for all types of vesicles found in body fluids and cell culture in accordance with the recommendation of the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV).1 In recent years, Interest in EVs increased because of their function in intercellular communication and their potential use as biomarkers and therapeutics for several diseases.2,3\r\n\r\nThese EVs contain various DNAs, proteins, mRNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs) that have potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications and are classified into exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies through their biogenesis and secretion mechanisms. Exosomes are 50 to 150-nm vesicles released by living cells. Microvesicles are 100-to 2,000-nm vesicles formed by direct outward budding of the plasma membrane from living cells. Apoptotic bodies are 1-to 4-µm vesicles and released from the plasma membrane as apoptotic cell blebs.4\r\n\r\nEVs act as a signaling complex, transfer membrane receptors between cells, deliver proteins to target cells, and modify the receiving cells by horizontal transfer of genetics.5\r\n\r\nMany studies have suggested that EVs might be involved in a wide range of biological processes, including immune regulation, inflammation, and tumor development.6 EV have been isolated from different body fluids, such as plasma,7 urine,8 and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF).9 EVs are highly stable in biological fluids and protected from degradation by their lipid bilayer.4 They play important roles in maintaining homeostasis through intercellular communication in the human airway.\r\n\r\nRecently, their biological roles draw significant interest in respiratory diseases because their contents, including miRNA, play an important role in the pathogenesis of many respiratory diseases, including lung cancer, interstitial lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and allergic diseases like asthma.10 In the lungs, various types of cells, such as epithelial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, tumor cells, stem cells, and immune cells, can release EVs. Alveolar macrophage-derived EVs can potentially control lung and airway inflammation through intercellular communication. Exposure to various stimuli, such as infection, DNA damage, and smoke exposure, enhances EV secretion and modify EV composition to change the surrounding microenvironment through EV-mediated cell-to-cell communication.11,12,13\r\n\r\nNoncancerous cell-derived EVs in the airway show protective functions against injuries, such as tissue recovery and repair, but lung cancer-derived EVs regulate tumor malignancy.14 Exosome secretion is increased during allergic inflammation in the lungs, which may mediate increased intercellular signaling.6 A few studies have reported that EVs may regulate airway inflammation and allergic reactions through their paracrine effects in the lungs.15,16 BALF exosomes from healthy individuals and asthmatic patients exhibit distinct phenotypes and functions. In asthmatics, BALF exosomes may contribute to subclinical inflammation in airway epithelium.17\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Pegtel et al.17 reported that miRNAs of viral origin are found in EVs secreted by infected cells and that their transfer to non-infected cells led to the regulation of some target genes of these miRNA. It has recently been shown that, EVs derived from Esherichia coli into the bloodstream induced systemic inflammation mimicking sepsis18 and that Staphylococcus aureus-derived EVs are related to the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis-like inflammation.18,19\r\n\r\nIn 2013, Kim et al.20 reported the relationship between EVs in indoor dust and neutrophilic pulmonary inflammation. Their study indicated that inhalation of indoor-dust EVs induce both Th1-and Th17-cellresponses and neutrophilic inflammation in the lungs. Furthermore, clinical data suggest that IgG1 sensitization to dust EVs may be related to the clinical manifestation of asthma symptoms in atopic children. Indoor-dust EVs may represent a novel target for the development of diagnostic tool for neutrophilic inflammation-induced airway diseases, such as neutrophilic asthma and COPD.\r\n\r\nIn this current issue of the Allergy, Asthma & Immunology Research, Kim et al.21 reported that serum IgG antibody level to dust EVs in the 3 disease groups and healthy controls had a normal distribution and were significantly higher in patients with non-eosinophilic asthma, COPD or lung cancer than in healthy control subjects. Furthermore, multivariable analysis showed that a high serum anti-dust EV IgG concentration was an independent risk factor for non-eosinophilic asthma, COPD (irrespective of severity), and lung cancer (irrespective of cellular subtypes) after adjustment for age, gender, and cigarette smoking. Although additional prospective studies will be needed to determine whether dust EV exposure has a causal relationship with asthma, COPD, and lung cancer, these findings provide an new insight into the pathogenesis of non-eosinophilic asthma, COPD, and lung cancer, as well as a clue to developing novel diagnostic and/or therapeutic modalities.",

This study evaluated the epidemiology of newly diagnosed asthma during pregnancy and the associated risk factors among previously nonasthmatic women. Twelve-year medical data from the Korean National Health Insurance claims database (from January 2007 to December 2018) of Korean women who gave birth between January 2012 and December 2015 were collected. Previously nonasthmatic women were defined as those who had not been diagnosed with asthma for at least 4 years before pregnancy. Asthma flare-up was defined as asthma diagnosed three times or more and treated at least once with an oral corticosteroid. A nested case-control study was performed, and then the derived risk factors were applied to whole study population. Among the nonasthmatic women, 7.5% experienced asthma during pregnancy including episodes requiring hospitalization and 18.6% of them visited emergency room. Older age, primiparity, multi-fetal pregnancy, and rhinitis were identified as the risk factors. Among the entire study population, moderate to severe rhinitis was a significant risk factor across all age groups, while primiparity with multi-fetal pregnancy was one for older pregnant women; 22.7% in those ≥ 34 years old experienced asthma flare-ups compared to only 3.5% in the < 34 age group. A substantial portion of pregnant women with no history of asthma experienced an asthma flare-up during pregnancy. Multi-fetal pregnancy as primiparity at a later age and moderate to severe rhinitis are risk factors for the new development of asthma.",

S47W secreted from Pichia pastoris was examined for secondary structure and for the formation of a hydrophobic cavity by 8-Anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) staining.Monoclonal and human IgE-antibody binding was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Allergen-induced degranulation by human epsilon receptor expressed-rat basophil was determined.Stimulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-8 release from human bronchial epithelial (BEAS2B) cells and inhibition of IgE binding to the wild type allergen by S47W-induced IgG were determined.Results: S47W reduced secondary structure and failed to bind the hydrophobic ANS ligand as well as a monoclonal antibody known to be dependent on the nature of the side chain of residue 114 in an adjacent loop.It could also not stimulate IL-8 release from BEAS2B cells.IgE from house dust mite (HDM)-allergic Thais bound S47W with 100-fold weaker avidity, whereas IgE of HDM-allergic Australians did not.S47W still induced basophil degranulation, although requiring higher concentrations for some subjects.Anti-S47W antiserumimmunized mice blocked the binding of human IgE to wild type Der p 2. Conclusions: The mutant S47W had altered structure and reduced ability to stimulate pro-inflammatory responses and to bind IgE, but retained its ability to induce blocking antibodies.It thus represents a hypoallergen produced by a single mutation of a non-solventaccessible amino acid.",

    "abstract": "Allergic rhinitis (AR) has traditionally been classified as perennial or seasonal, depending on the kind of allergen responsible for the symptoms1; however, this classification is not satisfactory for many reasons. Some AR (SAR) patients present with perennial symptoms due to exposure to several pollens over several months. Conversely, perennial AR (PAR) patients can present symptoms for only a few weeks per year. Furthermore, most patients have multiple sensitizations and symptoms throughout the year. Based on these findings, the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) guidelines were published in 2001.2 This report was innovative especially in proposing a new AR classification using duration and severity of symptoms as criteria.\r\n\r\nThe classifications of duration and severity were based on empirical criteria that required validation. Many validation studies of the ARIA classification have been performed in both European and international studies, and these established that and are not synonymous with and respectively.3-6 The ARIA classification appears to be closer to the patient's need than the traditional classification system.7 After 2001, more than 251 original articles conducted in 43 countries used the ARIA classification of intermittent and persistent AR.8 The ARIA 2008 update was published based on studies over 7 years, but the classification system was maintained. Currently, except for in North America, most countries use the ARIA guidelines as standard.\r\n\r\nIn Korea, the ARIA guidelines have also been considered as standard. Nevertheless, a questionnaire survey to 348 ENT doctors in 2012 showed that just 60% of clinicians use the ARIA guidelines.9 This relatively low frequency of use might be because of doctors' beliefs that traditional allergen-based classifications have some advantage. In Korea, tree pollens have peaks in the spring, grass pollens in the summer, and weed pollens in the fall.10 Thus, it is a logical deduction that allergens would produce symptoms specifically during their peak pollen season.\r\n\r\nIn the present issue of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology Research, Chung et al.11 addressed the validation of the ARIA classification in Korea. The authors especially highlighted the specificity of allergens. The authors revealed that the subjective symptom durations are not consistent with the peak seasons of the pollens. In addition, they found that most patients suffer during spring and fall, irrespective of the kind of pollen. This is very informative in daily practice because there was no study dealing with specificity of patients in Korea, although the study populations were smaller (number of patients=40).\r\n\r\nThe authors11 also showed a lack of association between the SAR/PAR classification and the ARIA classification. These are similar results to previous European3-6 and Korean studies.12,13 The authors documented that compared to the SAR/PAR classification, the ARIA classification showed a better association not only with the symptomatic score, but also with the quality of life score. These are concordant results to a previous report7 and first document in Korea.\r\n\r\nThus, the ARIA classification could be accepted as standard depending on previous international and Korean evidence. But the question remains, is the classification of SAR and really useless?\r\n\r\nIn this issue, Chung et al.11 reported that 64.6% of patients with had symptoms in a specific season, a higher percentage than that for patients with PAR or PAR+SAR (18.3% and 49.2%, respectively). Ciprandi et al.7 reported that allergic conjunctivitis is more frequent in (64.9%) than in PAR (46.4%) or PAR+SAR (47.9%). patients had a significant increase in total symptom score during the pollen season, and PAR patients showed more intense symptoms during the non-pollen season.7\r\n\r\nAR has been classified as and PAR in Japan.12 Japanese doctors believe that ARIA is an incongruous classification because AR patients sensitized to cedar pollen, the most common allergen in Japan, endure allergic symptoms for at least 6-7 weeks (persistent AR) and suffer absolutely more severe symptoms during the cedar pollen season.\r\n\r\nThe updated practice parameters were developed by The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) and the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (ACAAI) in 2008.13 This American system maintained the traditional and PAR classification and added PAR with seasonal exacerbation and episodic AR to address the weak points in the traditional PAR and classification.\r\n\r\nThe British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BSACI) guidelines introduced a complementary classification in 2008.14 These guidelines classified AR as intermittent or persistent based on ARIA. Each classification was further sub-classified into or perennial, because the and perennial concept is useful in UK practice, especially for diagnosis and immunotherapy.\r\n\r\nIn Korea, the ARIA classification has been validated and has showed good correlation with symptom score and quality of life. The purpose of classification, however, is to improve patient care and consequently improve patient satisfaction and compliance. In Korea, 73% of otorhinolaryngologists think the ARIA guidelines are not suitable in daily care practice although 60% follow ARIA guidelines.9 In order to improve the satisfaction of patients and clinicians, a complementary Korean-specific classification is mandatory. Large epidemiological and clinical studies are necessary to define the most suitable way to classify and treat patients with AR.",

Mice were examined for bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), the influx of inflammatory cells into the lung tissues, histopathological changes in the lungs and CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) T cells in the spleen, and examined the response after the depleting regulatory T cells (Tregs) with an anti-CD25mAb. Treatment of mice with sMA suppressed the asthmatic response, including BHR, bronchoalveolar inflammation, and pulmonary eosinophilic inflammation. Anti-CD25mAb treatment abrogated the suppressive effects of sMA in this mouse model of asthma and totally depleted CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) T cells in the spleen. sMA attenuated allergic inflammation in a mouse model of asthma, which might be related with CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) T cell.",

Although 2-year treatment with SLIT using cedar extracts was effective in >70% of patients with CP, the remaining patients did not respond to this therapy. The mRNA expression levels in peripheral CD4⁺ T cells and basophils from both high- and non-responder patients before and after undergoing SLIT were comparatively studied using microarray analysis. By processing the data using serial multivariate analysis, an apoptosis pathway was extracted in both CD4⁺ T cells and basophils. Conclusively, the strong treatment effectiveness of SLIT in patients with CP may be caused by the induction of apoptosis in CD4⁺ T cells and basophils in these patients (Trial registry at University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry Database, UMIN000016532).",

During secondary immune responses, plasma cell survival and Ig production are regulated by the local environment. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the presence of long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) and specific survival niches for LLPCs in human nasal polyps.Nasal mucosal samples were cultured with an air-liquid interface system and the Ig levels in culture supernatants were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The characteristics of LLPCs in nasal polyps were determined by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. The expression of neurotrophins as well as their receptors was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and Western blotting.The numbers of CD138⁺ total plasma cells and BCL2⁺ plasma cells were increased in both eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic nasal polyps compared with those in normal tissues. The production of IgG, IgA, and IgE was detected in culture supernatants even after a 32-day culture of nasal polyps. Although the total numbers of plasma cells were decreased in nasal polyps after culture, the numbers of BCL2⁺ plasma cells remained stable. The expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) as well as tropomyosin receptor kinase (Trk) A, a high-affinity receptor for NGF, was upregulated in both eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic nasal polyps. In addition, BCL2⁺ plasma cell numbers were positively correlated with NGF and TrkA mRNA expression in nasal mucosal tissues. Polyp plasma cells had the expression of TrkA.Human nasal polyps harbor a population of LLPCs and NGF may be involved in their prolonged survival. LLPCs may be a novel therapeutic target for suppressing the local Ig production in nasal polyps.",

In this study, we examined the role of HY peptide, which is an antagonistic peptide specifically binding the second extracellular loop of CCR5, in the expression of autophagy genes and β-arrestin 2 in lung tissues of asthmatic mice. Methods Experimental asthmatic mice were treated with HY peptide and dexamethasone sodium phosphate (Dex). Airway inflammation, autophagy-related genes, autophagic vacuoles (AVs) and β-arrestin 2 were examined in lung tissues, and the correlation between β-arrestin 2 and LC3 expression was assessed. Results HY peptide and Dex treatments alleviate airway inflammation. The expression of autophagy-related genes, such as BECN1, ATG5 and LC3, was decreased in the lung tissues of the asthmatic mice. However, HY peptide and Dex treatments increased the expression of these genes as well as the formation of AVs. Additionally, the expression of the β-arrestin 2 protein was significantly increased in the HY peptide-treated group, and positive cells expressing β-arrestin 2 were mainly located in the membrane and cytoplasm of bronchial epithelial cells. The β-arrestin 2 expression was positively correlated with the expression of LC3 in the model and HY peptide-treated groups. Conclusions HY peptide inhibits airway inflammation, autophagic dysfunction exists in asthmatic mice, and targeting HY peptide increases the expression of autophagy-related genes. Thus, β-arrestin 2 may participate in the mechanisms underlying these processes.",

Our aim was to study the effect of comorbid bronchiectasis on asthma.A propensity score-matched cohort study was conducted using the National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening Cohort database. From 2005 to 2008, 8,034 participants with asthma were weighted based on propensity scores in a 1:3 ratio with 24,099 participants without asthma. From the asthma group, 141 participants with overlapped bronchiectasis were identified, and 7,892 participants had only asthma. Clinical outcomes of acute asthma exacerbation(s) and mortality rates were compared among the study groups.The prevalence of bronchiectasis (1.7%) was 3 times higher in asthmatics than in the general population of Korea. Patients who had asthma comorbid with bronchiectasis experienced acute exacerbation(s) more frequently than non-comorbid patients (11.3% vs. 5.8%, P = 0.007). Time to the first acute exacerbation was also shorter in the asthmatics with bronchiectasis group (1,970.9 days vs. 2,479.7 days, P = 0.005). Although bronchiectasis was identified as a risk factor for acute exacerbation (adjusted odds ratio, 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-2.86), there was no significant relationship between bronchiectasis and all-cause or respiratory mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.17; 95% CI, 0.67-2.04 and aHR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.11-6.08).Comorbid bronchiectasis increases asthma-related acute exacerbation, but it does not-raise the risk of all-cause or respiratory mortality. Close monitoring and accurate diagnosis of bronchiectasis are required for patients with frequent exacerbations of asthma.",

This study aimed to develop a questionnaire to evaluate the quality of life in Korean children with allergic rhinitis. After a preliminary survey, an initial questionnaire was developed. Questions were modified to be easily understood by young children aged 6 to 7 years. The modified questionnaire was tested on children aged 6 to 12 years old. Item scores, defined as the proportion of children whose answer score was 1 point or higher was multiplied by the average answer score of each question, were used to identify questions that have practical application to the quality of life in Korean children with allergic rhinitis. Differences in answer scores between children with allergic rhinitis and those who were healthy were assessed by a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The relationship between nasal index scores and quality of life scores was determined by a Spearman rank order test. An initial questionnaire was composed of 21 items. We identified 19 questions with item scores above 0.5 in children with allergic rhinitis, many of which were related to nasal symptoms and 10 questions that were different between the allergic rhinitis group and the control group. The final questionnaire included the 10 questions that had both high item scores and a significant difference in the answer scores between the two groups. The developed questionnaire is essential and practical for assessing discomfort related to the symptoms felt by Korean children with allergic rhinitis.",

However, few studies have focused on allergic inflammation in the nose after an isolated lower airway allergen challenge, a situation that can exist clinically when human subjects breathe primarily through the mouth, as occurs when nasally congested. This study used a mouse model to investigate whether upper airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness were induced by an isolated lower airway allergen challenge. BALB/c mice were sensitized by systemic intraperitoneal injection of ovalbumin/saline and challenged with intratracheal ovalbumin/saline. Inflammation in the nose and lungs was assessed by cytology and histology of nasal tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), while nasal airway resistance and response were measured over 3 days post-challenge. Intratracheal application of an allergen in anaesthetized mice resulted in exclusive deposition in the lower airway. Compared to control animals, ovalbumin-sensitized mice after challenge showed bronchial hyperreactivity and increased IL-5 in the serum BALF, as well as eosinophil infiltration in the lungs. However, nasal histology of the ovalbumin-sensitized mice showed no increase in eosinophil infiltration. The nasal lavage fluid revealed no increase in eosinophils or IL-5, and the nasal airway resistance did not increase after challenge either. In a mouse allergy model, exclusive allergen challenge of the lower airway can elicit a pulmonary and systemic allergic response, but does not induce upper airway inflammatory or physiological responses.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of allergic rhinitis (AR) in the general population is increasing and currently estimated to be approximately 10-25%.1,2 Although AR is not associated with a risk of death, the disorder can have a considerable effect on a patient's quality of life. Consideration of comorbid diseases, including asthma, nasal polyp, olfactory dysfunction and chronic rhinosinusitis, results in a tremendous increase in the medical cost for AR treatment, which has come to entail more than just treating the rhinitis itself.1 Among the current treatment options for AR, specific allergen immunotherapy (SIT) is the only medical intervention that modifies fundamental immunologic mechanisms by inducing tolerance, and it can also modify the natural course of the disease. SIT for AR has been used for more than a century since first reported by Noon.3 SIT refers to the repeated administration of allergenic extracts to atopic individuals over a period of 3 to 5 years either subcutaneously (SCIT) or sublingually (SLIT) for the treatment of allergic diseases. At first, SCIT was used for allergic diseases caused by pollen allergens, such as hay fever or seasonal AR; however, today the indications extend to hymenoptera venom, house dust mites (HDMs), animal dander and allergic diseases related to fungi.4 SCIT has been demonstrated to be effective for asthma and AR; yet, it has several disadvantages, such as its inconvenience, invasiveness and potentially severe systemic reactions. Thus, SLIT has recently received much attention around the world as a primary treatment for AR and is now widely used as a replacement for subcutaneous administration, even in Korea.5,6 The efficacy and safety of SIT have been established by many clinical trials, studies, and meta-analyses, and its long-term effects and prevention of asthma progression have been suggested.7,8,9,10\r\n\r\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, the majority of patients with AR are diagnosed by ENT specialists or general practice physicians.11 Published data suggest that ENT specialists most commonly encounter patients with AR triggered by one or multiple inhalant allergens. Thus, ENT specialists are mainly responsible for the primary treatment of AR. In this regard, important information has been provided by a Chinese survey conducted among ENT specialists on their knowledge and clinical usage of SIT.12 Most of the survey respondents considered AR (96.0%) and allergic asthma (96.0%) the most suitable indications for SIT. Of all respondents, 77.0% recommended the use of SIT as early as possible; in addition, SIT was considered 'relatively controllable and safe' by most respondents (80.6%). With regard to the indications for SIT, ENT specialists in South China (69.1%) preferred SIT as 'the first choice of treatment'; however, those in West China (78.2%) preferred the response 'pharmacotherapy is invalid'. In terms of the choice between SCIT and SLIT, physicians tended to choose SCIT for those patients who are of good financial status (84.1%), have high-efficacy expectations (82.5%), are adult (76.4%) or are well educated (71.5%), suggesting that ENT specialists in China believe that SCIT is more efficient, more expensive, less safe, and more careful in its follow-up schedule than SLIT. However, only 15.8% of them believed that SIT could be implemented in a primary hospital due to the need for standardized diagnostic processes, professionally trained staff and a valid emergency rescue system. This implies that although many ENT specialists now agree with the efficacy of SIT, they are concerned about the safety issues of this therapy, especially those of SCIT. In terms of safety issues, most ENT specialists cannot justify using SCIT, which can lead to potentially fatal systemic complications in patients with AR, which is not a fatal disease but does affect quality of life. According to a Belgium survey, of the different types of SIT, SLIT is the most frequently performed by ENT physicians of longstanding practice, working in private practice and/or in the French-speaking part of Belgium.13 Most data suggest that ENT specialists may transition to practicing SLIT instead of SCIT because of its safety and convenience.\r\n\r\nThe highest allergen-positive rates of AR patients showed marked differences among geographical regions as well as age groups.12,14 A study of the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network demonstrated sensitization patterns to different inhalant allergens across Europe and the appropriate battery of tests on inhalant allergens needed for an epidemiological study.15 Japanese Cedar is the most common allergen in Japan. House dust mites (HDM) comprised the larger proportion of sensitized allergens among the younger compared with the older age groups in Korea.14 A recent Chinese study found that HDMs were the major allergen affecting patients; in addition, patients in northern China showed significantly greater sensitization to pollens than did those from the other regions.16 However, the majority of individuals who were surveyed in the Asia-Pacific region reported never having had a diagnostic test to confirm the presence of AR. Forty-one percent of adults and 43% of children surveyed reported having had a diagnostic test (either a skin or blood test) to confirm the diagnosis of AR. On average, roughly equal percentages of the survey population reported having had a skin-prick test (~10%), blood test (~14%), or both (~16%).11 Thus, for the application of SIT as well as the diagnosis of AR, allergen tests to determine offending allergens should be performed and tailored to individual age groups and epidemiological studies.\r\n\r\nAR is often induced by a variety of allergens. Among the patients seeking treatment for moderate to severe respiratory AR, polysensitization is more prevalent (range, 50-80%) than monosensitization in the United States, Europe and Korea. A monosensitized patient would be the ideal candidate for SIT. Nonetheless, it appears that polysensitized patients would also benefit from appropriately prescribed SIT, even though the use of single or multi-allergen SIT is still debatable in polysensitized patients. Although multi-allergen immunotherapy increases the risk of adverse reactions during SIT, some clinical trials have demonstrated its efficacy in AR and asthma,17 while others have not.18 In Korea, a comparative study performed on 134 patients demonstrated that mite-SLIT is equally effective between monosensitized and polysensitized patients.19 One of the most striking differences in SIT approaches between Europe and the United States is the use of allergen mixtures, which are a common practice in the United States but usually not applied in European countries. In Europe, the predominant view is that polyallergy does not always constitute a clinical problem, and that the most troublesome allergies only should be treated using the corresponding monoallergen SIT. In contrast, the predominant view in the United States is that one should treat as many of a patient's allergies as possible by administering all the relevant allergens (either as a mixture or as separate extracts). Data suggest that ENT specialists in China tend to use a similar SIT approach to treating patients as that used in the United States.12 According to published data, the use of single- or multi-antigen immunotherapy in polysensitized patients, whether delivered sublingually or subcutaneously, requires more supporting data.20\r\n\r\nLastly, the Chinese survey indicated that the 'high cost of SIT' (86.6%) and the 'lack of patient knowledge of SIT' (85.2%) were likely the main reasons for the lower clinical usage of SIT among Chinese ENT specialists. In a United Kingdom survey conducted among ENT consultants, 26% recommend SIT, yet only 6.6% currently administer the immunotherapy.21 In Belgium, 81% of Belgian ENT physicians have concluded that there is an indication for immunotherapy in AR patients, while 19% neglect such an indication, the main reasons being a lack of doctor expertise on, lack of patient knowledge about, and the high costs associated with SIT. In addition, its high cost is also an important reason that may prevent the usage of SIT during maintenance therapy. Chronic pharmacotherapy is recommended to patients with persistent moderate to severe AR. SIT, however, can not only improve the quality of life and the physical burden of allergies as well as change the course of the disease but can also reduce long-term costs. Published data have shown a significant cost benefit with SIT versus the use of drugs alone for AR and asthma treatments.22 However, this cost-benefit effect usually depends on the healthcare and insurance systems of each country. In Korea and most regions of China, the healthcare system does not cover the costs of SIT or the Medicare payment for SIT is low, which could increase the economic burden to patients. Additional healthcare policies should be adopted to promote and improve immunotherapy awareness and to support the implementation of SIT for allergic diseases, which can improve patients' health and happiness.\r\n\r\nPreviously published data suggest that it is most commonly ENT specialists who diagnose and manage AR patients. Most of them are aware of the efficacy and safety of SIT for AR patients. Among the different types of SIT, conventional SCIT is the preferred method in China, yet likely to change among ENT specialists to SLIT because of safety and convenience. However, the wide acceptance of SIT has been a serious issue due to its high cost, which will require financial support by means of adopting a new healthcare and reimbursement system. Finally, there is room for improving knowledge of specific immunotherapy options among general practitioners as well as patients. This would enhance synergy among specialists, primary care physicians and patients.",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) has a wide range of clinical symptoms with a tendency toward chronic relapse. Patients with mild AD can be managed with use of emollients after bathing and use of topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors. On the other hand, those with moderate to severe AD often require systemic treatment, which could induce adverse effects and demand careful monitoring, particularly in long-term use. In fact, systemic steroids are recommended for limited cases of acute flare-up as a short therapeutic course due to an overall unfavorable risk-benefit profile. According to meta-analysis evaluating the efficacy and safety of systemic treatment in moderate-to-severe AD, cyclosporin A is recommended as a first-line treatment for short-term use, and azathioprine and methotrexate are also recommended as a second- or a third-line treatment.1 However, long-term use of cyclosporine A was not recommended due to a lack of long-term safety data. In addition, there are patients who show a lack of response to these drugs. Therefore, approaches to develop and/or evaluate systemic treatment modalities based on appropriate assessment of efficacy and safety should be continued.\r\n\r\nA thorough understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of AD is crucial to the appropriate management of AD. Based on emerging evidences that skin barrier dysfunction predisposes to AD development, approaches have been directed toward correction of the primary abnormality in barrier function. However, additional factors are necessary for AD development, and a role of immune dysregulation has been strongly supported.2,3 In fact, cyclosporine A, a gold standard of systemic therapy in AD, is a representative drug for immunomodulation. For immune dysregulation, Th1/Th2-cell dysregulation, IgE production, dendritic cell signaling, and mast cell hyperactivity have been considered largely attributed to the pathogenesis of AD.2 Leukotrienes are arachidonic acid metabolites generated from many cells, including mast cells and lymphocytes.4 Based on important biological effects of cysteinyl leukotrienes, such as potent bronchoconstriction and proinflammatory mediators, in asthma development,5 their antagonists have been introduced as antiasthmatic medications in the late 1990s. Leukotriene receptor antagonists have also been successfully used in other conditions, particularly in allergic rhinitis. Although the exact mechanism of leukotriene receptor antagonists in AD is uncertain, evidence of enhanced leukotriene production in the pathogenesis of AD provide a theoretical rationale for the use of leukotriene receptor antagonists in AD patients.\r\n\r\nMontelukast is a cysteinyl-leukotriene-1 receptor antagonist, which is the most commonly prescribed leukotriene receptor antagonist worldwide with zfirlukast.7 However, montelukast is not possibly recommended as systemic treatment for AD due to its limited evidence.1 In order to ensure the efficacy and safety profiles of montelukast in AD management, study results, which are evaluated under a well-designed study, such as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, are warranted. Considering that AD occurs more commonly in children, data tested on children could be more desirable. Encouragingly, montelukast could be a representative drug for systemic treatment as long as the safety is concerned. The absence of major adverse effects allows montelukast to grant a license for children aged 6 years or older.8 The study to be published in this issue assessed,11 efficacy and safety of montelukast in children with AD in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled method, although there have been a few studies reported in the literature.9,10 They recruited considerable portion of children less than 6 years of age.10,11 In this study, no significant safety problems were noted in 2- to 6-year-old children,11 which will encourage further trials of leukotriene receptor antagonists in children with AD.\r\n\r\nEight randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have reported the efficacy of montelukast not only in children with AD but also in adults with AD, in which the efficacy results were inconsistent regardless of participant age, children or adult (Table).12,13,14,15,16 The results from 3 studies using a relatively large sample size compared to the other 5 studies, have demonstrated no significant difference in efficacy between the montelukast-treated and placebo-treated groups.11,14,16 The duration of study12 and the proportion of extrinsic subgroup of AD have been suggested as factors affected the difference in the result.6 However, studies to date have not completely evaluated the efficacy of montelukast and the factor affecting its efficacy in AD treatment. Further studies designed with a well-organized system are necessary to determine the efficacy of montelukast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable\r\n\r\nSummary for double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of montelukast used in AD patients",

We aimed to describe the distinctive asthma severity profile and the pattern of controller prescription in Korean children.Twelve pediatric allergists from tertiary medical centers reviewed medical records of all asthmatic children who visited their clinics between September 1 and November 30 of 2013. Controller prescriptions were re-classified into 4 categories, then the prevalence of each asthma severity category and the controller prescription patterns according to asthma severity assessed by a Western (Global Initiative for Asthma, GINA) and an Asia-Pacific (Japanese Pediatric GuideLine, JPGL) guideline were evaluated.A total of 840 cases were reviewed. Both GINA and JPGL revealed that 328 (39.0%) and 249 (29.6%) subjects had intermittent asthma whereas 24 (2.9%) and 21 (2.5%) subjects had severe persistent asthma, respectively. Although higher category controllers tended to be prescribed to those who had more severe asthma, there was much overlap in categories of prescribed controllers between groups with regard to asthma severities. Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) was the most frequently prescribed as a single controller (40%) or as an add-on medication (19%) in the group of asthmatic children <6 years.Korean children have distinctive patterns of asthma severity and management strategies with a lower prevalence of severe asthma and a preference toward LTRA rather than low dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) alone or add-on long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) in the group of <6 year-old asthmatics that has not been predicted in Western countries.

We examined whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MD-2 promoter can affect MD-2 expression and aimed to clarify the relationship between Der p 2 allergy and SNPs of MD-2 promoter.The function of SNPs of MD-2 promoter and the effects of cytokines and immunoglobulin on the secretion and mRNA expression were investigated in 73 allergic subjects with different MD-2 gene promoter variants. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured with or without LPS in the presence of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus group 2 allergen (Der p 2), followed by mRNA extraction and cytokine expression analysis. The culture supernatants were collected for cytokine measurement.Patients with the MD-2 promoter SNPs (rs1809441/rs1809442) had increased mRNA expressions of MD-2, ε heavy chain of IgE (Cε), and interleukin (IL)-8; however, only MD-2 and IL-8 were further up-regulated after Der p 2 stimulation. Patients with SNPs of MD-2 promoter tended to have high levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α after Der p 2 and LPS stimulation. Increased secretions of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 were found to be up-regulated by Der p 2 stimulation, and an increased secretion of IFN-γ and decreased secretion of IL-4 were noted after LPS stimulation.The high levels of proinflammatory cytokines secreted by Der p 2 were predetermined by MD-2 promoter SNPs (rs1809441/rs1809442).

    "abstract": "Oral corticosteroids (OCSs) are frequently prescribed for asthma management despite their adverse effects. An understanding of the pattern of OCS treatment is required to optimize asthma treatment and reduce OCS usage. This study evaluated the prescription patterns of OCSs in patients with asthma.This is a retrospective multicenter observational study. We enrolled adult (≥18 years) patients with asthma who had been followed up by asthma specialists in 13 university hospitals for ≥3 years. Lung function tests, the number of asthma exacerbations, and prescription data, including the days of supply and OCS dosage, were collected. The clinical characteristics of OCS-dependent and exacerbation-prone asthmatic patients were evaluated.Of the 2,386 enrolled patients with asthma, 27.7% (n = 660) were OCS users (the median daily dose of OCS was 20 mg/day prednisolone equivalent to a median of 14 days/year). OCS users were more likely to be female, to be treated at higher asthma treatment steps, and to show poorer lung function and more frequent exacerbations in the previous year than non-OCS users. A total of 88.0% of OCS users were treated with OCS burst with a mean dose of 21.6 ± 10.2 mg per day prednisolone equivalent to 7.8 ± 3.2 days per event and 2.4 times per year. There were 2.1% (51/2,386) of patients with OCS-dependent asthma and 9.5% (227/2,386) with exacerbation-prone asthma. These asthma phenotypes were consistent over the 3 consecutive years in 47.1% of OCS-dependent asthmatic patients and 34.4% of exacerbation-prone asthmatic patients when assessed annually over the 3-year study period.We used real-world data from university hospitals in Korea to describe the OCS prescription patterns and relievers in asthma. Novel strategies are required to reduce the burden of OCS use in patients with asthma.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin D (VitD) is an immunomodulatory molecule capable of alleviating allergic symptoms. However, the effectiveness of allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) is not commonly evidenced in the early build-up phase. The aim of the study was to determine the potential of VitD supplementation in this treatment phase.Thirty-four house dust mite (HDM)-allergic adult patients treated with subcutaneous AIT were randomized to receive VitD2 60,000 IU/week or placebo for 10 weeks and followed up for 10 weeks. The primary endpoints were the symptom-medication score (SMS) and the treatment response rate. The secondary endpoints were eosinophil count and levels of plasma IL-10, Der p 2-specific IgG4, and dysfunctional regulatory T (CRTH2+ Treg) cells.Of 34 patients, 15 in each group completed the study. Patients with VitD deficiency receiving a VitD supplement showed significantly lower mean change SMS than the placebo group in weeks 10 (mean difference -54.54%, P = 0.007) and 20 (mean difference -42.69%, P = 0.04). The percentage of treatment responders reached 78% and 50% in the VitD and placebo groups, respectively, and the effect remained in week 20 (89% and 60%). No significant difference was observed for the tested immunological read-outs, with the exception of the frequency of CRTH2+ Treg cells, which was remarkably reduced in the VitD-treated patients. Moreover, improvement in SMS was correlated to the number of CRTH2+ Treg cells. Our in vitro experiment indicated that VitD downregulated activation markers, whereas it improved the function of CRTH2+ Treg cells.VitD supplementation in the build-up phase of AIT could relieve symptoms and decrease Treg cell dysfunction, especially in patients with VitD deficiency.",

We aimed to evaluate the associations between nasal colonization by S. aureus and eczema of multiple body sites, including persistent and ever-reported eczema. We further examined the associations between eczema and different subtypes of S. aureus, that is, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA).The real-world data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used. The associations were calculated using survey-weighted multinomial logistic regression models and further calculated in subgroups stratified by demographic factors.In total, 2,941 adults were included. The prevalence rate of S. aureus nasal carriage was significantly higher in adults with persistent hand eczema (51.0%) than in those with ever-reported hand eczema (23.3%) and never eczema (26.9%). S. aureus nasal colonization was associated with an approximately two-fold increased risk of persistent hand eczema (odds ratios ranges in different models: 2.86-3.06) without significant heterogeneity in the association by demographic factors. No significant associations between S. aureus nasal colonization and persistent eczema of other body sites or ever-reported eczema of multiple body sites (including hands) were observed. Furthermore, similar significant association between nasal colonization of MSSA and persistent hand eczema was seen; the association was much stronger (odds ratios ranges in different models: 4.64-6.54) for MRSA, although with borderline significant.Nasal colonization of S. aureus was associated with increased risk of persistent hand eczema. Our findings imply that preventive measures targeting S. aureus for the anterior nares should be considered in preventing and treating eczema.",

This study systematically evaluated the clinical symptoms, diagnostic characteristics, and treatment modalities of pediatric PCD in Korea.This Korean nationwide, multicenter study, conducted between January 2000 and August 2022, reviewed the medical records of pediatric patients diagnosed with PCD. Prospective studies have been added to determine whether additional genetic testing is warranted in some patients.Overall, 41 patients were diagnosed with PCD in 15 medical institutions. The mean age at diagnosis was 11.8 ± 5.4 years (range: 0.5 months-18.9 years). Most patients (40/41) were born full term, 15 (36.6%) had neonatal respiratory symptoms, and 12 (29.3%) had a history of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. The most common complaint (58.5%) was chronic nasal symptoms. Thirty-three patients were diagnosed with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and 12 patients by genetic studies. TEM mostly identified outer dynein arm defects (alone or combined with inner dynein arm defects, n = 17). The genes with the highest mutation rates were DNAH5 (3 cases) and DNAAF1 (3 cases). Rare genotypes (RPGR, HYDIN, NME5) were found as well. Chest computed tomography revealed bronchiectasis in 33 out of 41 patients. Among them, 15 patients had a PrImary CiliAry DyskinesiA Rule score of over 5 points.To our knowledge, this is the first multicenter study to report the clinical characteristics, diagnostic methods, and genotypes of PCD in Korea.

The current literature prompted the role of epigenetics in the development of allergic diseases. We sought to investigate the roles of regulatory T (Treg) cells and Forkhead box p3 (Foxp3) DNA methylation in the process of maternal transmission of allergic rhinitis (AR) susceptibility. BALB/c female mice (AR mother) were sensitized by intraperitoneal injection of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p) 1 on day 1 and 7. Then they mated with normal male mice on day 8. From day 21 to 28, the female mice were intranasal challenged with Der p 1 continuously. The normal controls were given with normal saline in the same way. On postnatal day 3, Female mice and their offspring were sacrificed to detect their histopathology in nasal mucosae, cytokines in sera of mother and spleen homogenates of offspring, Treg cells count, Foxp3 mRNA expressions, and Foxp3 DNA methylation levels in spleens. Compared with the normal controls, neonatal offspring of Der p 1-stimulated female mice (AR offspring) showed the elevation of interleukin (IL)-4 (P<0.01) and IL-17 (P<0.01), the submission of IL-10 (P<0.01) in spleen homogenates. Further, Treg cells count in AR offspring decreased remarkably compared with the normal offspring (P<0.01). Though the difference of Foxp3 DNA methylation level between AR offspring and normal control offspring was not obvious, correlation analysis demonstrated that there was significantly positive correlation between Foxp3 DNA methylation level of mother and that of offspring (r=0.803, P<0.01). Under the influence of Maternal AR, their neonatal offspring develop into T-helper type 2 (Th2) dominant immune state, which is closely associated with the recession of Treg cells. Foxp3 DNA methylation may be a mechanism responsible for that maternal effect but still need more studies to ensure.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE Little is known about the clinical course of chronic urticaria (CU) and predictors of its prognosis. We evaluated CU patient clusters based on medication scores during the initial 3 months of treatment in an attempt to investigate time to remission and relapse rates for CU and to identify predictors for CU remission. METHODS In total, 4,552 patients (57.9% female; mean age of 38.6 years) with CU were included in this retrospective cohort study. The K-medoids algorithm was used for clustering CU patients. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with Cox regression was applied to identify predictors of CU remission. RESULTS Four distinct clusters were identified: patients with consistently low disease activity (cluster 1, n = 1,786), with medium-to-low disease activity (cluster 2, n = 1,031), with consistently medium disease activity (cluster 3, n = 1,332), or with consistently high disease activity (cluster 4, n = 403). Mean age, treatment duration, peripheral neutrophil counts, total immunoglobulin E, and complements levels were significantly higher for cluster 4 than the other 3 clusters. Median times to remission were also different among the 4 clusters (2.1 vs. 3.3 vs. 6.4 vs. 9.4 years, respectively, P < 0.001). Sensitization to house dust mites (HDMs; at least class 3) and female sex were identified as significant predictors of CU remission. Around 20% of patients who achieved CU remission experienced relapse. CONCLUSIONS In this study, we identified 4 CU patient clusters by analyzing medication scores during the first 3 months of treatment and found that sensitization to HDMs and female sex can affect CU prognosis. The use of immunomodulators was implicated in the risk for CU relapse.",

We call these conditions asthma-associated infectious and inflammatory multimorbidities (AIMs). At present, little is known about why some people with asthma are at high-risk of AIMs, and others are not, to the extent to which controlling asthma reduces the risk of AIMs and which specific therapies mitigate the risk of AIMs. These questions represent a significant knowledge gap in asthma research and unmet needs in asthma care, because there are no guidelines addressing the identification and management of AIMs. This is a systematic review on the association of asthma with the risk of AIMs and a case study to highlight that 1) AIMs are relatively under-recognized conditions, but pose major health threats to people with asthma; 2) AIMs provide insights into immunological and clinical features of asthma as a systemic inflammatory disease beyond a solely chronic airway disease; and 3) it is time to recognize AIMs as a distinctive asthma phenotype in order to advance asthma research and improve asthma care. An improved understanding of AIMs and their underlying mechanisms will bring valuable and new perspectives improving the practice, research, and public health related to asthma.",

If cough persists longer than 8 weeks, common causes of chronic cough, such as upper airway cough syndrome, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), should be considered. Although not a common cause of chronic cough, achalasia may cause symptoms very similar to reflux that can lead to its misdiagnosis as GERD. In this report, a 40-year-old woman presenting with chronic cough was initially diagnosed with GERD; however, her symptoms were refractory to conventional GERD treatment. Finally, she was diagnosed with achalasia. Her cough improved completely after pneumatic dilatation. Achalasia is a rare disease accompanied by dysphagia or regurgitation. If cough presumably due to GERD does not respond to treatment, or if the cause of chronic cough is uncertain, physicians should suspect achalasia.",

Interpretation of skin prick test and serum food-specific IgE (sIgE) test results is influenced by detailed clinical history of an individual patient, but ingested foods which provoke adverse reactions often contain many ingredients and lead to a misdiagnosis of food allergy. Oral food challenge is recommended for the diagnosis of food allergy, but we cannot always perform oral food challenge for various reasons, including recent severe reactions to food, severe atopic dermatitis, patient' and/or parents' refusal and noncooperation of young patients. Thus, from the physician's point of view, cutoff values of sIgE titers that provide high positive and negative predictive values would be very useful in clinical settings because they help determine which patient is more likely to have symptoms in response to a certain food and which are probably nonreactive.",

    "abstract": "Sensitization to house dust mite (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus) is a considerable risk factor for the progression of allergic disease. The group 2 allergen from Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Der p 2, is considered a major one in patients with specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) to Der p 2. Der p 2 has structural homology with myeloid differentiation 2 (MD-2), which is involved in the lipopolysaccharide-binding component of the Toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathway and the development of inflammation. The aim of this study was to examine the genetic association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of MD-2 with Der p 2-sensitive allergy. We investigated associations between cohort's characteristics, including 280 allergic and 80 healthy subjects by examining total IgE, eosinophils, D. pteronyssinus-specific IgE, Der p 2-specific IgE, the number of IgE-producing B cells induced by Der p 2, and the odds ratio of allergic symptoms. Based on the 1,000 genome project data, the minor allele frequencies of the rs1809441 and rs1809442 are 0.467 and 0.474, respectively. However, the correlation of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between these 2 SNPs is D'=1, the genotype frequencies of the 2 MD-2 (LY96) SNPs (rs1809441 and rs1809442) that are located nearby were significantly different between allergic and health subjects: the TT genotype of rs1809441 and the GG genotype of rs1809442 were more frequent in allergic subjects than in healthy subjects (16.1% vs 2.5% in both genotypes). The allergic patients with these genotypes exhibited significantly higher levels of D. pteronyssinus-specific IgE and Der p 2-specific Ig E, and a larger number of Der p 2-activated B cells. In addition, these 2 SNPs in the MD-2 promoter region were significantly associated with the prevalence of nasal, skin, and asthmatic allergic symptoms. Our results indicated that 2 SNPs in the MD-2 promoter region were significantly associated with Der p 2-specific Ig E, and thereby suggest that these SNPs may play a major role in susceptibility to Der p 2-triggered immune responses in a Taiwanese population.",

    "abstract": "Jang and colleagues investigated the relationship between exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and atopy profiles in children with asthma.1 They focused their attention mainly on the FeNO, showing that this parameter varied according to the profile of atopy. The authors also investigated lung function, including bronchial hyperreactivity. However, forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and their ratio were considered as parameters for lung function test. On the other hand, great attention has been recently paid to the relevance in asthma pathogenesis of FEF25-75 values,2 a parameter considered to better reflect small airways than the gold standard parameters of airway obstruction, such as forced vital capacity and FEV1.2 This may be even more relevant in childhood.3 Indeed, in allergic children with asthma, impaired FEF25-75 values appear to be related to severe bronchial hyperreactivity,4 reversible airway obstruction;5 perception of breathlessness and of positive response to reversibility test, assessed by visual analogue scale.6,7\r\n\r\nSince impaired FEF25-75 values were reported to be significantly associated also with the presence of high fractional FeNO levels in children with allergic rhinitis and/or asthma,8 it is possible that this marker of small airway obstruction could be related also to the degree of allergic sensitization (and of systemic allergic inflammation).\r\n\r\nPreviously, it has been reported that children with asthma due to mite allergy showed a tightly link between allergen-specific serum IgE and markers of allergic inflammation, such as eosinophil and FeNO, but no correlations were detected with bronchial obstruction, expressed as FEV1 values.9 On the basis of these considerations, we evaluated a cohort of children with allergic asthma, sensitized to house dust mites, aiming at investigating possible relationship between lung function, mainly concerning FEF25-75, and inflammation parameters, such as blood eosinophilia, allergen-specific serum IgE, and FeNO. Fifty-six children, 5 to 12 years of age, were studied. Blood eosinophil number inversely and moderately related with FEF25-75 values (r=-0.52; P<0.0001), as reported in Figure A. Also the relative blood eosinophil numbers, expressed as percentage on total blood leukocytes count, significantly and negatively correlated with FEF25-75 values (r=-0.4; P=0.001) (Figure B). Serum levels of house dust mites specific IgE showed negative significant correlations with FEF25-75 values (r=-0.31; P=0.01), as reported in Figure C. Finally, a significant negative relationship was demonstrated between FeNO and FEF25-75 values (r=-0.33; P=0.01) (Figure D). In contrast, a significant negative correlation with FEV1 values was detected only for blood eosinophil numbers (r=-0.35; P=0.006). These findings further confirm the possibility to detect links between markers of allergic inflammation and airflow limitation and further support the importance of FEF25-75 assessment in the evaluation of childhood allergic asthma.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure\r\n\r\nRelationship between FEF25-75 values and different inflammatory/allergy markers: blood eosinophils (as absolute number, A; as relative number, B), serum IgE to house dust mites (C), and FeNO (D).",

    "abstract": "Although asthma treatment guidelines recommend regular inhaled medication, real-world treatment patterns and outcomes in South Korea have not been examined. We examined real-world treatment patterns and outcomes among patients treated for asthma in South Korea.This retrospective cohort study utilized data from the South Korean National Health Insurance database (2013-2016). Newly treated patients with asthma aged ≥18 years without history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were included. Initial and maintenance medication prescriptions were examined. Treatment discontinuation and switch were described. Asthma exacerbation rates, poor asthma control, and healthcare resource utilization (HRU) were compared between maintenance treatment groups (inhaled versus oral) using adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRR) and hazard ratios (aHR).Overall, 1,054,707 patients initiated any asthma medication; 37,868 patients initiated inhaled (n = 9,983, 26.4%) or oral (n = 27,885, 73.6%) maintenance medication. More patients initiating inhaled versus oral asthma medication discontinued treatment within 12 months (94.4% vs. 86.3%; P < 0.0001). Patients treated with inhaled and oral medication switched treatment (2.5% and 2.3%; P = 0.4160, respectively). Patients initiating inhaled medication had significantly lower rates of asthma exacerbation (aIRR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.39-0.69), lack of asthma control (aHR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.48-0.62; P < 0.0001), all-cause and asthma-related HRU versus oral medication.Despite current asthma guidelines, more patients in South Korea were prescribed oral than inhaled medications, resulting in suboptimal asthma management and increased HRU. This study highlights the need to reduce oral corticosteroid prescriptions for optimized treatment in asthma management.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of food allergy, triggered by T-helper type 2 (Th2) cell-mediated inflammation, is increasing worldwide. Interleukin (IL)-18 plays an important role in inflammatory diseases by binding with the IL-18 receptor. IL-18/IL-18 receptor α (IL-18Rα) is a cofactor for immunoglobulin E (IgE) production and Th2 cell development. Studies have not investigated the association between the IL-18/IL-18Rα signaling pathway and food allergy. Here, we investigated the role of IL-18Rα in food allergy induction and development.Wild-type (WT) and IL-18Rα-null mutant (IL-18Rα-/-) C57BL/6 mice were sensitized and challenged using ovalbumin (OVA) for food allergy induction. Food allergy symptoms, T cell-mediated immune responses, and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)/suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) pathways were analyzed in mice.IL-18Rα expression was increased in WT mouse intestines after OVA treatment. Food allergy-induced IL-18Rα-/- mice showed attenuated systemic food allergic reactions, OVA-specific IgE and mouse mast cell protease-1 production, inflammatory cell infiltration, and T cell activation. Ex vivo experiments showed that cell proliferation and Th2 cytokine production were lower in IL-18Rα-/- mouse splenocytes than in WT mouse splenocytes. IL-18Rα blockade in WT splenocytes attenuated cell proliferation and Th2 cytokine production. Moreover, STAT3 phosphorylation was reduced in IL-18Rα-/- mice, and SOCS3 and SOCS1 activation were diminished in IL-18Rα-/- intestinal T cells.IL-18Rα regulates allergic reactions and immune responses by regulating T cell responses in food allergies. Moreover, IL-18Rα is involved in the STAT/SOCS signaling pathways. Targeting IL-18Rα signaling might be a novel therapeutic strategy for food allergy.",

There was no significant association between genetic polymorphisms in ABCB1 and ATD-induced MPE (P>0.05).

    "abstract": "The major apple allergen Mal d 1 cross-reacts with the homologous birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 and causes immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated immediate-type allergic reactions. In some patients, delayed-type hypersensitivity to apples may develop within 72 hours without evidence of specific IgE or a positive skin prick test (SPT). The aim of the study was to evaluate the concomitance of delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions and immediate IgE-mediated reactions against high- and low-allergenic apple cultivars in patients with birch pollen allergy. Data were obtained from 45 adults with clinical symptoms of birch pollen allergy. Patients were exposed to apple pulp via atopy patch tests (APTs) and SPTs. Levels of IgE specific to Bet v 1 and Mal d 1 were measured with a radioallergosorbent test. Patients allergic to birch pollen showed the highest rate of positive SPT responses to Golden Delicious apples and the lowest rate to low-allergenic cultivar Grey French Reinette. Among these patients, 9% developed delayed hypersensitivity reactions to either Golden Delicious or Grey French Reinette apples; these reactions manifested clinically as erythema with papules (class ++). Fifty percent of APT-positive patients were concomitantly SPT-negative. Here, we show for the first time the clinical relevance of T cell-driven allergic reactions to apples. APTs may reveal type IV sensitization in patients who are negative for the corresponding type I sensitization tests. Thus, utilization of the APT procedure with fresh apple appears to be a valuable tool for the diagnosis of apple allergy and may improve the accuracy of food allergy diagnoses.",

    "abstract": "Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) was recently developed and is widely used in Europe. SLIT has been reported to be well-tolerated and effective for the treatment of allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma in children, adults, and elderly patients.1,2 Several systemic reviews indicate that the use of SLIT in patients with AR sensitive to house dust mites (HDMs) yielded significantly lower symptom scores and better clinical outcomes.3,4,5 Recent studies support the use of SLIT as the first-choice treatment for AR and asthma compared to medication and subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT).6 Nevertheless, conflicting results on the efficacy of SLIT in patients with AR sensitive to HDMs have appeared, and no consensus has yet been formed in terms of the basic treatment parameters (e.g., dose and duration) for HDMs-SLIT.7\r\n\r\nThis study published in this issue is the first investigation to observe the clinical outcomes of long-term SLIT in patients with AR sensitive to HDMs in Korea.8 Effective responses after 3 years' treatment in aspects of total symptom scores was 72%, similar to other studies.3,5,9 The HDM-SLIT for 2 years in 736 pediatric AR patients sensitive to HDM was found to be effective in 83.8% with decrease in rescue medication scores.9 A large retrospective study demonstrated that HDM-SLIT was effective or very effective with reduction in medication scores in 82% of 1,289 respiratory allergy patients after 2 years' treatment. Most patients were well tolerated and satisfied with their treatment.3 Another study randomized 509 adults with HDM-sensitive AR to administer 2 types of HDM sublingual tables, 500-index of reactivity (IR) and 300-IR, for 1 year showed that both tablets significantly reduced the mean symptom scores compared with placebo. The efficacy of both tablets was maintained during the treatment-free follow-up period.5 However, the present study in this issue is a single-center study and the number of study subjects was not large enough compared with previous investigations.3,5,9 The compliance was lower, which may be related with higher cost than other treatment modalities in Korea.8\r\n\r\nThe present study evaluated the effective response rate of HDM-SLIT from 6 months to 3 years.8 No significant differences were noted in the effective response rate between groups, even the effect of 6-month group tended to be higher than other groups. These results may be derived from high drop-out rate of the patients who experienced improvement in their symptoms after 6 months' treatment. The effective response was observed after 6 months' treatment in this study which was comparable with previous studies demonstrating that favorable effect of SLIT was observed from 14 to 24 weeks of treatment.5,10,11 SLIT roughly halved the clinical scores at the end of the first year, and the scores remained low over the second and third years of therapy.12 The reduction in the symptoms scores was more evident after 2 years of treatment, although improvement was observed from the first year of treatment with SCIT in HDM-sensitive childhood patients.13 To analyze the outcomes of the study subjects who had completed 3 years' treatment will enable to further validate the effective response of HDM-SLIT in AR patients in this country. Most studies suggest that the effective response can be persistent longer with longer duration of SLIT.14,15 These findings suggest that SLIT is recommend for more than 3 years to maintain the longer period of effective response.\r\n\r\nThe mean age of the patients in the present study was 19.1 years (range, 5-59 years) including adult and pediatric patients.8 SLIT is considered as an alternative to SCIT or pharmacotherapy for children with AR; however, the efficacy of SLIT in children with AR sensitive to HDMs remains controversial. Further analysis will be needed to compare the effective response of HDM-SLIT in child and adult groups separately, although the efficacy of HDM-SLIT between pediatric and adult patients after 1 year did not differ significantly between the groups.16\r\n\r\nLimitations of this study are the lack of a control group.8 The present study did not employ a double-blind placebo approach; thus, there was no medication-only or placebo control groups. Some AR patients may improve spontaneously without allergen immunotherapy. Furthermore, the follow-up improvement after stopping SLIT was not observed.\r\n\r\nThe major outcome parameters of SLIT are the medication and symptom scores. Also, immunologic parameters such as the changes of serum specific IgE and IgG4 antibodies can be measured, which were not done in the present study.8 However, these findings are still conflicting: SLIT lasting longer than 3 years in children monosensitized to HDMs was not associated with a significant change in serum specific IgE to HDMs,17 while SLIT-treated patients exhibited a significant decrease in serum specific IgE to HDMs with no significant changes in specific IgG1 and IgG4 antibodies.18 Further immunologic findings including the changes of T cells and basophils should be followed over the period of SLIT.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, most SLIT studies have shown benefits in AR patients sensitive to HDMs. However, they involved small numbers of patients and used variable doses of HDM allergens. The optimal dose and duration of SLIT remain unclear, because the density and quality of HDM allergens vary according to the manufacturer. Additional investigations are essential in order to recommend HDM-SLIT as a primary treatment modality for AR patients sensitive to HDMs.",

    "abstract": "The gold standard for the diagnosis of IgE-mediated food allergy is an oral food challenge (OFC) that directly verifies the causal relationship between clinical symptoms and offending foods.1 However, OFC carries a risk of developing fatal reactions (such as anaphylaxis) in some patients. A thorough history taking and supportive tests such as a skin prick test (SPT) or serum food-specific IgE (sIgE) levels have been used in clinical practices for the diagnosis of IgE-mediated food allergy. A SPT or serum test can be performed easily and safely in an outpatient clinic setting. However, clinicians must be cautious in interpretation due to the possibility of a false positive or false negative test results. SPT or serum tests also have limitations and cannot replace OFC for the diagnosis of food allergy.2\r\n\r\nComponent-resolved diagnostics (CRD) is a diagnostic test to detect specific IgE against individual allergen molecules or components using purified native or recombinant allergens.3 It is expected that CRD could provide further diagnostic information in patients with an IgE-mediated food allergy in terms of predicting clinical relevance or prognosis.\r\n\r\nThe level of specific IgE toward Ara h 2 was correlated with a clinical threshold in patients with a peanut allergy.4 In a study that compared patients with a peanut allergy from 3 countries (Spain, the United States, and Sweden), American patients frequently had IgE against Ara h 1 to 3 that often manifested with severe symptoms, while sensitization to Ara h 9 and Ara h 8 were primarily found in Spanish and Swedish patients, respectively.5 One study that included 37 adults presented the accuracy of a specific IgE antibody toward rPen a 1 for shrimp allergy.6 Yang et al reported that sIgE antibodies to shrimp tropomyosin is more useful than a skin prick test to predict clinically relevant reactions in patients with shrimp allergy.7 An Italian study of egg allergy showed that 94% of Gal d 1 negative patients tolerated boiled egg; however, 95% of Gal d 1 positive patients reacted to raw egg. This study suggests that sIgE against Gal d 1 appears to be a good predictor of egg allergy.8 There have been more studies to report the higher diagnostic value of food allergies such as wheat, soybean, and hazelnut allergies.9-11 Taken together, CRD could be used to predict clinical reactivity in subjects with a sensitization to foods and to establish sensitization patterns with prognostic outcomes.\r\n\r\nCow's milk allergy (CMA) is an adverse reaction to cow's milk protein that is either IgE-mediated or by non-IgE-mediated. Cow's milk proteins acting as allergens consist of casein and whey proteins. The casein fraction (Bos d 8) accounts for 80% of total protein, while 20% is contained in whey proteins such as β-lactalbumin (Bos d 4), β-lactoglobulin (Bos d 5), bovine serum albumin (Bos d 6), immunoglobulin (Bos d 7), and lactoferrin.12 The prevalence of CMA in Western countries ranges from 0.12% to 3.8%, and frequently occurs during infancy.13 CMA is the second most common food allergy in young Asian children13 and is also common in Korean infants with a prevalence of 1.7%.14 Consequently, the accuracy of diagnostic tests and prediction of prognosis in CMA is important.\r\n\r\nIn the present issue, Cingolani et al. presented the usefulness of CRD to determine the severity of cow's milk allergy.15 The authors compared the level of specific IgE against nBos d 4, nBos d 5, and nBos d 8 between the anaphylaxis group and non-anaphylaxis group in patients with CMA. They found the level of IgE to nBos d 8 can differentiate the high anaphylaxis-risk from milder-risk group. The results support the usefulness of CRD in food allergy; however, not all studies consistently show the predictive value of CRD. Ott et al, evaluated the commercially available allergen microarray assay using Bos d 4, 5, 6, and 8 in patients with CMA.16 They found that no single allergen was detected to discriminate between asymptomatic sensitization and clinically relevant allergy. With regard to peanut allergy, American patients frequently had sIgE against Ara h 1 to 3 and some tended to present with more severe symptoms.5 Ara h 2 seems to be a good predictor for peanut allergy; however, the outcome of the food challenge could be predicted with sIgE to Ara h 2 only in 50% of the patients.17 Tolerance to baked egg was not predicted by sIgE against ovomucoid.18 CRD is promising as a diagnostic tool in food allergy, but its diagnostic value is limited at this point.\r\n\r\nCRD is currently available for the diagnosis and management of food allergy; in addition, it is more important in the clinical investigation of IgE-mediated food allergy compared to conventional methods such as SPT or serum sIgE against whole proteins from allergenic foods. Recently, a number of studies have demonstrated the utility of CRD to predict the presence or severity of food allergy. CRD may be helpful to improve the specificity of current allergy testing; however, it is evident that more clinical studies to validate IgE reactivity are required.",

A polymorphism of the PTPN22 gene has been found to be associated with chronic urticaria (CU). We investigated the associations between PTPN22 gene polymorphisms and CU characteristics, including serum specific IgE antibodies response to toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) and staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA). CU patients (n=409) and normal healthy controls (n=388) were enrolled in the present study. Serum specific IgE to TSST-1 and SEA were measured by ImmunoCAP®. Five PTPN22 single nucleotide polymorphisms, -1123G>C, 1858C>T, 13145A>G, 14943C>T, and 20628A>G, were genotyped. There were no significant differences in genotype or haplotype frequencies of these polymorphisms between the 2 groups. CU patients carrying the GG genotype at 20628A>G (P=0.035) or haplotype 3 [GGG] (P=0.047) had a significantly higher prevalence of serum specific IgE to TSST-1 compared to non-carriers. Similarly, CT/TT genotype at 14943C>T had a significantly higher prevalence of serum specific IgE to SEA (P=0.045). The findings suggest that the PTPN22 gene polymorphisms at 20628A>G and 14943C>T may enhance serum specific IgE responses to TSST-1 and SEA, which may contribute to CU pathogenesis.",

Foxp3 + iNKT cells were also measured.To determine the effect of FlaB-treated dendritic cells (DCs) on iNKT cells, we co-cultured CD14 + monocyte-derived DCs and T cells from patients with house dust mite-sensitive asthma and analyzed intracellular cytokines in iNKT cells.Results: A reduction of IL-4 and IL-17 production by iNKT cells in PBMCs after FlaB treatment was alleviated following blocking of IL-10 signaling.A decrease in the frequencies of IL-4 + and IL-17 + iNKT cells by FlaB-treated DCs was reversed after blocking of IL-10 signaling.Simultaneously, an increase in Foxp3 + iNKT cells induced by FlaB treatment disappeared after blocking of IL-10.Conclusions: FlaB may inhibit Th2-and Th17-like iNKT cells and induce Foxp3 + iNKT cells by DCs via an IL-10-dependent mechanism in asthmatic patients.In patients with a specific asthma phenotype associated with iNKT cells, FlaB may be an effective immunomodulator for iNKT cell-targeted immunotherapy.",

We investigated the clinical responses of children with allergic rhinitis (AR) and nonallergic rhinitis (NAR) to nonallergenic irritants, and identified factors associated with these responses.Children with chronic rhinitis (n=208) were classified as having AR or NAR based on the presence of aeroallergen-specific IgE. Healthy controls (n=24) were recruited for comparison. The Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) guidelines were used to classify patients, and their irritant score (0-21 points) and current symptom score (5-35 points) were measured. Subjects with irritant scores ≥3 and <3 were classified as having irritant and nonirritant rhinitis, respectively.The mean age of enrolled subjects was 6.8 years (range: 1.8-16.0 years). The AR and NAR groups had similar irritant scores (P=0.394) and proportions of subjects with irritant scores ≥3 (P=0.105). Irritant score correlated positively with symptom score (P=0.005), and the proportion of subjects with irritant scores ≥3 was greater in children with moderate-severe rhinitis than in those with mild rhinitis (P=0.046). Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that the presence of atopic eczema increased the risk for sensitivity to a nonallergenic irritant (aOR=2.928, 95% CI 1.567-5.473, P=0.001).Response to a nonallergenic irritant was useful for gauging the severity of rhinitis, but not for differentiating AR from NAR.

Coagulation factors and conventional coagulation assays were also analyzed.Results: Although patients with chronic urticaria showed prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time did not differ significantly between patients and controls.In both 1 pM and 5 pM TF-stimulated TGA, peak thrombin and endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) levels were markedly decreased in patients with chronic urticaria.As expected, intrinsic coagulation factors (VIII, IX, and XII), as well as coagulation factors of the common pathway (II, V, and X), were consistently decreased.Additionally, D-dimer was significantly increased in patients as compared to controls.In multivariate regression analysis, the presence of chronic urticaria was the only significant independent contributor to the low ETP value.Conclusions: Chronic urticaria is characterized by in vivo coagulation activation through the intrinsic coagulation pathway, which can be measured with sensitivity using TGA.",

    "abstract": "The elderly are not merely 'more aged' people just as children are not 'little' adults. This may hold true particularly when we discuss asthma. Along with the rapid aging of global populations, the burden of elderly asthma is expected to rise dramatically in the near future.1 Recent research highlights of elderly asthmatics reflect emerging significance. However, one thing that comes to us more clearly is that asthma in the elderly is more heterogeneous and complex than previously thought. A considerable proportion of elderly asthmatics are considered to have late-onset disease with distinct pathophysiology, being less associated with genetic factors but more related to comorbidities, occupations, or environment. Moreover, in the context of real-world practice, poor adherence resulting from the lack of socio-familial support or multiple comorbidity poses significant challenges in managing elderly asthmatics.2\r\n\r\nRecently, several major guidelines for asthma have been updated. However, only a few or no descriptions have still been made for elderly patients, which may reflect the lack of available evidence obtained from them.2 Indeed, being elderly has been one of the major exclusion criteria for many asthma clinical trials. Thus, we may not be sure whether the recommendations from current guidelines can be translated directly to elderly patients.\r\n\r\nIn this issue of the AAIR journal, Ye et al.3 have provided a very good news on the treatment strategy to be applied in elderly patients with asthma. In their 12-week randomized, open-labelled, parallel-designed, non-inferiority trial involving 140 elderly patients (60-75 years), the addition of montelukast to low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (MON-400BUD group) had comparable efficacy to that of medium-dose ICS (800BUD group) in elderly patients with mild asthma. In addition, the MON-400BUD group had less frequent asthma exacerbation (9 vs 20, P=0.036) and showed a reduced frequency of sore throat compared to the 800BUD group (11 vs 22, P=0.045).\r\n\r\nThe novelty of their study is that this is the first randomized trial to extend earlier findings4,5,6 from adult patients into elderly ones, showing that a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) as add-on to ICS is superior to constant-dose ICS monotherapy in improving clinical outcomes of asthma. In that trial,3 LTRA add-on therapy (MON-400BUD) increased the rate of well-controlled asthma from 2.9% at baseline to 36.9% at 12 weeks. Moreover, the efficacy of LTRA add-on therapy was not inferior, or better in a few outcomes, compared to doubling ICS strategy (800BUD). Thus, that paper would serve as reference to validate the role of LTRA add-on therapy in elderly patients with mild asthma who remain inadequately controlled by ICS monotherapy.\r\n\r\nAnother reason this work of Ye et al.3 is intriguing is that there have previously been rather negative data on LTRA in elderly patients. In the Accolate Clinical Evidence and Pharmacoepidemiology Trial (ACCEPT), which was the large-scale open-labelled trial for 4 weeks involving more than 3,700 asthmatics across various age groups, the addition of zafirlukast 20 mg twice daily improved several outcomes of asthma across the age groups; however, the clinical effect was less remarkable in the elderly compared to younger counterparts.7 This finding was not conclusive because the trial had limitations such as short duration, lack of control arm, insufficient number of elderly patients (8.5%), and more severe asthma in the elderly group.7 In a retrospective analysis of 5 randomized double-blind trials comparing fluticasone to zafirlukast as monotherapy, zafirlukast resulted in small improvement in asthma symptoms but minimal improvement in lung functions, and moreover more exacerbations in asthma patients older than 50 years.8 In a pilot study on sputum leukotriene (LT) levels, older asthmatics (n=6; mean age, 64 years) showed comparable eosinophils but much less LTB4 and cys-LT levels in induced sputum, compared to young asthmatics (n=12; mean age, 27 years).9 In this regard, the randomized trial of Ye et al.3 tackles the previous concept that LTRA may be less effective in elderly patients. This conclusion is supported by a recent 24-month long-term clinical observation study that LTRA as add-on to ICS improved clinical outcomes in elderly patients with severe asthma.10\r\n\r\nParticular implication of their trial3 may be that LTRA may be potentially a preferred option in the real-world practice of elderly asthmatics. LTRA has generally shown a good safety profile11 and better adherence rates in recent pragmatic trials (65% vs 41% compared to ICS as the first-line controller; and 74% vs 46% compared to long-acting beta2-agonist [LABA] as the add-on therapy).12 Adherence is a part of treatment effect, and would be more important in elderly patients.\r\n\r\nElderly patients have usually multiple comorbid conditions, affecting more than 3 organs/systems.13 They are also prone to have poor inhaler technique and adherence combined with lack of caregivers, cognitive impairment, and low health literacy,2 which lead to asthma exacerbation and poor control. For these reasons, it is difficult to conduct perfect clinical trials on elderly patients, and clinical values from conventional efficacy trials are limited in terms of external validity in the elderly. This is why we need pragmatic trials for elderly patients.\r\n\r\nFinally, further important questions may include: will the effectiveness of LTRA be similar to that of ICS as initial monotherapy in elderly patients?; will LTRA be equivalent to LABA as add-on therapy in elderly patients receiving ICS?; which subgroups of elderly patients will get more clinical benefit from LTRA? We look forward to forthcoming clinical trials to provide us better therapeutic strategies for elderly asthmatics.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE Data on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) hypersensitivity in Southeast Asia are scarce. Increased urinary leukotriene E4 (uLTE4) levels have been suggested as a biomarker of NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease (NERD). This study investigated clinical patterns of NSAID sensitivity in Thailand and the diagnostic roles of uLTE4 measurement in various phenotypes. METHODS The clinical phenotypes in 92 Thai adults with cross-reactive NSAID hypersensitivity were characterized based on the clinical history and drug provocation. The uLTE4 levels were measured at baseline, after aspirin provocation and after desensitization. RESULTS More than half of the patients (56.5%) presented with cutaneous symptoms (NSAID-exacerbated cutaneous disease), while one-third (33.7%) developed symptoms in at least 2 systems (NSAID-induced blended reactions; NIBR). Fifty-two patients underwent drug provocation and 59.6% of them yielded positive results. After drug provocation, a significant number of patients with confirmed NSAID cross-reactivity experienced clinical symptoms in more than one organ system. The uLTE4 levels at baseline were comparable between the NSAID-tolerant and NSAID-sensitive groups, but were substantially increased after aspirin provocation predominantly in NERD (983.4 pg/mg creatinine) and NIBR (501.0 pg/mg creatinine) compared to NSAID-tolerant subjects (122.1 pg/mg creatinine, P < 0.01 and 0.05, respectively). The uLTE4 levels were elevated after aspirin desensitization, although nasal polyposis and asthma were under control in 3 NERD and 3 NIBR subjects. CONCLUSIONS NIBR is not uncommon among NSAID-sensitive patients in Thailand. The diagnostic value of basal uLTE4 levels was limited, but increased uLTE4 levels upon aspirin provocation suggest NSAID cross-reactivity with respiratory components. This study indicates that aspirin desensitization, if necessary, might be effective in both NERD and NIBR. TRIAL REGISTRATION ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03849625.",

In younger patients, low Treg suppression was associated with significantly higher mean numbers of emergency department (ED) (1.8 vs. 0.17, P = 0.02) and urgent care visits (2.3 vs. 0.17, P = 0.01) for asthma, and decreased asthma control (mean Asthma Control Test [ACT] score, 17 vs. 21.3, P = 0.01) compared to those with high Treg suppression. In older patients, however, a lower Treg function was not significantly associated with ACT scores (18.2 vs. 13.4, P = 0.10), or the number of ED (P = 0.9) or urgent care visits (P = 0.2). Our data suggest that Tregs have a weak relationship with asthma control and clinical asthma outcomes in older patients and differ from findings in younger patients, where Tregs are more likely to play a protective role.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE Serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) has recently emerged as a critical regulator of inflammatory diseases. In this study, we examined SGK1 expression and its possible pathogenic roles in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). METHODS Immunohistochemistry, western blotting, Bio-Plex assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were performed to assess protein and gene expression levels. The mRNA expression levels of SGK1 and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were extracted from a CRS database to perform correlation analysis. Stable cell lines with SGK1 overexpression (16HBE) and knockdown (A549) were constructed to investigate the interaction between SGK1 and IL-6 in vitro. RESULTS SGK1 exhibited strong cytoplasmic and nuclear staining in the epithelial layers and the lamina propria of nasal polyps (NPs) and in the mucosal tissues of CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP). The mRNA and protein expression levels of SGK1 and IL-6 were significantly increased in NPs and CRSsNP tissues, compared to control tissues. SGK1 phosphorylation was significantly greater in NPs than in CRSsNP tissues (P < 0.01). The mRNA levels of SGK1 and IL-6 were significantly correlated (P < 0.001, r = 0.649). Exposure to IL-6 significantly increased SGK1 expression in cultured dispersed NP cells, 16HBE cells, and A549 cells. IL-6 expression was significantly down-regulated in SGK1-overexpressing 16HBE cells (P < 0.01) and significantly up-regulated in SGK1-knockdown A549 cells (P < 0.05). Administration of GSK650394, a SGK1 inhibitor, significantly increased IL-6 self-induced mRNA expression in cultured dispersed NP cells and 16HBE cells. CONCLUSIONS The interaction between SGK1 and IL-6 may play an anti-inflammatory role in IL-6-induced inflammation in the pathogenesis of CRS.",

    "abstract": "Short-acting β2-agonist (SABA) use is known to be lower in Korean patients with asthma than in those from other countries, while the rate of asthma exacerbations in Korea is higher than in other countries. Thus, an epidemiologic study on SABA use and the relationship between SABA overuse and treatment outcomes in asthma is needed in Korea. We performed a cross-sectional study using the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort 2002-2012 database. We evaluated the trend of annual SABA use and overuse (prescription of 3 or more SABA canisters/year) and the impact of SABA overuse on mortality. During the study period, the proportion of asthmatic patients who used SABA was approximately 8%-11%, with no significant change in trend. The mean annual SABA use in asthmatic patients was 0.15-0.22 canisters/patient/year and 1.93-2.05 canisters/patient/year in those who used SABA in 12 months. SABA overuse was observed in about 2%-4% of asthmatic patients during the study period. SABA overuse generally tended to increase as the age of patients increased, with triple peaks in the late 20s (3.3%), late 40s (3.1%), and late 70s (3.6%). SABA overuse was associated with mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.61-1.84). The rate of SABA use was very low in Korean asthmatic patients between 2002-2012. SABA overuse was found in 2%-4% of patients in Korea. SABA overuse was associated with an increased risk of mortality.",

    "abstract": "Recently there have been a number of reports that vitamin D plays a role in the pathogenesis of many diseases including atopic dermatitis (AD).1,2 Considering the purported immunologic mechanisms that contribute to AD, it is possible that vitamin D may influence this disorder through its immunomodulatory properties.3,4 It was well known the active form of vitamin D [1,25(OH)2 D3] enhanced expression of antibacterial peptides, and prevented skin infections. Some studies demonstrated a link between vitamin D-mediated activation of Toll-like receptors, the production of cathelicidin, and diminished sensitivity to bacterial infections.5,6 In addition, vitamin D stimulates protein synthesis, such as filaggrin, that is necessary for stratum corneum barrier formation. Therefore, vitamin D deficiency might exacerbate AD via disturbed epidermal barrier function and immunologic dysregulation, with subsequent impaired defense against infections. Clinical observations indicate that the disease usually worsens in winter season as a result of less exposure to solar radiation. Epidemiologic investigations have shown a higher prevalence of AD in countries with higher geographic latitude.7,8 This is consistent with other observations that inhabitants of urban countries at high latitudes often have low vitamin D levels. Javanbakht et al revealed that additional factors, besides geographic locations, may influence vitamin D level in patients with AD.9\r\n\r\nLee's study in this issue found an inverse correlation between serum concentration of vitamin D and severity of the disease expressed by SCORAD index in children with AD associated with food allergy.10 The result from this study also did not prove such a correlation in SCORAD index and any of its parameters and it could be explained by the influence of other environmental factors on the course of the disease. Perhaps other extrinsic factors, such as sweat or clothing, can irritate and exacerbate skin inflammation in a setting of low vitamin D levels. The deficiency of vitamin D is responsible for the most intensive skin lesions localized on body regions not exposed to sun. Vitamin D is poorly produced by cloth-covered skin, which suggests a possible local beneficial effect of vitamin D generated in the skin to protect against the development of AD lesions.\r\n\r\nFurthermore significantly higher rates of food allergy in children born autumn/winter compared to spring and summer suggest a relationship between relative food allergy rates and monthly UV irradiation. Mullins et al. hypothesized that UV light exposure and vitamin D status may be one of many potential factors contributing food allergies in childhood.10 Multiple reports suggested which the lack of vitamin D impairs the epithelial barrier integrity leading to increased and inappropriate mucosal exposure to food antigens. Thereby vitamin D deficiency would also promote a pro-sensitization immune imbalance that compromises immunologic tolerance. The authors hypothesized that early correction of vitamin D deficiency might promote mucosal defense, maintain a healthy microbial barrier and food allergen tolerance in children.11,12\r\n\r\nThe fact that vitamin D stimulates keratinocytes to produce antimicrobial peptides may explain why skin infections may occur more often during the winter season. 3-week supplementation with 1,000 IU/day vitamin D resulted in an increased expression of cathelicidin belonging to antimicrobial peptides family. These observed improvement of SCORAD index, with a decrease in mean index for lichenification and pruritus, and reduction of AD severity.13 Possibly, it demonstrates a regulatory effect of vitamin D on the immune response. Vitamin D stimulates production of antimicrobial peptides in the epidermis and, in turn, reduces skin colonization by Staphylococcus aureus.14\r\n\r\nVitamin D has become the subject of intensive research as an immune regulator both of the innate and adaptive immune system.15,16 Interestingly, vitamin D affects different aspects of innate immunity. On the one hand, vitamin D decreases the expression of immune receptors and co-stimulatory molecules inhibiting dendritic cell activation by LPS. Furthermore cytokine secretion declines and leads to reduced antigen presentation. On the other hand, vitamin D helps to defend opportunistic infections by inducing autophagy in human macrophages and to support the innate skin barrier by stimulating endogenous AMP expression in resident epithelial cells of the skin and lung. As a consequence, vitamin D decreases pro-inflammatory cytokine released from T cells. Therefore Vitamin D inhibits T cell proliferation through decreased Th1 cytokine secretion. Vitamin D suppresses adaptive immunity by inhibition of antigen presenting cells. B-cell proliferation and immunoglobulin production can be inhibited by vitamin D. Vitamin D also effects B lymphocyte functions and modulates the humoral immune response including secretion of immunoglobulin E (IgE).\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it was suggested that supplementation of vitamin D might improve barrier function and thus inflammation in AD. Vitamin D plays an important role in antimicrobial cutaneous immunity when identifying a vitamin D response element in the promoter region of the cathelicidin gene. Multiple elements in the molecular mechanisms of vitamin D mediated cathelicidin expression have been characterized. Thus, a direct connection between vitamin D metabolism and cutaneous innate defense function was established. Thus, elevating vitamin D levels in the serum may help to strengthen the innate cutaneous and mucous defense barriers to prevent cutaneous infections which could serve as cofactors for allergic sensitization as well as to maintain food allergen tolerance as Lee's study suggested.",

We aimed to determine the effects of a topical anesthetic patch containing prilocaine-lidocaine on wheal size of IDT with drugs. Patients who had positive IDT as part of their investigation process of suspected drug hypersensitivity were selected. IDT were performed according to guidelines. Anesthetic patch (AP) was placed and the same prior positive IDT, as well as positive histamine skin prick test (SPT) and negative (saline IDT) controls, were performed in the anesthetized area. Patients with negative IDT were also included to check for false positives with AP. Increase in wheals after 20 minutes both with and without AP was recorded and compared. 45 IDT were performed (36 patients), of which 37 have been previously positive (14 antibiotics, 10 general anesthetics, 6 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 3 iodinated contrasts, 3 anti-Hi-histamines and 1 ranitidine). Mean histamine SPT size without the AP was 4.7 mm [95%CI (4.4-5.1]), and 4.6 mm [95%CI(4.2-5.0)] with anesthesia. Mean wheal increase in IDT for drugs without the anesthesia was 4.5 mm [95%CI(3.3-5.7)] and with anesthesia was 4.3 mm [95%CI(2.8-5.8)]. No statistical significant differences were observed between skin tests with or without AP for histamine SPT (P=0.089), IDT with saline (P=0.750), and IDT with drugs (P=0.995). None of the patients with negative IDT showed positivity with the AP, or vice-versa. The use of an AP containing prilocaine-lidocaine does not interfere with IDT to diagnose drug allergy, and no false positive tests were found.",

To compare IgE binding to Der p 2 variants between sera from Bangkok, Thailand and Perth, Western Australia with different variants and to determine the variant-specificity of antibodies induced by vaccination with recombinant variants.The structures of recombinant variants produced in yeast were compared by circular dichroism and 1-anilinonaphthalene 8-sulfonic acid staining of their lipid-binding cavity. Sera from subjects in Bangkok and Perth where different variants are found were compared by the affinity (IC₅₀) of IgE cross-reactivity to different variants and by direct IgE binding. Mice were immunized with the variants Der p 2.0101 and Der p 2.0110, and their IgG binding to Der p 2.0103, 2.0104, and 2.0109 was measured.The secondary structures of the recombinant variants resembled the natural allergen but with differences in ANS binding. The IC₅₀ of Der p 2.0101 required 7-fold higher concentrations to inhibit IgE binding to the high-IgE-binding Der p 2.0104 than for homologous inhibition in sera from Bangkok where it is absent, while in sera from Perth that have both variants the IC₅₀ was the same and low. Reciprocal results were obtained for Der p 2.0110 not found in Perth. Direct binding revealed that Der p 2.0104 was best for detecting IgE in both regions, followed by Der p 2.0101 with binding to other variants showing larger differences. Mouse anti-Der p 2.0101 antibodies had a high affinity of cross-reactivity but bound poorly to other variants.The affinity of IgE antibody cross-reactivity, the direct IgE binding, and the specificities of antibodies induced by vaccination show that measures of allergic sensitization and therapeutic strategies could be optimized with knowledge of Der p 2 variants.",

Asthma becomes one of the major public health problems, and more than 330 million people worldwide have asthma. Asthmatics have an exaggerated response to allergens, which leads to the activation of both innate and acquired immune systems. From an immunological point of view, asthma is mediated by hyperactivation of Th2 cells, IgE production, and eosinophilia.1 Besides secretion of conventional Th2 cytokines, oxidative stress contributes to the development of asthma. For example, reduced intake of antioxidants, such as vitamin E, vitamin D, selenium, zinc, and PUFA has been invoked to explain the increase of asthma prevalence in Western countries.2,3 Airway inflammatory cells, such as macrophages, eosinophils, and neutrophils, from patients with asthma release increased quantities of reactive oxygen species compared to health subsets.4 The excessive quantities of reactive oxygen result in various pathophysiologic features of asthma, including airway smooth muscle contraction, airway hyperreactivity (AHR), mucus hypersecretion, epithelial shedding, and vascular exudation.2 In addition, ROS stimulates airway inflammation by activating redox-sensitive transcription factors, such as NF-κB, JAK-STAT, and Raf-1.2 Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that oxidative stress can exacerbate asthma symptoms, while antioxidant supplements may reduce them.",

The urinary levels of mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), mono-2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl phthalate (MECPP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate, and mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP) were measured by using high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, and mast cell releasability was determined after phthalate treatment. The levels of phthalate metabolites, especially di-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), are significantly increased in the urine of patients with urticaria compared to the healthy controls. The release of β-hexosaminidase in human mast cells is more significantly increased by MnBP, mono-benzyl phthalate, MEHHP, and MECPP compared to the negative controls; interestingly, the highest secretion of β-hexosaminidase is observed after the lowest stimulation of MECPP. Phthalates, including DEHP, may act as aggravating factors for chronic spontaneous urticaria and can be used as potential therapeutic targets in future studies.",

Cluster 3 (n = 65 [27.0%]) showed high type 2 inflammation and intermediate BHR. However, the severity of nasal symptoms and asthma comorbidity in this cluster were comparable with those in cluster 2. Cluster 4 (n = 30 [12.4%]) revealed high type 2 inflammation and BHR with potential functional airway impairment.

ASWE, HDME and PPE increased proportions of NK1R+ cells in CCR3+ PBMC and CD123+HLA-DR- granulocytes of AR patients. OVA, Der p1, IL-33, IL-37, IgE and SP enhanced NK1R expression on KU812 cells. NK1R expressing basophils were increased in blood of OVA sensitized and challenged AR and AA mice. FcεRI-KO AA mice seemed to have less NK1R+ basophils than WT AA mice in their blood.CCR3+ and CD123+HLA-DR- cells are likely involved in AA and AR via SP and NK1R. IgE-related mechanism may participate in upregulation of NK1R expression.",

    "abstract": "Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated egg allergy presents as one of the most common food allergies. The level of specific IgE (sIgE) antibody is widely used as an important in vitro diagnostic indicator. However, sIgE antibody levels are often inconsistent with the clinical manifestations of patients. The heterogeneity of egg-specific IgE idiotypes (sIgE-IDs) may help reflect clinical egg allergy severity. Eight peptides were synthesized, corresponding to the linear epitopes of ovomucoid (OVM). The sIgE-IDs of egg-allergic patients were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Fresh peripheral blood was collected from patients with different heterogeneity strength of sIgE-ID, and egg extract was used as a stimulus to the basophil activation test (BAT). RBL-2H3 cells were sensitized with serum with different strength of sIgE-ID heterogeneity and the release rate of β-hexosaminidase was calculated. Among 75 patients with egg allergy, 24% had sIgE for all epitopes and 85% had sIgE for at least one epitope. Analysis of individual patients revealed differences in epitope recognition patterns among the patients, that is, heterogeneity in sIgE-ID. More importantly, the number of IgE-positive peptides had a strong correlation with allergic symptoms in egg-allergic patients (r = 0.706). BAT and RBL-2H3 cell degranulation confirmed that higher sIgE-ID heterogeneity strength was more effective in inducing effector cell responses. Our results suggest that the greater the heterogeneity strength of OVM-sIgE-ID, the more severe the allergic symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Clavulanate, a beta-lactam associated with amoxicillin, is frequently prescribed in patients at all ages. Recent data implicate amoxicillin-clavulanate in up to 80% of beta-lactam allergy cases. We assessed clavulanate's role in inducing allergic reactions to this combination treatment, with a focus on selective immediate reactions.Adults (≥ 16 years) reporting a history of immediate reactions to amoxicillin-clavulanate were evaluated through a beta-lactam allergological workup, using modified European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology guidelines. Patients first underwent skin testing, and if negative, drug provocation tests. Expected outcomes were: Group A, subjects with immediate reaction to classical penicillin group determinants (penicilloyl polylysine, minor determinants mixture, and/or penicillin G); Group B, subjects with selective immediate reaction to amoxicillin; Group C, subjects with selective immediate reaction to clavulanate and Group D, those immediate reactions with co-sensitization to clavulanate plus penicillin group determinants or amoxicillin.Of 1,170 included patients, 104 had immediate reactions: 36.5% to penicillin group determinants (Group A), 26.9% to amoxicillin (Group B), 32.7% to clavulanate (Group C), and 3.8% to clavulanate plus penicillin determinants or amoxicillin (Group D). Diagnosis was made by skin testing in 79%, 75% and 47% of the patients, respectively, in the first 3 groups (P < 0.001). Drug provocation tests were necessary to establish most other diagnoses. Anaphylaxis predominated over urticaria/angioedema in all groups.Selective immediate reactions to clavulanate accounted for over a third of cases with confirmed reactions after amoxicillin-clavulanate intake, with more than half experiencing anaphylaxis. Within this group, skin test sensitivity was below 50%. People taking amoxicillin-clavulanate may also be co-sensitized to both drugs.",

    "abstract": "Increased evidence has shown that aerobic exercise reduces airway hyperresponsiveness in asthmatic individuals. However, the underlying mechanisms of action remain elusive. This study aimed to investigate the effect of exercise on airway smooth muscle (ASM) contractile function in asthmatic rats, and uncover the possible involvement of interleukin 4 (IL-4) and the store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) pathway.In this study, chicken ovalbumin was used to induce asthma in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The exercise group received moderate-intensity aerobic exercise training for 4 weeks. IL-4 concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were evaluated by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The contractile function of the ASM was investigated using tracheal ring tension experiments and intracellular Ca2+ imaging techniques. Western blot analysis was used to evaluate expression levels of calcium-release activated calcium (CRAC) channel protein (Orai) and stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) in ASM.Our data showed that the carbachol-stimulated, SOCE-mediated contraction of rat ASM was significantly increased in asthmatic rats, which could be abolished by exercise. Pharmacological studies revealed that GSK5498A and BTP-2, selective blockers of CRAC channels significantly inhibited SOCE-induced ASM contraction. In addition, exercise inhibited the up-regulation of IL-4 in BALF as well as STIM1 and Orai expression in the ASM of asthmatic rats. In line with these observations, we demonstrated that pretreatment of the ASM with IL-4 up-regulated the expression level of STIM1, Orai1 and Orai2, thereby promoting SOCE-mediated ASM contraction.The data in this study reveal that aerobic exercise may improve the ASM contractile function in asthmatic rats by inhibiting IL-4 secretion and by down-regulating the expression of STIM1, Orai1 and Orai2, thus decreasing excessive SOCE-mediated ASM contraction in asthmatic rats.",

However, respiratory infection is a common presenting feature of IGGSCD, and respiratory complications are responsible for subsequent morbidities, such as severe asthma, bronchiectasis, chronic obstructive airway diseases, and mortality. This review summarizes the current epidemiological data for PIDs, focusing on IGGSCD in the adult population. In addition, the investigation, treatment, and management strategies are detailed, including distinct issues faced by patients with chronic airway disease and their physicians in the proper diagnosis and treatment of IGGSCD.",

    "abstract": "A US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug methacholine chloride (Provocholine®) was recently introduced to Korea where it is now widely used in clinical practice. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence, risk factors and cutoff value of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to Provocholine in 7-year-old children. Six hundred and thirty-three children from the Panel Study on Korean Children who visited 16 regional hospitals were evaluated. Skin prick tests, spirometry and bronchial provocation tests for Provocholine as well as a detailed history and physical examinations were performed. The bronchial provocation test was reliably performed on 559 of these children. The prevalence of ever-diagnosed asthma via medical records was 7.7%, and that of current asthma (wheezy episode in the last 12 months + diagnosed asthma by physicians) was 3.2%. The prevalence of BHR to Provocholine was 17.2% and 25.8%, respectively, for a PC20 < 8 and < 16 mg/mL. The risk factors for BHR (PC20 < 16 mg/mL) were atopic dermatitis diagnosis and current dog ownership, whereas those for current asthma were allergy rhinitis diagnosis, a history of bronchiolitis before the age of 3, recent use of analgesics/antipyretics and maternal history of asthma. The BHR prevalence trend showed an increase along with the increased immunoglobulin E (IgE) quartile. The cutoff value of PC20 for the diagnosis of current asthma in children at age 7 was 5.8 mg/mL (sensitivity: 47.1%, specificity: 87.4%). BHR to Provocholine (PC20 < 8 mg/mL) was observed in 17.2% of 7-year-olds children from the general population and the cutoff value of PC20 for the diagnosis of current asthma was 5.8 mg/mL in this age group. The risk factors for BHR and current asthma showed discrepancies suggesting different underlying mechanisms. Bronchial provocation testing with Provocholine will be a useful clinical tool in the future.",

The study was conducted to compare the pattern of bronchial response in 200 HMWA-induced asthmatics (n = 130) and LMWA-induced asthmatics (n = 70).The study participants underwent a single-blind, placebo-controlled specific inhalation challenge (SIC) with workplace allergens, accompanied by evaluation of non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness (NSBHR) with methacholine before and after the SIC.A single early bronchial response more frequently occurred in HMWA-induced asthmatics than in LMWA-induced asthmatics (86.2% vs. 20%). An isolated late bronchial response or atypical patterns were more frequently observed in LMWA-induced asthmatics than in LMWA-induced asthmatics (45.7% vs. 3.8% or 34.3% vs. 10%, respectively). Baseline NSBHR before SIC was more often detected in LMWA-induced asthmatics than in HMWA-induced asthmatics (81.4% vs. 54.6%), and the median value of the provocation concentration of methacholine was relevantly lower in these patients before and after SIC. A significant 3-fold increase in NSBHR after SIC was observed more often in LMWA-induced asthmatics than in HMWA-induced asthmatics (82.8% vs. 66.1%). In addition, compared to LMWA-induced asthmatics, HMWA-induced asthmatics were older, were more frequently active smokers, showed lower level of NSBHR, and more frequently continued their work in harmful occupational exposure.The results of this study suggest that HMWA-induced asthmatics may have milder clinical courses and that there is a possibility of job continuation despite asthma exacerbation requiring medical surveillance.",

    "abstract": "Humidifier disinfectants (HDs) exposure has now been associated with acute lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis; polyhexamethylene guanidine (PHMG) has been confirmed to cause severe lung inflammation and fibrosis in mice. Recent evidence also indicates that HDs exposure increases the asthma risk in children, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We aimed to investigate the effects of PHMG exposure on asthma in mice and the potential underlying mechanisms. BALB/c mice were intranasally administered PHMG (0.1 mg/kg/day; 5 days per week) during 2 episodes of ovalbumin (OVA) sensitization and were then challenged with 1% OVA by inhalation. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), inflammatory cell influx into bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, serum total and OVA-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) E levels, and histopathological changes in the lung were analyzed. The levels of asthma-related cytokines and chemokines were assayed in the lung tissues to evaluate possible mechanisms. Exposure to PHMG following OVA sensitization and challenge significantly enhanced BHR, inflammatory cell counts in BAL fluid, airway inflammation, and total serum IgE levels in the asthma mouse model. In addition, the levels of chemokine ligand (CCL) 11 and serpine F1/pigment epithelium-derived factor (SERPINF1) were significantly elevated in the lungs of these mice compared to those in the control and OVA-treated only groups. Our findings suggest that PHMG can enhance the development of allergic responses and lung inflammation via CCL11- and SERPINF1-induced signaling in a mouse model of asthma.",

    "abstract": "Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) represent the most powerful approach for identifying genes that influence asthma, to date, no studies have established genetic susceptibility to asthma in the Korean population. This study aimed to identify genetic variants associated with adult Korean asthmatics and compare them with the significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of UK asthmatics from the UK Biobank.Patients were defined as having asthma if they were diagnosed by a doctor or taking medications for asthma. Controls were defined as individuals without asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We performed quality control, genotype imputation, GWAS, and PrediXcan analyses. In the GWAS, a P value of < 5 × 10-8 was considered significant. We compared significant SNPs between Korean and UK patients with asthma.A total of 1,386 asthmatic patients and 5,205 controls were analyzed. The SNP rs1770, located near the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQB1, was the most significant SNP (P = 4.5 × 10-10). In comparison with 24 SNPs in a GWAS of UK asthmatics, six SNPs were significant with the same odds ratio (OR) direction, including signals related to type 2 inflammation (e.g., IL1RL1, TSLP, and GATA3) and mucus plugging (e.g., MUC5AC). HLA-DQA1 showed an opposite OR direction. The HLA-DQB1 gene demonstrated significantly imputed mRNA expression in the lung tissue and whole blood.The SNP rs1770 of HLA-DQB1 was the most significant in Korean asthmatics. Similarities and discrepancies were found in the genetic variants between Korean and UK asthmatics. GWAS of Korean asthmatics should be replicated and compared with those of GWAS of other ethnicities.",

    "abstract": "Levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone and L-isomer of the racemate ofloxacin, has been approved for the treatment of acute and chronic bacterial infections. Gastrointestinal complaints are the most frequently reported adverse drug reactions to fluoroquinolones. Other adverse events include headache, dizziness, increased liver enzyme levels, photosensitivity, tachycardia, QT prolongation, and eruptions. Anaphylaxis has been documented as a rare adverse drug reaction to levofloxacin; however, diagnostic tests are needed to evaluate whether these reactions are the result of levofloxacin treatment. While the results of skin tests are considered unreliable due to false-positive responses, the oral provocation test is currently considered to be the most reliable test. Tryptase, a neutral protease, is the dominant protein component of secretory granules in human mast cells, and an increased serum concentration of tryptase is a highly sensitive indicator of anaphylaxis. Herein, we report a case of levofloxacin-induced anaphylaxis in which the patient exhibited elevated serum tryptase levels and a positive oral levofloxacin challenge test result. As anaphylaxis is potentially life-threatening, the administration of fluoroquinolones to patients who have experienced a prior reaction to this type of agent should be avoided.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic disease in childhood that affects virtually every facet of a patient's life and school activities, and every member of the family. It imposes a substantial socio-economic burden and demands many special considerations. Despite frequent updates on the current concepts of asthma management and its natural history, the prevalence of childhood asthma has increased worldwide in recent decades. More recently, however, comparable data on the prevalence of childhood asthma showed little change or a plateau in the incidence in some countries, including Korea. For example, the prevalence of asthma symptoms in the past 12 months in 13- to 14-year-old school children was 8.7% in Korea, compared with 8.8% in the entire Asia-Pacific region.1 As part of collaborative international studies in 1995, 2000, and 2005, national and regional cross-sectional surveys of asthma were performed using the Korean versions of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) written and video questionnaires. The ISAAC involves epidemiological studies enthusiastically carried out by the contributing members of the Korean Academy of Pediatric Allergy and Respiratory Diseases. There is little doubt regarding the prevalence of asthma determined by the ISAAC using the Korean versions of the written and video questionnaires.2,3\r\n\r\nThe lifetime prevalence of wheezing fell from 19.3% in 1995 to 14.4% in 2000 in Korea, whereas the number of affected children increased during this period in other countries.4 In addition, the prevalence of wheezing in the previous 12 months decreased from 10.5% in 1995 to 5.2% in 2000 in Korea.4 In contrast to the increased prevalence of asthma in 13- to 14-year-old children in Japan, the prevalence decreased in Korea. This decrease was partially attributable to a greater awareness of symptoms, early diagnosis, and proper management of childhood asthma by caregivers and physicians, following a successful Nationwide Asthma Campaign. In this issue, Kwon et al.5 showed that there was little change in asthma prevalence between 2005 Lessons Learned from the Prevalence of Childhood Asthma in Korea Ha-Baik Lee Department of Pediatrics, Hanyang University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea (13.0%) and 2008 (11.7%) based on the results of an epidemiological study conducted in metropolitan Seoul in 2008, using the same methodologies. A comparison of asthma prevalence among sequential phases of the ISAAC revealed similar trends. The rate for any diagnosis of asthma ever was 8.7% in 1995, 9.4% in 2000, 7.6% in 2005, and 7.9% in 2008. The prevalence of asthma treatments during the previous 12 months was 3.5% in 1995, 3.3% in 2000, 3.0% in 2005, and 2.7% in 2008.\r\n\r\nSeveral risk factors are important in the development of asthma in children, and although some childhood asthmatics 'outgrow' the disease, asthma more commonly persists throughout adulthood. Both genetic susceptibility and environmental factors contribute to the development and persistence of asthma symptoms in children.6 Arruda et al.7 reported that risk factors for asthma include early sensitization to airborne allergens, a history of atopic dermatitis or allergic rhinitis, maternal smoking during pregnancy, passive smoking, lower respiratory infections, air pollution, and various genetic polymorphisms. The risk factors for asthma symptoms in Korean children are similar to those identified in Phase Three of the ISAAC; these include body mass index, passive smoking, and pets.8 In this paper, striking risk factors for asthma development were male gender; a history of atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, or viral bronchiolitis; parental asthma; use of antibiotics during infancy; exposure to molds in the house during infancy; and moving to a new house, especially in genetically susceptible individuals.5 These results offer an opportunity to better understand asthma development.\r\n\r\nIn general, medical research has made progress in many human diseases, and advances in asthma research have reduced the toll of the disease. Nevertheless, much work remains. One common goal is to refocus attention on the prevalence and risk factors based on epidemiological studies of childhood asthma. However, efforts must still be directed toward better prevention and management of the disease, with a goal of minimizing the potential deterioration of lung function. It is important to educate the public and the medical community regarding more effective preventive measures and therapies for asthma.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells may play an important role in the pathogenesis of asthma in mice and humans.Thus, an agent that modulates the function of iNKT cells may have therapeutic potential to control asthma.We hypothesized that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-, flagellin-, or CpG-induced changes in the cytokine milieu may modify and even inhibit the function of airway iNKT cells in asthma.Methods: Because increased α-galactosylceramide (GalCer)-induced airway hyperreactivity (AHR) reflects the presence of airway iNKT cells, α-GalCer-induced AHR, as well as inflammatory cells and cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, were determined 24 hours after in vivo treatment with LPS, flagellin, or CpG in naïve BALB/c mice.Intracellular IL-4 and IFN-γ were measured in spleen iNKT cells after in vitro treatment with LPS, flagellin, or CpG.A role for IL-12 following the treatments was determined.Results: Intranasal administration of LPS, flagellin, or CpG reduced development of α-GalCer-induced AHR, eosinophilic airway inflammation, and Th1 and Th2 cytokine responses in BAL fluid, while producing IL-12 in BAL fluid.Intraperitoneal administration of IL-12 mAb blocked the suppressive effect of LPS, flagellin, or CpG.In vitro treatment with LPS, flagellin, or CpG reduced production of IL-4 and IFN-γ from α-GalCer-stimulated spleen iNKT cells; these effects were ameliorated by addition of anti-IL-12 mAb.Conclusions: TLR4, 5, and 9 agonists may suppress the function of airway and spleen iNKT cells via IL-12-dependent mechanisms.Anergy of iNKT cells by IL-12 might play a role in suppression by these TLR agonists.",

We aimed to identify the clinical features and CFTR mutations in Korean children.We included 18 pediatric patients with CF diagnosed using sweat chloride test or genetic analysis for 30 years. HEK293 cells were transfected with wild-type CFTR, ΔF508-CFTR, and L441P-CFTR mutant plasmids for 24 hours and treated with CFTR correctors (VX809 and VX661).The median age at diagnosis was 9.2 years. Eleven patients had growth retardation, and 6 had a respiratory failure at diagnosis. Genetic analysis was used for all patients, while sweat testing was for 8 patients. At diagnosis, the median z scores of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), FEV1/forced vital capacity, and forced expiratory flow at 25%-75% of forced vital capacity were -3.61 (-5.78, 1.78), -3.38 (-4.40, -0.60), and -4.45 (-5.78, 0.54), respectively. Two patients were treated with dornase alfa and only one with CFTR modulator. Patients were followed up for 3.7 years as a median. Four patients died at 10.6 years, with 4.2 years of post-diagnosis survival. The most common mutation was exon 16-17b deletion (19.4%). Among 11 single nucleotide variants, c.1322T>C (p.Leu441Pro, L441P) was detected in 4 patients. In the functional assay, L441P-CFTR correction was well restored by CFTR correctors compared with ΔF508.CF is extremely rare in Korean children and is caused by different mutations from those commonly observed in Caucasians. Early diagnosis and treatment availability may improve outcomes. CFTR modulators may be effective for Asian patients with rare CFTR mutations, c.1322T>C (p.Leu441Pro).",

The present study aimed to identify the difference in the effort required to complete spirometry by age in children and adolescents. Data from 707 children (mean age, 10.2 years; range, 4-25 years) from 6 medical centers were analyzed. In addition to demographics, we obtained information on the time required for as well as the number of demonstrations and spirometry demonstrations and trials from the patients' electronic medical records. A total of 398 (56.3%) male participants were included, and 300 (42.4%) participants had no prior experience receiving spirometry. The mean time required for spirometry demonstration was 2.7 minutes (standard deviation [SD], 2.1 minutes), whereas that for spirometry trial was 5.9 minutes (SD, 5.1 minutes). The total mean time required for spirometry was 8.6 minutes (SD, 6.5 minutes). Significant negative associations were observed between age and effort required to complete spirometry with respect to the time and number of demonstrations and trials. The results of the present study suggest that age may affect the degree of effort required to complete spirometry, with a pattern of increasing effort with decreasing age. This finding provides important evidence for the establishment of health care policies especially regarding lung diseases that can benefit from spirometry.",

All participants were treated with systemic cyclosporine before receiving upadacitinib, which yielded limited responses. At baseline, the mean prurigo severity scores assessed using the IGA, DLQI, and itch NRS were 3.4, 17.8, and 8.1, respectively; after 24 weeks of treatment, these scores significantly reduced to 1.0, 0.6, and 0.8, respectively. No severe adverse effects were observed. In conclusion, upadacitinib could be considered an alternative therapeutic option with good tolerability for refractory PN.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE Specific antibody deficiency (SAD) involves a deficient response to a polysaccharide vaccine despite having normal immunoglobulin levels. The failure of the polysaccharide response can be observed as a component of various primary antibody deficiencies. However, only a few studies have described the clinical and immunological profiles in SAD and/or other primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) in adults. METHODS A total of 47 patients who had a clinical history suggestive of antibody deficiency or had already been diagnosed with various antibody deficiencies were enrolled. Polysaccharide responses to 7 pneumococcal serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F) were measured using the World Health Organization enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (WHO-ELISA), and postvaccination immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers were compared to clinical and laboratory parameters. RESULTS Based on the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (AAAAI) criteria for the WHO-ELISA, 11 (23.4%) patients were diagnosed as having SAD. Sixteen-three percent of them had combined with other types of PID, such as IgG subclass deficiency and hypogammaglobulinemia. Postvaccination IgG titers for the serotypes 4/9V/18C correlated with IgG2 (P = 0.012, P = 0.001, and P = 0.004) and for 6B/9V/14 with IgG3 (P = 0.003, P = 0.041, and P = 0.036, respectively). The IgG3 subclass levels negatively correlated with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1, %) and FEV1/forced vital capacity (P < 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION SAD can be diagnosed in patients with normal IgG levels as well as in those deficient in IgG or the IgG3 subclass, implicating that restricted responses to Streptococcus pneumoniae polysaccharide antigens commonly exist in patients with predominantly antibody deficiency.",

    "abstract": "Although younger patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) have been successfully treated with pharmacotherapy, there are no definitive data on treatment outcomes in older patients with AR. We performed a prospective study of 51 older adults with AR (aged over 65 years) and 101 younger AR patients (aged from 19 to 40 years) to compare clinical outcomes between the 2 groups and to evaluate the impact of depressed mood on treatment outcomes in older AR patients. Changes in total symptom scores (TSS), rhinitis-specific quality of life questionnaire (RQLQ) results, rhinitis control assessment test (RCAT) results and visual analog scale (VAS) scores were evaluated after 4-week treatment according to the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) guideline, and the severity of depressed mood was assessed by using the geriatric depression scale. After 4-week treatment, younger AR patients had greater improvements in clinical scores compared with older adults; differences in least squares mean changes from baseline in older patients vs. younger patients were 1.71 (P = 0.004) for TSS, 10.84 (P < 0.001) for RQLQ, 0.80 (P = 0.275) for RCAT, and 8.60 for VAS score (P = 0.061). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the severity of depressed mood was independently associated with severe chronic upper airway disease (adjusted odds ratio, 1.385; P = 0.004). Our results suggest that older AR patients are less responsive to standard treatment compared with younger AR patients and that depressed mood is strongly associated with the increased risk of uncontrolled AR in older AR patients.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Macrophages are important regulators of environmental allergen-induced airway inflammation and asthma. ATP6V0d2 is a subunit of vacuolar ATPase highly expressed in macrophages. However, the functions of ATP6V0d2 in the regulation of pathogenesis of allergic asthma remain unclear. The aim of this study is to determine the function and related molecular mechanisms of macrophage protein ATP6V0d2 in allergic asthma. Methods We compared the disease severity between female C57BL/6 wild-type and ATP6V0d2-/- mice in an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma model. We also investigated the association of expression of ATP6V0d2, PU.1 and CCL17 with disease severity among asthmatic patients. Results The expression of ATP6V0d2 in sputum cells of asthmatic patients and in the lungs of OVA-challenged mice was enhanced compared to healthy subjects and their counterparts, respectively. However, ATP6V0d2-deficient mice exaggerated inflammatory cell infiltration as well as enhanced alternative activated macrophage (AAM) polarization and mucus production in an OVA-induced asthma model. Furthermore, we found that Atp6v0d2 promoted lysosomal degradation of Pu.1, which induced AAM polarization and Ccl17 production. Among asthma patients, ATP6V0d2 expression was inversely associated with disease severity, whereas PU.1 and CCL17 expression was positively associated with disease severity. Conclusions Our results identify macrophage Atp6v0d2, as an induced feedback inhibitor of asthma disease severity by promoting Pu.1 lysosomal degradation, which may in turn leads to reduced AAM polarization and Ccl17 production.",

The number of patients who overused for at least 1 day was 260 (17.1%). In particular, young patients, patients with limited physical activity, and patients with nocturnal symptoms demonstrated high frequency of overuse. The frequency of overuse during SMART was not high in Korean asthmatic patients and the asthma status of follow-up outpatients improved overall.

Symptoms could not be attributed to her muscular energy defect, since heterozygous CPT-2 deficiency is usually asymptomatic or causes only mild muscle fatigability. Myopathy is usually triggered by concurrent factors, either genetic (additional muscle enzymes defects) or acquired (metabolic stress). The patient was referred to our respiratory clinic for suspect bronchial asthma. Spirometry showed mild decrease in inspiratory flows. Methacholine challenge was negative. Dyspnea was triggered by hyperventilation-induced hypocapnia, which produced marked decrease in airflow rates, particularly in inspiratory flows, consistent with laryngospasm. Nutritional assessment of the patient showed low serum level of calcium and vitamin D, attributable to avoidance of milk and dairy products for lactose intolerance and to insufficient sunlight exposure. After calcium and vitamin D supplementation episodic laryngospasm disappeared and hypocapnic hyperventilation test induced very mild change in airflow rates. Calcium and vitamin D deficiency may favour laryngeal spasm mimicking asthma, particularly in subjects with underlying myopathy.",

This is largely due to a combination of inhibition, or defects in the apoptotic process and/or impaired apoptotic cell removal mechanisms. Among apoptosis-inducing genes, an important role is played by p53. In the present study, we have investigated the possible relationship between p53 codon 72 polymorphism and asthma and the interaction with ACP1, a genetic polymorphism involved in the susceptibility to allergic asthma. We studied 125 asthmatic children and 123 healthy subjects from the Caucasian population of Central Italy. p53 codon 72 and ACP1 polymorphisms were evaluated using a restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction (RFLP-PCR) method. There is a statistically significant association between p53 codon 72 polymorphism and allergic asthma: Arg/Arg genotype is more represented in asthmatic patients than in controls (P=0.018). This association, however, is present in subjects with low ACP1 activity A/A and A/B only (P=0.023). The proportion of children with A/A and A/B genotype carrying Arg/Arg genotype is significantly high in asthmatic children than in controls (OR=1.941; 95% C.I. 1.042-3.628). Our finding could have important clinical implications since the subjects with A/A and A/B genotypes of ACP1 carrying Arg/Arg genotype are more susceptible to allergic asthma than Pro/Pro genotype.",

Some reports demonstrate that mulberry fruit is a food allergen in the Mediterranean area. However, there has been no report of systemic allergic reactions after ingesting mulberry fruit in Korea. An 18-year-old boy with a mulberry fruit allergy visited our allergy clinic. He had experienced generalized urticaria, chest tightness, breathing difficulty, and abdominal cramping after ingesting mulberry fruit. The patient had a positive skin reaction to mulberry fruit extract (mean wheal size, 5 mm). We performed an ELISA to detect specific IgE antibody (Ab) to mulberry fruit extract in the patient's serum compared to those of non-atopic healthy controls and birch-sensitized individuals. Specific IgE Ab to mulberry fruit extract was detected in the patient's serum, as compared to non-atopic healthy controls. Another subject, who was strongly sensitized to birch pollen, also had a positive serum-specific IgE Ab to mulberry fruit. We performed IgE immunoblot analysis using the patient's and the other subject's sera, who had serum-specific IgE to mulberry fruit, to identify the IgE-binding component. An identical IgE-binding component to mulberry extract was detected in the two subjects at around 17 kDa, and which might be PR 10 of Bet v 1. In conclusion, mulberry fruit could induce a systemic allergic reaction through an IgE-mediated mechanism, and cross-reactivity might occur between mulberry fruit and birch pollen.",

It should be investigated that the contribution of fungi to allergic disease is species-specific, with specific fungal species leading to allergic disease exacerbations.\r\n\r\nMany studies examining the relationships between fungal exposure and allergic disease have focused on the total fungal spore count instead of specific fungal species as an indicator of exposure.2,3 In an elementary school with indoor mold count ranging 6,000 to 50,000 spores/m3, 85% of the students and teachers reported significant allergy symptoms.2 The author concluded that the elevations of the total spore count can have clinical implications, and a building is considered unhealthy at a total spore count of >1,000 spores/m3.2 Another observational study which is conducted in a large urban population demonstrated a positive correlation between daily concentrations of fungal spores and the frequency of visits to the emergency department.4 Therefore, changes in total fungal spore concentrations appear to be associated with an increase in allergy exacerbations. A more recent study5 on fungal spores in 173 asthmatic homes and 85 non-asthmatic homes reported that the total fungal spore and specific fungal species were higher in asthmatic homes than in non-asthmatic homes. However, that study did not confirm that the differences in the total fungal spore count or the distribution of specific fungi can cause asthma symptoms.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, case-control studies conducted with patients with asthma6 or allergic rhinitis7 showed no significant differences in the total spore count between cases and controls. The authors of these studies documented a potential relationship between genus-species and allergic diseases because some allergenic fungi were significantly higher in the allergy patients' homes, suggesting the type of mold is more important than the total spore count. In a large study of Taiwanese schoolchildren, there was no significant correlation between asthma and the total fungal spore in classrooms; however, Aspergillus/Penicillium and basidiospores spp. significantly correlated with current asthma.8 In a birth cohort study, exposure to specific fungal species in water-damaged buildings during infancy was associated with childhood asthma at 7 years.9 Thus, it could be possible that specific fungal species are more important in developing allergy symptoms rather than the total fungal spore count. This indicates that fungal species may play a different role in allergic disease. There is accumulating evidence that precise recognition of species-specific sensitization to fungal allergens is important in the management of allergic disease.\r\n\r\nIn this issue of the AAIR Journal, Lin et al.10 report the importance of specific allergenic species rather than the total fungal spore count for the exacerbation of allergy symptoms in fungus sensitized patients. They measured total and specific spore concentrations in 12 allergic patients' homes at active and inactive symptom stages. They could not find any significant association between exacerbations of allergy symptoms and the total or viable fungal spore count. Instead, they revealed that specific fungal species were more frequently found during the active stage. They also concluded the importance of specific species rather than the total fungal spore count for allergy exacerbations. However, an extreme small sample size (10 fungus-sensitized patients), heterogeneity of allergic disease, and no investigation into the effect of house dust mite (HDM) concentrations, the most important risk factor for allergy exacerbation in HDM-sensitized patients, should be considered in the interpretation of their results.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, recent studies11,12 have demonstrated the clinical implications of a high concentration of small fungal fragments in asthma severity. Submicron fungal fragments, such as fungal hyphae and fragmented conidia, are more common than airborne spores, and these fragments may function as allergen sources. These authors found that the presence of submicron fungal fragments is positively associated with a higher prevalence of reported asthma symptoms.11,12 Researchers emphasized the importance of submicron fungal fragments rather than fungal spores as a potential risk factor for allergic disease exacerbations, because they can penetrate into the lungs and be deposited therein.12 Recent progress in gene technology has greatly contributed to the identification of species-specific allergic molecules from different allergenic fungal sources.13 However, data verifying the allergenic reactivity of fungal allergens are insufficient. Studies regarding the species-specific impact of indoor fungi on the allergen sensitized population are warranted.\r\n\r\nIdentification of exact contributing factors for allergy exacerbations is crucial to evaluating the role of fungal species in fungal allergic patients.13,14 Identification of the spectrum of fungal species in allergic patients' homes will provide information about potential intervention targets for promoting allergic disease and improving understanding of possible mechanisms involved in fungi associated allergy. It is also necessary to assess not only specific fungal species but also submicron fragments for better understanding of exact mechanisms for allergic exacerbations in fungal allergic patients.",

    "abstract": "Palonosetron is a 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT-3) receptor antagonist used for preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting. Compared with ondansetron and granisetron, it is a better drug because of prolonged action and minimal side effects. Some adverse effects of palonosetron have been reported. In this report, we describe a 37-year-old male who developed severe hypersensitivity reactions to palonosetron during surgery for kidney donation. His medical history was unremarkable, except for inguinal hernia with herniorrhaphy 8 years ago. The surgery was uneventful until 2 hours 20 minutes. After palonosetron injection, his blood pressure dropped to 80/50 mm Hg, and facial edema, rash, conjunctival swelling, and wheezing developed. The patient was resuscitated by administration of ephedrine, hydrocortisone, and peniramine. Following the surgery, the patient was monitored for 3 days, and there were no subsequent anaphylactic reactions or other complications. The skin test on postoperative day 54 was positive for hypersensitivity to palonosetron. Although palonosetron is known for its safety, other hypersensitivity events have been reported. Ondansetron is another widely used 5-HT-3 antagonist, which has been reported to cause anaphylaxis. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of the possibility of patients experiencing severe adverse reactions to palonosetron.",

    "abstract": "Variations in barrier- or immune response-related genes are closely related to the development of atopic dermatitis (AD). This study was designed to identify genetic variations and clinical features to predict 'recalcitrant AD.' AD patients were classified as treatable and recalcitrant. Treatable AD patients showed satisfactory clinical improvement with basic and topical treatments. Recalcitrant AD patients used systemic immune-suppressants for over 4 weeks as they had not shown clinical improvement with basic and topical treatments. The frequency of gene variations in barrier- (FLG 3321delA, FLG K4022X, KLK7, SPINK 1156, SPINK 1188, SPINK 2475) and immune response- (DEFB1, KDR, IL-5RA, IL-9, and IL-12RB1a, b) related genes were compared between each AD group and the controls. Of all, 249 treatable AD and 32 recalcitrant AD were identified. Heterozygous mutations (Hetero) in KLK7 was more frequent in recalcitrant AD patients than treatable AD, without statistical significance. Hetero in DEFB1 was more frequent in treatable AD patients. However, no other significant genetic differences between treatable and recalcitrant AD was observed. Instead, higher initial Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) score, serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) level, allergen specific IgE for house dust mites, and family history of atopic diseases were associated with recalcitrant AD with statistical significance. According to our study, no genetic variation to predict recalcitrant AD was identified, suggesting that clinical manifestation, rather than genetic variations of AD patients is more likely to be an important factor in predicting the prognosis of AD. Further large-scale studies on the correlation between genetic variation and recalcitrant AD are needed.",

We performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to compare edema in the larynx and brain of anesthetized rats during anaphylactic hypotension versus vasodilator-induced hypotension. Male Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to hypotension induced by the ovalbumin antigen (n=7) or a vasodilator sodium nitroprusside (SNP; n=7). Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and T2-relaxation time (T2RT) were quantified on MRI performed repeatedly for up to 68 min after the injection of either agent. The presence of laryngeal edema was also examined by histological examination. Separately, the occurrence of brain edema was assessed by measuring brain water content using the wet/dry method in rats with anaphylaxis (n=5) or SNP (n=5) and the non-hypotensive control rats (n=5). Mast cells in hypothalamus were morphologically examined. Mean arterial blood pressure similarly decreased to 35 mmHg after an injection of the antigen or SNP. Hyperintensity on T2-weighted images (as reflected by elevated T2RT) was found in the larynx as early as 13 min after an injection of the antigen, but not SNP. A postmortem histological examination revealed epiglottic edema in the rats with anaphylaxis, but not SNP. In contrast, no significant changes in T2RT or ADC were detectable in the brains of any rats studied. In separate experiments, the quantified brain water content did not increase in either anaphylaxis or SNP rats, as compared with the non-hypotensive control rats. The numbers of mast cells with metachromatic granules in the hypothalamus were not different between rats with anaphylaxis and SNP, suggesting the absence of anaphylactic reaction in hypothalamus.

    "abstract": "Purpose Work-related asthma (WRA) occupies about 10%-30% of all asthma cases. Among 2 subtypes of WRA (occupational asthma [OA] and work-exacerbated asthma [WEA]), the rate of WEA has been reported to increase recently. WRA is described as having worse characteristics than non-WRA (NWRA), while WEA is known to show similar severity to OA in terms of symptoms and exacerbations. However, these data were mainly based on indirect surveys. Ulsan is a highly industrialized city in Korea; therefore, it is estimated to have a high incidence of WRA. This study aimed to identify the characteristics of WRA in the city. Methods This was a prospective asthma cohort study of individuals diagnosed with asthma and treated at Ulsan University Hospital between Jan 2015 and Dec 2016. Baseline characteristics and work-related inquiry (9 questionnaires) were investigated at enrollment. Various severity indices and job change were then investigated for the longitudinal analysis at 12 months after enrollment. Results In total, 217 asthma patients completed the study. WRA accounted for 17% (36/217), with an equal number of WEA and OA (18 patients each). Before the work-related survey, only 33% (n = 12) of WRA patients (22% [4/18] of WEA and 44% [8/18] of OA) were diagnosed with WRA by the attending physicians. Compared to the NWRA group and the OA subgroup, the WEA subgroup had more outpatient visits, more oral corticosteroids prescriptions, and trends of low asthma control test scores and severe asthma. The rate of job change was markedly lower in the WEA subgroup than in the OA subgroup (20% vs. 5%). Conclusions The overall prevalence of WRA (17%) was similar to those of previous studies, but the share of WEA was high (50% of WRA). WEA was more severe than OA or NWRA. The possible reason for this severity is ongoing workplace exposure.",

Although the EVH test is widely used, the in-test performance in high ventilation athletes as well as the reproducibility of that performance has not been determined. Reproducibility of pre- and post-test spirometry and self-reported atopy/cough was also examined.High ventilation athletes (competitive swimmers; n=11, 5 males) completed an atopy/cough questionnaire and EVH testing (operator controlled FiCO₂) on 2 consecutive days.Swimmers achieved 85%±9% and 87%±9% of target FEV1 volume on days 1 and 2, respectively, (P=0.45; ICC 0.57 [0.00-0.86]) resulting in a total ventilation of 687 vs 684 L [P=0.89, ICC 0.89 (0.65-0.97]) equating to 83%±8% and 84%±9% of predicted total volume (ICC 0.54 [0.00-0.85]) between days 1 and 2. FiCO₂ required to maintain eucapnic conditions was 2.5%. Pre-test FEV1 was less on day 2 (P=0.04; ICC >0.90). Day 1 to 2 post-test FEV1 was not different, and 4 swimmers were EIB positive (>10% fall in pre-post FEV1) on day 1 (3 on day 2).EVH in-test performance is reproducible however required less FiCO₂ than standard protocol and the swimmers under-ventilated by 125 and 139 L/min for days 1 and 2, respectively. How this affects EIB diagnosis remains to be determined; however, our results indicate a post-test FEV1 fall of ≥20% may be recommended as the most consistent diagnostic criterion.",

    "abstract": "Levodropropizine is commonly used as an antitussive drug for acute and chronic cough. It is a non-opioid agent with peripheral antitussive action via the modulation of sensory neuropeptide levels in the airways. Thus, levodropropizine has a more tolerable profile than opioid antitussives. However, we experienced 3 cases of levodropropizine-induced anaphylaxis. Three patients commonly presented with generalized urticaria, dyspnea, and collapse after taking cold medication including levodropropizine. To find out the culprit drug, we performed skin tests, oral provocation tests (OPTs), and basophil activation tests (BATs). Two patients were confirmed as having levodropropizine-induced anaphylaxis by OPTs, and one of them showed positive to skin prick tests (SPTs). The other patient was confirmed by skin tests and BATs. When we analyzed pharmacovigilance data related to levodropropizine collected for 5 years, most cases (78.9%) had allergic reactions, such as rash, urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis. Therefore, physicians should consider that levodropropizine can be a culprit drug, when anaphylaxis occurs after taking anti-cough or common cold medication.",

This study aimed to investigate the role of specific IgE (sIgE) and specific IgG4 (sIgG4) to shrimp extracts and the cross-reactive shrimp allergens tropomyosin (TM), arginine kinase (AK) and myosin light-chain (MLC), as markers of persistent or resolved shrimp allergy (PSA or RSA).Seventeen patients with a 10-year history of allergy to Penaeus monodon (Pm) and/or Macrobachium rosenbergii (Mr) were recruited. Oral shrimp challenges identified 10 patients with PSA and 7 patients with RSA. Sera from these patients were evaluated for sIgE and sIgG4 to Mr and Pm extracts as well as to TM, AK and MLC.The levels of sIgE to Mr and Pm extracts were lower in the RSA than in the PSA groups (P = 0.05 and P = 0.008, respectively), but sIgG4 or sIgG4:sIgE ratio did not show statistical significance. The sIgE to AK and MLC, but not TM, were lower in the RSA group than in the PSA group (P = 0.009 and P = 0.0008, respectively). There was no difference in sIgG4 to TM, AK and MLC between both groups. The ratio of sIgG4:sIgE to MLC, but not TM or AK, was higher in the RSA than in the PSA group (P = 0.02). A higher diversity of sIgE to shrimp components was found in the PSA group than in the RSA group (P = 0.006).Specific bioassays can be used to identify patients with RSA. Oral shrimp challenges in these patients may provide a higher rate of passing the challenges and finally reintroducing shrimp in their diet.",

    "abstract": "Current clinical guidelines are unclear regarding the association of cardiovascular medication with the risk of acute exacerbation (AE) in patients with asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap (ACO).We conducted a retrospective cohort study by interrogating the claims database of Taipei Veterans General Hospital. Patients with coexistent fixed airflow limitation and asthma were enrolled as an ACO cohort between 2009 and 2017. Exposure to cardiovascular medications, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), non-selective beta-blockers, cardioselective beta-blockers, dihydropyridine (DHP) calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and non-DHP CCBs, in 3-month period each served as time-dependent covariates. Patients receiving a cardiovascular medication ≥ 28 cumulative daily doses were defined as respective cardiovascular medication users. Patients were followed up until December 31, 2018. The primary endpoint was severe AE, defined as hospitalization or emergency department visit for either asthma, COPD, or respiratory failure. The secondary outcome was moderate AE.The final study cohort consisted of 582 ACO subjects, with a mean follow-up period of 2.98 years. After adjustment, ARB (hazard ratio [HR], 0.64, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44-0.93, P = 0.019), cardioselective beta-blocker (HR, 0.29, 95% CI, 0.11-0.72, P = 0.008) and DHP CCB (HR, 0.66, 95% CI, 0.45-0.97, P = 0.035) therapies were associated with lower risks of severe AE.

Cardioselective beta-blockers, ARBs, and DHP CCBs were associated with lower risks of severe AE in frequent exacerbators. ACEI, non-selective beta-blocker, or non-DHP CCB use did not change the risk of severe AE.ARB, cardioselective beta-blocker, and DHP CCB therapies may lower the risk of AE in patients with ACO.",

    "abstract": "Interleukin (IL)-17A plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of allergic airway inflammation. Yet, the exact roles of IL-17A in asthma are still controversial. Thus, the aim of this study was to dissect the roles of IL-17A in toluene diisocyanate (TDI)-induced mixed granulocytic asthma and to assess the effects of neutralizing antibody in different effector phases on TDI-induced asthma.IL-17A functions in allergic airway inflammation were evaluated using mice deficient in IL-17A (Il17a-/-) or IL-17A monoclonal antibody (IL-17A mab, intraperitoneally, 50 μg per mouse, 100 μg per mouse). Moreover, the effects of exogenous recombinant IL (rIL)-17A in vivo (murine rIL-17A, intranasally, 1 μg per mouse) and in vitro (human rIL-17A, 100 ng/mL) were investigated.TDI-induced mixed granulocytic airway inflammation was IL-17A-dependent because airway hyperreactivity, neutrophil and eosinophil infiltration, airway smooth muscle thickness, epithelium injury, dysfunctional T helper (Th) 2 and Th17 responses, granulocytic chemokine production and mucus overproduction were more markedly reduced in the Il17a-/- mice or by IL-17A neutralization during the sensitization phase of wild-type (WT) mice. By contrast, IL-17A neutralization during the antigen-challenge phase aggravated TDI-induced eosinophils recruitment, with markedly elevated Th2 response. In line with this, instillation of rIL-17 during antigen sensitization exacerbated airway inflammation by promoting neutrophils aggregation, while rIL-17A during the antigen-challenge phase protected the mice from TDI-induced airway eosinophilia. Moreover, rIL-17A exerted distinct effects on eosinophil- or neutrophil-related signatures in vitro.Our data demonstrated that IL-17A was required for the initiation of TDI-induced asthma, but functioned as a negative regulator of established allergic inflammation, suggesting that early abrogation of IL-17A signaling, but not late IL-17A neutralization, may prevent the progression of TDI-induced asthma and could be used as a therapeutic strategy for severe asthmatics in clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) and food allergy (FA) are associated with respiratory comorbidities, in the concept of 'atopic march.' However, children with AD and a coexisting FA have various disease courses, and the mechanism of atopic march remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether the phenotype of AD with coexisting FA in early life affected asthma or allergic rhinitis (AR) in school children.A total of 1,579 children from the Panel Study on Korean Children (PSKC) cohort were followed-up in 2013. The participants diagnosed with AD in this cohort were classified by the age of AD onset and persistence as well as FA history. We compared the presence of comorbidities-asthma and rhinitis-among different AD phenotypes.Asthma and AR with current symptoms within 12 months at age 6-8 years were associated with early-onset persistent AD phenotype, regardless of coexisting FA. AD with FA conferred a higher risk of recent wheezing at 8 years of age than AD without FA (adjusted odds ratio, 8.09; 95% confidence interval, 2.54-25.76). Children with early-onset persistent AD with FA manifested a distinctive trajectory with a higher prevalence of wheezing and AR at age 5-8 years than those without AD.AD with FA in early life is strongly associated with asthma and AR in school children, and the early-onset persistent AD with FA had a strong additive effect on the risk of asthma at school age. Classifying AD phenotypes regarding FA in early life will help predict and prevent asthma and AR in school children.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory diseases have a highly multifactorial etiology where different mechanisms contribute to the individual's susceptibility. We conducted a deep characterization of loci associated with asthma and lung function by previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS).Sixteen variants were selected from previous GWAS of childhood/adult asthma and pulmonary function tests. We conducted a phenome-wide association study of these loci in 4,083 traits assessed in the UK Biobank (n = 361,194 participants). Data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project were used to conduct a transcriptomic analysis with respect to tissues relevant for asthma pathogenesis. A pediatric cohort assessed with the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Children (ISAAC) Phase II tools was used to further explore the association of these variants with 116 traits related to asthma comorbidities.Our phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) identified 206 phenotypic associations with respect to the 16 variants identified. In addition to the replication of the phenotypes tested in the discovery GWAS, we observed novel associations related to blood levels of immune cells (eosinophils, neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes) for the asthma-related variants. Conversely, the lung-function variants were associated with phenotypes related to body fat mass. In the ISAAC-assessed cohort, we observed that risk alleles associated with increased fat mass can exacerbate allergic reactions in individuals affected by allergic respiratory diseases. The GTEx-based analysis showed that the variants tested affect the transcriptomic regulation of multiple surrounding genes across several tissues.This study generated novel data regarding the genetics of respiratory diseases and their comorbidities, providing a deep characterization of loci associated with asthma and lung function.",

    "abstract": "It is known that strong feelings of self-efficacy are linked with better management of asthma. However, it is not known whether the experience of poverty can detrimentally impact the self-efficacy feelings of asthma patients. This paper aims to determine whether falling into income or multidimensional poverty lowers self-efficacy among people diagnosed with asthma. Longitudinal analysis of Waves 7 to 11 (2007 to 2011) of the nationally representative Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey using generalized linear models. The analysis was limited to those who had been diagnosed with asthma. The Freedom Poverty Measure was used to identify those in multidimensional poverty. People with asthma who fell into income poverty had significantly lower self-efficacy scores-23% lower (95% CI: -35.1 to -9.1), after falling into income poverty for 3 or 4 years between 2007 and 2011 compared to those who were never in income poverty. Those who fell into multidimensional poverty also had significantly lower self-efficacy scores-25% lower (95% CI: -42.8 to -2.0), after being in multidimensional poverty for 3 or 4 years between 2007 and 2011 compared to those who were never in poverty. Asthmatics who fall into poverty are likely to experience a decline in their feelings of self-efficacy. The findings of this study show that experiencing poverty should be a flag to identify those who may need extra assistance in managing their condition.",

We report the case of a patient who developed toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) while she was being treated with chemoradiotherapy and several drugs. Cutaneous tests were performed with the drugs involved with negative result. Although the occurrence of TEN contraindicates suspected drug readministration, we based the decision to perform the controlled administration of temozolomide on the following reasons: (1) the poor prognosis of the underlying disease, (2) the lack of therapeutic alternatives, (3) the suspicion that other drugs taken by the patient simultaneously may be responsible (as anticonvulsants and trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole [TMP-SMX]), and (4) temozolomide was the first choice for treating the patient's disease. The administration of a cumulative dose of 60 mg of temozolomide caused a slight skin reaction. Given this result, we conducted controlled administration of other drugs involved. Dexamethasone, codeine, omeprazole and levetiracetam were well tolerated. However, TMP-SMX produced a similar reaction to that caused by temozolomide. In conclusion, we present the first case of TEN induced by temozolomide and TMP-SMX associated with cranial radiotherapy confirmed by controlled administration. Radiotherapy in combination with these drugs could have favored TEN, as some authors have postulated, but we cannot prove this.",

    "abstract": "Undoubtedly, cough is one of the most common symptoms that make people visit physicians for its treatment. It is also apparent that management of chronic cough is not so simple. Underlying causative diseases are diverse, pathogenic mechanism is not clear, and patients' complaints from personal subjective feelings often make physicians even more frustrated. Furthermore, some patients fail to comprehensively explain their symptoms, and they do not score the severity of their symptoms exactly on a standardized scale. Indeed, precise assessment of the severity and characteristics of cough would be helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of certain therapeutic approaches.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, physicians do not have perfectly reliable tools to objectively measure treatment outcomes of cough patients. In clinical practice, physicians, who eagerly want to know about cough severity in patients with chronic cough, frequently ask the patients Is your cough getting better? In addition, physicians modify the management plan based on patients' description of symptom changes. This is a usual pattern in clinical practice for cough patients. It may be alright for physicians seeing patients in their clinics to simply ask the patients about changes in cough severity to 1 or 2 weeks after prescribing cough medications. However, in clinical studies or trials of new antitussive drugs, it is of no value in obtaining clinical information to simply ask Is your cough getting better? A validated way to objectively measure cough in quantity and quality is necessary.\r\n\r\nAn excellent review article about tools to assess outcomes in clinical studies on cough has recently been published by the CHEST Expert Cough Panel.1 Originally, tools to assess the magnitude of cough were developed to evaluate the efficacy of new antitussive medications because valid tools should be used to measure outcomes of administration of antitussive agents in clinical trials. This panel suggests that assessment of cough consider various aspects of cough, such as severity, cough-specific quality of life (QoL), frequency, and sensitivity. It is recommended that validated and reliable cough-specific health-related QoL questionnaires be used to assess cough severity of patients, and it is specifically suggested that CoughSpecific Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (CQLQ) and Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) be used because they are most extensively studied and found to be valid and reliable.2,3\r\n\r\nAlthough QoL surpasses other measures in assessing cough, questionnaires are usually developed solely based on patients' input, and the methodology is somewhat subjective. Thus, tools to objectively assess cough in quantity could at least compensate for imperfect measures only based on personal assessment. Acoustic cough counting is a relatively well-known tool to measure cough frequency, which is recommended for the assessment of cough in clinical studies as an ancillary measure in the newest Expert Report. Inhalation challenges with tussigenic agents, such as capsaicin, may be another reasonable method to objectively measure cough responses of patients. However, introduction of this method into clinical practice is not recommended at this moment, and the method should be used only for research purposes. Other simple measures for patients' global assessment include visual analog and numeric rating scales. However, only limited data exists on the justification of the introduction of those methods into clinical use.\r\n\r\nConsidering that the development of new and effective antitussive agents, which can specifically reduce increased cough sensitivity, has become an important unmet need, standardization of assessment tools to assess cough is necessary to enhance the reliability of clinical trials. Furthermore, globally acceptable standardized tools are certainly prerequisite for improvement in values and efficiencies of clinical studies recruiting a large number of patients with cough from different countries. In order to encourage the use of such standardized questionnaire tools, validated versions in various languages should be prepared for clinical use. An existing accepted questionnaire should be translated into another language through established methodology, including backward and forward translation steps to preserve content validity.4\r\n\r\nIn the article by Kwon et al.,5 the Korean version of the LCQ was evaluated in terms of reliability and validity as a tool to assess cough in the Korean population using Korean language. In that article, the Korean version has been proved to be a valid assessment tool. Strict rules should be applied to the use of health-related questionnaire in clinical studies. Since any minor modification of the QoL questionnaires has the potential to result in different outcomes, no questionnaire item should be changed. If there is a need to modify even small part of the previously well-validated questionnaire, the changed version should be re-evaluated for its validity and reliability.6 Thereafter, physicians can be confident in using cough-specific questionnaires while conducting cough studies and measuring outcomes of the studies. Apparently, questionnaire is the only reliable and validated tool to measure outcomes of cough patients after application of any clinical intervention because there are no valid biomarkers that can be measured in biological samples from patients. Thus, a well-validated and globally acceptable questionnaire is particularly critical for cough research and clinical studies.\r\n\r\nIn clinical practice, a validated questionnaire is actually good enough for assessing cough. Precise measurement of responses to certain therapeutics will have additional value in facilitating clinical practice. A short modified version may be even more helpful in clinical practice. Cough severity can be measured more easily by using the visual analog or numeric rating scale; however, they should be standardized prior to use.\r\n\r\nWhat we need to keep in mind is that all validated and reliable questionnaires are not perfect tools to measure outcomes in cough studies, although they are the best way to cough study as mentioned above. In order to compensate for the disadvantages of QoL's subjectivity, additional objective measures may be needed. Of course, standardization and development of new tools is always justified. Given that cough hypersensitivity primarily induced by neuropathy is believed to be a pivotal pathogenetic mechanism underlying chronic cough, it is reasonable that novel objective measures for assessing cough should reflect the magnitude of cough sensitivity and the degree of neuropathic abnormalities. These approaches would greatly help not only improve clinical practice but also conduct basic research into pathogenic mechanisms. Finally, another issue we need to consider is that an adequate assessment tool to assess cough is also urgently needed in children. The article in this issue of the AAIR mainly focuses on adult patients with cough. Therefore, this version cannot be extended to pediatric patients with cough, but we can anticipate that ideal tools to assess cough in children will be available in the near future.",

    "abstract": "No clinician would disagree with the fact that chronic cough is a very common and annoying clinical condition and is not so easy to treat as anticipated.Chronic cough is considerably heterogeneous in terms of clinical features and many possible underlying causative disorders.Indeed, managing chronic cough patients can be very tricky at times, especially when they show neither symptoms suggestive of certain disorders nor definite abnormalities in physical examination or chest X-rays.In consideration of its high prevalence and heterogeneity, several algorithmic approaches have been proposed for the diagnosis and management of chronic cough, 1 though there have been no widely accepted guidelines, such as GINA for asthma. 2 The proposed algorithms mostly focus on diagnosing underlying causative diseases, such as asthma, rhinosinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and laryngopharyneal reflux , which are the common causes of chronic cough.The question is: Do most coughing patients get better when clinicians mainly focus on identification of culprit disorders with the guidelines?Unfortunately, the answer would not be affirmative.A substantial proportion of patients continue to suffer from chronic cough despite proper treatment of underlying diseases, and a significant number of patients are regarded as so-called idiopathic chronic cough. 3Although chronic cough is an umbrella term encompassing various underlying diseases and the importance of searching for the specific diagnosis for each patient should not be ignored, diagnosing the underlying disease is definitely not sufficient to solve this bothersome problem.What is interesting in the article on this issue by Song et al. 4 is that almost all chronic cough patients show symptoms strongly suggestive of neuropathy, namely hypertussivity to capsaicin and allotussivity to cold air regardless of underlying diseases, which are consistent with those of other previous studies. 5,6hose observations lead to a reasonable assumption that the same pathophysiologic mechanism may function to generate",

    "abstract": "Allergen immunotherapy has been used for more than a century to treat allergic diseases, including allergic rhinitis and asthma, as well as venom-induced anaphylaxis. The efficacy of immunotherapy has been established by many double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that have been reviewed in meta-analyses.1-3 Indications and prescription rules for immunotherapy have been clearly defined in the literature. However, prescription patterns of immunotherapy may differ by country.4,5 The article in the issue studied the practice patterns of immunotherapy in Korea for the first time.6 The authors e-mailed a questionnaire to 690 Korean allergists with clinical practice experience. About 70% of the respondents answered that they prescribed immunotherapy. Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) was performed by 82% and sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) by the rest. Thirty percent of respondents replied that they did not perform immunotherapy; however, two thirds of them desired using it in future practice.\r\n\r\nThe results of this study are worthy of comment despite the limitations due to response rate and demographics. In this survey, 30.4% of the respondents performing SCIT answered that they had experienced anaphylaxis related to immunotherapy. Adverse reactions of immunotherapy can be classified into 2 categories: local reactions and systemic reactions that can range in severity from mild to very severe life-threatening anaphylaxis. Unfortunately, the authors did not use a severity grading system for systemic reactions7 but asked simply Have you ever experienced anaphylaxis?. Variability in how the term 'anaphylaxis' is interpreted may make it difficult to compare the risk of systemic reactions with those of other studies. In addition, attention must be paid to the interpretation of the percentage of respondents who experienced anaphylaxis. Notably, about 28% of the respondents prescribing immunotherapy used rush or cluster immunotherapy during the build-up phase. These accelerated schedules offer the advantage of achieving a therapeutic dose earlier; however, they are associated with a greater risk from systemic reactions compared to conventional protocols.8\r\n\r\nMultiple sensitizations are frequent in atopic subjects. Multiple sensitizations are traditionally interpreted as cross-reactivity between biologically related allergens; however, they can also be viewed as an expression of the underlying atopic potential of the subject.9 In Europe, patients are generally treated with one (or a few) relevant allergen extracts even if they have multiple sensitivities; however, in Korea and the United States, the majority of allergists tend to favor immunotherapy using multiple allergen extracts in polysensitized patients. The prevailing view of US allergists is that, as long as multi-allergen therapy is effective, there is an advantage in treating as many of the patient's actual or potential allergies as possible.10 However, multi-allergen immunotherapy in polysensitized patients needs more supporting data to validate it as a treatment option.\r\n\r\nSLIT is widely prescribed in Europe; however, only 5.9% of US allergists reported using SLIT.11 The most cited reason for not using SLIT was the lack of approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). If SLIT were an FDA-approved form of immunotherapy, 65.7% would use it to treat allergic rhinitis and 40.9% would use it to treat moderate to severe asthma. In Korea, about 20% of the respondents that prescribed immunotherapy used SLIT.6 SLIT has advantages in home administration due to safety profiles despite its relatively late onset of action. On the contrary, whereas SCIT has an early onset of action, repeated injections and safety concerns have limited its use in the pediatric age group. Keles et al.12 studied the efficacy and safety of immunotherapy using a combination of SCIT in the build-up phase and SLIT maintenance compared to SCIT or SLIT only. This approach successfully combined the advantages of 2 alternatives: rapid onset and potency in SCIT and safety and avoidance of injections in SLIT.\r\n\r\nAnti-IgE has been challenged to improve the safety and efficacy of immunotherapy. Omalizumab pretreatment quantitatively improves the safety of rush immunotherapy in patients with allergic rhinitis.13 This approach could be an effective strategy to permit more rapid and higher doses of allergen immunotherapy with better safety. Immunotherapy and treatment with omalizumab have complementary modes of action. Kuehr et al. conducted a controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of omalizumab in children and adolescents with seasonal allergic rhinitis.14 Each subject was started on build-up SCIT before the anticipated pollen season, and followed with omalizumab or placebo in parallel to SCIT maintenance during the pollen season. The patients who received omalizumab during the pollen season had about a 50% reduction in symptom load compared to patients who had SCIT alone. Their study shows that combined therapy could provide better efficacy than either treatment alone. At present, asthma that is not well controlled might be considered a contraindication to immunotherapy. In retrospective surveys conducted by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, a total of 34 fatal reactions to immunotherapy were reported from 1985 to 2001.15 Most fatalities occurred in patients with asthma that was poorly controlled or treated with oral corticosteroids; therefore, it remains of interest if omalizumab can permit the administration of immunotherapy to high-risk patients (eg, patients with uncontrolled asthma).\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the majority of Korean allergists have prescribed SCIT for a long time. SLIT is not yet popular in Korea due to its recent introduction. However, SLIT is a promising immunotherapy that may change its inclusion criteria and increase in the population receiving immunotherapy. In this context, SLIT will be more frequently used in the future.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of an airway characterized by recurrent attacks of airflow obstruction that is at least partially reversible.1,2 This definition of implies that asthma can be completely reversible. Therefore, most patients with asthma (except those with severe or difficult-to-treat asthma) show the greatest improvement of symptoms in the first few months of therapy. Many newly diagnosed asthma patients irregularly or hardly follow the treatment advice of a physician due to the definition and clinical course of asthma.3,4\r\n\r\nAccording to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guideline and the Expert Panel Report 3, the goal of therapy in patients with asthma is to achieve asthma control. Asthma classification by severity (previously introduced by the previous GINA documents) is less important than before; however, it is still useful to decide the management at the initial assessment of a patient or when required to characterize a group of patients with asthma who are not in treatment. Recently, the severity of asthma means the intensity of the treatment required to achieve good asthma control.5\r\n\r\nThis issue of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology Research, Kang and colleagues6 evaluated patients who were newly diagnosed with asthma at a university hospital and were lost to follow-up within 3 years. The authors revealed that 73.9% of patients were lost to follow-up within 3 years and they were younger and had a lower severity of asthma at the time of diagnosis compared with those who had continued management at the hospital. They also showed that 63.3% of non-adherents (who responded to the telephone survey) had not taken any controller mainly due to improved symptoms. Those who did not follow up at the hospital but continued treatment at other hospitals were comparable to those that continued follow-up. Half of the survey respondents answered that the reason to discontinue treatment was due to the long distance to the hospital. Subsequently, the non-treatment group had distinctive characteristics of a young age, best FEV1 and highest PC20 of methacholine, compared to the previous 2 groups. The non-treatment group had intermittent or mild persistent severity of asthma at the time of diagnosis and none of them reported aggravation of asthma despite non-treatment.\r\n\r\nMy colleagues analyzed the characteristics of drop-out patients compared with those who maintained attendance in the COhort for Reality and Evolution of Adult Asthma in Korea (COREA).7 Forty-four percent of the initial participants dropped out from the cohort in the first 18 months. Non-adherents (versus adherents) had a lower mean age, a shorter duration of treatment and lower physician-assessed severity of asthma; in addition, they used fewer controllers and experienced fewer exacerbations. The findings suggest that newly diagnosed patients as well as those previously diagnosed with asthma tend to have lower adherence to their treatment if they have a lower severity of asthma.\r\n\r\nThe updated GINA guideline recommends controller treatment for 1 year even if the patient achieves asthma control and has no symptoms on the lowest dose of controller.1 However, the evidence of this recommendation is the lowest level and based on a panel consensus judgment. Asthma control can deteriorate in weeks to months when an inhaled steroid discontinued.8 There were non-responders to the telephone survey (in contrast to the current guideline or the previous report); however, this retrospective observational study identified no aggravation of asthma control in patients with mild asthma after they stopped the controllers themselves. This provides clinically valuable information in the context of the discrepancy between the doctor's recommendation and the patient's accordance. The choices by patients could be reasonable in light of economic costs and a possible adverse effect caused by unnecessary treatment if they had intermittent or mild persistent asthma.\r\n\r\nA limitation of this study was that the authors did not evaluate any previous exacerbations or any recurrences of asthma. The diagnosis of asthma was based on the bronchodilator/methacholine challenge testing as they described; however, episodic recurrences/exacerbations of the obstructive symptoms were necessary for the diagnosis of asthma. Frequent exacerbation of asthma is one of the important future risks in asthma control; subsequently, we cannot exclude the possibility that the diagnosis of the subjects included in this study may consist of asthma as well as asthma-like conditions that could show positive results to bronchodilator/Methacholine challenge testing.9-11 For example, a patient with postviral airway hyperresponsiveness could be included in this retrospective cohort and then show no recurrent symptom with no treatment.\r\n\r\nFurther studies focused on mild asthma are necessary to identify patients that require continued treatment despite achieving prolonged asthma control. In terms of the heterogeneity of asthma, developing biomarkers and indices to distinguish the need-to-treat patients could be essential for an optimized and personalized management.",

The filamin A interacting protein 1 (FILIP1) may play a crucial role in AERD pathogenesis by mediating T cell activation and membrane rearrangement. We investigated the association of FILIP1 variations with AERD and the fall rate of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). A total of 34 common FILIP1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 592 Korean asthmatic subjects that included 163 AERD patients and 429 aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA) controls. This study found that 5 SNPs (P=0.006-0.01) and 2 haplotypes (P=0.01-0.03) of FILIP1 showed nominal signals; however, corrections for the multiple testing revealed no significant associations with the development of AERD (P(corr)>0.05). In addition, association analysis of the genetic variants with the fall rate of FEV1, an important diagnostic marker of AERD, revealed no significant evidence (P(corr)>0.05). Although further replications and functional evaluations are needed, our preliminary findings suggest that genetic variants of FILIP1 might be not associated with the onset of AERD.",

    "abstract": "This is the inaugural issue of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology Research (AAIR), published under the auspices of the Korean Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Clinical Immunology and the Korean Academy of Pediatric Allergy and Respiratory Disease. This issue contains three reviews by world-famous professors, three original articles, and two case reports.\r\n\r\nFirst, I would like to briefly outline the histories of the Academies sponsoring the publication. The Korean Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Clinical Immunology was founded in 1972 and has published its official journal, the Korean Journal of Asthma, Allergy and Clinical Immunology, quarterly since 1981. As of 2008, its membership comprised about 1000 physicians, including pediatricians, rhinologists, and dermatologists. It holds two main congresses each year, in spring and autumn, at which more than 200 abstracts are presented. Annually, the Academy has published eight editorials, 20 original articles, eight reviews, and 10 case reports in its official journal.\r\n\r\nThe Korean Academy of Pediatric Allergy and Respiratory Disease was founded in 1987 and has published its official journal, the Pediatric Allergy and Respiratory Disease(Korea), since that time. The Academy consisted of 1400 pediatricians in 2008. Like its partner Academy, this Academy also holds congresses each spring and autumn, with more than 200 abstracts being presented every year, and has published eight editorials, 20 original articles, eight reviews, and 10 case reports in its official journal.\r\n\r\nSince their founding, the two Academies have sponsored several international congresses and symposia on allergy, immunology, and pediatric respiratory diseases. The Korean-Japan Joint Allergy symposium has been held biannually since the founding of the Korean Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Many of international meetings have been successfully hosted in Korea. At international and domestic symposia, members of both Academies have presented many excellent abstracts, which have been published in program booklets. Major contributions by Academy members have been published in the Korean Journal of Asthma, Allergy and Clinical Immunology and the Pediatric Allergy and Respiratory Disease(Korea). However, as the official journals of both Academies are written in Korean and distributed domestically, the study results of our members reach few readers outside Korea.\r\n\r\nTo promote international communication by their members, the two Academies have decided to publish an official journal in English, and I was appointed Editor-in-Chief. Last December, to prepare for the publication of AAIR, the Academies established a committee composed of Drs. Choon Shil Lee, Hae-Sim Park, Jae Won Oh, Soo-Jong Hong, You Sook Cho, Jung Won Park, and Woo Kyung Kim.\r\n\r\nAAIR will be published four times annually and will contain timely clinical, basic science, and experimental research papers; instructive case reports; and detailed examinations of state-of-the-art equipment and techniques useful for allergists, immunologists, and other physicians who deal with the clinical manifestations of allergies and pediatric respiratory disease. Original articles will cover topics such as allergy, immunology, respirology, and occupational allergy, and will include studies on allergens, the environment, and the latest therapies and treatment programs. AAIR will also publish solicited review articles on subjects of topical interest to researchers and physicians in the fields of allergy and immunology.\r\n\r\nWe are keen to develop AAIR as a leading journal in asthma, allergy, and clinical immunology. To enhance its academic quality, we have invited world-class professors and researchers to join the AAIR Advisory and Editorial Boards. We have also introduced internal enhancements involving board structure, office processing, manuscript centralization, impact factor registration, internal auditing, outcome review, and public relations, including more dynamic interactions with our publisher.\r\n\r\nPreparing the first issue of AAIR has been an enjoyable and rewarding experience, which was greatly enhanced by the contributions of an outstanding team that included the preparatory committee for publication, Advisory Board members, Associate Editors, Editorial Board members, and a loyal and hard-working Editorial Office staff. It will be a privilege for me to serve as Editor-in-Chief of AAIR, and I am proud of what we have achieved collectively to date. On behalf of all the Editors, I look forward to excellent support and assistance from members of the Korean Academies as well as international allergy and clinical immunology societies.",

    "abstract": "The immunological characteristics of young Korean children with walnut (WN) allergy and the influence of different cooking methods on WN proteins have not been evaluated to date. This study aimed to evaluate the major WN allergens identified among Korean children, together with changes in WN antigenicity caused by common cooking methods. We enrolled children under the age of 13 years with WN serum-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) E concentrations. The protein fractions of dry-fried and boiled WN extracts were compared with those of raw WNs using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), 2-dimentional gel electrophoresis (2DE) and a proteomic analysis using electrospray ionization (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry [LC-MS]). An immunoblotting analysis was conducted to examine IgE reactivity toward raw WNs using serum samples from 6 children with a clinical WN allergy. To determine the processed WN proteins with IgE-binding capacity, a 2D-immunoblotting analysis was performed using the pooled sera of 20 WN-sensitized children. Protein bands from raw WNs were identified at 9, 16, 28, 52, 58, and 64 kDa via SDS-PAGE. The 9- and 16-kDa protein bands were enhanced by boiling, whereas the 52- and 64-kDa bands were considerably diminished. On LC-MS analysis, of the 66 IgE-binding proteins present in raw WNs, 57 were found in dry-fried WNs, but only 4 in boiled WNs. The sera of 5 out of 6 participants reacted with the 52-kDa protein bands and those of 4 out of 6 participants reacted with the 16- and 28-kDa protein bands, respectively. Meanwhile, a 2D-immunoblotting result confirmed the presence of different binding patterns among children who consumed cooked WNs. The protein profile of boiled WNs is substantially different from that of raw WNs. However, 4 proteins including prolamins remained stable after dry-frying or boiling. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical relevance of these findings.",

However, the impact of frequently grilling meat or fish at home on airflow limitation in adult asthma has not been well elucidated. We performed a prospective cohort study of 91 adult patients with asthma enrolled from 2 university hospitals. Of the patients, 39 (42.9%) grilled meat or fish at least once a week and 52 (57.1%) less than once a week. Patients who grilled at least once a week tended to have lower peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) than those who grilled less than once a week (median, 345.5 L/min; 95% confidence interval [CI], 291.8-423.2 L/min vs. median, 375.1 L/min; 95% CI, 319.7-485.7 L/min; P = 0.059). Among patients with severe asthma who received step 4-5 treatment, PEFR was significantly lower in patients who grilled at least once a week compared with those who grilled less than once a week (median, 297.8 L/min; 95% CI, 211.3-357.7 L/min vs. median, 396.1 L/min; 95% CI, 355.0-489.6 L/min; P < 0.001). Our results suggest that the frequency of grilling meat or fish at home may affect PEFR in asthmatic patients, especially those with severe asthma who needed a high level of asthma treatment.",

    "abstract": "Since the establishment of the academic society in 1972, Korean allergists have made continuous efforts to elucidate pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic advances for allergic diseases. The present study aimed to summarize recent progress and explore future prospects of research performance by Korean allergists. We performed a comprehensive bibliometric analysis for research papers published in the Science Citation Index (SCI) or SCI-expanded journals by Korean allergists between 2009 and 2013. Research performance was quantitatively analyzed for the numbers of papers by publication year, research type, and main topic. In addition, the performance was also examined for qualitative indices, such as impact factor and citation number. A total of 1,091 papers were identified. The number of publication increased continuously, with an annual increase rate of 12.3%. Clinical and basic studies were the most frequent types of research, and recently the number of epidemiological studies has increased. By research topic, asthma was the most commonly studied, accounting for 20.9% of the total number of publications. Notably, the amount of rhinitis/rhinosinusitis research has risen steeply in 2013. Qualitative analyses also indicated continuous progress; the median impact factor of published journals increased from 1.918 in 2009 to 2.746 in 2013, yielding an annual increase rate of 7.4%. In conclusion, the present analyses identified a continuous increase in the research performance of Korean allergists over a recent 5 year period (2009-2013), both quantitatively and qualitatively. A more significant contribution is expected in the forthcoming era.",

    "abstract": "Because the increasing prevalence of allergies within the last 20 to 30 years cannot be explained by genetic changes, most allergists have tried to find answers in environmental and lifestyle changes, as reflected by the hygiene hypothesis. Environmental exposures during pregnancy and early infancy during critical periods of immune development can have profound effects on allergy development. Food intake is a well-known environmental factor that influences allergy development and three specific nutrients-vitamin D, omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and folate-have recently attracted attention.1\r\n\r\nThe methyl donor folate is a well-known nutrient supplement given during early pregnancy to prevent neutral tube defects in the developing fetus. A recent murine study has reported however that a maternal diet supplemented with folate increased the prevalence of allergic airway disease in offspring.2 Of the 82 genes that were found in that mouse study to be differentially methylated after in utero supplementation with a methyl-rich diet, runt-related transcription factor 3, which regulates allergic airway disease, was shown to be excessively methylated. These results suggest that prenatal dietary factors can increase the risk of allergy development in offspring through epigenetic mechanisms. Other nutrients, including methionine, vitamin B12, choline, and betaine, are also known to induce methylation changes in genes.3\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the results in a mouse model, a number of human studies have tried to identify an association between an increased intake of folate during pregnancy and the risk of asthma in childhood but have not produced any solid evidence to support such an association. A previous meta-analysis of the effect of prenatal folate on the risk of postnatal asthma also found no evidence of this association, although only 14 articles were assessed in that analysis.4 Likewise, in this current issue of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology Research, Wang et al.5 did not find any association between prenatal folate and a risk of asthma, other than a risk of wheeze in early childhood. A previous large cohort study by Haberg et al.6 reported that maternal folic acid supplementation during early pregnancy increased the risk of wheeze at 6-18 months postnatally. The weight of that study was calculated at 92% in the present meta-analysis of the relationship between maternal folic acid supplementation during pregnancy and the risk of wheeze in childhood, whereas the weights of the other 2 studies that found no relationship between these 2 factors were just 1.83% and 6.18%, respectively. However, 59.2% of children who developed a wheeze in the first 3 years after birth did not show this condition at the age of 6 years.7 Indeed, although wheeze is the main symptom of childhood asthma, it is not diagnostic for asthma. Moreover, in another earlier meta-analysis,4 when the data of Haberg et al. were removed, the association between prenatal folate and the risk of childhood wheeze became non-significant.\r\n\r\nWe conclude from the reported evidence to date that gene-environmental interactions affect the development of asthma and should therefore be considered when investigating the association between prenatal folate and asthma development. The data in many epidemiologic studies have been inconsistent in this regard. A single nucleotide polymorphism (C677T) in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene has been associated with folate metabolism, resulting in different blood concentrations of folate in individuals with different genotypes.8 The risk of asthma should be evaluated in offspring with differing genotypes to determine how the genotype interacts with prenatal folate intake. Given that folate is a well-known methyl donor, epigenetic changes should also be evaluated in a future study. Prenatal folate intake may alter the methylation of genes involved in the development of the immune system, increasing the risk of asthma in humans, as found in mouse studies.\r\n\r\nThe limitations of previous epidemiologic studies should also be considered in any future study. Because most pregnant women take folate to prevent neural tube defects in their offspring, a randomized control trial of the relationship between prenatal folate intake and asthma development in children could not be conducted within ethical guidelines. Indeed, there has been no previous randomized control trial in this area, which is an obstacle to any meta-analysis conclusion supported by strong evidence. Previous studies of the association between prenatal folate and asthma development have varied in terms of the type, time, dose, duration, and method for measuring folate exposure, the definition of outcomes, and the child's age at the evaluation of outcomes. Given these factors, a detailed and well-considered study design is needed.",

The occurrence of asthma patients within families indicates the likely presence of a genetic component. Ge-nome-wide linkage studies, biologically plausible candidate gene approaches, and genome-wide association scans (GWAS), have been performed over the past 20 years to search for the genetic background of asthma. Recently, whole genome sequencing is applied to reveal the genes (or SNPs) related with the traits of asthma and subphenotypes. However, SNPs discovered by several GWASs have a limited ability to explain genetic effects for the development of asthma despite the significant number of enrolled subjects (more than 10,000). Imprecise disease phenotypes have been regarded as the factor related to the limitations of GWAS. Asthma should be classified into specific phenotypes with the consideration of environmental factors to overcome missing inheritability.4,5",

    "abstract": "Dear Editor,\r\n\r\nI recently read the article Threshold for Positivity and Optimal Dipyrone Concentration in Flow Cytometry-Assisted Basophil Activation Test by Hagau et al., in the August 2013 issue of AAIR, where the authors assessed the usefulness of basophil activation tests (BATs) in the diagnosis of allergy to dipyrone.1 Allergy to dipyrone still represents a main concern and pyrazolones are considered a major cause of immediate IgE-mediated reactions to drugs in many countries.2 A case of drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptomatology (DRESS) attributed to dipyrone was recently reported; however, the authors could not rule out a possible interfering role attributed to herbal mixtures and other drugs.3 BATs represent an interesting tool to diagnose drug hypersensitivity, though with some criticism about their performance and interpretation.4 Basophils captured in flow cytometry by CD193 (CCR3)-phycoerythrin (PE) may be contaminated by CD3+ expressing cells, leading to possible bias.5 Despite this issue, Hagau and colleagues reported that commercial BAT equipped with a Flow2-CAST technique, showed a sensitivity as low as 0.25 µg/mL dipyrone, about 3 orders of magnitude lower than previous reported evidence.1,2 In the paper by Gomez et al., a commercial BAT using an anti-IgE/CD63 protocol (instead of a CCR3/CD63) reported that the lowest dose able to trigger CD63 upregulation over the 5% threshold, was 0.25 mg/mL dipyrone (matamizole); Hagau and co-workers used the same CD63% threshold.1 It apppears quite difficult to attribute this sensitivity improvement to superior BAT performance (at least in regards to the phenotyping protocol).5 CCR3 has been recently reviewed as a phenotyping marker and compared to other flow cytometry approaches.5 The eotaxin receptor is commonly expressed on eosinophils,6 together with CD63 (which is only present on activated cells)7; however, in a SSC (side scatter)/CCR3 scatter plot, eosinophils and basophils can be clearly separated and eosinophils should not affect a Flow2-CAST BAT performance. Yet CCR3 is downregulated during basophil activation5 and the proportion of gated basophils evaluated as up-regulating CD63 is higher than the same calculated on resting, non activated basophils, if gate is set at a fixed threshold (usually ≤5%). In a SSC/CCR3 gating plot basophils may be underestimated, due to CCR3 downregulation and contamination by SSClow scattered/CD3+ lymphocytes. If we consider that CCR3-PEbright basophils express homogeneously very low amount of membrane CD63 (for example 5%), a supposed reduction of 52% of 500 gated CCR3-PEbright cells (due to activation), might shift the threshold to 1.53%. This would mean that a proportion of CD63neg cells enter the right side of the threshold and lead to a higher CD63% evaluation. The bias may be significant when CD63% is close to the threshold. In the paper, 1 SI is calculated on the number of basophils and Table 11 reports 6/20 samples (30%) with 5.3< SI <9.1. The simultaneous evaluation of CD63-FITCMFI and CD63% should prevent a bias4; however, other bias can still occur. The operator might capture more CCR3-PEbright cells than the negative control: in this case, as CCR3-PEbright basophils are negative, the MFI ratio CD63pos/CD63neg may decrease while CD63% increase. In the lack of a CD3 marker, the operator may capture low SSC cells that express CCR3 but not CD63: this occurrence may also decrease the MFI ratio CD63neg/CD63pos and increase CD63%. Lowest doses of dipyrone may show a low expression of CD63-FITC (as median MFI) but relatively higher CD63% expressing basophils. This may prompt researchers to evaluate BAT as a valuable tool to probe very low doses of dipyrone in allergy; however, the absence of a flow cytometry plot reported by the authors1 makes it difficult to address this point and to elucidate possible causes about the high sensitivity reported.",

The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of smoking among asthma patients in South Korea and to compare the medication regimens of asthma patients who do and do not smoke.A cross-sectional survey was conducted from August 2010 to January 2011. Participating physicians (N=25) recorded demographic and clinical data on all asthma patients presenting during the study period (N=2,032), and then recruited a subset of patients (N=500) for the survey such that half were self-reported current smokers. Recruited patients were between the ages of 18 and 60.Among presenting asthma patients, 17.3% were current smokers, 19.2% were former smokers, and 63.5% had never smoked. Within the analyzable study population (N=471), 212 patients reported smoking currently, 79 smoking formerly, and 180 never smoking. Among current and former smokers, 79.7% and 81.0%, respectively, were men, while women represented 80.5% of patients who had never smoked. Agreement was strong between physician-determined smoking status and patient-reported smoking status (κ=0.82; P<0.001). However, asthma medication regimens examined according to GINA treatment steps did not differ by smoking status. In addition, mean quality of life scores and level of asthma control did not differ by smoking status.In South Korea, physicians are well aware of the smoking status of their patients. However, smoking status did not affect the prescribed medication regimens of this population of asthma patients.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of anaphylaxis has greatly evolved since its fortuitous discovery by Portier and Richert,1 but it is nowhere near enough. Uncertainty is more intensified in a lack of comprehensive understanding of predictors associated with severity or serious outcomes of anaphylaxis. In this sense, the article by Ye et al.2 in this issue of the AAIR is greatly informative. They collected as many as 1,806 cases from 15 nationwide university hospitals. Although their study was retrospectively designed, an enormous number of cases enhance the value of this report considering that the incidence of anaphylaxis in Korea was reported to be 0.014%.3 Major findings are summarized as follows: (1) the anaphylaxis rate in adults was significantly increased; (2) the important causes were drugs, food, and insect stings; (3) the severity was dependent on age, the presence of comorbidities, and specific causes; and (4) drug-associated anaphylaxis, multiorgan involvement, and older age were independent predictors of serious outcomes.\r\n\r\nA clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis in epidemiologic studies, especially with a retrospective design, is difficult to make. Both overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis can occur.4 Inaccuracy of diagnostic coding which was used to collect cases in the article by Ye et al.2 is one of the contributing factors. A study of food-induced acute allergic reactions encountered in the emergency department found that among 678 patients identified according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, 51% should actually have been classified as having anaphylaxis.5 Even if anaphylaxis is accurately recognized, only a part of patients sometimes receive the proper ICD codes. Decker et al.6 reported that as many as 25% of the anaphylaxis cases identified had received less specific codes. Even though there are concerns about accuracy in diagnosis, recent epidemiologic studies showing a steady increase in the rate of occurrence of anaphylaxis may enable us to say We are in the anaphylaxis epidemic era.6,7,8,9 Likewise, Ye et al.2 reported that the anaphylaxis rate in Korean adults was significantly increased from 7.74 per 100,000 in 2007 to 13.32 per 100,000 in 2011. This is the first report in Asia. Recently, social actions to meet the needs of growing numbers of people at high risk of anaphylaxis have been initiated and become more important. The anaphylaxis campaign in the United Kingdom is a good example.10 Taken together, further prospective investigations in conjunction with Asian nations are warranted to determine exact anaphylaxis rates in Asia.\r\n\r\nThe importance of risk prediction is growing in importance, both for the individual and at the public health level. Unfortunately, there is no prospectively validated grading system to link clinical features of anaphylaxis with its severity. Ye et al.2 demonstrated that the severity of anaphylactic reactions is significantly associated with age, comorbidities including diabetes and hypertension, and history of allergic disease. Among specific causes, radiocontrast media, antibiotics, and wheat flour were significant etiologies. However, interactions between the factors should be recognized, and combinations of factors rather than single factor need to be considered in predicting the severity of anaphylaxis. For example, in patients at less than 30 years of age, food (34.2%) was most significantly associated with anaphylaxis, while drugs (36.3%) were so in those at older than 51 years. Prediction of serious outcomes is likely to be more pragmatic than that of the severity of anaphylaxis. In the article by Ye et al.,2 serious outcome was defined as a new admission or prolongation of hospitalization related to anaphylaxis. Multiorgan involvement, drugs, and age were independent predictors of serious outcomes that were also important for the prediction of severity. Of particular interest, history of allergic disease was a risk factor for the development of severe anaphylaxis, but it was favorably associated with outcomes. They found that patients with history of allergic disease more quickly visited nearly clinics and more frequently used self-injectable epinephrine kits when their symptoms started. Specifically, this observation suggests us that we need to establish nationwide educational programs to improve social awareness of anaphylaxis.\r\n\r\nAnaphylaxis is a rare allergic reaction of sudden onset; however, if it occurs, it can be potentially life-threatening. For the prompt and proper management of anaphylaxis, identification of factors predicting severity and serious outcomes, development of comprehensive grading systems, and prospective validation are essential. Hopefully, factors demonstrated by the above-mentioned study will be utilized to provide better tools to predict subjects with anaphylaxis.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway is the most widely known pathomechanism of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). This study aimed to perform integrative analysis of transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling with network analysis to determine the novel pathogenic features of AERD. Ten patients with asthma including 5 patients with AERD and another 5 patients with aspirin tolerant asthma (ATA) were enrolled. Nasal scraping was performed and nasal mucosa was used in omics profiling. Peripheral eosinophil counts, sputum eosinophil counts, fractional exhaled nitric oxide levels, and pulmonary function test results were evaluated. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs), differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and differentially correlated genes (DCGs) between patients with AERD and those with ATA were analyzed. Network analysis using ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was performed to determine the gene connection network and signaling pathways. In total, 1,736 DEGs, 1,401 DMPs, and 19 pairs for DCGs were identified. Among DCGs, genes related to vesicle transport (e.g., RAB3B and STX2) and sphingolipid dysregulation (e.g., SMPD3) were found to be hypo-methylated and up-regulated in AERD. Using the canonical pathway analysis of IPA with 78 asthma-related DEGs, signaling pathways of T helper cell differentiation/activation and Fcε receptor I were generated. Up-regulation of RORγt and FcER1A were noted in AERD. Gene expression levels of RAB3B, SYNE1, STX2, SMPD3 and RORγt were significantly associated with sputum eosinophil counts. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed and mRNA expression levels of STX2, SMPD3, RORγt, and FcER1A were significantly higher in AERD compared to ATA. Distinct pathogenic features were identified by using integrative multi-omics data analysis in patients with AERD.",

    "abstract": "Chronic urticaria (CU) is a common problem with a high disease burden that has a significant negative impact on quality of life. Many patients are undertreated, and awareness of management strategies is low among clinicians. The present study aimed to improve understanding of CU from the patients' perspective, including the disease burden and current healthcare system use. Adult patients who presented to our referral hospital for CU treatment completed self-report questionnaires about demographics, clinical characteristics of CU, the impact of CU on daily life, unmet needs, and the history of medical service usage. This self-report survey included 127 participants (females, 57.0%; mean age, 42.0 ± 13.6 years; mean CU duration, 1.8 ± 3.4 years); 51.6% reported frequent discomfort with CU in daily life, including 44.1% of those who reported a good response to medication. More than half of the respondents reported a depressed mood and anxiety. Although 46.4% of the respondents reported that urticaria completely disappeared while on medication, only 10% were satisfied with the CU management provided by primary care hospitals. The principal cause of dissatisfaction was that they did not know the cause of CU (68.4% of patients). In total, 55% of the patients visited 2 or more hospitals before presenting to our referral hospital and 6.3% had tried folk remedies. In conclusion, most patients report that CU is not adequately controlled. Therefore, in addition to appropriate medication, information on the cause of CU, long-term treatment plan, medication safety, and expected prognosis is required to meet patients' needs.",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronically recurrent inflammatory skin disorder characterized by pruritus, a specific distribution, and a family history. It has recently been reported that the incidence of AD has increased in Korea.1,2 Pruritus, sleep loss, dietary restrictions, and psychosocial factors significantly decrease the quality of life for AD patients.3,4 Recently, the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology published the PRACTALL consensus report for the diagnosis and treatment of AD in children and adults.5 The report suggests a stepwise management that includes the addition of multiple therapeutic agents on the basis of the disease severity.\r\n\r\nThe PRACTALL consensus report defines severe or recalcitrant AD as AD that cannot be controlled with topical treatment.6 In the 2009 Korean Work Group Report on the treatment of severe/recalcitrant AD, severe AD is defined as AD with a SCORAD index higher than 50 and that cannot be controlled with conventional treatment,7 while the 2008 Guideline of Atopic Dermatitis in Korean Children defines severe AD by a SCORAD index higher than 40.8 Specific criteria for the definition of recalcitrant and severe AD are necessary.\r\n\r\nFor the management of severe AD, the PRACTALL consensus report recommends systemic therapy such as antimicrobial treatment, systemic corticosteroids, cyclosporin A, azathioprine, anti-histamines, phototherapy, and immunotherapy. Several reports, including the 2009 Korean Work Group Report, have described intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment as one of various immunoregulatory treatments. Nevertheless, this treatment was not included in the PRACTALL report.7,9,10\r\n\r\nIVIg treatment displays immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties, and its effectiveness in several immune-mediated conditions such as Kawasaki disease and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura has been demonstrated.11 IVIg is considered a candidate for the treatment of AD because of its ability to downregulate T-cell function, particularly interleukin-4 production.12,13 A small number of observations on the efficiency of IVIg in AD have been reported, but prospective and randomized studies for its clinical efficiency in childhood AD are sparse. A randomized, placebo-controlled prospective study in childhood AD patients is therefore required.14\r\n\r\nJee et al.14 recently reported therapeutic effects of IVIg in childhood AD; however, this study involved moderate to severe AD patients, and it did not include severe AD patients because the disease severity might have affected the treatment results. Further randomized studies with strict criteria for recalcitrant/severe AD are warranted. In addition, the IVIg effective dose, the dosing interval for initiation and maintenance, the identification of biomarkers (e.g., ECP, ICAM-1, and IL-5/INF-gamma) to determine efficiency, and clear criteria for IVIg indications all require consideration.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we lack evidence-based data supporting the use of IVIg and other immunomodulators in childhood AD. Before IVIg can be recommended, its cost-benefit ratio, course, duration, and adverse reactions compared with alternative therapeutic options must be determined. The effects of novel therapies such as IVIg for recalcitrant/severe AD patients should be verified through repeated research and numerous research discussions.",

Here we report a case of a new sensitization to house dust mites during the follow-up period in a 37-year-old female patient with OA induced by cefteram pivoxil powder (cefteram powder). She was previously diagnosed with OA caused by inhalation of cefteram powder. Consequently, she left her job and had been well for 9 subsequent years. She began to experience aggravation of her rhinitis and asthmatic symptoms again several months prior to presentation. Her skin-prick test results had converted to strongly positive responses to two types of house dust mites. The serum levels of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and the total and specific immunoglobulin (Ig)E levels against the two types of house dust mites were elevated. An inhalation challenge test with Dermatophagoides farinae was performed, and significant bronchoconstriction (21.1% reduction in the forced expiratory volume in the first second) with asthma symptoms was observed at 10 minutes. To our knowledge, this is the first case demonstrating a new sensitization to house dust mites in a patient with OA caused by cefteram powder. Regular monitoring, including skin-prick tests and measurement of specific serum IgE/ECP levels, may help to screen potential cases.",

    "abstract": "The definition of remodeling is model again or differently, reconstruct. In the airway, reaction to chronic inflammatory conditions can lead to changes in the structural components of the airway wall, known as airway remodeling. Airway remodeling in response to allergens is a well-known key feature of pathogenesis in asthma, a representative allergic disease of the lower airway.1-3 The structural changes in airway remodeling comprise epithelial disruption, smooth muscle hypertrophy, goblet cell hyperplasia, subepithelial fibrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, and vascular remodeling such as neovascularization.4 The nasal and bronchial mucosa present similarities, and epidemiologic studies have revealed that allergic rhinitis and asthma are closely related with each other.5 Therefore, once regarded as two separate disease entities, they are now considered to be a common disease with different clinical manifestations. Thus, airway remodeling is presumed to occur in allergic rhinitis.6 Many previous studies have shown that airway remodeling exists in allergic rhinitis, although it seems to be less extensive than that in asthma.7-11\r\n\r\nSeveral studies have been performed to elucidate the epithelial changes in the nasal mucosa of patients with allergic rhinitis. An electron microscopic study has revealed that damaged epithelium and tight junctions of the epithelial cells were found in the nasal mucosa of patients with allergic rhinitis.12 Allergic patients also present a marked goblet cell hyperplasia, and have a thicker epithelium than normal persons.8,13 However, there was a contradictory result that patients with perennial rhinitis have an epithelium thickness comparable with that of normal persons.14 In addition, the epithelial damage is less extensive in the nose than in the bronchi of the same asthmatic patients.15 Also, there is pseudo-thickening of the reticular basement membrane caused by collagen deposition in allergic rhinitis, although the extent was less severe than in asthma.9 Furthermore, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), major proteolytic enzymes that are involved in extracellular matrix turnover, is increased in the nasal mucosa 10 hours after nasal allergen challenge.16 Expression of tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) mRNA was also increased in the nasal mucosa of patients with perennial allergic rhinitis.7\r\n\r\nIn terms of vascular remodeling, only few studies have been conducted to evaluate the association between angiogenesis and nasal airway remodeling until now. Mori et al.17 have reported that the hypervascularity and overexpression of the platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor, a potent angiogenic factor, were observed in the nasal mucosa of allergic rhinitis. However, the mechanism and exact process of remodeling, especially regarding angiogenesis, is still poorly understood in allergic rhinitis.\r\n\r\nIn the present issue of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology Research, Moon et al.18 addressed this topic that angiogenic factors can be associated with nasal airway remodeling. The authors assessed the role of representative angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), in the development of nasal airway remodeling in response to chronic allergic inflammation. Though the interpretation of the data is complicated, the results provide interesting information. After repetitive intranasal challenge with ovalbumin for 3 months in experimental mice, significant nasal airway remodeling, such as increases in eosinophil infiltration, subepithelial fibrosis, goblet cell count, and MMP-9/TIMP-1 expression, was developed as compared with control mice challenged with PBS. Of particularly interest, these abnormal responses were inhibited following systemic administration of SU1498, a VEGF receptor inhibitor, and/or AG1296, a PDGF receptor inhibitor. As far as we know, this is the first attempt to clarify the association between inhibitors of potent angiogenic factors and nasal airway remodeling in allergic rhinitis, and the result is noteworthy.\r\n\r\nThis result provides indirect evidence that angiogenic factors may play some role in nasal airway remodeling. Increased eosinophil infiltration was consistently inhibited by blocking the function of angiogenic factors in this study. It is well known that eosinophils are the main effector cells of allergic inflammation and an important source of VEGF along with other inflammatory and structural cells in inflamed tissue.19 Eosinophils are a source of several molecules, such as fibroblast growth factor-2, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 that are implicated in tissue remodeling processes.20 In addition, PDGF is a physiologically important activator of eosinophils in pulmonary inflammation associated with asthma.21 Furthermore, the authors found that subepithelial fibrosis along with MMP-9/TIMP-1 expression were also influenced by the inhibitors of angiogenic factors. This is in accordance of the previous report that there is a significant correlation between VEGF and MMP-9 levels in asthmatic patients.22 Also, VEGF receptor inhibitors were effective in reducing MMP-9 expression and reversing all pathophysiologic signs in an asthma murine model. Therefore, Moon et al.18 hypothesized that increased vascular permeability caused by angiogenic factors after chronic allergen challenges can lead to leakage of inflammatory cells, such as eosinophils. Subsequent augmented eosinophilic inflammation may influence MMP-9/TIMP-1 and subepithelial fibrosis.\r\n\r\nIn the study, the authors only confirmed that inhibition of angiogenic factors can reduce the nasal airway remodeling. However, the authors did not provide an evidence of increased neovascularization in the nasal mucosa. This may be a limitation of the study, and further studies are necessary to confirm the exact relationship between angiogenesis and nasal airway remodeling.\r\n\r\nRecently, scientific concern with regard to the nasal airway remodeling in allergic rhinitis has grown. Clarifying responsible mechanism for nasal airway remodeling is necessary in allergic rhinitis in order to better understand the underlying pathophysiology and develop new treatment strategy. In addition, elucidating the role of angiogenic factors in nasal airway remodeling in the study may develop new treatment strategies in patients with allergic rhinitis in the future. In a clinical aspect, however, further studies regarding demonstrating dose-response relationship between anti-angiogenic agents and airway remodeling and comparing treatment efficacy of airway remodeling among well-known anti-inflammatory drugs (steroid) and anti-angiogenic agents are needed to investigate the clinical applicability of these anti-angiogenic agents.",

    "abstract": "Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an epithelial cell-derived cytokine expressed in skin, gut, lungs, and thymus. TSLP signals via the TSLP receptor (TSLPR), a heterodimer of the IL-7 receptor α chain and TSLPR chain. The TSLPR chain is closely related to the common receptor γ chain, which is expressed on a wide range of cell types in allergic inflammation. TSLP exerts a profound influence on the polarization of dendritic cells to drive T helper (Th) 2 cytokine production.1 TSLP also promotes T-cell proliferation directly in response to T-cell receptor activation and Th2 cytokine production, and supports B-cell expansion and differentiation. TSLP further amplifies Th2 cytokine production by mast cells and natural killer T cells.2 These properties confer a critical role on TSLP in driving Th2-mediated inflammation. Several studies have suggested an active role of TSLP in allergic diseases, including atopic dermatitis, asthma, and allergic rhinitis, because increased TSLP expression was noted in target tissues.3,4 Additionally, increased TSLP expression is seen in inflammatory conditions in response to a wide variety of allergens and viral infections5-7 and in eosinophilic esophagitis.8,9 Regarding the role of TSLP in nasal polyps, one study suggested increased TSLP expression in nasal polyp tissue, but it did not demonstrate any relationship between TSLP and any major inflammatory parameter, such as eosinophilic infiltration.4\r\n\r\nThe study by Kimura et al.10 in this issue of the AAIR clearly demonstrated increased in vivo expression of TSLP mRNA and protein in the epithelial and infiltrating cells of patients with nasal polyps regardless of their atopic status. Furthermore, they showed that the TSLP expression correlated closely with the degree of eosinophilic inflammation and local IgE level in nasal polyp tissue. These findings suggest a potential role of TSLP in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation found in nasal polyps via regulating Th2 and eosinophilic inflammation. Moreover, the authors localized the source of TSLP within the nasal polyp tissue, and noted TSLP expression in inflammatory cells, various structural cells, and epithelial cells. These levels correlated significantly with the number of eosinophils in nasal polyp tissue, indicating that TSLP derived primarily from epithelial cells has a role in regulating eosinophilic inflammation in nasal polyps, possibly by driving Th2 type inflammation, which upregulates eosinophilic chemoattractants.\r\n\r\nSeveral points should be clarified in future studies. First, increased TSLP expression was noted in both atopic and non-atopic groups. In the atopic group, allergen exposure could increase TSLP expression, as described in previous studies, because it was demonstrated that allergen exposure increased TSLP production from bronchial epithelial cells, which would enhance Th2-derived inflammation in asthmatic airways.11,12 However, the mechanism of elevated TSLP expression in the nasal polyp tissue of the non-atopic group is not understood. Second, because the mast cell is a major inflammatory cell in nasal polyp tissue and TSLP can active mast cells as well as eosinophils, further studies should investigate the roles of TSLP in the survival and recruitment of mast cells in nasal polyps.\r\n\r\nRecent interesting findings suggest that respiratory viral infections and the recruitment of Th2 cytokine-producing cells amplify Th2 inflammation via the induction of TSLP.5 The clinical features of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) include a very high prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis in which Th2 and eosinophilic inflammations are the major findings.13 Compared with other types of nasal polyp, the increased activated status of eosinophils is a characteristic finding of chronic nasal polyp tissue in AERD patients.14 In this study, the subjects were classified into two groups according to their atopic status. They did not enroll nasal polyps from AERD patients. Thus, the next strategy is to evaluate the role of TSLP in chronic eosinophilic inflammation of nasal polyp tissue in AERD patients compared with non-AERD patients.\r\n\r\nSeveral studies suggest that AERD develops as a result of chronic viral infection,15-17 and respiratory viral infections are the most frequent exacerbating factors in AERD patients.18 Moreover, a recent study showed that two genetic polymorphisms of the Toll-like receptor, TLR3, at -299698G>T and 293391G>A, were associated with the AERD phenotype.19 Further studies are needed to investigate the role of TSLP in the development and exacerbation of symptoms in AERD patients.",

    "abstract": "Achieving asthma control is central to optimizing patient quality of life and clinical outcomes. This definition of asthma control has two components: achieving current clinical asthma control and reducing future risk.1 The level of clinical asthma control is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) using a composite score comprising five measures. Reducing asthma exacerbations is a key factor for preventing future risk.2 The regular use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) is essential for controlling asthma symptoms and reducing asthma exacerbations. A previous study found that a history of exacerbations, poor asthma control, poor inhaler technique, a history of lower respiratory tract infections, poor adherence to medication, and the presence of co-morbid conditions all predicted the future risk of asthma exacerbation.3\r\n\r\nMost control medications, including ICS, are delivered via inhalation. The correct use of inhaler devices is critical for optimizing drug delivery and obtaining clinical benefits.4 However, inhaler use still represents an important challenge for most asthmatic patients. The correct inhalation maneuver differs markedly for different inhaler types. The problems and prevalence of incorrect inhaler use have been the subject of several recent reviews.5-7 Improper technique remains common for both metered dose (MDIs) and dry power (DPIs) inhalers, and was associated with poor clinical control and increased unscheduled health-care demands in asthma clinics.8 Inhaler mishandling continues to be common among experienced outpatients referred to asthma clinics and is associated with increased unscheduled health care resource use.8 Nevertheless, inhaler technique status has not been included in most analyses examining the predictors of asthma exacerbation. Poor adherence to asthma medication is a dilemma, as it decreases the chance of achieving and maintaining proper asthma control. Education of both patients and health care professionals regarding proper inhaler technique will improve asthma control.9,10\r\n\r\nThe study by Price et al.11 in this issue is the first to compare outcomes for asthmatic patients prescribed the same inhaler device versus mixed device types for asthma control and relief therapy. This retrospective observational study identified patients with asthma (age 4-80 years) in a large primary care database who were prescribed an ICS. They compared outcomes for patients prescribed the same breath-actuated inhaler (BAI) for both the ICS controller and salbutamol reliever versus those using two devices (a BAI for the controller and a pressurized metered-dose inhaler [pMDI] for the reliever). Patients prescribed the same device (n=3,428) were significantly more likely to achieve asthma control (adjusted odds ratio, 1.15) and had significantly lower severe exacerbation rates (adjusted rate ratio, 0.79; 95%) than those prescribed two devices (n=5,452). These finding suggest that prescribing the same device for both ICS and reliever therapy improves asthma control.\r\n\r\nA previous study evaluated the skill at handling inhalers and factors associated with these skills in 145 patients with asthma under the care of asthma specialists in Korea.12 When their skill at using the inhalers was assessed visually, the performance was inadequate for 12.8% of the participants using Turbuhaler, 6.2% using Diskus, and 23.4% using pMDIs. Most showed excellent skill at using their inhalers. However, older age and the absence of previous instructions for handling the inhalers were associated with inadequate techniques, indicating that this population requires more education to improve their inhalation technique. Several studies used repeated inhaler instructions as a method to improve inhaler technique.9,13 Educational adherence support should be a collaborative effort between the patient and health care professional.14\r\n\r\nOne limitation of this study is that it includes the potential for unrecognized confounding factors, including selection bias, as it was a retrospective study.11 This study examined a database of primary physicians in the U.K. As such, there were missing data for some patients, including smoking history, which could influence outcomes. There is no assurance that patients actually took the medications as prescribed. However, this study enrolled a larger cohort of patients using ICS, included for a 1-year outcome period, and provided good evidence of improved asthma outcome with improved adherence to medications using the same BAI device for both controller ICS and reliever salbutamol therapy.",

    "abstract": "The most important peach fruit allergen is Pru p 3, followed by Pru p 1, Pru p 4, and Pru p 7. We aimed to assess their role in subjects with peach fruit-induced allergy (anaphylaxis and OAS) and compare skin prick tests (SPT) vs. specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE) for predicting anaphylaxis. We also selected a control group. SPT included prevalent inhalant and plant food allergens plus peach peel extract. The sIgE to Pru p 1, Pru p 3, Pru p 4, and Pru p 7 were quantified. Compared with controls (n = 42), cases (n = 41) were younger (P = 0.003), more frequently female (P < 0.05) and had higher SPT positivity to peach peel (44% vs. 2.4%, P < 0.0001). There were significant differences in sensitization to several pollens: Olea europaea, Artemisia vulgaris, Prunus persica, Platanus acerifolia (all P < 0.001); and fruits: apple (P < 0.04), peanut (P < 0.002), tomato (P < 0.005), and melon (P < 0.05). Pru p 3 sIgE was detected in 61% of all cases (85% anaphylaxis and 38% OAS; P < 0.01 each) and 5% of controls (P < 0.001). Pru p 4 sIgE was present in 19% of cases and 7% of controls. The sIgE to Pru p 1 and Pru p 7 were not found. The odds ratio to predict anaphylaxis for peach peel SPT was 113 (confidence interval [CI], 20-613; P < 0.0001); for sIgE to Pru p 3, 22 (CI, 5.3-93; P < 0.0001); and for SPT positivity to selected plant food allergens, 5 (CI, 1-19; P < 0.05). In our study group, SPT with peel peach extract was a better predictor of anaphylaxis than Pru p 3 sIgE or other variables considered. The role of sIgE to Pru p 1, Pru p 4, and Pru p 7 seemed negligible.",

    "abstract": "The present study focused on identifying the usual methods of cooking walnuts in order to investigate changes in walnut allergen activity caused by cooking and evaluated the allergenic changes in walnut proteins within raw, dry-fried and boiled walnuts. Previous studies have reported a decrease in the allergen activity of walnut by thermal processing methods, which are not used in Korean kitchens, such as dry-frying and boiling. In Korea, Walnuts are consumed with rice and usually boiled and stir-fried with seasoning. Thus, the present study clarified the protein bands corresponding to raw walnuts and confirmed that the patterns of each walnut protein differ depending on cooking methods. This concern may be a very crucial point to understand the other tree nuts allergy as well as walnut allergy. The results of the present study differ from those of previous studies performed in Europe, although further studies with older participants are needed in order to draw more definite conclusions on lipid transfer protein (LTP). The other crucial point is that the findings of the present study support existing findings that the allergenic components of walnut have varying antigenicity depending on cooking methods. The allergenic components of walnut identified using diagnostic tests for walnut allergic patients could be reduced in walnuts cooked by different processing techniques. The allergenic components of walnut have varying allergen activity depending on cooking methods. Therefore, the allergenic components of walnuts identified using diagnostic tests for walnut allergic patients could allow physicians to prescribe consumption of walnuts cooked by different processing techniques to patients with walnut allergy.",

    "abstract": "A growing number of individuals are developing allergic diseases due to pollen exposure. Seasonal variations and increased pollen concentrations have occurred with the increased rates of allergic sensitization among both children and adults. Temperature significantly influences pollination, particularly in spring- and early summer-flowering plants, with weather conditions affecting pollen allergen levels. Human activities, including agriculture and deforestation, increase carbon emissions, leading to higher atmospheric CO₂ levels that may enhance allergenic plant productivity. Climate change affects the range of allergenic plant species and length of pollen season. Studies indicate that higher CO₂ and temperature levels are linked to increased pollen concentrations and allergenicity, whereas atmospheric fungal concentrations have declined annually over the past 25 years. Despite more intense precipitation in summer and autumn, the number of rainy days has decreased across all seasons. This concentration of rainfall over shorter periods likely prolongs the dry season and shortens the period of fungal sporulation. Future climate changes, including atmospheric dryness, drought, and desertification could further decrease allergenic fungal sporulation. It remains unclear whether the inverse relationship between pollen and fungal concentrations and distributions directly results from climate change. It is crucial to evaluate the patterns of aeroallergens and their associated health risks.",

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by various factors, particularly transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, orchestrates airway remodeling. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), an important serine-threonine phosphatase, is involved in TGF-β1 production and EMT. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as novel players in regulating EMT. Here, we aimed to explore the effects and mechanisms of action of lincR-PPP2R5C, a lncRNA that affects PP2A activity, on airway remodeling in a mouse model of chronic allergic asthma. LincR-PPP2R5C knockout (KO) alleviated inflammatory responses in house dust mite (HDM)-induced chronic allergic asthma. Moreover, airway remodeling and EMT were reduced in lung tissues of lincR-PPP2R5C KO mice. HDM extract induced EMT in airway epithelial cells, which was decreased following lincR-PPP2R5C KO. Mechanistically, lincR-PPP2R5C deficiency enhanced PP2A activity, which inhibited TGF-β1 production in epithelial cells. In conclusion, lincR-PPP2R5C deficiency prevented HDM-induced airway remodeling in mice by reversing EMT, which was mediated by the PP2A/TGF-β1 signaling pathway. Thus, lncRNAs,",

    "abstract": "The Working Group on Severe Asthma of the Korean Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology recently published an expert opinion paper on the management of severe asthma in Korea. When developing a consensus, the working group encountered several diagnostic and treatment issues and decided to perform a questionnaire survey of Korean specialists with regard to severe asthma. An e-mail with a uniform resource locator link to the questionnaire was sent to 121 asthma specialists, of whom 44.6% responded. The most commonly accepted definitions of severe asthma were a history of fatal exacerbation or an asthma-triggered need for mechanical ventilation, 3-4 oral corticosteroid (OCS) bursts/year, and maintenance of OCS therapy for 3-6 months per year. Before diagnosing severe asthma, most physicians contemplate chest computed tomography, seek to control chronic rhinosinusitis, and consider poor inhaler compliance. For patients with uncontrolled severe asthma accompanied by type 2 (T2)-high inflammation, most biologics available in Korea were considered appropriate, but gaps were apparent in terms of T2-low asthma treatments. These findings about specialist perception of diagnosis and treatment of severe asthma will inform the use of emerging new drugs and facilitate personalized therapy.",

    "abstract": "Although most influenza A virus infections result in self-limited uncomplicated disease, it causes significant morbidity and mortality in children.1 Influenza A accounts for the highest rates of influenza-related hospital admissions, especially in young children and elderly people, and pneumonia is one of the most common complications (10%-26%).2,3 Furthermore, it was previously reported that 35% of influenza A (H1N1)-related deaths in children were due to pneumonia.4 In addition to seasonal influenza A infection, there was an outbreak of pandemic H1N1 influenza A viral infection (pandemic H1N1 influenza) that was first reported in patients from Mexico and the United States in early April 2009. An outbreak of pandemic H1N1 influenza during 2009-2010 was responsible for severe respiratory disease and death, especially in children and elderly people with chronic respiratory diseases, even though its overall impact did not appear to cause more severe disease than seasonal influenza A.5,6 A recently published case series of 122 children with pneumonia due to pandemic H1N1 influenza reported up to a 60% prevalence of underlying medical conditions, including asthma (29%), and described the need for intensive care in 20% of patients and mechanical ventilation in 10%.7\r\n\r\nThe relationship between viral infection and asthma has been investigated during the last few decades and evidence for such a link has been reported; however, the question of whether all respiratory viruses are equipotent remains unclear. As described in a recent review by Holt et al.8, it was assumed that respiratory syncitial virus (RSV) was overwhelmingly the most important trigger of severe lower respiratory illness (LRI) in the first two years of life, and compelling data on the association between early RSV-induced LRI and subsequent development of persistent asthma have been published from independent prospective cohort studies. More recently, it was revealed that the contribution of human rhinovirus to LRI during infancy and the preschool years was considerably higher than previously believed, and that these infections are strongly linked to the risk of subsequent asthma.8 Although the pathogenic nature of the relationship between asthma and H1N1 viral infection is unclear, several studies have reported that asthma is a risk factor for worsening respiratory conditions in pandemic H1N1 influenza patients.6,7 However, there are several other reports that pandemic H1N1 influenza causes high rates of severe LRI (pneumonia, atelectasis), aggravation of asthma, and admission to intensive care units in patients with exisiting asthma or atopy.6,9,10 In a recent animal study, high concentrations of virus-infected cells were found in the central and lower respiratory tracts of ferrets inoculated with H1N1 influenza virus compared to ferrets inoculated with seasonal influenza virus. This result suggests that pandemic H1N1 influenza replicated more extensively in the lower respiratory tract, causing more severe LRI than that caused by seasonal influenza virus.11\r\n\r\nIn this issue of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology Research, Kim et al.12 report an increased prevalence of H1N1-induced severe lower respiratory tract disease in children with atopic sensitization. In aforementioned study, a high proportion of atopic children with pandemic H1N1 influenza had atelectasis and required ICU care and oxygen and steroid therapy. Based on these findings and the results of several animal studies, the authors suggest that atopic sensitization combined with pandemic H1N1 influenza infection can induce severe LRI. In addition, eosinophil recruitment into the lungs and enhancement of IL-10 production from CD4+ T cells may play a role in the development of severe LRI observed in pandemic H1N1 influenza patients.13,14 Due to the small sample size, Kim et al.12 could not confirm whether atopic sensitization itself, and not asthma, was associated with pandemic H1N1 influenza-induced severe LRI. Although the authors could not directly confirm that the atopic sensitization itself was the cause of severe LRI in pandemic H1N1 influenza, they demonstrated this relationship using proper statistical analyses. There was a recent study that also supports the notion that pandemic H1N1 influenza greatly increases the risk of severe LRI regardless of the severity of previous asthma or the presence of asthma in patients with atopic sensitization.9 In addition, patients with atopy have been shown to exhibit low natural killer cell activity,15 suggesting that both abnormal innate immune responses in atopic individuals and the affinity of the pandemic H1N1 virus for the respiratory tract may lead to increased susceptibility to severe LRI induced by pandemic H1N1 influenza.\r\n\r\nBased on several recent studies, including the study by Kim et al.12 reported in this issue, it is suggested that atopic sensitization itself can cause severe LRI. This has highlighted the importance of influenza prevention through vaccination, especially in children with atopic sensitization, even if the patients have no obvious history of clinical asthma or any other allergic disease.",

    "abstract": "Allergen sensitization and Th2 responses are the major factors predisposing to the development of allergic asthma.1,2 This was confirmed by a Korean cohort study that enrolled subjects living in urban (Seoul) or rural areas.3 The present study summarized the clinical features of adult patients with asthma who were admitted to a single university hospital in an urban area (Seoul) over a 6-year period.4 The authors reported that the atopy rate was 50%, which was higher than that reported several years earlier in the same city.5,6 However, asthma has heterogeneous phenotypes, and the atopy rate in Korea is increasing7 and differs according to patient age, with significantly higher atopy rates in the younger population.3 Therefore, if the authors were to dissect the clinical features according to the age of the study subjects, the results may differ.\r\n\r\nThe skin prick test is an essential method for screening atopy status and identifying the causative agents. The authors used 45 antigens to identify the causative agents. Although the authors did not list the skin prick test antigens, 45 inhalant allergens are not enough to identify the causative agents in adult asthmatic patients considering the major causative allergens in our environment.8 The clinical features of asthmatic patients may differ depending on the sensitizing allergens. In this study, the authors grouped all pollens into one group, which may give wrong information, as three seasonal pollen groups exist in Korea-tree, grass, and weed pollens- and sensitive patients show increased eosinophil counts with symptom exacerbation during the corresponding pollen season. Moreover, the results may differ depending on whether the patients are sensitive to multiple indoor and outdoor allergens or to a single allergen. We suggest comparing the patients sensitive to house dust mites alone with those who have combined sensitivity to one specific pollen or animal dander independently. More ideally, in most studies, the enrolled subjects were identified by positive bronchial challenge tests to the corresponding allergen.8\r\n\r\nNo published data suggest that asthmatic patients sensitized to fungal allergens present with a more severe phenotype. From this study, it is not clear whether the patients were sensitized fungal allergens alone or to multiple allergens, including house dust mites and pollens. Considering the cross-reactivity between Alternaria and Cladosporium spp,9,10 the same study subjects may have been sensitive to both groups. Moreover, the clinical severity of asthma depends on various other clinical parameters, such as smoking, the duration of asthma, and co-morbid conditions, especially chronic rhinitis.11 Furthermore, the severity of asthma can be determined by asthma control status, episodes of asthma exacerbations, and anti-asthmatic medication requirements.12,13 A Korean cohort study suggested that smoking status, male gender, and longer duration of asthma are significant predisposing factors for severe asthma.14\r\n\r\nThis study provides recent data on the clinical characteristics of adult asthma in a single university hospital for a 6-year period. Further studies are needed in a larger multicenter cohort that dissects the clinical phenotypes, including the clinical course and therapeutic response.",

    "abstract": "Dyspnea is not widely utilized as an indicator of asthma provocation despite its universal presentation. We hypothesized that dyspnea severity was proportionate with the lung function decline, methacholine dose-step, and the degree of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR).We retrospectively analyzed 73 children's bronchial provocation test data with an assessment of dyspnea at every dose-step. Dyspnea severity was scored using a modified Borg (mBorg) scale. A linear mixed effect analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between the mBorg scale, the percentage fall in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) (ΔFEV1%), the methacholine dose-step, and the degree of BHR (BHR grade).Subjects were divided into 5 BHR groups based on their last methacholine dose-steps. The mBorg scores did not differ significantly among BHR groups (P=0.596, Kruskal-Wallis test). The linear mixed effect analysis showed that ΔFEV1% was affected by the methacholine dose-step (P<0.001) and BHR grade (P<0.001). The mBorg score was affected by the dose-step (P<0.001) and BHR grade (P=0.019). We developed a model to predict the mBorg score and found that it was affected by the methacholine dose-step and ΔFEV1%, elevating it by a score of 0.039 (χ² [1]=21.06, P<0.001) and 0.327 (χ² [1]=47.45, P<0.001), respectively. A significant interaction was observed between the methacholine dose-step and ΔFEV1% (χ² [1]=16.20, P<0.001).In asthmatic children, inhaled methacholine, as well as the degree of BHR and lung function decline, may affect dyspnea perception during the bronchial provocation test.

    "abstract": "Ambient and household air pollution are negatively associated with human health and act as the leading environmental cause of mortality and morbidity.Especially in the Asia Pacific region, air pollution has become a serious issue in recent years because of its large population, rapid industrialization and urbanization.Particulate matter (PM), one of the major air pollutants, is found ubiquitously and considered an important environmental threat to human health.2][3][4][5][6][7][8] In particular, such harmful effects are notable in children who are in rapid growth and development. 9Recent studies have even suggested that PM may be a possible carrier for COVID-19 infection. 3bient PM is a complex mixture of solid and liquid particles, and its hazardous effects on humans are influenced by sources, chemical composition, sizes and so on. 10Airborne PM is primarily derived from either natural or anthropogenic sources such as forest fires, sea salts, biologic materials, biomass combustion, vehicle exhaust, power plants and cooking.In contrast, PM2.5, also called fine particles, are mainly generated from precursors emitted in the air including sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds and ammonia. 11The route of exposure to PM is mainly through inhalation, while PM is also penetrated into the human gastrointestinal tract or skin.In this regard, the ambient PM2.5 level is regarded as an environmental risk that should be lowered because of its small size and toxic components. 12Particularly in Asia, the high level of ambient PM2.5 is a problem to seriously be taken, since annual mean concentrations are substantially high in many developing countries and exceed the World Health Organization's Air Quality Guideline even in developed countries. 13 has been reported that PM can trigger acute exacerbation of pre-existing asthma and may be linked to new-onset asthma. 14A systematic review of panel studies in children showed that the overall effect of either PM10 or PM2.5 on peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and lower respiratory tract symptoms were statistically significant, and that the effects of PM2.5 appeared to be greater than those of PM10. 15A meta-analysis of 26 time-",
