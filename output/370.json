    "abstract": "The use of plastic mulch in agriculture has increased dramatically in the last 10 years throughout the world. This increase is due to benefits such as increase in soil temperature, reduced weed pressure, moisture conservation, reduction of certain insect pests, higher crop yields, and more efficient use of soil nutrients. However, disposing of used plastic films, which cause pollution, has led to development of photodegradable and biodegradable mulches. Here we review the use of plastic mulches in agriculture, with special reference to biodegradable mulches. Major topics discussed are (1) history of plastic mulch and impact on crop yield and pest management, (2) limitations of polyethylene mulches and potential alternatives, (3) biodegradable and photodegradable plastic mulches, (4) field performance of biodegradable mulches, and (5) use of biodegradable plastic mulches in organic production. We found that (1) despite multiple benefits, removal and disposal of conventional polyethylene mulches remains a major agronomic, economic, and environmental constraint; (2) early use of photodegradable plastic mulch during the 1970s and 1980s, wrongly named biodegradable mulch films, discouraged adoption of new biodegradable mulch films because they were too expensive and their breakdown was unpredictable; (3) biodegradable plastic films are converted through microbial activity in the soil to carbon dioxide, water, and natural substances; (4) polymers such as poly(lactic acid), poly(butylene adipate-coterephthalate), poly(ε-caprolactone), and starch-based polymer blends or copolymers can degrade when exposed to bioactive environments such as soil and compost; (5) with truly biodegradable materials obtained from petroleum and natural resources, opportunity for using biodegradable polymers as agricultural mulch films has become more viable; and (6) the source of polymer and additives may limit use of some biodegradable mulches in organic production. More knowledge is needed on the effect of biodegradable mulches on crop growth, microclimate modifications, soil biota, soil fertility, and yields.",

    "abstract": "The 7 billion global population is projected to grow by 70 million per annum, increasing by 30 % to 9.2 billion by 2050. This increased population density is projected to increase demand for food production by 70 % notably due to changes in dietary habits in developing countries towards high quality food, e.g. greater consumption of meat and milk products and to the increasing use of grains for livestock feed. The availability of additional agricultural land is limited. Any expansion will happen mostly at the expense of forests and the natural habitats containing wildlife, wild relatives of crops and natural enemies of crop pests. Furthermore, more agricultural land will be used to produce bio-based commodities such as biofuel or fibre instead of food. Thus, we need to grow food on even less land, with less water, using less energy, fertiliser and pesticide than we use today. Given these limitations, sustainable production at elevated levels is urgently needed. The reduction of current yield losses caused by pests is a major challenge to agricultural production. This review presents (1) worldwide crop losses due to pests, (2) estimates of pesticide-related productivity, and costs and benefits of pesticide use, (3) approaches to reduce yield losses by chemical, as well as biological and recombinant methods of pest control and (4) the challenges of the crop-protection industry. The general public has a critical function in determining the future role of pesticides in agriculture. However, as long as there is a demand for pesticide-based solutions to pest control problems and food security concerns, the externality problems associated with the human and environmental health effects of pesticides need also to be addressed.",

New approaches and technologies involving application of blended modern agricultural science and indigenous knowledge systems and spearheaded by thousands of farmers, NGOs, and some government and academic institutions are proving to enhance food security while conserving agrobiodiversity soil and water resources conservation throughout hundreds of rural communities in the developing world. Case studies from Cuba, Brazil, Philippines, and Africa are presented to demonstrate how the agroecological development paradigm based on the revitalization of small farms which emphasizes diversity, synergy, recycling and integration, and social processes that value community participation and empowerment, proves to be perhaps one of the only viable options to meet present and future food needs. Given the present and predicted near future climate, energy and economic scenarios, agroecology has emerged as one of the most robust pathways towards designing biodiverse, productive, and resilient agroecosystems available today.",

    "abstract": "Farmers are facing serious plant protection issues and phytosanitary risks, in particular in the tropics. Such issues are food insecurity, lower income in traditional low-input agroecosystems, adverse effects of pesticide use on human health and on the environment in intensive systems and export restrictions due to strict regulations on quarantine pests and limits on pesticide residues. To provide more and better food to populations in both the southern and northern hemispheres in a sustainable manner, there is a need for a drastic reduction in pesticide use while keeping crop pest and disease damage under control. This can be achieved by breaking with industrial agriculture and using an agroecological approach, whose main pillar is the conservation or introduction of plant diversity in agroecosystems. Earlier literature suggest that increasing vegetational biodiversity in agroecosystems can reduce the impact of pests and diseases by the following mechanisms: (1) resource dilution and stimulo-deterrent diversion, (2) disruption of the spatial cycle, (3) disruption of the temporal cycle, (4) allelopathy effects, (5) general and specific soil suppressiveness, (6) crop physiological resistance, (7) conservation of natural enemies and facilitation of their action against aerial pests and (8) direct and indirect architectural/physical effects. Here we review the reported examples of such effects on a broad range of pathogens and pests, e.g. insects, mites, myriapods, nematodes, parasitic weeds, fungi, bacteria and viruses across different cropping systems. Our review confirms that it is not necessarily true that vegetational diversification reduces the incidence of pests and diseases. The ability of some pests and pathogens to use a wide range of plants as alternative hosts/reservoirs is the main limitation to the suppressive role of this strategy, but all other pathways identified for the control of pests and disease based on plant species diversity (PSD) also have certain limitations. Improving our understanding of the mechanisms involved should enable us to explain how, where and when exceptions to the above principle are likely to occur, with a view to developing sustainable agroecosystems based on enhanced ecological processes of pest and disease control by optimized vegetational diversification.",

    "abstract": "Despite significant advances in crop protection, plant diseases cause a 20% yield loss in food and cash crops worldwide. Therefore, interactions between plants and pathogens have been studied in great detail. In contrast, the interplay between plants and non-pathogenic microorganisms has received scant attention, and differential responses of plants to pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms are as yet not well understood. Plants affect their rhizosphere microbial communities that can contain beneficial, neutral and pathogenic elements. Interactions between the different elements of these communities have been studied in relation to biological control of plant pathogens. One of the mechanisms of disease control is induced systemic resistance (ISR). Studies on biological control of plant diseases have focused on ISR the last decade, because ISR is effective against a wide range of pathogens and thus offers serious potential for practical applications in crop protection. Such applications may however affect microbial communities associated with plant roots and interfere with the functioning of the root microbiota. Here, we review the possible impact of plant defense signaling on bacterial communities in the rhizosphere. To better assess implications of shifts in the rhizosphere microflora we first review effects of root exudates on soil microbial communities. Current knowledge on inducible defense signaling in plants is discussed in the context of recognition and systemic responses to pathogenic and beneficial microorganisms. Finally, the as yet limited knowledge on effects of plant defense on rhizosphere microbial communities is reviewed and we discuss future directions of research that will contribute to unravel the molecular interplay of plants and their beneficial microflora.",

    "abstract": "Abstract There is consensus that the global food system is not delivering good nutrition for all and is causing environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity, such that a profound transformation is needed to meet the challenges of persistent malnutrition and rural poverty, aggravated by the growing consequences of climate change. Agroecological approaches have gained prominence in scientific, agricultural and political discourse in recent years, suggesting pathways to transform agricultural and food systems that address these issues. Here we present an extensive literature review of concepts, definitions and principles of agroecology, and their historical evolution, considering the three manifestations of agroecology as a science, a set of practices and a social movement; and relate them to the recent dialogue establishing a set of ten iconic elements of agroecology that have emerged from a global multi-stakeholder consultation and synthesis process. Based on this, a consolidated list of principles is developed and discussed in the context of presenting transition pathways to more sustainable food systems. The major outcomes of this paper are as follows. (1) Definition of 13 consolidated agroecological principles: recycling; input reduction; soil health; animal health; biodiversity; synergy; economic diversification; co-creation of knowledge; social values and diets; fairness; connectivity; land and natural resource governance; participation. (2) Confirmation that these principles are well aligned and complementary to the 10 elements of agroecology developed by FAO but articulate requirements of soil and animal health more explicitly and distinguish between biodiversity and economic diversification. (3) Clarification that application of these generic principles can generate diverse pathways for incremental and transformational change towards more sustainable farming and food systems. (4) Identification of four key entry points associated with the elements: diversity; circular and solidarity economy; co-creation and sharing of knowledge; and, responsible governance to enable plausible pathways of transformative change towards sustainable agriculture and food systems.",

    "abstract": "Compaction of agricultural soils is a concern for many agricultural soil scientists and farmers since soil compaction, due to heavy field traffic, has resulted in yield reduction of most agronomic crops throughout the world. Soil compaction is a physical form of soil degradation that alters soil structure, limits water and air infiltration, and reduces root penetration in the soil. Consequences of soil compaction are still underestimated. A complete understanding of processes involved in soil compaction is necessary to meet the future global challenge of food security. We review here the advances in understanding, quantification, and prediction of the effects of soil compaction. We found the following major points: (1) When a soil is exposed to a vehicular traffic load, soil water contents, soil texture and structure, and soil organic matter are the three main factors which determine the degree of compactness in that soil. (2) Soil compaction has direct effects on soil physical properties such as bulk density, strength, and porosity; therefore, these parameters can be used to quantify the soil compactness.

    "abstract": "Agriculture consumes more than two thirds of the total freshwater of the planet. This issue causes substantial conflict in freshwater allocation between agriculture and other economic sectors. Regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) is key technology because it helps to improve water use efficiency. Nonetheless, there is a lack of understanding of the mechanisms with which plants respond to RDI. In particular, little is known about how RDI might increase crop production while reducing the amount of irrigation water in real-world agriculture. In this review, we found that RDI is largely implemented through three approaches: (1) growth stage-based deficit irrigation, (2) partial root-zone irrigation, and (3) subsurface dripper irrigation. Among these, partial root-zone irrigation is the most popular and effective because many field crops and some woody crops can save irrigation water up to 20 to 30 % without or with a minimal impact on crop yield. Improved water use efficiency with RDI is mainly due to the following: (1) enhanced guard cell signal transduction network that decreases transpiration water loss, (2) optimized stomatal control that improves the photosynthesis to transpiration ratio, and (3) decreased evaporative surface areas with partial root-zone irrigation that reduces soil evaporation. The mechanisms involved in the plant response to RDI-induced water stress include the morphological traits, e.g., increased root to shoot ratio and improved nutrient uptake and recovery; physiological traits, e.g., stomatal closure, decreased leaf respiration, and maintained photosynthesis; and biochemical traits, e.g., increased signaling molecules and enhanced antioxidation enzymatic activity.",

    "abstract": "Drought is a predominant cause of low yields worldwide. There is an urgent need for more water efficient cropping systems facing large water consumption of irrigated agriculture and high unproductive losses via runoff and evaporation. Identification of yield-limiting constraints in the plant–soil–atmosphere continuum are the key to improved management of plant water stress. Crop ecology provides a systematic approach for this purpose integrating soil hydrology and plant physiology into the context of crop production. We review main climate, soil and plant properties and processes that determine yield in different water-limited environments. From this analysis, management measures for cropping systems under specific drought conditions are derived. Major findings from literature analysis are as follows. (1) Unproductive water losses such as evaporation and runoff increase from continental in-season rainfall climates to storage-dependent winter rainfall climates. Highest losses occur under tropical residual moisture regimes with short intense rainy season. (2) Sites with a climatic dry season require adaptation via phenology and water saving to ensure stable yields. Intermittent droughts can be buffered via the root system, which is still largely underutilised for better stress resistance. (3) At short-term better management options such as mulching and date of seeding allow to adjust cropping systems to site constraints. Adapted cultivars can improve the synchronisation between crop water demand and soil supply. At long term, soil hydraulic and plant physiological constraints can be overcome by changing tillage systems and breeding new varieties with higher stress resistance. (4) Interactions between plant and soil, particularly in the rhizosphere, are a way towards better crop water supply. Targeted management of such plant–soil interactions is still at infancy. We conclude that understanding site-specific stress hydrology is imperative to select the most efficient measures to mitigate stress. Major progress in future can be expected from crop ecology focussing on the management of complex plant (root)–soil interactions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Integrated Pest Management (IPM) provides an illustration of how crop protection has (or has not) evolved over the past six decades. Throughout this period, IPM has endeavored to promote sustainable forms of agriculture, pursued sharp reductions in synthetic pesticide use, and thereby resolved myriad socio-economic, environmental, and human health challenges. Global pesticide use has, however, largely continued unabated, with negative implications for farmer livelihoods, biodiversity conservation, and the human right to food. In this review, we examine how IPM has developed over time and assess whether this concept remains suited to present-day challenges. We believe that despite many good intentions, hard realities need to be faced. 1) We identify the following major weaknesses: i) a multitude of IPM definitions that generate unnecessary confusion; ii) inconsistencies between IPM concepts, practice, and policies; iii) insufficient engagement of farmers in IPM technology development and frequent lack of basic understanding of its underlying ecological concepts. 2) By diverting from the fundamental IPM principles, integration of practices has proceeded along serendipitous routes, proven ineffective, and yielded unacceptable outcomes. 3) We show that in the majority of cases, chemical control still remains the basis of plant health programs. 4) Furthermore, IPM research is often lagging, tends to be misguided, and pays insufficient attention to ecology and to the ecological functioning of agroecosystems. 5) Since the 1960s, IPM rules have been twisted, its foundational concepts have degraded and its serious (farm-level) implementation has not advanced. To remedy this, we are proposing Agroecological Crop Protection as a concept that captures how agroecology can be optimally put to the service of crop protection. Agroecological Crop Protection constitutes an interdisciplinary scientific field that comprises an orderly strategy (and clear prioritization) of practices at the field, farm, and agricultural landscape level and a dimension of social and organizational ecology.",

    "abstract": "Conservation agriculture involves reduced tillage, permanent soil cover and crop rotations to enhance soil fertility and to supply food from a dwindling land resource. Recently, conservation agriculture has been promoted in Southern Africa, mainly for maize-based farming systems. However, maize yields under rain-fed conditions are often variable. There is therefore a need to identify factors that influence crop yield under conservation agriculture and rain-fed conditions. Here, we studied maize grain yield data from experiments lasting 5 years and more under rain-fed conditions. We assessed the effect of long-term tillage and residue retention on maize grain yield under contrasting soil textures, nitrogen input and climate. Yield variability was measured by stability analysis. Our results show an increase in maize yield over time with conservation agriculture practices that include rotation and high input use in low rainfall areas. But we observed no difference in system stability under those conditions. We observed a strong relationship between maize grain yield and annual rainfall. Our meta-analysis gave the following findings: (1) 92% of the data show that mulch cover in high rainfall areas leads to lower yields due to waterlogging; (2) 85% of data show that soil texture is important in the temporal development of conservation agriculture effects, improved yields are likely on well-drained soils; (3) 73% of the data show that conservation agriculture practices require high inputs especially N for improved yield; (4) 63% of data show that increased yields are obtained with rotation but calculations often do not include the variations in rainfall within and between seasons; (5) 56% of the data show that reduced tillage with no mulch cover leads to lower yields in semi-arid areas; and (6) when adequate fertiliser is available, rainfall is the most important determinant of yield in southern Africa. It is clear from our results that conservation agriculture needs to be targeted and adapted to specific biophysical conditions for improved impact.",

    "abstract": "The expansion of renewable energies aims at meeting the global energy demand while replacing fossil fuels. However, it requires large areas of land. At the same time, food security is threatened by the impacts of climate change and a growing world population. This has led to increasing competition for limited land resources. In this context, the combination of photovoltaics and plant production — often referred to as agrophotovoltaic (APV) or agrivoltaic systems — has been suggested as an opportunity for the synergistic combination of renewable energy and food production. Although this technology has already been applied in various commercial projects, its practicability and impact on crop production have hardly been investigated. In this review, we give a short summary of the current state of the art and prospective opportunities for the application of APV systems. In addition, we discuss microclimatic alterations and the resulting impacts of APV on crop production. Our main findings are that (1) crop cultivation underneath APV can lead to declining crop yields as solar radiation is expected to be reduced by about one third underneath the panels. However, microclimatic heterogeneities and their impact on crop yields are missing reference and thus, remain uncertain. (2) Through combined energy and crop production, APV can increase land productivity by up to 70%. (3) Given the impacts of climate change and conditions in arid climates, potential benefits are likely for crop production through additional shading and observed improvements of water productivity. (4) In addition, APV enhances the economic value of farming and can contribute to decentralized, off-grid electrification in developing and rural areas, thus further improving agricultural productivity. As such, APV can be a valuable technical approach for more sustainable agriculture, helping to meet current and prospective needs of energy and food production and simultaneously sparing land resources.",

    "abstract": "Food production in cities has long been a tradition in many countries around the world and a mainstream activity for many developed countries. While urban agriculture plays an important role in increasing food security and social well-being, it comes with significant costs and constraints. Here, we review the growth of urban agriculture throughout the developed world in order to clarify the different benefits, risks, and hindrances associated with the practice. Through this analysis, we identify the need for better understanding of the following five aspects if urban agriculture is to make a meaningful contribution to food security and social well-being in the future: (1) the impacts of continued urban sprawl and loss of peri-urban agricultural land; (2) appropriate government and institutional support at local, regional, and country levels; (3) the role of urban agriculture in self-sufficiency of cities; (4) the risks posed by pollutants from agriculture to urban ecosystems and from urban ecosystems to agriculture; and (5) the carbon footprint of urban agriculture and use of “food miles.” If urban agriculture is to have a legitimate place in resolving the global food crisis as advocates claim, then it is time to take urban agriculture seriously and assess more rigorously both the positive and negative impacts, especially carbon emissions. Only then can the world’s limited resources be properly allocated to the development of urban agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Planetary boundaries for terrestrial inputs of reactive nitrogen (Nr) are transgressed and reducing the input of new Nr and its environmental impacts are major global challenges. Grain legumes fix dinitrogen (N2) in symbiosis with soil bacteria and use soil N sources, but often less efficient than cereals. Intercropping grain legumes with cereals may be a means of increasing use efficiency of soil N. Here, we estimate the global sole cropped grain legume acquisition of N from soil to approximately 14.2 Tg N year−1, which corresponds to one-third of the global synthetic fertilizer N use (109 Tg N year−1) for all crops, assuming that grain legumes recover on average 40% of the fertilizer N. Published data from grain legume-cereal intercrop experiments, employing stable 15N isotope methods, have shown that due to competitive interactions and complementary N acquisition in intercrops, the cereals recover a more than proportional share of the soil N sources. As a consequence, the intercropped legume derives more of its N from the atmosphere, compared with when it is grown as legume sole crop. We estimated that the increased N use efficiency in intercropping can reduce the requirements for fossil-based fertilizer N by about 26% on a global scale. In addition, our estimates indicate that if all current grain legume sole crops would instead be intercropped with cereals, a potential net land saving would be achieved, when also replacing part of the current cereal sole crop area with intercropping. Intercropping has additional potential advantages such as increased yield stability and yield per unit area, reduced pest problems and reduced requirements for agrochemicals, while stimulating biodiversity. It is concluded that crop diversification by intercropping has the potential to reduce global requirements for synthetic fertilizer N and consequently support the development of more sustainable cropping systems.",

    "abstract": "Animal slurry contains plant nutrients that are essential for crop production. However, intensive livestock production may lead to a surplus of plant nutrients on farms and, as a consequence, discharge or emission to the environment. In order to ensure that the slurry applied to fields matches the nutrient requirements of the crops, techniques have been developed to reduce the nutrient content of slurry by means of separation. This review discusses the separation technologies used for animal slurry treatment and the physical and chemical processes involved in separation. These processes need to be understood before efficient, reliable and cheap separation technologies that take into account the actual properties of slurry and the likely end-use of the separation products can be developed. A simple separation efficiency expression can be used to assess the efficiency of slurry separation. It is indeed important to measure the amount and composition of the slurry before treatment, the dry-matter-rich fraction and the liquid fraction. The separation efficiency of mechanical separators for the removal of dry matter and phosphorus (P) is ranked as follows: centrifugation > sedimentation > non-pressurized filtration > pressurized filtration. In general, the separation of total N and NH 4 + 4 follows the same pattern, but the separation efficiency is lower than for dry matter and P. Treatment with a flocculant before separation improves separation efficiency significantly. Of the polyacrylamide polymers tested, high-molecular-weight, linear cationic polymers with a medium charge density (20–40 mol%) were found to be the most efficient flocculants. The best mechanical separation techniques for flocculated slurry are screens or filter belts. The separation efficiency of polyacrylamide-treated slurry can be improved by adding a multivalent ion to coagulate particles and for precipitation of phosphorus. Aluminium sulfate (Al2(SO4)3) or ferric chloride (FeCl3) seem to be very efficient for improving the mechanical separators. Alternatively, the mineral struvite (MgNH4PO4) may be formed by changing the slurry characteristics, such as by the addition of magnesium (Mg) or by increasing the pH to 9. The struvite crystals are removed during solid-liquid separation. The products of the solid—liquid separation may be further treated by evaporation, membrane filtration or ammonia stripping in order to obtain the desired end-products; however, low-maintenance and/or cost-efficient operation of these post-treatments has not yet been demonstrated. The separation should be developed as a whole-system approach, paying attention to parameters such as the value of end-products, environmental consequences and economy.",

These services are important for agroecosystem sustainability but can be degraded by intensive cultural practices such as use of pesticides. Many literature reports have investigated the effect of pesticides on earthworms. Here, we review those reports to assess the relevance of the indicators of earthworm response to pesticides, to assess their sensitivity to pesticides, and to highlight the remaining knowledge gaps. We focus on European earthworm species and products authorised in Europe, excluding natural compounds and metals. We consider different organisation levels: the infra-individual level (gene expression and physiology), the individual and population levels (life-history traits, population density and behaviour) and the community level: community biomass and density. Our analysis shows that earthworms are impacted by pesticides at all organisation levels. For example, pesticides disrupt enzymatic activities, increase individual mortality, decrease fecundity and growth, change individual behaviour such as feeding rate and decrease the overall community biomass and density. Insecticides and fungicides are the most toxic pesticides impacting survival and reproduction, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Climate change and global warming have worldwide adverse consequences. Biochar production and its use in agriculture can play a key role in climate change mitigation and help improve the quality and management of waste materials coming from agriculture and forestry. Biochar is a carbonaceous material obtained from thermal decomposition of residual biomass at relatively low temperature and under oxygen limited conditions (pyrolysis). Biochar is currently a subject of active research worldwide because it can constitute a viable option for sustainable agriculture due to its potential as a long-term sink for carbon in soil and benefits for crops. However, to date, the results of research studies on biochar effects on crop production show great variability, depending on the biochar type and experimental conditions. Therefore, it is important to identify the beneficial aspects of biochar addition to soil on crop yield in order to promote the adoption of this practice in agriculture. In this study, the effects of two types of biochar from agricultural wastes typical of Southern Spain: wheat straw and olive tree pruning, combined with different mineral fertilization levels on the growth and yield of wheat (Triticum durum L. cv. Vitron) were evaluated. Durum wheat was pot-grown for 2 months in a growth chamber on a soil collected from an agricultural field near Córdoba, Southern Spain. Soil properties and plant growth variables were studied in order to assess the agronomic efficiency of biochar. Our results show that biochar addition to a nutrient-poor, slightly acidic loamy sand soil had little effect on wheat yield in the absence of mineral fertilization. However, at the highest mineral fertilizer rate, addition of biochar led to about 20–30 % increase in grain yield compared with the use of the mineral fertilizer alone. Both biochars acted as a source of available P, which led to beneficial effects on crop production. In contrast, the addition of biochar resulted in decreases in available N and Mn. A maximum reduction in plant nutrient concentration of 25 and 80 % compared to nonbiochar-treated soils for N and Mn, respectively, was detected. This fact was related to the own nature of biochar: low available nitrogen content, high adsorption capacity, and low mineralization rate for N; and alkaline pH and high carbonate content for Mn. Our results indicate that biochar-based soil management strategies can enhance wheat production with the environmental benefits of global warming mitigation. This can contribute positively to the viability and benefits of agricultural production systems. However, the nutrient–biochar interactions should receive special attention due to the great variability in the properties of biochar-type materials.",

We analyzed physicochemical and microbial parameters, and we evaluated the sanitary risk. Results show 55.1 % of material degradation and 11.8 % of biomass conversion based upon total solids. We observed higher levels of N and P in the treatment residue than in the inflow material. Results also show a lower concentration of Salmonella spp. and viruses.

    "abstract": "Evidence shows the importance of food systems for sustainable development: they are at the nexus that links food security, nutrition, and human health, the viability of ecosystems, climate change, and social justice. However, agricultural policies tend to focus on food supply, and sometimes, on mechanisms to address negative externalities. We propose an alternative. Our starting point is that agriculture and food systems’ policies should be aligned to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This calls for deep changes in comparison with the paradigms that prevailed when steering the agricultural change in the XXth century. We identify the comprehensive food systems transformation that is needed. It has four parts: first, food systems should enable all people to benefit from nutritious and healthy food. Second, they should reflect sustainable agricultural production and food value chains. Third, they should mitigate climate change and build resilience. Fourth, they should encourage a renaissance of rural territories. The implementation of the transformation relies on (i) suitable metrics to aid decision-making, (ii) synergy of policies through convergence of local and global priorities, and (iii) enhancement of development approaches that focus on territories. We build on the work of the “Milano Group,” an informal group of experts convened by the UN Secretary General in Milan in 2015. Backed by a literature review, what emerges is a strategic narrative linking climate, agriculture and food, and calling for a deep transformation of food systems at scale. This is critical for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement. The narrative highlights the needed consistency between global actions for sustainable development and numerous local-level innovations. It emphasizes the challenge of designing differentiated paths for food systems transformation responding to local and national expectations. Scientific and operational challenges are associated with the alignment and arbitration of local action within the context of global priorities.",

    "abstract": "Nanoscience emerged in the late 1980s and is developed and applied in China since the middle of the 1990s. Although nanotechnologies have been less developed in agronomy than other disciplines, due to less investment, nanotechnologies have the potential to improve agricultural production. Here, we review more than 200 reports involving nanoscience in agriculture, livestock, and aquaculture. The major points are as follows: (1) nanotechnologies used for seeds and water improved plant germination, growth, yield, and quality. (2) Nanotechnologies could increase the storage period for vegetables and fruits. (3) For livestock and poultry breeding, nanotechnologies improved animals immunity, oxidation resistance, and production and decreased antibiotic use and manure odor. For instance, the average daily gain of pig increased by 9.9–15.3 %, the ratio of feedstuff to weight decreased by 7.5–10.3 %, and the diarrhea rate decreased by 55.6–66.7 %. (4) Nanotechnologies for water disinfection in fishpond increased water quality and increased yields and survivals of fish and prawn. (5) Nanotechnologies for pesticides increased pesticide performance threefold and reduced cost by 50 %. (6) Nano urea increased the agronomic efficiency of nitrogen fertilization by 44.5 % and the grain yield by 10.2 %, versus normal urea. (7) Nanotechnologies are widely used for rapid detection and diagnosis, notably for clinical examination, food safety testing, and animal epidemic surveillance. (8) Nanotechnologies may also have adverse effects that are so far not well known.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Reducing pesticide use has become a goal shared by several European countries and a major issue in public policies due to the negative impacts of pesticides on the environment and on human health. However, since most of the agri-food sector relies on pesticides in these countries, substantially reducing pesticide use is a complex issue. To overcome this situation, we argue that agricultural research has a major role to play and must adopt a pesticide-free paradigm to expect a deep impact on pesticide use. In this article, we explain why this new paradigm is needed and outline research fronts that it will help address. These research fronts are related to five strategies: (1) redesigning cropping systems to enhance prophylaxis, (2) diversifying biocontrol strategies and associated business models, (3) broadening the scope of plant breeding to include functional biodiversity and evolutionary ecology concepts, (4) setting new goals for agricultural machinery and digital technologies, and (5) supporting development of public policies and private initiatives for the transition toward pesticide-free agri-food systems. The corresponding research activities must be managed conjointly to develop systemic and coupled innovations, which are essential for reducing pesticide use significantly. We therefore provide examples of cross-cutting objectives that combine these fronts while also highlighting the need for interdisciplinary research projects. By doing so, we provide an overall orientation for research to achieve sustainable agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Sustainable strategies for managing weeds are critical to meeting agriculture’s potential to feed the world’s population while conserving the ecosystems and biodiversity on which we depend. The dominant paradigm of weed management in developed countries is currently founded on the two principal tools of herbicides and tillage to remove weeds. However, evidence of negative environmental impacts from both tools is growing, and herbicide resistance is increasingly prevalent. These challenges emerge from a lack of attention to how weeds interact with and are regulated by the agroecosystem as a whole. Novel technological tools proposed for weed control, such as new herbicides, gene editing, and seed destructors, do not address these systemic challenges and thus are unlikely to provide truly sustainable solutions. Combining multiple tools and techniques in an Integrated Weed Management strategy is a step forward, but many integrated strategies still remain overly reliant on too few tools. In contrast, advances in weed ecology are revealing a wealth of options to manage weeds at the agroecosystem level that, rather than aiming to eradicate weeds, act to regulate populations to limit their negative impacts while conserving diversity. Here, we review the current state of knowledge in weed ecology and identify how this can be translated into practical weed management. The major points are the following: (1) the diversity and type of crops, management actions and limiting resources can be manipulated to limit weed competitiveness while promoting weed diversity; (2) in contrast to technological tools, ecological approaches to weed management tend to be synergistic with other agroecosystem functions; and (3) there are many existing practices compatible with this approach that could be integrated into current systems, alongside new options to explore. Overall, this review demonstrates that integrating systems-level ecological thinking into agronomic decision-making offers the best route to achieving sustainable weed management.",

    "abstract": "Despite huge gains in productivity, environmental impacts of industrial agriculture based on a few high-yielding crop cultivars and the massive use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides have led to a search for new pathways leading to more sustainable agriculture in both temperate and tropical regions. New strategies incorporating ecological knowledge gained from the observation of natural ecosystems is an alternative to design \"ecologically intensive\" agroecosystems. Such systems are indeed both ecological and productive. Designing ecologically intensive agroecosystems calls for in-depth knowledge of biological regulations in ecosystems, and for the integration of traditional agricultural knowledge held by local farmers. This article reviews the main initiatives underlying ecologically intensive agroecosystems, analyses basic concepts, and proposes a framework for action. The rainforest model, the dry forest model, and the American Prairie are exemplified as three main natural systems at the basis of the mimicry concept. The link between biodiversity and the mimicry hypotheses, and the use of the concepts of productivity, efficiency, stability, and resilience for agroecosystems are discussed. Six main principles for cropping system design based on natural ecosystem mimicry are identified. A three-step framework for action is proposed, including nature observation, experimental design, and participatory design. Although far from being a panacea, the mimicry approach can provide new ways for agroecosystem design both in temperate and tropical countries.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Agricultural intensification increased crop productivity but simplified production with lower diversity of cropping systems, higher genetic uniformity, and a higher uniformity of agricultural landscapes. Associated detrimental effects on the environment and biodiversity as well as the resilience and adaptability of cropping systems to climate change are of growing concern. Crop diversification may stabilize productivity of cropping systems and reduce negative environmental impacts and loss of biodiversity, but a shared understanding of crop diversification including approaches towards a more systematic research is lacking. Here, we review the use of ‘crop diversification’ measures in agricultural research. We (i) analyse changes in crop diversification studies over time; (ii) identify diversification practices based on empirical studies; (iii) differentiate their use by country, crop species and experimental setup and (iv) identify target parameters to assess the success of diversification. Our main findings are that (1) less than 5% of the selected studies on crop diversification refer to our search term ‘diversification’; (2) more than half of the studies focused on rice, corn or wheat; (3) 76% of the experiments were conducted in India, USA, Canada, Brazil or China; (4) almost any arable crop was tested on its suitability for diversification; (5) in 72% of the studies on crop diversification, at least one additional agronomic measure was tested and (6) only 45% of the studies analysed agronomic, economic and ecological target variables. Our findings show the high variability of approaches to crop diversification and the lack of a consistent theoretical concept. For better comparability and ability to generalise the results of the different primary studies, we suggest a novel conceptual framework. It consists of five elements, (i) definition of the problem of existing farming practices and the potential need for diversification, (ii) characterisation of the baseline system to be diversified, (iii) definition of the scale and target area, (iv) description of the experimental design and target variables and (v) definition of the expected impacts. Applying this framework will contribute to utilizing the benefits of crop diversification more efficiently.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Over the past decades, climate change has induced transformations in the weed flora of arable ecosystems in Europe. For instance, thermophile weeds, late-emerging weeds, and some opportunistic weeds have become more abundant in some cropping systems. The composition of arable weed species is indeed ruled by environmental conditions such as temperature and precipitation. Climate change also influences weeds indirectly by enforcing adaptations of agronomic practice. We therefore need more accurate estimations of the damage potential of arable weeds to develop effective weed control strategies while maintaining crop yield. Here we review the mechanisms of responses of arable weeds to the direct and indirect effects of climate change. Climate change effects are categorized into three distinct types of shifts occurring at different scales: (1) range shifts at the landscape scale, (2) niche shifts at the community scale, and (3) trait shifts of individual species at the population scale. Our main conclusions are changes in the species composition and new species introductions are favored, which facilitate major ecological and agronomical implications. Current research mainly considers processes at the landscape scale. Processes at the population and community scales have prevalent importance to devise sustainable management strategies. Trait-climate and niche-climate relationships warrant closer consideration when modeling the possible future distribution and damage potential of weeds with climate change.",

    "abstract": "Agroecology is a promising alternative to industrial agriculture, with the potential to avoid the negative social and ecological consequences of input-intensive production. Transitioning to agroecological production is, however, a complex project that requires diverse contributions from the outside of scientific institutions. Agroecologists therefore collaborate with traditional producers and agroecological movements. Permaculture is one such agroecological movement, with a broad international distribution and a unique approach to system design. Despite a high public profile, permaculture has remained relatively isolated from scientific research. Though the potential contribution of permaculture to agroecological transition is great, it is limited by this isolation from science, as well as from oversimplifying claims, and the lack of a clear definition. Here, we review scientific and popular permaculture literature. A systematic review discusses quantitative bibliometric data, including keyword analysis. A qualitative review identifies and assesses major themes, proposals, and claims. The manuscript follows a stratified definition of permaculture as design system, best practice framework, worldview, and movement. The major points of our analysis are as follows: (1) Principles and topics largely complement and even extend principles and topics found in the agroecological literature. (2) Distinctive approaches to perennial polyculture, water management, and the importance of agroecosystem configuration exceed what is documented in the scientific literature and thus suggest promising avenues of inquiry. (3) Discussions of practice consistently underplay the complexity, challenges, and risks that producers face in developing diversified and integrated production systems. (4) The movement is mobilizing diverse forms of social support for sustainability, in geographically diverse locations. (5) And scholarship in permaculture has always been a diverse marginal sector, but is growing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Agricultural landscapes are increasingly being managed with the aim of enhancing the provisioning of multiple ecosystem services and sustainability of production systems. However, agricultural management that maximizes provisioning ecosystem services can often reduce both regulating and maintenance services. We hypothesized that agroforestry reduces trade-offs between provisioning and regulating/maintenance services. We conducted a quantitative synthesis of studies carried out in sub-Saharan Africa focusing on crop yield (as an indicator of provisioning services), soil fertility, erosion control, and water regulation (as indicators of regulating/maintenance services). A total of 1106 observations were extracted from 126 peer-reviewed publications that fulfilled the selection criteria for meta-analysis of studies comparing agroforestry and non-agroforestry practices (hereafter control) in sub-Saharan Africa. Across ecological conditions, agroforestry significantly increased crop yield, total soil nitrogen, soil organic carbon, and available phosphorus compared to the control. Agroforestry practices also reduced runoff and soil loss and improved infiltration rates and soil moisture content. No significant differences were detected between the different ecological conditions, management regimes, and types of woody perennials for any of the ecosystem services. Main trade-offs included low available phosphorus and low soil moisture against higher crop yield. This is the first meta-analysis that shows that, on average, agroforestry systems in sub-Saharan Africa increase crop yield while maintaining delivery of regulating/maintenance ecosystem services. We also demonstrate how woody perennials have been managed in agricultural landscapes to provide multiple ecosystem services without sacrificing crop productivity. This is important in rural livelihoods where the range of ecosystem services conveys benefits in terms of food security and resilience to environmental shocks.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cover crops (CCs) are a promising and sustainable agronomic practice to ameliorate soil health and crop performances. However, the complex of relationships between CCs, the soil, and the plant nutritional status has been little investigated. In this article, for the first time, we critically review, under a holistic approach, the reciprocal relationships between CCs and the soil physical and hydraulic properties, microbial, and faunal communities, soil nutrient availability, and plant nutritional status in temperate climates. For each of these topics, we report the current state of understanding, the influence of CC management options and suggested strategies, thus including both fundamental and applied aspects. In addition, we provide a detailed focus on the history of CCs and a list of the main temperate CCs. Cover cropping is a helpful practice in improving the physical, chemical, and biological soil properties, optimizing nutrient use efficiency and reducing the dependency of crops on external supplies of nutrients. The interactions between CCs and the nutritional status of soil and plants are complex and dynamic. Their understanding could be useful to set up an appropriate and site-specific management of fertilization. Management options play a key role in developing an effective and context-specific cover cropping.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Agrivoltaic (AV) systems integrate the production of agricultural crops and electric power on the same land area through the installation of solar panels several meters above the soil surface. It has been demonstrated that AV can increase land productivity and contribute to the expansion of renewable energy production. Its utilization is expected to affect crop production by altering microclimatic conditions but has so far hardly been investigated. The present study aimed to determine for the first time how changes in microclimatic conditions through AV affect selected agricultural crops within an organic crop rotation. For this purpose, an AV research plant was installed near Lake Constance in south-west Germany in 2016. A field experiment was established with four crops (celeriac, winter wheat, potato and grass-clover) cultivated both underneath the AV system and on an adjacent reference site without solar panels. Microclimatic parameters, crop development and harvestable yields were monitored in 2017 and 2018. Overall, an alteration in microclimatic conditions and crop production under AV was confirmed. Photosynthetic active radiation was on average reduced by about 30% under AV. During summertime, soil temperature was decreased under AV in both years. Furthermore, reduced soil moisture and air temperatures as well as an altered rain distribution have been found under AV. In both years, plant height of all crops was increased under AV. In 2017 and 2018, yield ranges of the crops cultivated under AV compared to the reference site were −19 to +3% for winter wheat, −20 to +11% for potato and −8 to −5% for grass-clover. In the hot, dry summer 2018, crop yields of winter wheat and potato were increased by AV by 2.7% and 11%, respectively. These findings show that yield reductions under AV are likely, but under hot and dry weather conditions, growing conditions can become favorable.",

Diversifying crops generally enhances crop productivity, quality, soil health and fertility, and resilience to pests and diseases and reduces environmental stresses. Moreover, crop diversification provides an alternative means of enhancing farmers’ income. Camelina ( Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz) reemerged in the background of European agriculture approximately three decades ago, when the first studies on this ancient native oilseed species were published. Since then, a considerable number of studies on this species has been carried out in Europe. The main interest in camelina is related to its (1) broad environmental adaptability, (2) low-input requirements, (3) resistance to multiple pests and diseases, and (4) multiple uses in food, feed, and biobased applications. The present article is a comprehensive and critical review of research carried out in Europe (compared with the rest of the world) on camelina in the last three decades, including genetics and breeding, agronomy and cropping systems, and end-uses, with the aim of making camelina an attractive new candidate crop for European farming systems. Furthermore, a critical evaluation of what is still missing to scale camelina up from a promising oilseed to a commonly cultivated crop in Europe is also provided (1) to motivate scientists to promote their studies and (2) to show farmers and end-users the real potential of this interesting species.",

Accordingly, digital agriculture has received considerable attention in policy in recent years, with emphasis mostly placed on the potential of digital agriculture to improve efficiency, productivity and food security, and less attention given to how digitalization may impact other principles of sustainable development, such as biodiversity conservation, soil protection, and human health, for example. Here, we review high-level policy and law in the German and European context to highlight a number of important institutional, societal, and legal preconditions for leveraging digital agriculture to achieve diverse sustainability targets. Additionally, we combine foresight analysis with our review to reflect on how future frame conditions influencing agricultural digitalization and sustainability could conceivably arise. The major points are the following: (1) some polices consider the benefits of digital agriculture, although only to a limited extent and mostly in terms of resource use efficiency; (2) law as it applies to digital agriculture is emerging but is highly fragmented; and (3) the adoption of digital agriculture and if it is used to enhance sustainability will be dependent on future data ownership regimes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite the large body of research surrounding crop growth parameters, there is still a lack of systematic assessments on how harvestable yields of different crop types respond to varying levels of shading. However, with the advent of agrivoltaic systems, a technology that combines energy and food production, shade tolerance of cropping systems is becoming increasingly important. To address this research gap, a meta-analysis with data from two experimental approaches (intercropping and artificial shading with cloths, nets or solar panels) was performed. The aim was to quantitatively assess the susceptibility of different temperate crop types to increasing levels of shading. Crop type specific yield response curves were developed as a function of reduction in solar radiation, estimating relative crop yields compared to the unshaded controls. Only studies that reported reduction in solar radiation and crop yield per area in temperate and subtropical areas were included. The results suggested a nonlinear relationship between achieved crop yields and reduction in solar radiation for all crop types. Most crops tolerate reduced solar radiation up to 15%, showing a less than proportional yield decline. However, significant differences between the response curves of the following crop types existed: Berries, fruits and fruity vegetables benefited from reduction in solar radiation up to 30%. Forages, leafy vegetables, tubers/root crops, and C 3 cereals initially showed less than proportional crop yield loss. In contrast, maize and grain legumes experienced strong crop yield losses even at low shade levels. The results provide a set of initial indicators that may be used in assessing the suitability of crop types for shade systems, and thus for agrivoltaic or other dual land-use systems. Detailed yield response curves, as provided by this study, are valuable tools in optimizing the output of annual crop components in these systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract There is an urgent need for agri-food system transformation to achieve global sustainability goals. Innovations can play a key role in this transformation but often come with both sustainability synergies and trade-offs. One such innovation is agricultural mechanization, which is spreading rapidly in parts of the Global South and is high on the policy agenda in others. The rapid spread of mechanization is fundamentally changing the character of agri-food systems in the Global South, with both positive and negative effects. However, while some of these effects have been well explored, no study so far has systematically reviewed the sustainability synergies and trade-offs associated with mechanization, undermining necessary accompanying research and policy efforts. This review provides an overview of the progress toward mechanization across the Global South, identifies drivers and barriers, assesses sustainability synergies and trade-offs, and discusses options to maximize sustainability outcomes. The review is the first to holistically assess the potentials and risks of agricultural mechanization for the sustainable transformation of agri-food systems in the Global South, taking into account all pillars of sustainability. The review suggests that agricultural mechanization is needed to make agri-food systems more sustainable concerning various economic and social aspects, such as labor productivity, poverty reduction, food security, and health and well-being. However, there are also sustainability risks concerning environmental aspects such as biodiversity loss and land degradation, and economic and social concerns related to lacking inclusiveness and growing inequalities, among others. A wide range of technological and institutional solutions is identified to harness the potential of agricultural mechanization for sustainable agri-food system transformation, while at the same time minimizing the risks. However, more efforts are needed to implement such solutions at scale and ensure that mechanization contributes to agri-food systems that respect all pillars of sustainability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In response to the sustainability issues that agriculture faces in advanced economies, agroecology has gained increasing relevance in scientific, political, and social debates. This has promoted discussion about transitions to agroecology, which represents a significant advancement. Accordingly, it has become a growing field of research. We reviewed the literature on and in support of farm transitions to agroecology in advanced economies in order to identify key research challenges and suggest innovative research paths. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (1) Research that supports exploration and definition of desired futures, whether based on future-oriented modeling or expert-based foresight approaches, should more explicitly include the farm level. It should stimulate the creativity and design ability of farmers and other stakeholders, and also address issues of representation and power among them. (2) Research that creates awareness and assesses farms before, during or after transition requires more holistic and dynamic assessment frameworks. These frameworks need to be more flexible to adapt to the diversity of global and local challenges. Their assessment should explicitly include uncertainty due to the feedback loops and emergent properties of transitions. (3) Research that analyzes and supports farms during transition should focus more on the dynamics of change processes by valuing what happens on the farms. Research should especially give more credence to on-farm experiments conducted by farmers and develop new tools and methods (e.g., for strategic monitoring) to support these transitions. This is the first review of scientific studies of farm transitions to agroecology. Overall, the review indicates that these transitions challenge the system boundaries, temporal horizons, and sustainability dimensions that agricultural researchers usually consider. In this context, farm transitions to agroecology require changes in the current organization and funding of research in order to encourage longer term and more adaptive configurations.",

Fertilizer use is a major driver of crop yield, but a comprehensive synthesis of the effect of fertilizer on the nutritional quality of food crops is lacking. Here we performed a comprehensive global meta-analysis using 7859 data pairs from 551 field experiment-based articles published between 1972 and 2022, assessing the contribution of fertilization with a wide set of plant nutrients to the nutritional quality of food crops (i.e., fruits, vegetables, cereals, pulses/oil crops, and sugar crops). On average, fertilizer application improved crop yield by 30.9% (CI: 28.2–33.7%) and nutritional quality (referring to all nutritionally relevant components assessed; carbohydrates, proteins, oil, vitamin C, representative mineral nutrients, and total soluble solids) by 11.9% (CI: 10.7–12.1%). The improvements were largely nutrient- and crop species dependent, with vegetables being the most responsive. Potassium, magnesium, and micronutrients played important roles in promoting crop nutritional quality, whereas the combined application of inorganic and organic source(s) had the greatest impact on quality. Desirable climatic conditions and soil properties (i.e., silt loam, soil organic matter 2.5–5.0%, and pH 4.5–8.5) supported further enhancements. Considering cross-continent responsiveness, the increase in the nutritional quality of food crops with fertilizer application was greatest in Africa. In a nutshell, our findings pave the way towards a quantitative understanding of nutrient management programs and responsible plant nutrition solutions that foster the sustainable production of nutritious and healthy food crops for human consumption.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Agroecology is identified as an important solution to increase the sustainability of agricultural and food systems. Despite the increasing number of publications assessing the socio-economic outcomes of agroecology, very few studies have consolidated the scattered results obtained on various case studies. This paper provides new insights by consolidating evidence on the varied socio-economic effects of agroecology across a large number of cases at a global level. To this purpose, we used a rapid review methodology, screening more than 13,000 publications to retrieve evidence on the socio-economic outcomes of the implementation of agroecological practices. The results of the review indicate that (1) agroecological practices are associated more often with positive socio-economic outcomes across the broad range of evaluated metrics (51% positive, 30% negative, 10% neutral, and 9% inconclusive outcomes); (2) the socio-economic metrics associated with financial capital represent the vast majority of evaluated metrics (83% of total) and are affected positively in a large share of cases (53%), due to favourable outcomes on income, revenues, productivity and efficiency; (3) human capital metrics (16%) are associated with a larger number of negative outcomes (46% versus 38% positive), due to higher labour requirements and costs that are however partly compensated by an overall greater number of positive outcomes on labour productivity (55%); and (4) the results vary depending on the agroecological practice assessed; e.g. for agroforestry, we identify 53% positive outcomes while for cropping system diversification 35%. These results indicate an overall favourable potential for farms to benefit from a positive socio-economic performance with the use of agroecological practices. Yet, the magnitude, temporal aspects, and success factors related to these outcomes, as well as the trade-offs between them, and the system-level effects of an agroecological transition are to be further assessed, since they can have an important influence on the performance of individual farms.",

    "abstract": "Urban agriculture is receiving increasing attention throughout the developing world, but debate rages as to whether it is a blessing or a curse. Some see it as savior for the poor, providing food, and livelihoods, yet to others it is responsible for harboring and vectoring pathogenic diseases and is an archaic practice that has no place along the path toward development. Consequently, the activity receives a mixed reception, and despite much support in many instances, it certainly does not enjoy universal unimpeded progress. Here, we undertake a global tour of urban agriculture throughout the developing world in an attempt to elucidate the various benefits, costs, and hindrances associated with the practice. Through this analysis we identify the need for better understanding of the following six aspects if urban agriculture is to make a meaningful contribution to food security and sustenance of livelihoods in the future: (1) the global and regional extent of urban agriculture; (2) the contribution of urban agriculture to communicable diseases, especially malaria but also diarrheal disease; (3) the role that urban agriculture does and/or could play in abating both malnutrition and obesity; (4) the impacts of urban agriculture on women; (5) appropriate methods of achieving governance and institutional support; and (6) the risks posed by chemical pollutants, particularly as Africa becomes increasingly industrialized. Overlaying these, we suggest that the time is ripe to extend the debate about urban agriculture’s positive and negative environmental impacts—especially in relation to carbon emissions—from primarily a developed world concern to the developing world, particularly since it is the developing world where population growth and consequent resource use is increasing most rapidly.",

    "abstract": "Expansion of agricultural land use has increased emission of greenhouse gases, exacerbating climatic changes. Most agricultural soils have lost a large portion of their antecedent soil organic carbon storage, becoming a source of atmospheric carbon-dioxide. In addition, agricultural soils can also be a major source of nitrous oxide and methane. Adoption of conservation agricultural practices may mitigate some of the adverse impacts of landuse intensification. However, optimal implementation of these practices is not feasible under all physical and biotic conditions. Of a wide range of conservation practices, the most promising options include agroforestry systems and soil application of biochar, which can efficiently sequester large amounts of carbon over the long-run. In addition, these practices also increase agronomic productivity and support a range of ecosystem services. Payments to farmers and land managers for sequestrating carbon and improving ecosystem services is an important strategy for promoting the adoption of such practices, aimed at mitigating climate change while decreasing environmental footprint of agriculture and sustaining food security.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is now affecting global agriculture and food production worldwide. Nonetheless the direct link between climate change and food security at the national scale is poorly understood. Here we simulated the effect of climate change on food security in China using the CERES crop models and the IPCC SRES A2 and B2 scenarios including CO2 fertilization effect. Models took into account population size, urbanization rate, cropland area, cropping intensity and technology development. Our results predict that food crop yield will increase +3–11 % under A2 scenario and +4 % under B2 scenario during 2030–2050, despite disparities among individual crops. As a consequence China will be able to achieve a production of 572 and 615 MT in 2030, then 635 and 646 MT in 2050 under A2 and B2 scenarios, respectively. In 2030 the food security index (FSI) will drop from +24 % in 2009 to −4.5 % and +10.2 % under A2 and B2 scenarios, respectively. In 2050, however, the FSI is predicted to increase to +7.1 % and +20.0 % under A2 and B2 scenarios, respectively, but this increase will be achieved only with the projected decrease of Chinese population. We conclude that 1) the proposed food security index is a simple yet powerful tool for food security analysis; (2) yield growth rate is a much better indicator of food security than yield per se; and (3) climate change only has a moderate positive effect on food security as compared to other factors such as cropland area, population growth, socio-economic pathway and technology development. Relevant policy options and research topics are suggested accordingly.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Diversification of cropping systems has been proposed as a major mechanism to move towards sustainable cropping systems. To date, a diversification option that has received little attention is introduction of ley pastures into cropping systems, but the use of ley pastures is challenged by most future-oriented scenarios aiming to feed the world sustainably. In these scenarios, ruminant livestock feed only on permanent pastures, while cropping systems focus completely on production of crop-based human food. Diversification of cropping systems with ley pastures is thus compromised by knowledge gaps and future-oriented policy options. Here, we review ecosystem services provided by introducing ley pastures into cropping systems to increase sustainability of agriculture, discuss types of ley pastures and their management liable to promote these services, and raise future challenges related to introducing ley pastures into cropping systems. We conclude that (1) ley pastures provide a large set of input (soil conservation, nutrient provision and recycling, soil water retention, biological control of pests) and output (water purification, climate regulation, habitat provision for biodiversity conservation, forage production) ecosystem services of primary importance to cropping systems and society, respectively, as long as their spatial and temporal insertion within cropping systems is well-managed; otherwise, disservices may be produced. (2) To benefit from ecosystem services provided by ley pastures in cropping systems while limiting their disservices, it appears necessary to define a safe operating space for ley pastures in cropping systems. Moving towards this space requires changing plant breeding programs towards multiservice ley pastures, producing knowledge about emerging ways of introducing ley pastures into cropping systems (e.g., living mulch, green manure) and better quantifying the bundles of ecosystem services provided by ley pastures in cropping systems.",

    "abstract": "Homemade botanical insecticides are widely used by subsistence and transitional farmers in low-income countries. Their use is often driven by the limited availability or cost of commercial pesticides. Homemade botanical insecticides are often recommended by agricultural extension services and some development organizations. However, this could be questioned because scientific evidence of their efficacy and safety may not be available or accessible. Although botanicals with insecticidal properties have been widely studied, a synthesis focusing specifically on homemade preparations used in realistic field or storage conditions is missing. In this paper, we review efficacy assessments of botanicals used to prepare homemade insecticides. This covers twelve botanicals recommended by national extension partners in 20 countries within the global agricultural Plantwise program. These are as follows: garlic (Allium sativum), neem (Azadirachta indica), chili pepper (Capsicum spp.), Siam weed (Chromolaena odorata), mother of cocoa (Gliricidia sepium), chinaberry (Melia azedarach), moringa (Moringa oleifera), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), clove basil (Ocimum gratissimum), tephrosia (Tephrosia vogelii), tree marigold (Tithonia diversifolia), and bitter leaf (Vernonia amygdalina). This review shows that (1) all the selected botanicals contain active ingredients with insecticidal, antifeedant, or repellent properties, and (2) homemade insecticides based on all the selected botanicals have been used with some success to control pests or prevent damage, although efficacy was variable and often lower than the positive controls (synthetic pesticides). Factors affecting the efficacy of homemade botanical insecticide include variation in active ingredient content and concentration in plant material, as well as variation in the preparation process. In conclusion, there is some evidence that homemade botanical insecticides could contribute to reducing losses in food production. Since further research is needed to better understand their variable efficacy and potential health and environmental risks, those who promote the use of homemade botanical insecticides should also communicate those “unknowns” to the farmers who use such products.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural production is unstable as a result of complex, dynamic and interrelated factors such as climate, markets and public policy that are beyond farmers’ control. Farmers must therefore develop new farming systems incorporating innovations in objectives, organization and practices adapted to changing production contexts. As a consequence, agronomists have expanded the “farming system design” field of research. A variety of quantitative and qualitative design approaches have been developed to support the analysis of current farming systems and the design and evaluation of alternatives. A comprehensive literature assessment is lacking for this emerging field of agricultural science. Here we review 41 farming system design approaches using computer models. Our main findings are the following: (1) the reviewed literature do not make reference to the theoretical approaches from the field of design science. (2) Two categories of farming system approaches can be distinguished: optimisation approaches, and participatory and simulation-based approaches. These two categories are connected to two of the main design science theories. (3) For optimisation approaches, farming system design is mainly seen as a problem-solving process. Emphasis is placed on the computational exploration of the solution space by a problem-solving algorithm. (4) For participatory and simulation-based approaches, conceptualization of the design problem is central to the farming system design process. The subsequent exploration of the solution space relies on the creativity of humans. (5) Optimisation approaches, and participatory and simulation-based approaches are oriented towards the development of exploitative rather than exploratory innovations. Exploitative innovations involve the exploitation of available knowledge while exploration innovations build on knowledge created in the course of the design process.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Although many agronomic researchers currently focus on designing and developing decision support systems, they rarely discuss the methodological implications of such work. In this paper, with the examples of two decision support systems, we propose methodological elements for conducting the participatory design of such tools. Our proposition aims at building dialogue between designers and users but also between humans, tools and work situations. We focus on two main stages: first, a diagnosis of the uses of decision tools within current working situations and, second, the use of a prototype of the tool under design. The first stage serves to characterize the diversity of uses and user situations in order to determine the tool’s flexibility and to identify new concepts for tools. The second stage involves setting up an arrangement whereby a prototype of the decision support tool, open to amendment, can be used in work-like situations and then discussed during debriefing sessions among designers and users. This stage mediates dialogue between all the participants and allows them to develop cross-learning processes. We discuss how these two stages allow for a coordinated expansion of three spaces: the concept space, the knowledge space and the use space. We then discuss the need for such participatory design processes described as dialogical design processes and their contribution to produce new agronomic knowledge supporting a more sustainable agriculture. Finally, we point out a need to provide more opportunity for scientific discussion on participatory design approaches and on design methodology more broadly within the agronomic community.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Agricultural practices affect the physical and chemical characteristics of the soil, which in turn may influence soil microorganisms with consequences on soil biological functioning. However, there is little knowledge on the interactions between agricultural management, soil physicochemical properties, and soil microbial communities, notably in tropical ecosystems with few studies conducted in strongly weathered and acid soils. Here, we investigated the early effect of tillage and crop residues management on top soil physical, chemical, and microbial properties in an acid savannah grassland of northeastern Laos. We initiated a 3-year rotation of rice/corn/soybean under three no-till systems (NTs) distinguished by the cover crops associated prior to and with the main crops, and one conventional tillage-based system (CT). The effect of agricultural management was evaluated 2 years after land reclamation in reference to the surrounding natural pasture (PAS). Our results demonstrate that NTs improve soil physicochemical characteristics (aggregate stability, organic carbon, and cation exchange capacity) as well as microbial abundance (total biomass, bacterial and fungal densities). A significant discrimination of the genetic structure of soil bacterial community was also observed between NTs, CT, and PAS. Interestingly, bacterial abundance and diversity were differently influenced by soil environment changes: microbial density was affected by the quantity and diversity of crop residues, soil organic carbon, and exchangeable base contents, whereas soil bacterial genetic structure was mainly determined by exchangeable aluminum content, pH, cation exchange capacity, and C/N ratio. Altogether, our study represents one of the most complete environmental evaluations of agricultural practices in tropical agrosystems and leads to recommend no-till systems with high residue restitutions to improve the physical, chemical, and microbial properties of tropical acid soils and thus contribute to the sustainability of agriculture in these ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Micronutrients are essential factors for human health and integral for plant growth and development. Among the micronutrients, zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) deficiency in dietary food are associated with malnutrition symptoms (hidden hunger), which can be overcome through biofortification. Different strategies, such as traditional and molecular plant breeding or application of chemical supplements along with fertilizers, have been employed to develop biofortified crop varieties with enhanced bioavailability of micronutrients. The use of microorganisms to help the crop plant in more efficient and effective uptake and translocation of Zn and Fe is a promising option that needs to be effectively integrated into agronomic or breeding approaches. However, this is less documented and forms the subject of our review. The major findings related to the mobilization of micronutrients by microorganisms highlighted the significance of (1) acidification of rhizospheric soil and (2) stimulation of secretion of phenolics. Plant–microbe interaction studies illustrated novel inferences related to the (3) modifications in the root morphology and architecture, (4) reduction of phytic acid in food grains, and (5) upregulation of Zn/Fe transporters. For the biofortification of Zn and Fe, formulation(s) of such microbes (bacteria or fungi) can be explored as seed priming or soil dressing options. Using the modern tools of transcriptomics, metaproteomics, and genomics, the genes/proteins involved in their translocation within the plants of major crops can be identified and engineered for improving the efficacy of plant–microbe interactions. With micronutrient nutrition being of global concern, it is imperative that the synergies of scientists, policy makers, and educationists focus toward developing multipronged approaches that are environmentally sustainable, and integrating such microbial options into the mainframe of integrated farming practices in agriculture. This can lead to better quality and yields of produce, and innovative approaches in food processing can deliver cost-effective nutritious food for the undernourished populations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In Latin America, the cultivation of Arabica coffee ( Coffea arabica ) plays a critical role in rural livelihoods, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable development. Over the last 20 years, coffee farms and landscapes across the region have undergone rapid and profound biophysical changes in response to low coffee prices, changing climatic conditions, severe plant pathogen outbreaks, and other drivers. Although these biophysical transformations are pervasive and affect millions of rural livelihoods, there is limited information on the types, location, and extent of landscape changes and their socioeconomic and ecological consequences. Here we review the state of knowledge on the ongoing biophysical changes in coffee-growing regions, explore the potential socioeconomic and ecological impacts of these changes, and highlight key research gaps. We identify seven major land-use trends which are affecting the sustainability of coffee-growing regions across Latin America in different ways. These trends include (1) the widespread shift to disease-resistant cultivars, (2) the conventional intensification of coffee management with greater planting densities, greater use of agrochemicals and less shade, (3) the conversion of coffee to other agricultural land uses, (4) the introduction of Robusta coffee ( Coffea canephora ) into areas not previously cultivated with coffee, (5) the expansion of coffee into forested areas, (6) the urbanization of coffee landscapes, and (7) the increase in the area of coffee produced under voluntary sustainability standards. Our review highlights the incomplete and scattered information on the drivers, patterns, and outcomes of biophysical changes in coffee landscapes, and lays out a detailed research agenda to address these research gaps and elucidate the effects of different landscape trajectories on rural livelihoods, biodiversity conservation, and other aspects of sustainable development. A better understanding of the drivers, patterns, and consequences of changes in coffee landscapes is vital for informing the design of policies, programs, and incentives for sustainable coffee production.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The sustainability of agriculture is questioned due to major negative environmental and socioeconomic impacts. To improve the state of agriculture, various management changes have been proposed. Different tools, with varying characteristics, sustainability framing and indicators, have been used to evaluate the impact of these changes on sustainability. Here, we review 119 tools for farm sustainability assessment and compare their use, sustainability dimensions, themes and types of indicators used for biodiversity conservation, farm viability and gender equity. Our main findings are that (1) tools could be classified into five groups that differ in stakeholder participation and model used for calculating sustainability, (2) seven different sustainability framings are used and (3) only two out of 29 indicators screened address impacts of farming system while the others address drivers, pressures or states of the system. The tools were grouped in “Long-term monitoring of farm activities” (11%), “Ex-ante assessment of sustainability with bioeconomic models” (9%), “Survey- and indicator-based assessment of tools” (41%), “Consultation-based assessment” (25%) and “Active engagement of stakeholder-based assessment” (14%). The “classical view of sustainability”, with the economic, social and environmental pillars, was used in 61% of the papers. Based on these findings, we suggest (1) development of temporal dynamic assessment of farm sustainability with active involvement of stakeholders in the framing of sustainability and design of indicators to achieve reliable and relevant assessment outcomes. We recommend (2) adoption of more complex sustainability framings dealing with emerging system properties, namely resilience, viability and stability. In these, (3) governance/institutional dimensions should be emphasised, and social themes targeting farmers’ characteristics should be included. Finally, (4) use of impact indicators in farm sustainability assessments is critical, and they should be designed to contribute to scientifically rigorous and relevant assessments of farming system sustainability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the face of a changing climate, yield stability is becoming increasingly important for farmers and breeders. Long-term field experiments (LTEs) generate data sets that allow the quantification of stability for different agronomic treatments. However, there are no commonly accepted guidelines for assessing yield stability in LTEs. The large diversity of options impedes comparability of results and reduces confidence in conclusions. Here, we review and provide guidance for the most commonly encountered methodological issues when analysing yield stability in LTEs. The major points we recommend and discuss in individual sections are the following: researchers should (1) make data quality and methodological approaches in the analysis of yield stability from LTEs as transparent as possible; (2) test for and deal with outliers; (3) investigate and include, if present, potentially confounding factors in the statistical model; (4) explore the need for detrending of yield data; (5) account for temporal autocorrelation if necessary; (6) make explicit choice for the stability measures and consider the correlation between some of the measures; (7) consider and account for dependence of stability measures on the mean yield; (8) explore temporal trends of stability; and (9) report standard errors and statistical inference of stability measures where possible. For these issues, we discuss the pros and cons of the various methodological approaches and provide solutions and examples for illustration. We conclude to make ample use of linking up data sets, and to publish data, so that different approaches can be compared by other authors and, finally, consider the impacts of the choice of methods on the results when interpreting results of yield stability analyses. Consistent use of the suggested guidelines and recommendations may provide a basis for robust analyses of yield stability in LTEs and to subsequently design stable cropping systems that are better adapted to a changing climate.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Africa’s need to double food production and feed the burgeoning human population, without compromising its natural resource base, has raised the momentum for sustainable agricultural intensification on the continent. Many studies describe agronomic practices that can increase productivity on existing agricultural land without damaging the environment and without increasing the agricultural carbon footprint. However, there is limited information on specific practices with the greatest potential to contribute to sustainable intensification on smallholder farms in sub-Saharan Africa, while simultaneously keeping the carbon footprint low. The objectives of this review were to (1) identify good agronomic practices with potential for contributing to sustainable intensification across sub-Saharan Africa, (2) synthesize available information on benefits and synergies from these technologies, and (3) discuss bottlenecks in their adoption in order to obtain insights that inform the formulation of supportive policies. Agroforestry, cereal-legume intercropping, conservation agriculture, doubled-up legume cropping, fertilizer micro-dosing, planting basins, and push-pull technology were identified as key agronomic innovations widely promoted in sub-Saharan Africa. We show that these innovations can build synergies and increase resource use efficiency while reducing agricultural carbon footprint. We outline the benefits, trade-offs, and limitations of these practices and discuss their potential role in strengthening food sovereignty and climate change adaptation and mitigation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Participatory research can improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and scope of research processes, and foster social inclusion, empowerment, and sustainability. Yet despite four decades of agricultural research institutions exploring and developing methods for participatory research, it has never become mainstream in the agricultural technology development cycle. Citizen science promises an innovative approach to participation in research, using the unique facilities of new digital technologies, but its potential in agricultural research participation has not been systematically probed. To this end, we conducted a critical literature review. We found that citizen science opens up four opportunities for creatively reshaping research: (i) new possibilities for interdisciplinary collaboration, (ii) rethinking configurations of socio-computational systems, (iii) research on democratization of science more broadly, and (iv) new accountabilities. Citizen science also brings a fresh perspective on the barriers to institutionalizing participation in the agricultural sciences. Specifically, we show how citizen science can reconfigure cost-motivation-accountability combinations using digital tools, open up a larger conceptual space of experimentation, and stimulate new collaborations. With appropriate and persistent institutional support and investment, citizen science can therefore have a lasting impact on how agricultural science engages with farming communities and wider society, and more fully realize the promises of participation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Legume crops hold promise to diversify the currently simplified rotations that dominate Europe and to increase the sustainability of European farming systems. Nevertheless, most legumes have been ignored by farmers, advisors, and value chain agents in the EU, where legumes are estimated to occupy only ~2% of arable land. Recent surveys find that farmers see a lack of knowledge on the agroecological impacts of (re)introducing legumes as a key barrier to legume adoption. A review of current research on the agroecological potential of legume-inclusive cropping systems would help in assessing whether research targeting sufficiently supports farmers in overcoming this barrier. We have systematically reviewed and synthesized published literature reporting on agricultural ecosystem service delivery in European cropping systems with legumes included compared to those without legumes. Our analysis of 163 published articles revealed: (1) the bulk of published research addresses production-related services delivered by few legume species (pea, clover, faba bean, and vetch, 70% of reviewed studies) comparatively assessed in cereal-based rotations; (2) substantial knowledge gaps also exist, encompassing ecosystem services with less direct relevance to economic outcomes (e.g., biodiversity) and with potential for high variability (e.g., pest and disease suppression); (3) studies at plot-level and within-season scales dominate (92% and 75% of reviewed studies, respectively). Assessed in the context of recent complementary studies, we find that a limited research focus is both counter to knowledge demands from farmers and likely the result of self-reinforcing socio-technical regimes which prioritize production over non- or indirectly-marketable ecosystem services. We conclude that scientists in Europe should diversify research to include legume species, ecosystem services, contexts, and scales not yet well studied, in order to provide the agroecological knowledge base farmers need to amplify the potential benefits of crop diversity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Agroforestry interventions have the potential to benefit the livelihoods of farmers and communities worldwide. However, given the high system complexity, the long-term benefits of agroforestry are difficult to anticipate. This study aimed to integrate uncertainty into long-term performance projections for agroforestry interventions in the highlands of Northwest Vietnam. We applied decision analysis and probabilistic modeling approaches to produce economic ex-ante assessments for seven agroforestry options (intercropping of maize, forage grass, or coffee with tea, nut, fruit, and timber trees) promoted in the region. Our results indicate that farmers likely prefer annual monocultures due to the relatively early incomes and short time-lag on returns. However, the results also show that annual profits from monocrops can be expected to decrease over time, due mainly to unsustainable soil use. Agroforestry systems, on the other hand, return substantial profits in the long term, but they also incur high establishment and maintenance costs and can generate net losses in the first few years. Initial financial incentives to compensate for these losses may help in promoting agroforestry adoption in the region. Uncertainties related to farmers’ time preference, crop yields, and crop prices appeared to have the greatest influence on whether monocropping or agroforestry emerged as the preferable option. Narrowing these key knowledge gaps may offer additional clarity on farmers’ optimal course of action and provide guidance for agencies promoting agroforestry interventions in Vietnam and elsewhere. Our model produced a set of plausible ranges for net present values and highlighted critical variables, more clarity on which would support decision-making under uncertainty. Our innovative research approach proved effective in providing forecasts of uncertain outcomes and can be useful for informing similar development interventions in other contexts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cover crops can provide a wide range of ecosystem services including soil water conservation, improved soil nutrient supply and retention, and enhanced crop yields. However, achieving these services in dryland cropping systems can be highly challenging, and cover crops may carry a greater risk of causing ecosystem disservices. Assessment of the balance of ecosystem services vs disservices is critical for understanding the potential role of cover crops within dryland cropping systems. The objective of this meta-analysis was to assess the effects of cover cropping in drylands on soil water and soil mineral nitrogen content at sowing of subsequent cash crops and their yields compared to control fallows. A total of 38 articles were examined, for a total of 1006 cash crop yield, 539 soil water, and 516 soil mineral nitrogen independent studies, spanning the period 1994–2021. On average, cover cropping reduced cash crop yield by 7%, soil water content by 18%, and soil mineral nitrogen by 25%, with significant variation across climates, soil types, and crop management conditions. Subsequent cash crop yields changed by +15, +4, −12, and −11% following cover crops in tropical, continental, dry, and temperate dryland climates, respectively. The most significant yield benefits were proportionate to soil water content and soil mineral nitrogen at the time of cash crop sowing. This is the first meta-analysis to demonstrate that minimum annual precipitation of ~700 mm represents a “break-even” point to realize significant cash crop yield benefits of cover cropping compared to control fallows in dryland environments. The successful incorporation of cover crops into dryland cropping systems requires careful planning based on context-specific biophysical conditions to minimize trade-offs between ecosystem services and disservices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper reviews and analyzes the impact of residue burning on the environment and human health, and the influence of ex-situ and in-situ residue management on reducing pollution and improving soil health, crop yield, and farmers’ economic benefits. Paddy is cultivated on 43.8 Mha in India, producing 118.43 Mt grain and an estimated 165.8 Mt straw. Burning is the most common practice for managing rice crop residues mainly due to its simplicity, low cost, increased mechanical harvesting, short window between rice harvest and wheat sowing, and lack of viable uses for residues. Around 50 Mt of rice straw is burned annually, nearly half of which occurs in northwestern India during October/November. Burning residue is a major contributor to air pollution, emitting around 1.5 Mt particulate matter, 150 Mt carbon dioxide, and other greenhouse gases (e.g., NO 2 , SO 2 , CO, CH 4 , NH 3 ) and volatile organic compounds, resulting in a wide range of respiratory infections in humans, reduced soil nutrient and carbon inputs, and disturbed soil microbial activity. In-situ residue management using a Happy Seeder, Super straw management system, paddy straw chopper cum spreader, reversible moldboard plow, or no-till seeder incorporates or mulches residues, avoiding burnings. These operations are economically profitable as they reduce costs, increase yields, or both. In-situ residue management, i.e., incorporation or mulching improves the soil’s physical, chemical and biological properties and is considered better for improving soil health than residue removal. Ex-situ residue management for biofuel, biochar, electricity generation or bale making is also profitable for the environment and reduces pollutant emissions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Incorporation of crop residues into the soil has been widely recommended as an effective method to sustain soil fertility and improve soil carbon sequestration in arable lands. However, it may lead to an increase in the emission of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and leaching of nitrate (NO 3 − ) to groundwater due to higher nitrogen (N) availability after crop residue incorporation. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis based on 345 observations from 90 peer-reviewed studies to evaluate the effects of crop residue return on soil N 2 O emissions and NO 3 − leaching for different locations, climatic and soil conditions, and agricultural management strategies. On average, crop residue incorporation significantly stimulated N 2 O emissions by 29.7%, but decreased NO 3 − leaching by 14.4%. The increase in N 2 O emissions was negatively and significantly correlated with mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation, and with the most significant changes occurring in the temperate climate zone. Crop residues stimulated N 2 O emission mainly in soils with pH ranging between 5.5 and 6.5, or above 7.5 in soils with low clay content. In addition, crop residue application decreased NO 3 − leaching significantly in soils with sandy loam, silty clay loam, and silt loam textures. Our analysis reveals that an appropriate crop residue management adapted to the site-specific soil and environmental conditions is critical for increasing soil organic carbon stocks and decreasing nitrogen losses. The most important novel finding is that residue return, despite stimulation of N 2 O emissions, is particularly effective in reducing NO 3 − leaching in soils with loamy texture, which are generally among the most productive arable soils.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Intensive agriculture in Germany is not only highly productive but has also led to detrimental effects in the environment. Crop diversification together with new field arrangements considering soil heterogeneities can be an alternative to improve resource use efficiency (RUE), ecosystem services (ESS), and biodiversity. Agroecosystem models are tools that help us to understand and design diversified new field arrangements. The main goal of this study was to review the extent to which agroecosystem models have been used for crop diversification design at field and landscape scale by considering soil heterogeneities and to understand the model requirements for this purpose. We found several agroecosystem models available for simulating spatiotemporal crop diversification at the field scale. For spatial crop diversification, simplified modelling approaches consider crop interactions for light, water, and nutrients, but they offer restricted crop combinations. For temporal crop diversification, agroecosystem models include the major crops (e.g., cereals, legumes, and tuber crops). However, crop parameterization is limited for marginal crops and soil carbon and nitrogen (N). At the landscape scale, decision-making frameworks are commonly used to design diversified cropping systems. Within-field soil heterogeneities are rarely considered in field or landscape design studies. Combining static frameworks with dynamic agroecosystems models can be useful for the design and evaluation of trade-offs for ESS delivery and biodiversity. To enhance modeling capabilities to simulate diversified cropping systems in new field arrangements, it will be necessary to improve the representation of crop interactions, the inclusion of more crop species options, soil legacy effects, and biodiversity estimations. Newly diversified field arrangement design also requires higher data resolution, which can be generated via remote sensing and field sensors. We propose the implementation of a framework that combines static approaches and process-based models for new optimized field arrangement design and propose respective experiments for testing the combined framework.",

Conventional farming uses industrial inputs to a level that is economically justified, whilst organic farming systems avoid mineral fertilizers and synthetic chemical pesticides. This study investigates the long-term effect of organic and conventional farming systems on soil quality. The DOK trial (bio D ynamic, bio O rganic, K onventionell (German for conventional)) running since 1978 in Therwil (CH), compares bioorganic (BIOORG), biodynamic (BIODYN), and conventional (CONFYM) farming systems at two farmyard manure intensities corresponding to 0.7 and 1.4 livestock units per hectare with a purely mineral fertilized system (CONMIN) and an unfertilized control (NOFERT). The treatments in the DOK trial vary in plant protection and receive system-specific organic matter inputs differing in rate and quality. With this work, we revisit the soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics across 42 years and redefine the previous perception of mainly declining SOC contents after 21 years of organic and conventional management (Fliessbach et al. 2007). After 42 years, we found SOC contents to be increased in BIODYN 1.4 and to a lesser extent also in BIOORG 1.4. CONFYM 1.4 showed stable SOC contents, while systems fertilized with manure of 0.7 livestock units and CONMIN lost SOC. SOC loss was highest in NOFERT. Enhanced biological soil quality under organic and particularly biodynamic management highlights the close link between soil biology and SOC changes. The impact of farming systems on SOC was detectable after 2 decades of continuous management. We conclude that recycling manure at a level of 1.4 livestock units per hectare permits maintenance of SOC levels and that composting manure, as performed in BIODYN 1.4, helps to further increase SOC levels and improve biological soil quality.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the future, a cropping system that guarantees food security by delivering high yields and, simultaneously, protects our environment is desperately needed. This can be achieved through a cropping system that waives chemical synthetic plant protection products, which endanger, for example, biodiversity and water resources. However, such a system, referred to here as the mineral-ecological cropping system (MECS), should still allow for the usage of mineral fertilizers to ensure high yields. It can be thought of as a compromise between the current conventional and organic cropping systems. This article presents a comprehensive literature review on the economic, social, and environmental effects of pesticides and the resulting reasons farmers have to use (or not use) them. Hereby, regarding future pesticide reduction, we identify hindrances and potential benefits that could be mobilized to design the MECS. The major points are the following: in a MECS, (1) it is expected that yields and temporal stability of yields will be higher than in organic farming, but lower than in conventional farming; (2) profitability might suffer due to high input costs and energy consumption; (3) it is expected that soil fertility and biodiversity protection will increase along with the promotion of alternative disease and pest control measures; (4) crop rotations will be wider and more diverse than in conventional farming; (5) mineral fertilizer cannot be optimally used by the crops unless a balanced supply of nitrogen is achieved. Farmers who want to switch to MECS should be compensated as they are likely to experience higher costs and lower yield and yield stability. The lessons learned from this review will help to progress toward an innovative and sustainable cropping system. Further research should focus on rational farmers’ adaptation possibilities when abandoning pesticides while still using mineral fertilizers.",

Controversy forms an essential part of the scientific process, but on the topic of soil carbon storage, it may confuse the agricultural community and the general public and may delay actions to fight climate change. In an attempt to shed light on this topic, the originality of this article lies in its intention to provide a balanced description of contradictory scientific opinions on soil carbon storage and to examine how the scientific community can support decision-making despite the controversy. In the first part, we review and attempt to reconcile conflicting views on the mechanisms controlling organic carbon dynamics in soil. We discuss the divergent opinions about chemical recalcitrance, the microbial or plant origin of persistent soil organic matter, the contribution of particulate organic matter to additional organic carbon storage in soil, and the spatial and energetic inaccessibility of soil organic matter to decomposers. In the second part, we examine the advantages and limitations of big data management and modeling, which are essential tools to link the latest scientific theories with the actions taken by stakeholders. Finally, we show how the analysis and discussion of controversies can guide scientists in supporting stakeholders for the design of (i) appropriate trade-offs for biomass use in agriculture and forestry and (ii) climate-smart management practices, keeping in mind their still unresolved effects on soil carbon storage.",

In Europe, legume production is still marginal with grain legumes covering less than 3% of arable land. A transition towards legume-supported systems could contribute to a higher level of protein self-sufficiency and lower environmental impacts of agriculture. Suitable approaches for designing legume-supported cropping systems are required that go beyond the production of prescriptive solutions. We applied the DEED framework with scientists and advisors in 17 study areas in nine European countries, enabling us to describe, explain, explore, and redesign cropping systems. The results of 31 rotation comparisons showed that legume integration decreased N fertilizer use and nitrous oxide emissions (N 2 O) in more than 90% of the comparisons with reductions ranging from 6 to 142 kg N ha −1 and from 1 to 6 kg N 2 O ha −1 , respectively. In over 75% of the 24 arable cropping system comparisons, rotations with legumes had lower nitrate leaching and higher protein yield per hectare. The assessment of above-ground biodiversity showed no considerable difference between crop rotations with and without legumes in most comparisons. Energy yields were lower in legume-supported systems in more than 90% of all comparisons. Feasibility and adaptation needs of legume systems were discussed in joint workshops and economic criteria were highlighted as particularly important, reflecting findings from the rotation comparisons in which 63% of the arable systems with legumes had lower standard gross margins. The DEED framework enabled us to keep close contact with the engaged research-farmer networks. Here, we demonstrate that redesigning legume-supported cropping systems through a process of close stakeholder interactions provides benefits compared to traditional methods and that a large-scale application in diverse study areas is feasible and needed to support the transition to legume-supported farming in Europe.",

At present, it remains unclear how long perennial crops can sequester carbon in the soil and how soil carbon stock dynamics are influenced by climate, soil, and plant properties across the globe. This study presents a meta-analysis synthesizing 51 publications (351 observations at 77 sites) distributed over different pedo-climatic conditions to scrutinize the effect of perennialization on organic carbon accumulation in soil compared with two annual benchmark systems (i.e., monoculture and crop rotation). Results showed that perennial crops significantly increased soil organic carbon stock by 16.6% and 23.1% at 0–30 cm depth compared with monoculture and crop rotation, respectively. Shortly after establishment (&lt; 5 years), perennial crops revealed a negative impact on soil organic carbon stock; however, long duration (&gt; 10 years) of perennialization had a significant positive effect on soil organic carbon stock by 30% and 36.4% at 0–30 cm depth compared with monoculture and crop rotation, respectively. Compared with both annual systems, perennial crops significantly increased soil organic carbon stock regardless of their functional photosynthetic types (C 3 , C 4 , or C 3 -C 4 intermediates) and vegetation type (woody or herbaceous). Among other factors, pH had a significant impact on soil organic carbon; however, the effect of soil textures showed no significant impact, possibly due to a lack of observations from each textural class and mixed pedoclimatic effects. Results also showed that time effect of perennialization revealed a sigmoidal increase of soil organic carbon stock until about 20 years; thereafter, the soil carbon stocks advanced towards a steady-state level. In conclusion, perennial crops increased soil organic carbon stock compared with annual systems; however, the time since conversion from annual to perennial system decisively impacted soil organic carbon stock changes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Long-term active restoration is often employed to restore degraded grasslands. The establishment of a viable soil seed bank is the key to successful restoration, as it enhances the resilience of vegetation. However, little is known of how the soil seed bank affects vegetation resilience following long-term active restoration of degraded grasslands. We determined seed abundance and species composition of the soil seed bank and soil properties and vegetation resilience of intact, degraded, and long-term (&gt;10 years) actively restored grasslands on the Tibetan plateau (3900–4200 m a.s.l.). The plant-soil-seed bank quality index and structural equation modelling (SEM) were used to assess the effect of the soil seed bank on vegetation resilience. After long-term (&gt;10 years) active restoration of degraded grasslands by sowing seeds of native plant species, the densities of transient and persistent seeds increased by 5%, but seed richness (number of species) decreased by 25% when compared with degraded grasslands. This occurred largely as a result of an increase in grass but decrease in forb seeds. Persistent seeds of grasses play an important role in the productivity of restored grasslands, while the density of persistent seeds serves as an indicator of the resilience of vegetation. A combination of the plant community and soil properties determined seed density. Here, we show for the first time that long-term active restoration enhances vegetation resilience of grasslands by altering the soil seed bank. A high seed density of sown Gramineae and a low seed density of forbs in the soil seed bank is a key to the successful active restoration of degraded grasslands.",

    "abstract": "Conservation agriculture is often assumed to reduce soil N2O emissions. Yet, studies analyzing the specific effect of conservation agriculture practices on N2O emissions give contradictory results. Herein, we synthesized a comprehensive database on the three main conservation agriculture practices (cover crops, diversified crop rotations, and no-till and/or reduced tillage (NT/RT)) to elucidate the role of conservation practices on N2O emissions. Further, we used a random meta-forest approach to identify the most important predictors of the effects of these practices on soil N2O emissions. Averaged across all comparisons, NT/RT significantly decreased soil N2O emissions by 11% (95% CI: –19 to –1%) compared to conventional tillage. The reductions due to NT/RT were more commonly observed in humid climates and in soils with an initial carbon content < 20 g kg–1. The implementation of cover crops and diversified crop rotations led to variable effects on soil N2O emissions. Cover crops were more likely to reduce soil N2O emissions at neutral soil pH, and in soils with intermediate carbon (~20 g kg–1) and nitrogen (~3 g kg–1) contents. Diversified crop rotations tended to increase soil N2O emissions in temperate regions and neutral to alkaline soils. Our results provide a comprehensive predictive framework to understand the conditions in which the adoption of various conservation agriculture practices can contribute to climate change mitigation. Combining these results with a similar mechanistic understanding of conservation agriculture impacts on ecosystem services and crop production will pave the way for a wider adoption globally of these management practices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract There is a lack of data on resources used and food produced at urban farms. This hampers attempts to quantify the environmental impacts of urban agriculture or craft policies for sustainable food production in cities. To address this gap, we used a citizen science approach to collect data from 72 urban agriculture sites, representing three types of spaces (urban farms, collective gardens, individual gardens), in five countries (France, Germany, Poland, United Kingdom, and United States). We answered three key questions about urban agriculture with this unprecedented dataset: (1) What are its land, water, nutrient, and energy demands? (2) How productive is it relative to conventional agriculture and across types of farms? and (3) What are its contributions to local biodiversity? We found that participant farms used dozens of inputs, most of which were organic (e.g., manure for fertilizers). Farms required on average 71.6 L of irrigation water, 5.5 L of compost, and 0.53 m 2 of land per kilogram of harvested food. Irrigation was lower in individual gardens and higher in sites using drip irrigation. While extremely variable, yields at well-managed urban farms can exceed those of conventional counterparts. Although farm type did not predict yield, our cluster analysis demonstrated that individually managed leisure gardens had lower yields than other farms and gardens. Farms in our sample contributed significantly to local biodiversity, with an average of 20 different crops per farm not including ornamental plants. Aside from clarifying important trends in resource use at urban farms using a robust and open dataset, this study also raises numerous questions about how crop selection and growing practices influence the environmental impacts of growing food in cities. We conclude with a research agenda to tackle these and other pressing questions on resource use at urban farms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Maize production in Zambia must increase with a view towards improved food security and reduced food imports whilst avoiding cropland expansion. To achieve this, it is important to understand the causes behind the large maize yield gaps observed in smallholder farming systems across the country. This is the first study providing a yield gap decomposition for maize in Zambia, and combining it with farm typology delineation, to identify the key limiting factors to maize yield gaps across the diversity of farms in the country. The analysis builds upon a nationally representative household survey covering three growing seasons and crop model simulations to benchmark on-farm maize yields and N application rates. Three farm types were delineated, including households for which maize is a marginal crop, households who are net buyers of maize, and households who are market-oriented maize producers. Yield gap closure was about 20% of the water-limited yield, corresponding to an actual yield of 2.4 t ha − 1 . Market-oriented maize farms yielded slightly more than the other farm types, yet the drivers of yield variability were largely consistent across farm types. The large yield gap was mostly attributed to the technology yield gap indicating that more efficient production methods are needed to raise maize yields beyond the levels observed in highest yielding fields. Yet, narrowing efficiency and resource yield gaps through improved crop management (i.e., sowing time, plant population, fertilizer inputs, and weed control) could more than double current yields. Creating a conducive environment to increase maize production should focus on the dissemination of technologies that conserve soil moisture in semi-arid areas and improve soil health in humid areas. Recommendations of sustainable intensification practices need to consider profitability, risk, and other non-information constraints to improved crop management and must be geographically targeted to the diversity of farming systems across the country.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In a growing world population scenario, greater demand for food and in turn agricultural input is expected in the coming decades. The development of innovative sustainable amendments and fertilizers such as hydrogels (HGs) relies on this context. HGs are defined as 3D polymeric networks with the ability to absorb and retain a large amount of water (i.e., swellability). HGs swellability makes them ideal platforms for water- and nutrient-controlled release. The literature reflects a notable diversity in HGs composition, properties, and impacts on agroecosystems, resulting in the dissemination of information across multiple publications. Within this context, the primary aim of this scientific review is to systematically compile, critically evaluate, and synthesize the latest findings and relevant literature pertaining to the application of HGs in agroecosystems. We found that this class of materials was consistently found on soil bulk density, crop available water, soil electrical conductivity, cation exchange capacity and main cereal or legume crops performances particularly under moderate water deficit conditions, suggesting their effectiveness for arid and semi- arid areas. Encouraging results were also found on pesticide, agrochemicals, and microorganisms delivering. Thus, the delivery of agronomic inputs with loaded-HG may play a key role in forthcoming agriculture that would minimize the agronomic impact on the environment. Nevertheless, some critical issues still remain open, concerning: (i) the decreased of HG effectiveness following wetting and drying cycles, (ii) the impact of Na + contained in HG on crop cells, (iii) the HG effect on soil saturated hydraulic conductivity and pH, and (iv) HG biodegradability and their fate into the environment. In conclusion, HGs seem a promising technology to reach/maintain food security and soil health, but future research should address the development of well-defined protocols for producing biowaste-derived HG that will ensure their biodegradability and non-toxicity and will disclose new insights into a circular economy approach agronomy. One of the biggest challenges would be the synthesis of “smart” HG able to respond to environmental stimuli triggering molecule(s) release in soil.",

    "abstract": "As a fundamental pillar of food security in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), ensuring seed security is critical to empowering farmers in cultivating food and livestock feed, thereby fostering income generation from agricultural outputs. Among the crops cultivated by smallholders, legumes have the potential to deliver multifaceted benefits. Legumes are nutrient-dense and enhance soil health through their nitrogen-fixing qualities. However, in many instances, the development, release, and supply of improved legume varieties are insufficient to meet the needs of smallholder farmers in SSA. Here, we systematically reviewed the literature to (i) identify and categorize existing legume seed systems, (ii) map legume varieties available to smallholders, (iii) identify barriers hindering the adoption of various legume varieties, and (iv) identify potential strategies and opportunities for strengthening legume seed systems in SSA. Our results demonstrate the coexistence of formal and informal seed systems within legume seed supply chains in SSA, each employing unique seed distribution channels. Smallholders, however, are shown to predominantly depend on the informal seed system to source most legume seeds except for commercially available varieties. We also identified a diverse range of legume varieties available to smallholders in the region, with farmers having varying trait preferences based on crop type and gender. Notably, high yield and abiotic stress tolerance were the most preferred traits. The adoption of these varieties, however, is influenced by various factors, including lack of timely access to seeds in adequate quantities from the formal seed system, high seed costs, and limited information on new varieties. The reviewed literature highlighted that utilizing improved legume varieties had a positive effect on smallholders, leading to improved welfare, food security, dietary diversity, and income. We conclude that the effective scaling of legume systems in SSA is contingent upon the presence of supportive policy frameworks and well-established technical support structures.",

    "abstract": "Plant production systems worldwide are struggling to meet the diverse and increasing needs of humankind while also facing challenges such as climate change and biodiversity loss. This, combined with the desirable transition from the use of conventional pesticides to more sustainable plant protection solutions, has led to an urgent, and increasing, need for low-risk plant protection products (PPPs) to be developed, applied, and integrated into management practices across all types of plant production systems. Despite a high demand from end users and consumers together with joint political goals at the EU level to replace conventional pesticides, the number of low-risk PPPs on the European market remains low, in comparison to synthetic agrochemicals. In this review, we summarize knowledge about the policy, technical, and administrative issues hampering the process of bringing new low-risk PPPs to the European market. We present an overview of the challenges in using the low-risk PPPs that are currently available within the EU agricultural, horticultural, and forestry sectors. We describe the variation in modes of action and the limitations associated with different application techniques and give concrete examples of problems and solutions from Swedish plant production sectors, in contrast to global perspectives as demonstrated by examples from African agriculture. Finally, we conclude that trans-sectoral, multi-actor approaches are required and provide suggestions on how to address the remaining knowledge gaps related to efficiency, application, and economics of low-risk PPP use in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) solutions for plant protection to improve future food security in Europe.",

    "abstract": "Matching crop varieties to their target use context and user preferences is a challenge faced by many plant breeding programs serving smallholder agriculture. Numerous participatory approaches proposed by CGIAR and other research teams over the last four decades have attempted to capture farmers' priorities/preferences and crop variety field performance in representative growing environments through experimental trials with higher external validity. Yet none have overcome the challenges of scalability, data validity and reliability, and difficulties in capturing socio-economic and environmental heterogeneity. Building on the strengths of these attempts, we developed a new data-generation approach, called triadic comparison of technology options (tricot). Tricot is a decentralized experimental approach supported by crowdsourced citizen science. In this article, we review the development, validation, and evolution of the tricot approach, through our own research results and reviewing the literature in which tricot approaches have been successfully applied. The first results indicated that tricot-aggregated farmer-led assessments contained information with adequate validity and that reliability could be achieved with a large sample. Costs were lower than current participatory approaches. Scaling the tricot approach into a large on-farm testing network successfully registered specific climatic effects of crop variety performance in representative growing environments. Tricot's recent application in plant breeding networks in relation to decision-making has (i) advanced plant breeding lines recognizing socio-economic heterogeneity, and (ii) identified consumers' preferences and market demands, generating alternative breeding design priorities. We review lessons learned from tricot applications that have enabled a large scaling effort, which should lead to stronger decision-making in crop improvement and increased use of improved varieties in smallholder agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The application of nitrogen (N) fertilizer both underpins high productivity of agricultural systems and contributes to multiple environmental harms. The search for ways that farmers can optimize the N fertilizer applications to their crops is of global significance. A common concept in developing recommendations for N fertilizer applications is the “mass balance paradigm” – that is, bigger crops need more N, and smaller less – despite several studies showing that the crop yield at the optimum N rate (N opt ) is poorly related to N opt . In this study we simulated two contrasting field experiments where crops were grown for 5 and 16 consecutive years under uniform management, but in which yield at N opt was poorly correlated to N opt . We found that N lost to the environment relative to yields (i.e., kg N t -1 ) varied +/- 124 and 164 % of the mean in the simulations of the experiments. Conversely, N exported in harvested produce (kg N t -1 ) was +/- 11 and 48 % of the mean. Given the experiments were uniformly managed across time, the variations result from crop-to-crop climatic differences. These results provide, for the first time, a quantitative example of the importance of climatic causes of the poor correlation between yield at N opt and N opt . An implication of this result is that, even if yield of the coming crop could be accurately predicted it would be of little use in determining the amount of N fertilizer farmers need to apply because of the variability in environmental N losses and/or crop N uptake. These results, in addition to previous empirical evidence that yield at N opt and N opt are poorly correlated, may help industry and farmers move to more credible systems of N fertilizer management.",

However, the existing evidence for the effectiveness of plant diversification in enhancing pest biocontrol services is highly uncertain across features of plant diversity and biodiversity characteristics. We undertook a comparative meta-analysis focusing on three essential crops (wheat, maize, and soybean) to investigate how diversification schemes in-field (intercropping) and Agri-environmental scheme (AES) around the field (flower strip, hedgerow and field margin) affect arthropod abundance. A random effects analysis was used to determine the role of 10 key factors underlying the effectiveness of plant diversification including biodiversity level and habitat, main and companion plant species, intercropping arrangement, the growth stage of the main crops, type of AES planting scheme, AES planting width, distance from AES plantings and geographical latitude. The overall results revealed that intercropping reduced herbivore and boosted predators and parasitoids abundance significantly, while AES successfully increased predators but not herbivores. Maize intercropping with legume and non-legume plants and row intercropping allowed for effective pest management. The abundance of predators increased in wheat fields immediately adjacent to planting around the field (AES), but this effect declined beyond 5 m from the flower strips. Our results suggest that the response of arthropod abundance to plant diversification is a compromise between spatial management scale, ecological characteristics of arthropod and plant diversification features. These results offer promising pathways for optimizing plant diversification schemes that include functional farm biodiversity across spatial and temporal scales and designing multi-functional landscapes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Increasing our understanding of farm resilience drivers to climate-related risks is critical for designing innovative farm systems, especially for smallholders that are highly vulnerable to climatic hazards and expected to follow a pathway toward sustainable development. However, the literature is fragmented on the concepts and methods to measure farm resilience. Moreover, quantitative assessments of options to enhance farm resilience to climate risks are scarce. Resilience can be defined as the ability of a system to recover, reorganize and evolve following external stresses and disturbances. Such definition can be applied to farm systems. In this study, we systematically reviewed how changes in resilience-enhancing attributes (reserves, openness, modularity, tightness of feedbacks and diversity) impacted farm performance and resilience to climate-related risks, with a specific attention to smallholder farms. Our analysis showed that reviewed studies assessed farm resilience using the agricultural and economic dimensions of performance, often excluding the socio-environmental dimensions. To assess performance, the average value of indicators was most commonly employed, sometimes combined with variability metrics or the probability of exceeding a critical threshold. Improving one resilience attribute increased one dimension of farm performance for a given metric in most of the studies, but some studies showed the opposite effect. The lack of comprehensive assessments exploring different attributes and their impact on several dimensions of performance using diverse metrics prevents a robust conclusion on how to improve farm resilience to climate-related risks. Therefore, we recommend to pay more attention to quantitative assessments of farm resilience, including a systematic investigation of the temporal variability of performance and the socio-environmental dimensions of performance. Finally, we emphasize the need to focus on the recovery of smallholder farms after a disturbance, with the goal of achieving growth in farm performance rather than simply reverting to their current state of food insecurity and poverty.",

    "abstract": "Sustainable intensification of agricultural production is needed to ensure increased productivity relative to inputs. Short-term yield returns and labor input are major determinants of the fate of sustainable intensification options on smallholder farms in sub-Saharan Africa because labor shortage is often acute, and most farmers lack access to labor-saving technologies. We assessed the relationship between maize grain yield change and labor input from a total of 28 published papers (631 data pairs) including subsets of data pairs within specific sustainable intensification practices. Among the reviewed technologies, manually dug planting basins showed ratios between the change in yield and change in labor inputs (ΔY/ΔL) below 1, suggesting that labor demand increased more than yield. In contrast, ridging showed average ΔY/ΔL values ≥ 2. No-till showed high ΔY/ΔL (average ≥ 1.7) when combined with herbicides but average ΔY/ΔL ≤ 1 (total labor) when manually weeded. Manually weeded rotations showed average ΔY/ΔL ≥ 1 and manually weeded intercropping systems average ΔY/ΔL around 1. The relations revealed four scenarios: high yield returns but low labor demand, high yield returns and labor demand, low yield returns and labor demand, and low yield returns but high labor demand. High yield with high labor demand requires mostly investments in machinery and/or herbicides to reduce labor input. Low yield with low labor demand requires improved crop management, whereas low yield with high labor demand requires a combination of improved crop management and investments to reduce labor. This is the first comprehensive assessment showing that the sustainable intensification options being considered for smallholder farmers may increase crop yield but also labor demand. Options that include mechanization and herbicides at low cost are likely to be adopted due to their reduction effect on drudgery and total labor input.",

In addition, policies fostering the production of regional goods support rural development. Tomato consumption has increased fast in Europe over the last decade. Intensive production techniques such as heated greenhouses and long-distance transport overcome seasonal constraints in order to provide year-round fresh goods. However, studies that evaluate seasonal and off-season production are scarce. Here, we analyzed the carbon footprint of tomato production systems in Austria, Spain, and Italy using a life cycle approach. We collected data from four main supply chains ending at the point of sale in an average Austrian supermarket. We aimed to identify hotspots of greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production, heating, packaging, processing, and transport. Our results show that imported tomatoes from Spain and Italy have two times lower greenhouse gas emissions than those produced in Austria in capital-intensive heated systems. On the contrary, tomatoes from Spain and Italy were found to have 3.7 to 4.7 times higher greenhouse gas emissions in comparison to less-intensive organic production systems in Austria. Therefore, greenhouse gas emissions from tomato production highly depend on the production system such as the prevalence or absence of heating.",

We argue that this can best be achieved through the utilization of biodiversity and the inclusion of marginal arable lands for agricultural production, while maintaining a broad gene pool to secure the potential for future plant production and supporting rural agricultural communities. We present several specific examples of how an emphasis on agricultural biodiversity can provide the basis for a nutritional, reliable, culinary and sustainable food production, and analyse the advantages, limitations and risks of an increased focus on agrobiodiversity. We conclude that the potential for approaches based on the preservation and development of existing agrobiodiversity has not been given sufficient attention in the current scientific and political debates concerning the best strategy to keep pace with global population growth and increasing demand for food. An emphasis on agrobiodiversity is the basis for the most appropriate strategies if the goal is to feed the world in the twenty-first century.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Scarcity of quantity and quality feed has been a key constraint to productivity of smallholder crop-livestock systems. Tropical forages include a variety of annual and perennial grasses, herbaceous and dual-purpose legumes, and multipurpose trees and shrubs. They have been promoted in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) for increasing livestock productivity and household income through higher quantity and quality of herbage, while contributing to soil improvement and higher food crop yields. For the first time, we quantitatively reviewed 72 experimental studies from across SSA to take stock of geographical distribution and forage technology focus of past research; quantify magnitudes of multidimensional impacts of forage technologies; and present variability in forage agronomy data. Improved forage technologies were classified into four groups: (i) germplasm, (ii) management, (iii) cropping system integration, and (iv) feeding regime. Mean weighted response ratios were calculated from 780 pairs of observations for 13 indicators across the five impact dimensions. Improved forage germplasm had on average 2.6 times higher herbage productivity than local controls, with strongest effect in grasses. Feeding regimes with improved leguminous forages increased milk yield by on average 39%, dry matter intake by 25%, and manure production by 24%. When forage technologies were integrated with food crops, soil loss was almost halved, soil organic carbon increased on average by 10%, and grain and stover yields by 60% and 33%, respectively. This study demonstrates the central role improved forages could play in sustainable intensification of crop-livestock systems in SSA. It highlights the need for multidisciplinary and systems-level approaches and studies to quantify synergies and tradeoffs between impact dimensions. Further research is needed to explain forage agronomic yield variability, unraveling interactions between genotype, on-farm environmental conditions, and management factors. Results from this review can inform development programs, prioritizing technologies proven successful for dissemination and indicating magnitudes of expected impacts.",

    "abstract": "Agriculture in the Upper Midwest of the USA is characterized by a short growing season and unsustainable farming practices including low-diversity cropping systems and high fertilizer inputs. One method to reduce the magnitude of these problems is by integrating a winter annual into the summer-annual-dominant cropping system. For this reason, pennycress (Thlaspi arvense) has garnered interest in the agricultural community due to its winter annual growth habit and potential for industrial oil production, making it an ecologically and economically desirable crop. Despite decades of research focusing on pennycress as an agricultural weed, little is known about its best management practices as an intentionally cultivated crop. The majority of agronomic research has occurred within the past 10 years, and there are major gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed prior to the widespread integration of pennycress on the landscape. Here we review relevant agronomic research on pennycress as a winter annual crop in the areas of sowing requirements, harvest, seed oil content, seed oil quality, cropping strategies, ecosystem services, and germplasm development. The major points are as follows: (1) there is little consensus regarding basic agronomic practices (i.e., seeding rate, row spacing, nutrient requirements, and harvest strategy); (2) pennycress can be integrated into a corn (Zea mays)–soybean (Glycine max) rotation, but further research on system management is required to maximize crop productivity and oilseed yields; (3) pennycress provides essential ecosystem services to the landscape in early spring when vegetation is scarce; (4) breeding efforts are required to remove detrimental weedy characteristics, such as silicle shatter and high sinigrin content, from the germplasm. We conclude that pennycress shows great promise as an emergent crop; however, current adoption is limited by a lack of conclusive knowledge regarding management practices and future research is required over a multitude of topics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The diversification of cropping systems has the potential to contribute towards a sustainable land use while preserving biodiversity. Mixed cropping is one possibility to increase biodiversity within farming systems. However, adoption of mixed cropping systems is challenging for farmers, as the agricultural sector has evolved around pure stands over the past decades and path dependencies have emerged. Yet, little is known about farmers’ motivation to adopt mixed cropping. Utilizing the theory of planned behavior as the main framework, this paper studies the psychological factors underlying farmers’ intention to adopt mixed cropping based on an online survey with 172 German farmers. In addition, the most crucial adoption obstacles are assessed. Using partial least squares structural equation modeling, we show for the first time that attitude, perceived behavioral control, and injunctive as well as descriptive group norms explain over 52% of farmers’ intention to adopt mixed cropping. Our results also demonstrate that perceived ecological benefits positively influence a farmer’s attitude towards mixed cropping. Missing sales opportunities for mixed yields, the uneven maturing of crops, and deficient economic benefits are ranked as the most crucial obstacles for the implementation of mixed cropping. These results, which can be relevant for other European countries as well, indicate that the introduction of a voluntary agri-environmental scheme could encourage adoption and that considering positive effects of group norms within policy schemes could further increase adoption on a large scale.",

In this paper, we present the results of an endogenous switching regression model which suggests, for the first time, that legume–cereal rotations have clear economic advantages over cereal monocropping. Rotations provide higher yields, gross margins, and consumption of wheat and faba beans. Most past economic analyses on rotation used data from experimental stations or small-sized farmer surveys covering only one season and variety. This study makes an important improvement by employing two-year data from a large sample of 1230 farm households and their 2643 fields cultivated with different varieties of wheat and faba beans in the wheat-based production system of Morocco. Assuming a biennial rotation – the fastest cycle possible in a rainfed dryland system, this paper is also the first to demonstrate that joint adoption of rotations and improved faba bean varieties leads to a two-year average gross margin that is US$537/ha (48%) higher than wheat monocropping. This is the highest economic benefit of all available cropping options. A striking result of the study is that, contrary to common expectations, adopters of rotation did not use lesser amounts of nitrogen fertilizer than those monocropping wheat, thereby undermining the ecological benefits of faba bean–wheat rotations. Given that current average applications are below marginal product-maximizing levels, higher marginal yields of nitrogen fertilizers after rotation help explain farmers’ current behavior. Our results suggest that: 1) promoting improved legume varieties may enhance adoption of rotation; and 2) an economic rationale should be used as the main driver of the rotation agenda in the dry areas.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Productivity of coffee plantations is threatened by both climate change and decreasing revenues of coffee growers. Using shade trees might protect against temperature variability, erosion and excessive radiation but there may be trade-offs in productivity and quality. While impacts of shade trees on arabica ( Coffea arabica ) have been reviewed, a global synthesis on robusta ( Coffea canephora ) coffee is lacking. We assessed how shade affects robusta growth and productivity, and what are the interactions and trade-offs. We conducted a systematic literature search in Web of Science and CAB Abstracts on 16 December 2019. Thirty papers fulfilled our inclusion criteria of being experimental studies on the impact of overstory trees with approximately half being from Brazil or India. Shade improved robusta tree growth and yield with some contrasting effects on physicochemical and biochemical properties. Shade (&gt; 30%) was associated with reduced beverage quality. Significant interactions between shade and location, rainfall level and robusta clone were found. Among the clones tested, 06V, C153, LB1, GG229 and JM2 showed a higher productivity and growth (from + 17 to + 280%) under moderate shade (41–65%). This is the first meta-analysis of the effects of shade on robusta coffee. By synthesizing data from different studies, we highlight for the first time that the effect of shade on robusta coffee depends on tree age. Shade had positive impacts on older robusta trees (mean of 16 years), while the impact of shade on younger trees was either insignificant or negative. We highlight the importance of both clone type and tree ages. Research gaps included a lack of knowledge on the effects of shade with respect to coffee and shade tree age as well as interactive effects. More in-depth studies are needed to understand the mechanisms of how shade trees affect robusta coffee.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper reviews the empirical literature on the determinants of farmer adoption of sustainable intensification technologies in maize agri-food systems of the Global South. The attributes of the technology and the dissemination institutions interact with farm/farmer-specific variables, leading to heterogeneous impacts, making the prediction of technology adoption challenging. However, most empirical studies oversimplify the adoption process and examine only the farm/farmer-specific variables as the determinants of adoption, thereby limiting the scope of learning on how the attributes of the technology and the dissemination system could have been altered to realize a more efficient and more inclusive technological change. We argue for a realignment of empirical adoption analysis for better implications through a conscious rejection of the assumption that the onus of technology performance rests solely with the farmer. Here we review the studies published between 2007 and 2018 on the adoption of sustainable intensification technologies in maize systems of the Global South to examine how the adoption models are currently dependent on the farm/farmer attributes vis-à-vis the attributes of technologies and disseminating institutions. The main findings from a synthesis of 137 adoption studies are threefold. (1) Limited information access and technologies not suitable for the small landholdings were the major constraints of farmer adoption of technologies. (2) The criticisms on the conventional adoption analysis concerning oversimplification and decontextualization of the decision-making process are reaffirmed. (3) The empirical adoption research needs to incorporate the attributes of technologies and the socio-institutional context to develop better research strategies toward inclusive agrarian development. We examine how the framework of the socioeconomic analysis can be reconstructed to facilitate the research and development (R&amp;D) institutions to overcome the major hurdles of rapid and inclusive dissemination. Evaluation of the degree to which the attributes of technology favor its adoption requires increased research attention.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The honey bee is an important fruit and vegetable pollinator and a producer of honey and other hive products. Beekeeping is a sustainable and high-potential activity for local communities and especially for the rural poor to gain additional income through non-timber forest products, does not require much land or high starting costs, maintains biodiversity and increases crop yields. Ethiopia is one of the top ten honey and beeswax producers in the world, but plays only a minor role in the international honey trade. Unlike large-scale beekeepers using modern techniques found in most leading honey-producing countries, the majority of Ethiopian beekeepers are small-scale producers practicing traditional beekeeping. In this article, we summarize the knowledge on Ethiopian beekeeping, honey bees, honey bee pests, marketing strategies, cultural aspects and major challenges of beekeeping. Furthermore, we used FAOSTAT data to calculate a pollination gap in order to draw the attention of stakeholders and decision-makers to bees and their importance in pollination and sustainable rural development. In regard to forage, we compiled 590 bee forage plants and their flowering times as a supplement to the article. This review outlines the following major points: (1) Ethiopia is a top honey and beeswax producer mainly for the domestic market; (2) Equipment for traditional beekeeping is easily accessible but brings disadvantages (gender gap, limitations in hive management and lower honey yield), while transitional and modern systems require certain beekeeping skills and higher starting costs; (3) Colony numbers increased by 72% from 1993 to 2018 and crop areas needing pollination by 150%; (4) Honey yield per hive and number of beehives managed per area of bee-pollinated crops increased by 20% and 28%, respectively; (5) Pesticide use has been increasing and there is a lack in pesticide use education. Recommendations to realize Ethiopia’s tremendous apicultural potential are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A profound transformation of agricultural production methods has become unavoidable due to the increase in the world’s population, and environmental and climatic challenges. Agroecology is now recognized as a challenging model for agricultural systems, promoting their diversification and adaptation to environmental and socio-economic contexts, with consequences for the entire agri-food system and the development of rural and urban areas. Through a prospective exercise performed at a large interdisciplinary institute, INRAE, a research agenda for agroecology was built that filled a gap through its ambition and interdisciplinarity. It concerned six topics. For genetics, there is a need to study genetic aspects of complex systems (e.g., mixtures of genotypes) and to develop breeding methods for them. For landscapes, challenges lie in effects of heterogeneity at multiple scales, in multifunctionality and in the design of agroecological landscapes. Agricultural equipment and digital technologies show high potential for monitoring dynamics of agroecosystems. For modeling, challenges include approaches to complexity, consideration of spatial and temporal dimensions and representation of the cascade from cropping practices to ecosystem services. The agroecological transition of farms calls for modeling and observational approaches as well as for creating new design methods. Integration of agroecology into food systems raises the issues of product specificity, consumer behavior and organization of markets, standards and public policies. In addition, transversal priorities were identified: (i) generating sets of biological data, through research and participatory mechanisms, that are appropriate for designing agroecological systems and (ii) collecting and using coherent sets of data to enable assessment of vulnerability, resilience and risk in order to evaluate the performance of agroecological systems and to contribute to scaling up. The main lessons learned from this collective exercise can be useful for the entire scientific community engaged in research into agroecology.",

    "abstract": "The coffee research community has maintained a long ongoing debate regarding the implications of shade trees in coffee production. Historically, there has been contrasting results and opinions on this matter, thus recommendations for the use of shade (namely in coffee agroforestry systems) are often deemed controversial, particularly due to potential yield declines and farmers’ income. This study is one of the first demonstrating how several Coffea arabica cultivars respond differently to shade with respect to yield. By standardising more than 200 coffee yield data from various in-field trials, we assembled the so-called “Ristretto” data pool, a one of a kind, open-source dataset, consolidating decades of coffee yield data under shaded systems. With this standardised dataset, our meta-analysis demonstrated significant genotypic heterogeneity in response to shade, showing neutral, inverted U-shaped and decreasing trends between yield and shade cover amongst 18 different cultivars. These findings encourage the examination of C. arabica at the cultivar level when assessing suitability for agroforestry systems. Comparison of productivity is also encouraged across a range of low to moderate shade levels (10–40%), in order to help elucidate potential unknown optimal shade levels for coffee production.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Livestock excrements are used as natural fertilizer, in the form of manure or slurry, to provide nutrients and organic matter to arable soils. However, it is potentially contaminated with antibiotics residues, used in livestock farming to prevent diseases (and thus animal losses), as well as to increase animals’ body weight. This poses a contamination risk to surrounding environments. Therefore, we quantitatively evaluated data from 57 peer-reviewed articles published over the past 20 years to generate an overview of antibiotics residues in manure, slurry, soils, plants, and water. Our results revealed that pig manure and slurry, mostly from European countries, contained fluoroquinolones, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines. Furthermore, antibiotics used in animal husbandry are found to contaminate surrounding environments, exceeding the proposed EU threshold value for maximal environmental contamination by veterinary antibiotics in soil in many countries. In soil samples, the highest contents of tetracyclines and sulfonamides were detected in the UK (41 ± 18 μg/kg and 300 ± 10 μg/kg, respectively) and in Austria (370 μg/kg) for fluoroquinolones. In water environments, antibiotics contents were detected in low amounts in most countries (&lt; 2 μg/L), with the highest content of fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines detected in the USA (3 ± 0.7 μg/L and 1.3 ± 0.6 μg/L, respectively) and of sulfonamides in the USA and Germany (0.3 ± 0.8 μg/L and 0.2 ± 2 μg/L, respectively). In plants, an accumulation of tetracyclines and sulfonamides was found in China, Germany, and Spain (&gt; 50 μg/kg). However, no significant specificity of these antibiotics residues to country or continent could be observed. It is urgent that the use of veterinary antibiotics be significantly reduced in order to diminish their residues in slurry, and thus their contamination potential to the surrounding environments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract It is now essential to reduce the negative impacts of weed management and especially herbicide use. Weed-suppressive crop species/varieties hold promise for integrated and sustainable weed regulation. Competition for resources and allelopathy are the two main underlying mechanisms. Unlike competition, which is well studied and established, allelopathy by living crops remains a contentious mechanism. A major difficulty to demonstrate the effects of allelopathy in the field is to dissociate them from those of competition. Here, we systematically and quantitatively review the literature, searching for field-based evidence of the role of allelopathy (by root exudation of living crops) in weed regulation, independently of competition, focusing on studies comparing different varieties of a given crop species. Our critical literature analysis also aims to identify weaknesses and strengths in methodology, providing insights on optimal experimental designs and avenues for future research. Our main conclusions are: (1) in most articles, the role of crop competition is disregarded or not exhaustively studied. Consequently, contrary to authors’ conclusions, it cannot be determined whether weed regulation is due to allelopathy and/or to competition. (2) Few articles provided convincing evidence of the presence/absence of allelopathy in the field. (3) To further investigate allelopathy in the field we recommend to (i) finely characterize crop competition by measuring traits in the field, (ii) assess crop allelopathic potential with complementary experiments in controlled conditions or by quantifying allelochemicals in the field, and (iii) quantify the contribution of each studied trait/mechanism in explaining weed regulation in the field with multiple regression models. In conclusion, the consistent use of the suggested guidelines, as well as alternative approaches (e.g., creation of varieties with deactivated allelopathic functions, development of process-based simulation models), may provide a basis for quantifying the role of allelopathy in the field and, subsequently, for designing weed management strategies promoting weed biological regulation.",

    "abstract": "Continued population growth and urbanization as well as changing consumption patterns have led to an explosion in the amount of waste produced, especially in cities. To feed the world, we also need to increase agricultural production while limiting our impact on the environment. Part of the solution could be to recycle the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) as a resource for agriculture near cities with techniques such as vermicomposting, which uses earthworms to recycle organic waste into nutrient-rich vermicompost. The objective of this review was to examine (i) whether vermicomposting is appropriate for recycling OFMSW, (ii) the quality of the vermicompost produced, and (iii) the impact of this product on crops and soil parameters. We found that vermicomposting can be adapted for OFMSW recovery because the process is suitable for all the types of OFMSW (food, paper, and green waste). The vermicompost produced is both high in organic carbon (18.83-36.01%) and a potential fertilizer (1.16-2.58% N, 0.42-1.12% P, and 0.61-2.05% K). A comparison with compost from the same types of OFMSW suggested that vermicompost is slightly more suitable for crop production with significantly lower C/N and pH and higher N and P. Vermicompost was actually found to have a better effect on plant growth than compost, suggesting that classical chemical analyses are not always sufficient to characterize the potential of organic amendments/fertilizers. Indeed, the application of vermicompost in the field leads to an increase in carbon storage, water retention, enzymatic and microbiological activity, and soil fauna abundance and diversity. Finally, we found that reports on the use of vermicompost from OFMSW are scarce and most studies focused on the process itself. Overall, our review synthesizes data and the interest in this technique and proposes perspectives for future studies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Food security depends on the ability of staple crops to tolerate new abiotic and biotic pressures. Wheat, barley, and other small grains face substantial yield losses under all climate change scenarios. Intra-plot diversification is an important strategy for smallholder farmers to mitigate losses due to variable environmental conditions. While this commonly involves sowing polycultures of distinct species from different botanical families in the same field or multiple varieties of the same species (varietal mixtures), mixed plantings of multiple species from the same family are less well known. However, the sowing of maslins, or cereal species mixtures, was formerly widespread in Eurasia and Northern Africa and continues to be employed by smallholder farmers in the Caucasus, Greek Islands, and the Horn of Africa, where they may represent a risk management strategy for climate variability. Here, we review ethnohistorical, agronomic, and ecological literature on maslins with a focus on climate change adaptation, including two case studies from Ethiopian smallholder farmers. The major points are the following: (1) farmers in Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Georgia report that mixtures are a strategy for ensuring some yield under unpredictable precipitation and on marginal soils; (2) experimental trials support these observations, demonstrating increased yield advantage and stability under certain conditions, making maslins a potentially adaptive practice when crops are impacted by new biotic and abiotic conditions due to climate change; (3) maslins may balance trade-offs between interfamilial species plantings and varietal mixtures, and expand the total portfolio of traits available for formulating mixtures from varietal mixtures alone; and (4) they may buffer against the impacts of climate trends through passive shifts in species composition in response to environmental pressures. We demonstrate the potential benefits of maslins as an agroecological intensification and climate adaptation strategy and lay out the next steps and outstanding questions regarding the applicability of these cropping systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) is the contributor to agricultural greenhouse gas emissions with the highest warming global potential. It is widely recognised that traffic and animal-induced compaction can lead to an increased potential for N 2 O emissions by decreasing soil oxygen supply. The extent to which the spatial and temporal variability of N 2 O emissions can be explained by soil compaction is unclear. This review aims to comprehensively discuss soil compaction effects on N 2 O emissions, and to understand how compaction may promote N 2 O emission hotspots and hot moments. An impact factor of N 2 O emissions due to compaction was calculated for each selected study; compaction effects were evaluated separately for croplands, grasslands and forest lands. Topsoil compaction was found to increase N 2 O emissions by 1.3 to 42 times across sites and land uses. Large impact factors were especially reported for cropland and grassland soils when topsoil compaction—induced by field traffic and/or grazing—is combined with nitrogen input from fertiliser or urine. Little is known about the contribution of subsoil compaction to N 2 O emissions. Water-filled pore space is the most common water metric used to explain N 2 O emission variability, but gas diffusivity is a parameter with higher prediction potential. Microbial community composition may be less critical than the soil environment for N 2 O emissions, and there is a need for comprehensive studies on association between environmental drivers and soil compaction. Lack of knowledge about the interacting factors causing N 2 O accumulation in compacted soils, at different degrees of compactness and across different spatial scales, limits the identification of high-risk areas and development of efficient mitigation strategies. Soil compaction mitigation strategies that aim to loosen the soil and recover pore system functionality, in combination with other agricultural management practices to regulate N 2 O emission, should be evaluated for their effectiveness across different agro-climatic conditions and scales.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cropping system models are deployed as valuable tools for informing agronomic decisions and advancing research. To meet this demand, early career scientists are increasingly tasked with building crop models to fit into these system modelling frameworks. Most, however, receive little to no guidance as to how to do this well. This paper is an introduction to building a crop model with a focus on how to avoid pitfalls, minimize uncertainty, and maximize value. We synthesized knowledge from experienced model builders and literature on various approaches to model building. We describe (1) what to look for in a model-building dataset, (2) how to overcome gaps in the dataset, (3) different approaches to fitting and testing the model, and (4) how to avoid common mistakes such as over-parameterization and over-fitting the model. The process behind building a crop model can be overwhelming, especially for a beginner, and so we propose a three-pronged approach: conceptualize the model, simplify the process, and fit the model for a purpose. We revisit these three macrothemes throughout the paper to instil the new model builder with the methodical mindset needed to maximize the performance and impact of their crop model.",

The authors investigated processes in case studies at the landscape scale where synergies and trade-offs between social and environmental objectives become the most tangible. Contributions from all continents highlighted regional specificities related to diversification and include research from natural and social sciences, with inter- and transdisciplinary approaches including synthesis of knowledge (reviews), empirical studies with experiments as well as assessments with interviews in case studies: Model-based design of crop diversification, the role of digitalization for achieving sustainability in the European context, ecological engineering for rice pest suppression in China, the role of cereal species mixtures in Ethiopian smallholder farmers, diversified planting in arid irrigation areas in northwestern China, integration of legumes in European and Canadian cropping systems, screening of native forage legumes for northern Swedish grassland systems, cropping system diversification of smallholder farmers in south-central Bangladesh, identification of how farmers imagine diversified landscapes in southern Idaho in the US, farm diversification affecting impacts from COVID-19 across Europe, the role of diversified farming in Mato Grosso Brazil, diversification and soil management measures in Germany, value chain formation for the scaling of crop diversification, and the design process with farmers and scientists for the transition toward legume-supported farming in Europe. A key finding from these examples is that agricultural intensification has led to the simplification of cropping systems and landscapes in terms of species diversity and ecosystem function. To instead move towards sustainable transformation, all system levels (i.e. from the plot, farm, landscape, governance and overall food systems) need to interact and reinforce each other for diversification to deliver the desired outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Soil degradation threatens agricultural production and soil multifunctionality. Efforts for private and public governance are increasingly emerging to leverage sustainable soil management. They require consensus across science, policy, and practice about what sustainable soil management entails. Such agreement does not yet exist to a sufficient extent in agronomic terms; what is lacking is a concise list of soil management measures that enjoy broad support among all stakeholders, and evidence on the question what hampers their implementation by farmers. We therefore screened stakeholder documents from public governance institutions, nongovernmental organizations, the agricultural industry, and conventional and organic farmer associations for recommendations related to agricultural soil management in Germany. Out of 46 recommended measures in total, we compiled a shortlist of the seven most consensual ones: (1) structural landscape elements, (2) organic fertilization, (3) diversified crop rotation, (4) permanent soil cover, (5) conservation tillage, (6) reduced soil loads, and (7) optimized timing of wheeling. Together, these measures support all agricultural soil functions, and address all major soil threats except soil contamination. Implementation barriers were identified with the aid of an online survey among farmers ( n = 78). Results showed that a vast majority of farmers (&gt; 80%) approved of all measures. Barriers were mostly considered to be economic and in some cases technological, while missing knowledge or other factors were less relevant. Barriers were stronger for those measures that cannot be implemented in isolation, but require a systemic diversification of the production system. This is especially the case for measures that are simultaneously beneficial to many soil functions (measures 2, 3, and 4). Results confirm the need for a diversification of the agricultural system in order to meet challenges of food security and climate change. The shortlist presents the first integrative compilation of sustainable soil management measures supporting the design of effective public or private governance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A major effect of environment on crops is through crop phenology, and therefore, the capacity to predict phenology for new environments is important. Mechanistic crop models are a major tool for such predictions, but calibration of crop phenology models is difficult and there is no consensus on the best approach. We propose an original, detailed approach for calibration of such models, which we refer to as a calibration protocol. The protocol covers all the steps in the calibration workflow, namely choice of default parameter values, choice of objective function, choice of parameters to estimate from the data, calculation of optimal parameter values, and diagnostics. The major innovation is in the choice of which parameters to estimate from the data, which combines expert knowledge and data-based model selection. First, almost additive parameters are identified and estimated. This should make bias (average difference between observed and simulated values) nearly zero. These are “obligatory” parameters, that will definitely be estimated. Then candidate parameters are identified, which are parameters likely to explain the remaining discrepancies between simulated and observed values. A candidate is only added to the list of parameters to estimate if it leads to a reduction in BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion), which is a model selection criterion. A second original aspect of the protocol is the specification of documentation for each stage of the protocol. The protocol was applied by 19 modeling teams to three data sets for wheat phenology. All teams first calibrated their model using their “usual” calibration approach, so it was possible to compare usual and protocol calibration. Evaluation of prediction error was based on data from sites and years not represented in the training data. Compared to usual calibration, calibration following the new protocol reduced the variability between modeling teams by 22% and reduced prediction error by 11%.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Faced with the biodiversity extinction crisis and climate change, alternative approaches to food production are urgently needed. Decades of chemical-based weed control have resulted in a dramatic decline in weed diversity, with negative repercussions for agroecosystem biodiversity. The simplification of cropping systems and the evolution of herbicide resistance have led to the dominance of a small number of competitive weed species, calling for a more sustainable approach that considers not only weed abundance but also community diversity and composition. Agroecological weed management involves harnessing ecological processes to minimize the negative impacts of weeds on productivity and maximize biodiversity. However, the current research effort on agroecological weed management is largely rooted in agronomy and field-scale farming practices. In contrast, the contributions of landscape-scale interventions on agroecological weed management are largely unexplored (e.g., interventions to promote pollinators and natural enemies or carbon sequestration). Here, we review current knowledge of landscape effects on weed community properties (abundance, diversity, and composition) and seed predation (a key factor in agroecological weed management). Furthermore, we discuss the ecological processes underlying landscape effects, their interaction with in-field approaches, and the implications of landscape-scale change for agroecological weed management. Notably, we found that (1) landscape context rarely affects total weed abundance; (2) configurational more than compositional heterogeneity of landscapes is associated with higher alpha, beta, and gamma weed diversity; (3) evidence for landscape effects on weed seed predation is currently limited; and (4) plant spillover from neighboring habitats is the most common interpretation of landscape effects on weed community properties, whereas many other ecological processes are overlooked. Strikingly, the drivers of weed community properties and biological regulation at the landscape scale remain poorly understood. We recommend addressing these issues to better integrate agroecological weed management into landscape-scale management, which could inform the movement towards managing farms at wider spatiotemporal scales than single fields in a single season.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Fertilizer recommendations (FR) to improve yields and increase profitability are based on relationships between crop yields and soil nutrient levels measured via soil extraction methods. Within these FR, critical soil nutrient (CSN) levels are used to distinguish nutrient deficient from non-deficient soils. The variation in CSN levels is large, implying a risk of over- or under-fertilization. Here, we review and assess the factors influencing the derivation of CSN levels in order to increase both their reliability and applicability within FR systems. The evaluated factors included site conditions, i.e., crop type and location as a surrogate for climate and soil properties, and methodological factors, i.e., the experimental approach (field or pot experiments), and statistical methods and cut-off point. Results showed that the range of values used to define the medium soil fertility classes coincided with the range of CSN levels derived from experimental data. We show that harmonizing methodological aspects can substantially reduce the uncertainty in the CSN levels (&gt; 50%), implying a substantial enhancement of the reliability of FR systems. Inclusion of site conditions might further improve the reliability. To enable reduction in CSN levels requires well-documented field experiments and standardization of data collection and analysis. We foresee the potential for generic FR systems that make use of reliable data, more process-based interpretation of nutrient pools and accounting for the interactions among nutrients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Global weather changes compel agriculture to be adequately productive under diverse and marginal conditions. In maize, modern hybrids fail to meet this requirement. Although breeding has achieved spectacular progress in grain yield per area through improved tolerance to stresses, including intense crowding, yields at low plant population densities remain almost unchanged. Stagnated plant yield potential renders hybrids unable to take advantage of resource abundance at lower populations, designating them population dependent. Consequently, the optimum population varies greatly across environments. Generally, the due population increases as the environmental yield potential gets higher. As a remedy, relatively low populations are recommended for low-input conditions leading to inappropriate population in occasional adequacy of resources and considerable yield loss. For example, for a rain-fed hybrid tested at one location across 11 seasons, crop yield potential and optimum population on the basis of the quadratic yield-plateau model varied from 1,890 to 8,980 kg/ha and 4.56 to 10.2 plants/m 2 , respectively, while 100 % yield loss is computed in the driest season if the optimum population for the most favorable season is used. The article reviews the consequences in terms of crop sustainability under widely diverse environments imposed by climatic changes and proposes crop management strategies to address the situation. The major points are: (1) variable-yielding environments require variable optimum populations, (2) population dependence is an insurmountable barrier in making a decision on plant population, (3) farmers suffer from considerable yield and income loss, (4) estimating the less population-dependent hybrids among the currently cultivated ones is a major challenge for agronomists, and (5) the development of population-neutral hybrids is a fundamental challenge for maize breeding. Honeycomb breeding is a valuable tool to pursue this goal since it places particular emphasis on the so-far stagnated plant yield potential that is essential for population-neutral hybrid development.",

One of the principal ways of attaining higher productivity and environmental standards is identification and adoption of beneficial management practices (BMP) by reviewing the conventional agricultural activities. The BMP are agricultural practices that promote sustainable land stewardship and maintain/increase profitability of farms. The BMP are from both crop and animal production systems and tradeoffs between the two systems could provide several opportunities in reducing, removing and/or avoiding of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. Despite that, few reviews have presented them together. This review covers GHG emissions related to the BMP in the crop and animal production systems of farms relevant to Canadian Prairie. These BMP include: (1) use of inorganic N fertilizers, (2) livestock and feed management, (3) manure management, (4) cropping systems, (5) tillage practices and (6) improved pasture and grazing management. In addition, sources of variations, quantification methods and adoptability are discussed. Quantified GHG emissions from direct and indirect measurements of researches from Canada and other part of the world are included. Since most experiments are conducted under multiple biophysical scenarios while adopting various methodologies, summarizing the findings was difficult. The effect of BMP on GHG is determined by ecological processes. Such determinants are discussed and knowledge gaps are identified. Integration of crop and livestock production systems could further lead toward higher energy and resource use efficiency; hence less GHG emissions.",

    "abstract": "The use of agrochemicals is expected to increase with the global expansion of oil palm plantations. In line with environmentally sustainable palm oil certification, targeted grazing can minimize the dependency on herbicides for controlling weeds in plantations. Here, we show for the first time that targeted grazing would control weeds and improve biodiversity of desired animal species. We sampled birds at 45 oil palm plantations in Peninsular Malaysia that were systematically grazed, non-systematically grazed, or herbicide-controlled plantations without cattle grazing. We found that bird species richness increased with size of grazing area, but decreased with number of cattle. Bird abundance was higher in the systematic grazing system, but negatively related to number of cattle. These factors explained 18.41 and 25.34% of the observed variations in bird species richness and abundance, respectively. Our findings suggest that targeted cattle grazing can be instrumental for transforming conventional oil palm agriculture into more biodiversity-friendly agroecosystems. Targeted grazing is likely to be practical under field conditions in major palm oil producing countries. In addition, the use of targeted grazing as a biological control method for weeds would be welcomed by palm oil consumers and encouraged by sustainable palm oil certification bodies such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO).",

However, little is known about the effect of landscape structure and local factors on pests, natural enemies, and biological control services in the Neotropics. We investigated how environmental conditions at local and landscape levels affect Leucoptera coffeella (insect pest), social wasps (natural enemies), and the provision of biological control services in 16 Brazilian coffee plantations under different crop management and landscape contexts. We considered microclimatic conditions, coffee plantation size, and management intensity at the local level; and forest cover, landscape diversity, and edge density at the landscape level. Pest population, wasp communities, and biocontrol services were monitored in wet and dry seasons when L . coffeella outbreaks occur. We found that the amount of forest in the surrounding landscape was more important for explaining patterns than the local environment, landscape diversity, or landscape configuration. In both seasons, L . coffeella was negatively affected by forest cover, whereas biological control and richness and abundance of social wasps increased with increasing forest cover at multiple spatial scales. Moreover, biological control was positively correlated with wasp abundance during pest outbreaks, suggesting that social wasps are important natural enemies and provide pest control services within coffee plantations. We provide the first empirical evidence that forest cover is important for the maintenance of social wasp diversity and associated pest control services in a Brazilian coffee-producing region.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Wheat yields in Ethiopia need to increase considerably to reduce import dependency and keep up with the expected increase in population and dietary changes. Despite the yield progress observed in recent years, wheat yield gaps remain large. Here, we decompose wheat yield gaps in Ethiopia into efficiency, resource, and technology yield gaps and relate those yield gaps to broader farm(ing) systems aspects. To do so, stochastic frontier analysis was applied to a nationally representative panel dataset covering the Meher seasons of 2009 and 2013 and crop modelling was used to simulate the water-limited yield (Yw) in the same years. Farming systems analysis was conducted to describe crop area shares and the availability of land, labour, and capital in contrasting administrative zones. Wheat yield in farmers’ fields averaged 1.9 t ha − 1 corresponding to ca. 20% of Yw. Most of the yield gap was attributed to the technology yield gap (&gt; 50% of Yw) but narrowing efficiency (ca. 10% of Yw) and resource yield gaps (ca. 15% of Yw) with current technologies can nearly double actual yields and contribute to achieve wheat self-sufficiency in Ethiopia. There were small differences in the relative contribution of the intermediate yield gaps to the overall yield gap across agro-ecological zones, administrative zones, and farming systems. At farm level, oxen ownership was positively associated with the wheat cultivated area in zones with relatively large cultivated areas per household (West Arsi and North Showa) while no relationship was found between oxen ownership and the amount of inputs used per hectare of wheat in the zones studied. This is the first thorough yield gap decomposition for wheat in Ethiopia and our results suggest government policies aiming to increase wheat production should prioritise accessibility and affordability of inputs and dissemination of technologies that allow for precise use of these inputs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Global demand for pesticide-free food products is increasing rapidly. Crops of all types are, however, under constant threat from various plant pathogens. To achieve adequate control with minimal pesticide use, close monitoring is imperative. Many plant pathogens spread through the air, so the atmosphere is composed of a wide variety of plant pathogenic and non-plant pathogenic organisms, in particular in agricultural environments. Aerobiology is the science that studies airborne microorganisms and their distribution, especially as agents of infection. Although this discipline has existed for decades, the development of new molecular technologies is contributing to an increase in the use of aerobiological data for several purposes, from day-to-day monitoring to improving our understanding of pathosystems. Although the importance of knowing the size and composition of plant pathogen populations present in the air is recognized, technical constraints hinder the development of agricultural aerobiology. Here we review the application of spore sampling systems in agriculture and discuss the main considerations underlying the implementation of airborne inoculum monitoring. The results of this literature review confirm that the use of aerobiological data to study the escape of inoculum from a source and its role in the development of diseases is well mastered, but point at a lack of knowledge to proceed with the deployment of these systems at the landscape scale. Thus, we conclude that airborne inoculum surveillance networks are still in their early stages and although more and more initiatives are emerging, research must be conducted primarily to integrate evolving technologies and improve the access, analysis, interpretation and sharing of data. These tools are needed to estimate short- and medium-term risks, identify the most appropriate control measures with the lowest environmental risk, develop indicators to document the effects of climate change, and monitor the evolution of new genotypes at multiple scales.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Conservation agriculture has been promoted to sustainably intensify food production in smallholder farming systems in southern Africa. However, farmers have rarely fully implemented all its components, resulting in different combinations of no-tillage, crop rotation, and permanent soil cover being practiced, thus resulting in variable yield responses depending on climatic and soil conditions. Therefore, it is crucial to assess the effect of conservation agriculture components on yield stability. We hypothesized that the use of all three conservation agriculture components would perform the best, resulting in more stable production in all environments. We evaluated at, eight trial locations across southern Africa, how partial and full implementation of these components affected crop yield and yield stability compared with conventional tillage alone or combined with mulching and/or crop rotation. Grain yield and shoot biomass of maize and cowpea were recorded along with precipitation for 2 to 5 years. Across different environments, the addition of crop rotation and mulch to no-tillage increased maize grain by 6%, and the same practices added to conventional tillage led to 13% yield increase. Conversely, adding only mulch or crop rotation to no-tillage or conventional tillage led to lower or equal maize yield. Stability analyses based on Shukla’s index showed for the first time that the most stable systems are those in which mulch is added without crop rotation. Moreover, the highest yielding systems were the least stable. Finally, additive main effects and multiplicative interaction analysis allowed clarifying that mulch added to no-tillage gives stable yields on sandy soil with high rainfall. Similarly, mulch added to conventional tillage gives stable yield on sandy soil, but under low rainfall. This is the first study that highlighted the crucial role of mulch to enhance the stability and resilience of cropping systems in southern Africa, supporting their adaptability to climate change.",

    "abstract": "Abstract With the concept of resilience being increasingly applied in farming systems research, there is general agreement that the resilience theory should be supported by sound assessment methodologies. Yet, in the extant literature, definitions and measures of resilience as a system outcome, a system capability or a process are often conflated, causing conceptual and methodological ambiguities. To overcome these limitations, here we systematically review the literature on assessing the resilience of farming systems and identify patterns, including similarities and differences in underpinning theories and in methodologies. We analyzed 123 papers on how the resilience of farming systems is conceptualized and assessed. From these papers, we identified four theoretical positions (“lenses”): traditional, vulnerability, capacities, and agroecology. These lenses differ and complement each other in terms of the outcome definition of resilience (stability, transformation, and reduced vulnerability), the prominent components of resilience (capacities, practices, and resources), and the perturbations that farming systems are exposed to (shocks, exposure, and sensitivity). Collectively, these lenses offer a novel causality framework with a complementary set of causal links between perturbations, components, and outcomes. This paper suggests for the first time that resilience assessment methodologies can be further developed by drawing from the strengths and complementarities of the different perspectives. Hence, this paper identifies five design choices that need to be made in order to rigorously assess the resilience of farming systems. These concern the choice of system traits, of perturbations, of type of resilience, of contributing factors, and of resilience outcomes that will be considered.",

    "abstract": "Abstract To promote greater sustainability in agriculture, development of agroecology is increasingly being invoked. What are the conditions for establishing agroecological production in tropical regions? Based upon case studies in several tropical areas, we provide here some answers to this question. We review the “pillars” (i.e. principles) and the “implementation levers” (i.e., tools) for the development of agroecology. We identify three main pillars: (1) the mobilization and management of ecological processes for the sustainable production and the resilience of agroecosystems; (2) the development of interactions between technical, social, environmental, and institutional components of agroecosystems for a holistic approach to agroecology; and (3) the scaling up of agroecology that takes place with a plurality of actions and pathways at different organization levels rather than an increase in resources and a replication of standardized technical processes. To implement these three pillars, we identify 11 main bio-technical, cognitive, socio-political, and organizational levers. Bio-technical levers include those for (1) mobilizing complementarity between crop species to optimize natural resources use, (2) mobilizing functional biodiversity at the plot scale to optimize natural regulation of pests and diseases, (3) managing biodiversity at landscape and territorial scales, (4) increasing the efficiency of biogeochemical cycles, and (5) renewing targets for genetic improvement. Cognitive, socio-political, and organizational levers include those for (6) political and institutional action at the national and global level, (7) action at the local level to support producers, (8) political and organizational action at the territorial level, (9) the marketing and the development of new agri-chains, (10) the development of new methods for evaluating production systems, and (11) the recognition of the values of gender and generation within families and other organisational levels. This paper provides an overall orientation for the agroecological transition in tropical agriculture and also considers the socio-political context that underlies this transition.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the face of climate change, cropping systems need to achieve a high performance, providing food and feed and adapting to variable environmental conditions. Diversification of cropping systems can support ecosystem services and associated biodiversity, but there is little evidence on which temporal field arrangement affects the performance of crop yields (productivity and stability), partly due to a lack of long-term data and appropriate indicators. The objectives of this study were to quantify the effect of cropping system diversification on yield stability, environmental adaptability, and the probability of diversified systems to outperform less diverse cereal-based systems in Europe. Spring and winter cereal yields were analyzed from long-term field experiments from Sweden, Scotland, and France. We investigated diversification through (i) introduction of perennial leys, (ii) increasing the proportion of ley in the rotation, (iii) varying the order in which crops are positioned in the rotation, (iv) introduction of grain legumes, and (v) introduction of cover crops. The results showed that cereal crops within cropping systems incorporating perennial leys outperformed systems without leys in 60–94% of the comparisons with higher probabilities at low fertilizer intensities. The yield stability of oat did not differ, but mean yields were 33% higher, when grown directly after the ley compared to oat grown two years later in the crop sequence under similar management. Durum wheat grown in a cropping system with grain legumes had higher yields in lower-yielding environmental conditions compared to rotations without legumes. Diversification with cover crops did not significantly affect yield stability. We conclude that diverse cropping systems can increase cereal productivity and environmental adaptability and are more likely to outperform less diverse systems especially when introducing perennial forage legumes into arable systems. Effects of diversification on cereal yield stability were inconsistent indicating that higher productivity is achievable without reducing yield variability. These novel findings can support the design of more diverse and high-performing cropping systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cropping of rice and wheat ( Triticum aestivum L .) in rotation contiguously in the same field is a fundamental pillar of double-cropping systems in southern China. Yields of such cropping systems are increasingly challenged as climate change (CC) drives increases in autumnal rainfall, delaying rice harvesting and subsequent sowing of wheat. Here, our purpose was to identify prospective traits of wheat crops enabling adaptation to later sowing and successively truncated growing seasons caused by CC. To identify traits that maintained or improved yields, we constructed 4,096 hypothetical genotypes underpinned by step-wise variations in parameters regulating phenology, growth and yield components. We then assimilated biophysical response surfaces through genotype (G) by environment (E) by management (M) analyses (G×E×M) using six locations spread across the breadth of southern China. We showed that later sowing reduced cumulative radiation interception, cumulative thermal time and crop capture of growing season rainfall. The culmination of these factors shortened crop duration and decreased biomass accumulation and retranslocation after anthesis, reducing grain number and penalising yields. Genotypes that had greater radiation use efficiency, longer juvenile phases and greater grain filling rates were more effective in alleviating yield losses with delayed sowing. However, not even the highest yielding genotype × management combination could entirely alleviate yield losses with delayed sowing. Our results suggest that CC and increasingly frequent extreme climatic events may reduce wheat yields in such cropping systems in the absence of other adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Some European countries are exploring the idea of replacing dedicated crops with energy cover crops for biogas production. Indeed, energy cover crops can generate consequential biomass without competing with food crops for land use. However, the potential benefits and impacts of this choice are not fully understood. Here, we review what is known about the consequences of energy cover crop usage by examining management regimes and digestate use, including impacts on the environment and cropping system performance. First, compared to cover crops, energy cover crops are intensively managed to produce more biomass (&lt; 5 t DM/ha vs. up to 16 t DM/ha). Second, nitrogen is conserved during anaerobic digestion and is more readily available to crops in digestate than in cover crops residues. However, ammonia is lost via volatilization, which could reduce nitrogen use efficiency, depending on the storage conditions and application method. Third, 43–80% of the crops’ initial carbon is transformed into biogas. That said, levels of soil carbon storage may nonetheless resemble those obtained with cover crops left behind because carbon is stabilized during anaerobic digestion and the energy cover crops’ roots and stubble are left behind in the soil. Fourth, energy cover crops can act as multiservice cover crops, reducing nitrate leaching, improving soil microbial activity, and enhancing soil physical properties during the fallow period. Fifth, energy cover crop usage can have certain disservices, such as soil compaction, the need for additional inputs (e.g., irrigation, fertilization, pesticides), reduced groundwater recharge, and reduced following crop yield. In summary, expanding the usage of energy cover crops for biogas production does not seem to be an environmental threat. However, care must be taken to avoid the intensification of irrigation and lengthening growing periods to boost biomass, which could reduce food production.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Seeds are a vector of genetic progress and, as such, they play a significant role in the sustainability of the agri-food system. The current global seed market is worth USD 60 billion that is expected to reach USD 80 billion by 2025. Seeds are most often treated before their planting with both chemical and biological agents/products to secure good seed quality and high yield by reducing or preventing losses caused by diseases. There is increasing interest in biological seed treatments as alternatives to chemical seed treatments as the latter have several negative human health and environmental impacts. However, no study has yet quantified the effectiveness of biological seed treatments to enhance crop performance and yield. Our meta-analysis encompassing 396 studies worldwide reveals for the first time that biological seed treatments significantly improve seed germination (7±6%), seedling emergence (91±5%), plant biomass (53±5%), disease control (55±1%), and crop yield (21±2%) compared to untreated seeds across contrasted crop groups, target pathogens, climatic regions, and experimental conditions. We conclude that biological seed treatments may represent a sustainable solution to feed the increasing global populations while avoiding negative effects on human health and ensuring environmental sustainability.",

    "abstract": "Millions of people rely on nature-rich farming systems for their subsistence and income. The contributions of nature to these systems are varied and key to their sustainability in the long term. Yet, agricultural stakeholders are often unaware or undervalue the relevance of those contributions, which can affect decisions concerning land management. There is limited knowledge on how farming practices and especially those that build more strongly on nature, including agroecological practices, may shape farmers' livelihoods and well-being. We aim to determine the effect that farmer perception of contributions from nature, socioeconomic conditions, and farming practices, have on outcomes related to food security and human well-being. We conducted 467 household surveys in an agricultural growth corridor in rural Tanzania, which is also essential for nature conservation due to its high biodiversity and its strategic location between several protected areas encompassing wetland, forest, and grassland habitats. Results show that implementing more agroecological practices at farm scale has a positive effect on farmer well-being in the study landscape. Results also indicate that higher awareness of benefits from nature, as well as engagement with agricultural extension services, are associated with higher number of agroecological practices applied in the farm. This research confirms the relevance of capacity-building initiatives to scale up the uptake of agroecological practices in the tropics. It also shows, using empirical evidence, that farming practices taking advantage of nature's contributions to people can positively affect food security and human well-being, even when those practices complement conventional ones, such as the use of synthetic inputs. Understanding the impact of agroecological farming on the well-being of smallholder farmers in the tropics paves the way for policy and program development that ensures global food demands are met in a sustainable way without compromising the well-being of some of the world's most vulnerable people.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Geographical Indications (GIs) scheme is the EU’s primary policy tool for increasing the market values of geographically distinct food products. Although GIs are linked to the landscapes of food production, little is known about the social-ecological values they represent, mainly due to a lack of spatial data. In this study, we, therefore, mapped all 638 food products labeled as Protected Designations of Origin (PDOs), using NUTS-3 areas as proxies for their actual extent, and correlated their distribution with 13 social-ecological indicators. By compiling this novel dataset, we show that the presence of PDOs strongly overlaps with environmental and cultural values. We reveal positive correlations of PDO frequency with high nature value farmland, semi-natural agriculture, tourism, and cultural heritage indicators. Further, we find that PDOs occur more often in economically weaker areas with older and declining populations. Besides differences in PDO distribution between northern and southern EU countries, we find different correlation patterns across the four largest food categories. For example, cheese and meat products are less correlated to environmental values compared to oils and fats, or fruit, vegetables and cereals. On that basis, we identify the potential of PDOs to support structurally deprived areas and propose PDOs as entry points for sustainable transformation and rural development policies—while simultaneously contributing to the conservation of cultural landscapes and their associated environmental values. As outlined in the Green Deal of the European Union and its Farm to Fork strategy, PDOs should be a part of this transformation. Based on the results of this study, we discuss more specifically for which production systems and under what enabling conditions PDOs are fit for this challenge. We recommend that future governance interventions for a sustainable transformation of EU’s agriculture should take the differences across regions and product categories into account.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite the potential of diversification strategies to achieve sustainability, diversified systems such as agroforestry are still not widely implemented by farmers, which indicates the need to further understand and adequately assess the impacts of diversification to inform the design of complex systems. In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review focused on agroforestry coffee systems, to assess (i) how current methods and indicators are used to quantify the impact of diversification on multiple dimensions of system sustainability, and (ii) to assess the impact of diversification through coffee agroforestry on multiple dimensions of sustainability. Our analysis was based on 215 selected papers and all the indicators identified could be classified in one of the sustainability dimensions proposed in our framework: ecosystem services (57.2%), biodiversity (35.6%), input use (4%), socio-economic sustainability (2.7%) and resilience capacity (0.5%). Despite the broad scope of the indicators, individual studies were found to often lack interdisciplinarity and a systemic view on agroecosystems. Besides, not only were there few studies that included the impacts of diversification on input use, socio-economic sustainability and resilience capacity, but specific biodiversity attributes (e.g. functional diversity, landscape diversity) and ecosystem services (e.g. soil biological quality, water regulation, pollination) were generally underreported. The impact of diversification was more positive than negative in all dimensions of sustainability, with the exception of crop productivity. Yet, diversified systems are associated with reduced costs and high yields can still be achieved in diversified systems with appropriate agricultural management (e.g. adequate number and type of shade trees). Key to reaping the benefits of diversified systems is that the diversity of elements is carefully integrated considering the impact on multiple dimensions of system sustainability. A better understanding of synergies and trade-offs remains crucial for the customized design of diverse and sustainable systems for a variety of geo-climatic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The convergence among the rise of digital technologies, the attention paid to the localized issues of transitions in practices toward agroecology, and the emergence of new open innovation models are renewing and reviving the scientific community’s interest in on-farm experimentation (OFE). This form of experimentation is claimed to be enhanced by digital tools as well as being an enabler of production of credible, salient, and legitimate science insofar as it embraces a farmer-centric perspective. However, the forms of research in which some experimental activities on farms are anchored vary greatly, notably with regard to the actual forms that interventions on farms take, the legitimacy of the actors involved and their roles, or the observations and instruments applied for interpretation. We propose a systematic review of the literature and an analytical framework in order to better understand this diversity of practices behind on-farm experimentation. Our analysis segregated six major publication clusters based on themes appearing in titles and abstracts. These themes guided a more in-depth analysis of representative articles, from which we identified seven types of OFE practices that are described and discussed here with regard to the knowledge targeted, roles of the various actors, and on-farm experimental space. Our typology provides an original basis for supporting reflexivity and building alignment between the above-mentioned dimensions and the ways in which new tools can support the experimental process.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Agroforestry is gaining interest due to its potential in enhancing climate resilience and sustainability of farming systems. In this meta-analysis, the crop yield in agroforestry system compared to the control (sole crop) from thirty-six experimental field trials in Mediterranean countries was assessed. The response variable Wlog(RR) (i.e., the weighted natural logarithm of the response ratio) was analyzed by the 95% confidence intervals of mean and by fitting eight linear mixed models. Fixed effects, namely the tree cover (low, medium, high), the tree species (ash tree, chestnut, cork oak, holm oak, olive, poplar, walnut), and the crop species (alfalfa, barley, durum wheat, faba bean, forage, oat, pasture, pea, winter wheat) were significant ( P = 0.030, P = 0.017, and P = 0.014, respectively), while the system type (alley cropping, silvo-arable, silvo-pastoral) was not. Among management practices (variety, pruning, fertilization, irrigation, crop age classes, imposed warming and drought, harvest time), only the fertilization significantly improved the response variable ( P = 0.006), while the interaction of pruning × crop species was marginally significant ( P = 0.065). Relatively large study heterogeneity was observed ( Q = 72.6, I 2 = 72%), which is quite common for agronomic meta-analysis. On the contrary, publication bias based on funnel plots and the Trim and Fill method suggested symmetrical distribution of studies. The sensitivity analysis for significant models identified room for improvements. Overall, we observed a negative effect of trees on crop yield that could be ascribed to the competition for light. Nonetheless, facilitation could be expected under extreme climate events, provided that agricultural practices will maximize synergies among tree cover, tree species, crop species, and management. Future works are encouraged to focus on the overall benefit agroforestry can provide at the field and landscape level, along with long-term monitoring to assess the whole lifespan of these systems and other companion planting options and designs in the Mediterranean region.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Intensification and homogenization of agricultural landscapes have led to a strong decline in European farmland birds. Agroforestry systems, which were widespread in the past, are regaining attention as they could return structural heterogeneity to agricultural landscapes. However, few studies focus on the effects of such systems on biodiversity and especially bird diversity. We hypothesized that agroforestry systems host a higher alpha and beta diversity of birds compared to open agriculture as well as distinct bird communities. Moreover, we expected that bird communities in temperate Europe and the Mediterranean are differently affected by agroforestry systems. In this study, we assessed breeding bird diversity via audio recordings in nineteen mature agroforestry plots, comprising both silvoarable and silvopastoral systems distributed across seven countries in temperate and Mediterranean Europe. For comparison, bird diversity was also assessed in nearby open agricultural land, forests, and orchards. Bird species richness in agroforestry was more than doubled compared to open agricultural land and similar to the diversity found in forests and orchards. Community composition and within-habitat beta diversity differed between the habitat types and between European regions. While temperate agroforestry systems hosted generalist and woody habitat species, bird communities in Mediterranean agroforestry were composed of species from both open and woody habitats. Beta diversity was significantly higher in agroforestry than in open agriculture in temperate systems but not in the Mediterranean. Our study demonstrates that agroforestry systems represent a valuable habitat for breeding birds in European agricultural landscapes. A wider adoption of these systems could thus contribute to halting and reversing the decline in bird diversity, especially in temperate agricultural landscapes.",

The aim of this study was to understand and explain work satisfaction of farmers running an organic mixed livestock farm. Using a mixed-method approach, quantitative and qualitative data were collected from 102 farmers in seven European countries during face-to-face interviews. We showed for the first time that across Europe and different animal species and category combinations, organic mixed livestock farms can provide a high work satisfaction, despite a high workload. By using a mixed-method approach and a clear framework, we aimed at better understanding work satisfaction. Underlying reasons for work satisfaction included the diversity of tasks, opportunities to learn, autonomy in the work schedule, perceived acknowledgement by consumers, and the contribution to sustainable food production. Factors contributing to work satisfaction identified in the analysis of quantitative data included workload, number of livestock units, mental complexity, proportion of work peaks per year, and the match between wanted free time and time taken off work. The combination of qualitative and quantitative data allowed a deeper understanding of farmers’ work satisfaction and revealed consistent findings. Future research should investigate the relationship between farmers’ work satisfaction and capacity for innovation, flexibility, and adaptation potential.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Rice cultivation plays a vital role in the Southeast Asian (SEA) economy, but it poses environmental challenges and contributes a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions. To address these concerns, sustainable agricultural practices (SAPs) for rice production have been introduced to mitigate the environmental impact of rice production while fostering economic and social sustainability. However, the adoption of these practices remains limited, highlighting the need for a critical review of existing literature to gain deeper insights into the factors influencing farmers’ adoption of these practices in SEA countries. This review analyzed 39 manuscripts to assess the current state of SAPs for rice cultivation in SEA. We found that socio-demographic variables and farm management variables were frequently examined in these studies, with varying levels of significance. Economic and institutional variables were moderately studied and tended to have more significant findings. There is a noticeable research gap regarding behavioral factors, emphasizing the need for further investigation in SEA. Furthermore, the findings underscore the importance of conducting additional research to develop effective monetary and non-monetary incentives and explore methodologies to address the gaps in understanding farmers’ trade-offs and preferences among different SAPs. These efforts are crucial for promoting the widespread adoption of SAPs in rice cultivation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cropping systems depend on external nitrogen (N) to produce food. However, we lack metrics to account for society’s fertilizer dependency, although excessive increases in N application damage human and environmental health. The objective of this study is to propose a novel indicator, N fertilizer dependency, calculated as the ratio between human-controllable external inputs and total N inputs. Nitrogen fertilizer dependency has a solid mathematical base being derived from closing the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) equation. This study also tests the value of the N fertilizer dependency concept at the cropping system (plant-soil) scale and at different spatial scales, from field to country, as a complementary indicator to promote sustainable production. The field experiments conducted with grain cereals as a main crop showed that when replacing the barley precedent crop with a legume, N fertilizer dependency accounted for soil legacy and was reduced by 15% in fertilized treatments. In a farm population, N fertilizer dependency ranged from 47 to 95% and accounted for the relevance of biological fixation and irrigation water N inputs, adding pertinent information to performance indicators (i.e., NUE). At the country scale, N fertilizer dependency showed different temporal patterns, depending mainly on the relevance of biological atmospheric N fixation. Nitrogen fertilizer dependency of global cropping systems has risen to ≈83% in the last five decades, even though the N exchange among regions has increased. Nitrogen fertilizer dependency has great potential to monitor the achievements of efforts aiming to boost system autonomy, and within similar agricultural systems, it can be used to identify practices that lead to a reduction of fertilizer needs. In summary, N fertilizer dependency is a new indicator to evaluate the agroenvironmental sustainability of cropping systems across the scales and provides a complementary dimension to the traditional indicators such as NUE, N output, and N surplus.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Accurate calculation of nitrogen requirements is essential in rice fields utilizing both local manure and mineral fertilizers to mitigate nitrogen deficiencies and yield losses associated with reducing chemical fertilizer use. Traditional approaches often fail to effectively integrate organic and mineral fertilizers or adapt to the complexities of real-farm conditions. To tackle these challenges, this study introduced a novel application of the Nitrogen Fertilizer Optimization Algorithm (NFOA), leveraging remote optical sensors and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to deliver precise, data-driven nitrogen recommendations for the effective integration of organic fertilization in rice cultivation. Fertilizer prescription maps generated by the NFOA delivered precise nitrogen recommendations tailored for diverse real-farm fields. The algorithm demonstrated strong predictive performance for yield responses to nitrogen application at critical phenological stages, such as panicle initiation and maximum tillering (R 2 = 0.71, p &lt; 0.0001; R 2 = 0.73, p &lt; 0.0001). Key findings demonstrate the model’s ability to optimize nitrogen inputs, achieving up to a 40% reduction in surplus nitrogen while maximizing yields. By promoting a balanced nitrogen input-output equilibrium, the NFOA offers significant environmental and economic benefits, even in the context of the complexities associated with organic fertilization. In conclusion, these findings suggest that the NFOA approach is suitable for calculating nitrogen fertilizer requirements in rice fields using organic fertilization strategies, effectively accommodating the high variability in nutrient content and availability of organic nitrogen to rice crops. However, further refinement is necessary to enhance its predictive accuracy by incorporating advanced spectral indices and accounting for detailed environmental and management factors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Agriculture is a key contributor to gaseous emissions causing climate change, the degradation of water quality, and biodiversity loss. The extant climate change crisis is driving a focus on mitigating agricultural gaseous emissions, but wider policy objectives, beyond net zero, mean that evidence on the potential co-benefits or trade-offs associated with on-farm intervention is warranted. For novelty, aggregated data on farm structure and spatial distribution for different farm types were integrated with high-resolution data on the natural environment to generate representative model farms. Accounting for existing mitigation effects, the Catchment Systems Model was then used to quantify global warming potential, emissions to water, and other outcomes for water management catchments across England under both business-as-usual and a maximum technically feasible mitigation potential scenario. Mapped spatial patterns were overlain with the distributions of areas experiencing poor water quality and biodiversity loss to examine potential co-benefits. The median business-as-usual GWP20 and GWP100, excluding embedded emissions, were estimated to be 4606 kg CO 2 eq. ha −1 (inter-quartile range 4240 kg CO 2 eq. ha− 1 ) and 2334 kg CO 2 eq. ha −1 (inter-quartile range 1462 kg CO 2 eq. ha −1 ), respectively. The ratios of business-as-usual GHG emissions to monetized farm production ranged between 0.58 and 8.89 kg CO 2 eq. £ −1 for GWP20, compared with 0.53–3.99 kg CO 2 eq. £ −1 for GWP100. The maximum mitigation potentials ranged between 17 and 30% for GWP20 and 19-27% for GWP100 with both corresponding medians estimated to be ~24%. Here, we show for the first time that the co-benefits for water quality associated with reductions in phosphorus and sediment loss were both equivalent to around a 34% reduction, relative to business-as-usual, in specific management catchment reporting units where excess water pollutant loads were identified. Several mitigation measures included in the mitigation scenario were also identified as having the potential to deliver co-benefits for terrestrial biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "In France, researchers and public policy makers are calling for the agroecological transition of livestock. This transition is facing technical, economic, social, and cultural obstacles. Whereas technical obstacles are extensively studied, other categories remain little studied despite their potential role in agroecological transition of livestock. This article aims to analyze the livestock cultural and territorial vitality (dis)services perceived by local actors on two distinct French territories and to understand how these services could act as levers for the agroecological transition of livestock. To do so, we interviewed 45 local actors from the livestock sector and local rural development in two French territories: Aubrac (24) and Pays de Rennes (21). We conducted inductive content analyses to draw on interviewees' perceptions and link the cultural and territorial vitality services identified to the agroecological transition of livestock. Our work revealed 20 cultural and territorial vitality services that can be organized into 11 categories (7 categories of cultural services and 4 categories of territorial vitality services). Among the 11 cultural services, cultural landscapes linked to livestock and gastronomy heritage were the most cited. Among the nine territorial vitality services, the contribution to social bonds on the territories was the most cited. Here, we showed for the first time that the prioritization of cultural and territorial vitality services were different between the territories studied. Emblematic cow breed, food know-how, and quality products were more important in Aubrac, whereas territorial vitality services such as on-farm jobs and social bonds linked to livestock were more cited in the Pays de Rennes. Such methodological approach allowed us to highlight and prioritize the different cultural and vitality services, which need to be supported by public policy and translated into action.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Agri-food system transitions are a considerable challenge requiring stakeholder alignment on what changes need to be made and how. When stakeholders do not agree on the goals or methods of a transition, this can be a serious obstacle to success. This paper analyzes 42 vision documents for the future of Dutch agriculture from a broad range of stakeholders to determine stakeholder alignment using an inductive coding approach. We identified 23 issues as the main challenges for the transition in these documents. We are the first to categorize them according to a recently proposed problem-solution space for wicked problems. Stakeholders were fully aligned in recognizing the problem for the majority of issues, but showed agreement on solutions for less than a quarter. For the issues of international orientation, sector size, and farm business models, we found a lack of consensus on the problem, indicating fundamental disagreement about the type of agricultural sector desired by stakeholders. The apparent consensus on environmental and social issues provides clear societal expectations for agronomic development and innovation, while the divergence on economic issues highlights the rift between growth-oriented paradigms and more holistic paradigms like agroecology. The crucial empirical novelty of this paper is that progress on environmental and social matters is restricted by divergent views on the economic characteristics of a future agri-food system, adding further complexity to mission-oriented transition and innovation policies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ground beetles (carabids) constitute an important functional component of biodiversity in agroecosystems, mainly because of their role as predators of pests, but also as consumers of weed seeds and as prey to other organisms. Over the past few decades, there has been a marked and continuous decline of ground beetles in Europe, and many species of this insect family are threatened by intensive agricultural practices. The effect of soil tillage, a standard technique in arable farming, on carabids has been investigated in many experimental studies. However, there is currently no clear and differentiated picture of how ground beetles are affected by tillage operations in direct and indirect ways. In this review, we narrow this gap of knowledge and show that the effects of intensive tillage on ground beetles—especially the use of mouldboard ploughing—are extremely variable. Nonetheless, on balance across multiple studies, greater tillage intensity tends to have a negative effect on abundance, species richness, and diversity. The observed variability may partly be attributed to a change in species-specific food availability or habitat conditions, induced by tillage. Tillage effects on dominant species tend to have a strong impact on total carabid abundance. The high variability of carabid responses to tillage is also a consequence of various modifying factors such as cover cropping, rotations, and variations in weed control associated with tillage. Because different modes of tillage tend to affect different carabid species, the diversification of tillage operations within a farm or region may contribute to the overall diversity of carabid communities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Relay intercropping of subsidiary legumes with durum wheat (living mulch) can be a viable option to support ecological weed control and optimize nutrient cycling in cereal-based cropping systems. However, the lack of knowledge on suitable legume species is often identified as the main bottleneck for the successful application of legume living mulches. This study aimed to evaluate the suitability of 12 different legumes for relay intercropping with wheat in two contrasting Mediterranean cereal-based cropping systems respectively characterized by low-input and integrated management. Each legume was monitored from the undersowing in wheat until the following spring and we compared direct drilling to broadcast sowing of legumes. None of the undersown legumes showed a negative effect on the wheat grain yield. Relay intercropping of legumes proved to be an effective solution to control weeds before and after the wheat harvest, provided suitable legumes species are chosen. Suitable legumes reduced the weed biomass up to the 90% during the intercropping and up to 94% in the following spring. On the contrary, legumes such as T r i f o l i u m resupinatum , V i c i a villosa , M e d i c a g o truncatula , and M e d i c a g o scutellata boosted weed growth in the following spring in comparison with the control. According to the performance of legumes, M e d i c a g o sativa , T r i f o l i u m repens and M e d i c a g o lupulina had the most suitable characteristics for relay intercropping with durum wheat at the Ravenna site, in a highly productive region whereas M e d i c a g o sativa , H e d y s a r u m coronarium and T r i f o l i u m subterraneum performed better in the low-input system near Pisa, where yields are generally lower. This is the first time that such a diversity in legumes species is tested in the same experiment for relay intercropping under diversified environmental and management conditions. The results of this study can support farmers in selecting the most appropriated legume species for their specific cropping systems and local conditions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Traditional rice ( Oryza sativa L.) cropping systems under flooding irrigation combined with conventional tillage management are under increasing threat due to a loss of soil quality and a scarcity of water resources, especially in Mediterranean environments. Hence, the development of such management strategies as no-tillage, the application of organic amendments, and water-saving methods could be vital in enhancing the sustainability of rice crops. This work tests the combination of various management systems for growing rice under Mediterranean conditions. It assesses for the first time their influence on soil properties and rice yield components. A field experiment was carried out in southern Spain over 3 years (2015–2017) with six treatments: tillage and continuous flood irrigation either without or with application of two-phase olive mill waste compost; tillage and sprinkler irrigation either without or with application of mill waste compost; direct seeding (no tillage) and sprinkler irrigation either without or with application of mill waste compost. Applying mill waste compost in combination with sprinkler-rice systems improved significantly the soils’ properties. Sprinkler-rice yield was similar to that of rice under tillage and flooding, but it used less irrigation water. In 2017, the greatest rice yield occurred under tillage and sprinkler irrigation with application of mill waste compost (8581 kg ha -1 ), showing the importance of soil organic matter on yields. Additionnally, flooding increased significantly weed density because it lowered herbicide efficacy, making weed control a key issue for rice yields. Thus, the novelty of this communication is showing that the application of mill waste compost combined with sprinkler irrigation may be a sustainable alternative for rice crops under Mediterranean conditions, increasing the water efficiency and reducing weed pressure, while improving different soil properties.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Soil–plant–atmosphere models and certain land surface models usually require information about the ability of soils to store and release water. Thus, a critical soil parameter for such reservoir-like models is the available water capacity (AWC), which is usually recognized as the most influential parameter when modeling water transfer. AWC does not have a single definition despite its wide use by scientists in research models, by regional managers as land-management tools and by farmers as decision-aid tools. Methods used to estimate AWC are also diverse, including laboratory measurements of soil samples, field monitoring, use of pedotransfer functions, and inverse modeling of soil-vegetation models. However, the resulting estimates differ and, depending on the method and scale, may have high uncertainty. Here, we review the many definitions of AWC, as well as soil and soil–plant approaches used to estimate it from local to larger spatial scales. We focus especially on the limits and uncertainties of each method. We demonstrate that in soil science, AWC represents a capacity—the size of the water reservoir that plants can use—whereas in agronomy, it represents an ability—the quantity of water that a plant can withdraw from the soil. We claim that the two approaches should be hybridized to improve the definitions and estimates of AWC. We also recommend future directions: (i) adapt pedotransfer functions to provide information about plants, (ii) integrate newly available information from soil mapping in spatial inverse-modeling applications, and (iii) integrate model-inversion results into methods for digital soil mapping.",

This pressure threatens the use of extensive sheep-grazing systems in mountain areas of low productivity but high natural value. Using information gathered at a long-term research setting in a mountainous area of the Basque Country (northern Spain), we assessed the multiple benefits of extensive dairy sheep grazing systems from multiple perspectives using indicators pertaining to ecological, socio-economic, and food quality domains. In this way, we address the benefits that would be lost if sheep grazing abandonment persists in mountain regions. Our results show that the benefits of extensive dairy sheep grazing in the research area include the production of healthy and high-quality foods and multiple ecological benefits including biodiversity conservation. Extensive dairy sheep grazing also contributes to rural development by generating employment and income in marginal, low-productivity lands that can support few economic alternatives. In particular, we found that sheep farmers who produce high-value products, such as cheese, have enhanced their economic profitability and are less dependent on public subsidies. However, careful attention to sustainable practices, support for new generations of farmers, and streamlined supply chains are required. These would contribute to ensure socio-economic benefits for farmers, avoid the ecological costs associated with grazing abandonment, and enhance ecosystem services for the whole society.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Facing the ecological and social crisis that the agrifood systems cross, a profound transformation of food systems is required, necessitating systemic and sustainable innovations. Sustainability assessments are generally performed to identify and/or validate the improvement in sustainability conferred by a designed artifact relative to the current or standard situation. However, they can have many other benefits in the design process. Here, we review the place, role, and conditions of use of sustainability assessment in innovation design processes in agrifood systems. By cross-referencing published findings and our own experience, we formalize a design process highlighting the place of sustainability assessment, whether design is intended for the creation of an agricultural or food artifact. We identify three types of assessment: initial diagnosis, screening between solutions at the ideation stage, and evaluation at the prototyping and development stages. We discuss ways of performing each of these assessments and highlight general key points about sustainability assessment. A first set of key points relate to criteria and indicators, a second set to the role of stakeholders, a third one to the adaptive nature of the assessment, and the last one to the uncertainty consideration. These key points provide guidance for efficient assessment in the design of innovations to increase the sustainability of agrifood systems. Thus, we demonstrate that the design process of innovations for sustainable agrifood systems requires (1) to formalize the place and mode of assessment, (2) to make use of relevant sustainability criteria and indicators, (3) to reinforce participatory practices, and (4) to adapt the assessment to the context of the designed artifact, to facilitate choices between imperfect solutions. Such an approach aims to promote innovations that meet the expectations of the system’s direct stakeholders, but also integrate the needs of invisible actors such as the environment or the well-being of populations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. is one of the worst agricultural weeds and invasive species in the world, being widely established in many countries. Despite its impact on agriculture and the growing awareness of authorities and consumers about the consequences of synthetic herbicides, alternative control methods for this weed have been poorly reviewed. A systematic review of the literature published over the last 50 years was used to assess the most studied control methods of C. dactylon (excluding synthetic herbicides) and to summarize the trends and knowledge gaps. The major findings are as follows: (1) the number of publications that studied alternative methods to synthetic chemical control in C. dactylon management has been increasing exponentially since 1972; (2) most of the studies were made under controlled conditions (57%) and lack observations under real production conditions; (3) most of the field experiments were carried out in Asia (42%), under temperate subtropical and arid climates; (4) the publication of articles studying allelopathy stands out significantly (50% of the papers found), with two species from the Poaceae family, rice ( Oryza sativa L.) and sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), showing very high allelopathic inhibitory effects (often above 80%), especially under open field conditions; and (5) preventive soil tillage is the most studied treatment among indirect weed control treatments, and although there is a high risk of propagation, the results indicate that tillage can significantly contribute to control C. dactylon , when compared to no-tillage treatments. Further research is needed to optimize treatments and methods so that they can be applied by farmers under real production conditions.",

Knowledge of farmers’ perceptions and drivers for decision-making in view of coping with water scarcity is so far lacking but needed to improve local technologies and frame policies fostering their adoption. Here, for the first time, we investigated farmers’ perception of water scarcity, key adaptation strategies, and the determinants of their adoption in irrigated rice schemes in dry climatic zones of West Africa. We surveyed 572 farming households and conducted expert interviews with key informants in four contrasting irrigated rice schemes in Burkina Faso between April 2018 and August 2019. Information was gathered on biophysical field characteristics, grain yields, agronomic and water management practices, farmers’ perception of water scarcity, their adaptive responses, and social-economic attributes of adopting households. Nearly 80% of the respondents reported having experienced water scarcity during the past 5 years. To cope with the adverse effect of water scarcity, farmers implemented seventeen different adaptation strategies that could be categorized into seven groups. Most popular among those were “water and soil conservation practices” (consisting mainly of field bunding and leveling), “no rice cultivation,” and “crop rotation.” Farmers in drier areas (Sudano-Sahelian zone) were less likely to adopt and implement several adaptation strategies to water scarcity compared to farmers in wetter areas (Sudanian zone). Belonging to farming associations increased the probability of implementing several strategies to alleviate water scarcity, while female-headed households tended to have a lower propensity to adopt and implement concomitantly several adaptation strategies in comparison with their male counterpart. The dissemination of scheme- and household-specific technology options could contribute to mitigating water scarcity in irrigated rice-based systems in the dry climatic zones of West Africa, thus contributing to rural livelihood and food security.",

This paper presents the results obtained over three years in a vineyard of the “Pedro Ximénez” variety organically grown in southern Spain. The influence on production, vigor, and grape quality of a seeded cover crop versus tillage was compared using field data and imagery acquired by an uncrewed aerial vehicle. The vines under tillage showed greater vegetative development and yield than those with cover crops between rows. The grapes from the vines under the cover crop treatment ripened earlier and presented higher values of total soluble solids, characteristics that can be useful in the protected designation of origin where the study field is placed. However, the strong yield reduction caused by the cover crop treatment encourages future research to explore other cover crop species that could contribute to improving soil properties without compromising the profitability of the vineyard. This is the first time that the influence of cover cropping on the agronomic and oenological parameters of organically grown white vineyard varieties such as “Pedro Ximénez” has been assessed using field and UAV data.",

    "abstract": "Abstract To attain food security, we must minimize crop losses caused by weed growth, animal herbivores, and pathogens (or “pests”). Today, crop production depends heavily on the use of chemical pesticides (or “pesticides”) to protect the crops. However, pesticides are phased out as they lose efficiency due to pest resistance, and few new pesticides are appearing on the market. In addition, policies and national action programs are implemented with the aim of reducing pesticide risks. We must redesign our cropping systems to successfully protect our crops against pests using fewer or no pesticides. In this review, I focus on the principles for redesigning the crop ecosystem. Ecological redesign aims to enhance ecological functions in order to regulate pest populations and diminish crop losses. Exploring ecology and ecosystems plays an important role in this transition. Guiding principles for redesigning the cropping system can be drawn from understanding its ecology. Ecosystem and community ecologists have identified four principal ecological characteristics that enhance the biotic regulation of ecological processes across ecosystems: (i) advanced ecosystem succession through introducing and conserving perennial crops and landscape habitats; (ii) reduced disturbance frequency and intensity; (iii) an increase in both managed and wild functional biological diversity, above and below ground; and (iv) matched spatial extent of land use (e.g., crop field size) with that of ecological processes (e.g., dispersal capacity of predators). I review the practices that link these ecosystem characteristics to crop protection in grain commodity cropping in both the crop field and the agricultural landscape. The review brings forth how basic understandings drawn from ecosystem and community ecology can guide agricultural research in the redesign of cropping systems, ensuring that technologies, breeding, innovation, and policy are adapted to and support the reshaped crop ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Sustainable intensification (SI) responds to the concurrent challenges of increasing food production while reducing the environmental impacts of agriculture. As an early disclosure of innovation, patents are a useful indicator of technology market potential. However, we lack understanding of the extent to which current agricultural technology patents relate to the goals of SI and which kinds of technologies can potentially address SI. Here, we analyzed the diffusion and focus of more than one million patents issued during the period 1970–2022. We explored the degree to which the patents relate to SI through the co-occurrence of efficiency and environmental friendliness targets. Our results reveal that while the rate of patent issuance has dramatically increased over the past five decades, the rate at which patents diffused to different countries had decreased over time. The USA was the biggest net exporter of patents and had produced by far the most high-impact patents (in the top 1% most-cited patents). Since 1970, only 4% of agricultural patents and 6% of high-impact patents were related to SI targets (i.e., promoting both agricultural efficiency and environmental friendliness), but the attention to SI has increased over time. The most highly cited SI-related patents had become more diverse over time, shifting from digital, machine, and energy technologies in 1980s to the current era of agroecology, information, and computer networking. Our results provide an early indication of promising technologies that may play a greater role for SI in the future, subject to the challenges of market transfer and farm adoption and complemented by non-technological innovations in farm management and institutional support.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Modern “intensive” agriculture drives the biodiversity-climate crisis but is also central to global food security. Future farming needs management approaches that maintain (or even enhance) food production while reducing negative climate and biodiversity impacts. Intercrops could provide part of the solution, increasing biodiversity and boosting production with fewer inputs. However, barriers remain to their wide-scale uptake, in particular tailoring intercrops to local equipment, management practice, and environment. We analyze data from multiple trials of cereal-legume intercrops conducted on farms across Europe between 2018 and 2021. Our study is the first attempt, to our knowledge, to quantify the yield benefits of cereal-legume intercropping undertaken at commercially relevant scales for farms across Europe. We used crop performance ratio (CPR)—the ratio of the observed intercrop yield compared to the expected yield based on monoculture yields—as our metric of intercrop performance. Using CPR, we found a roughly 30% yield gain across all sites. However, CPR was modulated by a number of factors. CPR was not strongly affected by management except for the negative effects of direct drilling and the positive effects of organic fertilizer addition. CPR also depended on intercrop composition (number and identity of components), background yields (being highest where yields were lower), and rainfall (being higher with higher rainfall). Our findings allow us to reduce uncertainty about how intercrops will perform in realistic local farm conditions, give guidance for tailoring intercrops to local farming conditions, and provide key goals for further work to integrate intercrops into sustainable farming systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the context of ever-growing demand for food and associated concerns regarding the environmental impacts of high-input agricultural systems, there is growing interest in mixed farm enterprises to deliver greater sustainability compared with mono-enterprise production systems. However, assessments of such systems are complex and require high-resolution data to determine the true value and interconnectivity across enterprises. Given the scarcity of information on mixed crop–livestock systems and the difficulties of its analysis, we perform life cycle assessment using temporally high-resolution data (2019–2022) from a long-term experiment in South America to evaluate the ‘cradle-to-farmgate exit’ greenhouse gas emissions intensities of four rotational crop–livestock systems. Systems evaluated were continuous cropping: 2 years of continuous cropping; short rotation: 2-year continuous cropping plus 2-year pasture; long rotation: 2-year continuous cropping followed by 4-year pasture; and forage rotation: continuous pasture. Emissions intensities for beef throughput were reported as kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO 2 -eq) per kilogram of liveweight gain (LWG) using the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change’s Sixth Assessment Report (AR6 2021) CO 2 characterisation factors. Point estimate results were found to be 11.3, 11.8, 11.8 and 16.4 kg CO 2 -eq/kg/LWG for continuous cropping, short rotation, long rotation and forage rotation, respectively. Emission averages arising from crops, which were separated from animal-based emissions using economic allocation, were 1.23, 0.53 and 0.52 kg CO 2 -eq/kg for soybean, wheat and oat, respectively. The inclusion of soil organic carbon stock changes had notable effects on reducing each system’s emissions: by 22.4%, 19.2%, 25.3% and 42.1% under continuous cropping, short rotation, long rotation and forage rotation, respectively, when soil organic carbon was included. Given there are few life cycle assessment studies available on such mixed-enterprise ‘semi-circular’ systems, particularly with novel primary data, this study adds critical knowledge to agri-food-related sustainability literature by addressing environmental issues in complex production systems compared to extant and broad coverage of mono-enterprise systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Research has shown that soil-borne beneficial microorganisms can enhance plant growth, productivity, and resistance against pests and pathogens and could thus serve as a sustainable alternative to agrochemicals. To date, however, the effect of soil-beneficial microbes under commercial crop production has been little assessed. We here investigated the effect of root inoculation with nine well-characterized bacterial and fungal strains and two consortia on tomato performance under intensive tomato crop management practices. We measured the impact of these root inoculations on plant growth, fruit quality, yield, and pest and pathogen incidence. While most microbial strains showed weak effects, we found that the fungal strains Trichoderma afroharzianum T22 and Funneliformis mosseae significantly increased marketable tomato yield. Moreover, we found that inoculation with most of the fungal strains led to a significant reduction in the incidence of the devastating leaf-mining pest Tuta absoluta , while this effect was not observed for bacterial inoculants. In addition, we found that microbial inoculations did not impact the incidence of introduced natural pest enemies, supporting their compatibility with well-established integrated pest management strategies in horticulture. In summary, the observed general positive effects of soil microbes on tomato yield and resistance reinforce the move toward broader adoption of microbial inoculants in future crop production, ultimately improving agricultural sustainability.",

    "abstract": "Innovations in the agri-food sector are needed to create a sustainable food supply. Sustainable food supply requires unexpectedly that densely populated regions remain food producers. A Dutch innovation program has aimed at showing the way forward through creating a number of practice and scientific projects. Generic lessons from the scientific projects in this program are likely to be of interest to agricultural innovation in other densely populated regions in the world. Based on the executed scientific projects, generic lessons across the whole innovation program are derived. We found that the agricultural sector requires evolutionary rather than revolutionary changes to reshaping institutions. Measuring sustainability is possible against benchmarks and requires stakeholder agreement on sustainability values. Results show the importance of multiple social views and multiple stakeholder involvement in agricultural innovation. Findings call for flexible goal rather than process-oriented management of innovation. Findings also emphasise the essential role of profit in anchoring sustainable development in business. The results agree with concepts of evolutionary innovation. We conclude that there is no single best solution to making the agri-food sector more sustainable densely populated areas, but that the combination of a range of solutions and approaches is likely to provide the best way forward.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Crop varieties should fulfill multiple requirements, including agronomic performance and product quality. Variety evaluations depend on data generated from field trials and sensory analyses, performed with different levels of participation from farmers and consumers. Such multi-faceted variety evaluation is expensive and time-consuming; hence, any use of these data should be optimized. Data synthesis can help to take advantage of existing and new data, combining data from different sources and combining it with expert knowledge to produce new information and understanding that supports decision-making. Data synthesis for crop variety evaluation can partly build on extant experiences and methods, but it also requires methodological innovation. We review the elements required to achieve data synthesis for crop variety evaluation, including (1) data types required for crop variety evaluation, (2) main challenges in data management and integration, (3) main global initiatives aiming to solve those challenges, (4) current statistical approaches to combine data for crop variety evaluation and (5) existing data synthesis methods used in evaluation of varieties to combine different datasets from multiple data sources. We conclude that currently available methods have the potential to overcome existing barriers to data synthesis and could set in motion a virtuous cycle that will encourage researchers to share data and collaborate on data-driven research.",

It has been acknowledged that improved understanding of farmer decision-making is needed due to the variation in socio-economic and agro-ecological contexts which drives the research agenda to answer the question ‘what forms of Conservation Agriculture work, where, and why?’. To fully understand this question, we need to approach the study of Conservation Agriculture within complex farming systems by collating and integrating different forms of knowledge. In this paper, we discuss (1) a comparison of disciplinary approaches to evaluating Conservation Agriculture in Malawi, (2) the identification of the knowledge gaps that persist at the intersection of these disciplines and (3) recommendations for alternative and interdisciplinary approaches in addressing these knowledge gaps. With a focus on published studies from Malawi, we show that the Conservation Agriculture literature represents two distinct approaches to addressing the question ‘what forms of Conservation Agriculture work, where, and why?’, namely agro-ecological and socio-economic and that neither of these approaches can address the full scope of this question, in particular its ‘why’ component. To overcome these challenges, there is a need for access to compatible, comprehensive data sets, methodological approaches including farmer participation and ethnography, through on-farm trial research as a middle ground between disciplinary approaches.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Agricultural mechanization is on the rise in Africa. A widespread replacement of manual labor and animal traction will change the face of African agriculture. Despite this potentially transformative role, only a few studies have looked at the effects of mechanization empirically, mostly focusing on yields and labor alone. This is the first paper that explores perceived agronomic, environmental, and socioeconomic effects together, thereby revealing linkages and trade-offs, some of which have been hitherto unknown. Data were collected using a novel data collection method called “participatory impact diagrams” in four countries: Benin, Kenya, Nigeria, and Mali. In 129 gendered focus group discussions, 1330 respondents from 87 villages shared their perceptions on the positive and negative effects of agricultural mechanization, and developed causal impact chains. The results suggest that mechanization is likely to have more far-reaching agronomic, environmental, and socioeconomic consequences than commonly assumed. Most perceived effects were positive, suggesting that mechanization can help to reduce poverty and enhance food security but other effects were negative such as deforestation, soil erosion, land-use conflicts, and gender inequalities. Accompanying research and policy efforts, which reflect variations in local agro-ecological and socioeconomic conditions, are needed to ensure that mechanization contributes to an African agricultural transformation that is sustainable from a social, economic, and environmental perspective.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The livestock farming sector is under stress as fewer and fewer people are willing or able to become livestock farmers. Contributing to the decline in attractiveness of the profession are, among other factors, agricultural crises, higher consumer expectations, and difficult working conditions. Agroecology is a sustainable solution that can maintain livestock production and provide positive contributions to society without negatively affecting the environment. Moreover, in its search for social sustainability, agroecological farming could offer better working conditions to farmers and thus contribute to a sustainable future for the livestock farming sector. Here, we review research on livestock farmers’ working conditions in agroecological farming systems. This paper aims to give a comprehensive overview of the available research findings and the dimensions used to describe farmers’ working conditions. The major findings are the following: (i) relatively little published research is available; (ii) it is difficult to compare findings across studies as different dimensions are used to study working conditions and, in certain cases, detailed descriptions of the farming systems are not provided; (iii) certain dimensions were rarely addressed, such as farmers’ health, or work organization; and (iv) in general, farmers’ work is addressed as a component of environmental and economic analyses of the performance of agroecological livestock farming systems, using most often indicators on labor productivity and/or efficiency. Comprehensive multidimensional approaches to study working conditions are lacking, as are studies on the interactions and trade-offs between dimensions (e.g., workload, fulfillment, work organization). To study livestock farmers’ working conditions in agroecological farming systems, we recommend to use a comprehensive approach assessing different dimensions contributing to working conditions, combined with the description of farmers’ activities and work environment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Diversifying cropping systems by increasing the number of cash and cover crops in crop rotation plays an important role in improving resource use efficiency and in promoting synergy between ecosystem processes. The objective of this study was to understand how the combination of crop diversification practices influences the performance of arable crop sequences in terms of crop grain yield, crop and weed biomass, and nitrogen acquisition in a temperate climate. Two field experiments were carried out. The first was a 3-year crop sequence with cereal or grain legume as the first crops, with and without undersown forage legumes and forage legume-grass crops, followed by a cereal crop. The second experiment was a 2-year crop sequence with cereal or legume as the first crops, a legume cover crop, and a subsequent cereal crop. For the first time, crop diversification practices were combined to identify plant-plant interactions in spatial and temporal scales. The results partly confirm the positive effect of diversifying cereal-based cropping systems by including grain legumes and cover crops in the crop sequence. Legume cover crops had a positive effect on subsequent cereal grain yield in one of the experiments. Using faba beans as the first crop in the crop sequence had both a positive and no effect on crop biomass and N acquisition of the subsequent cereal. In cover crops composed of a forage legume-grass mixture, the grass biomass and N acquisition were consistently increased after the grain legume, compared to the cereal-preceding crop. However, differences in the proportion of legume to grass in mixture did not influence crop yield or N acquisition in the subsequent cereal. In conclusion, these results support that increased crop diversity across spatial and temporal scales can contribute to resource-efficient production and enhance the delivery of services, contributing to more sustainable cropping systems.",

In this review, we (1) explore the diversity of contexts, driving forces, stakeholders and recommended management practices involved in Rh/Re initiatives in key cocoa-producing countries; (2) summarise the often conflicting views of farmers and extension agents on Rh/Re programmes; (3) review the evidence of age-related changes in planting density and yield of cocoa, given the weight of these variables in Rh/Re decision processes; (4) describe the best known Rh/Re systems and their most common management practices; (5) propose an agroforestry Re approach that overcomes the limitation of current Rh/Re diagnosis protocols, which do not consider the regular flow of food crop and tree products , and the need to restore site soil quality to sustain another cycle of cultivation of cocoa at the same site; and (6) explore the effects of climate change considerations on Rh/Re decision-making and implementation processes.

    "abstract": "Abstract Timely crop planting is a foundation for climate-resilient rice-wheat systems of the Eastern Gangetic Plains—a global food insecurity and poverty hotspot. We hypothesize that the capacity of individual farmers to plant on time varies considerably, shaped by multifaceted enabling factors and constraints that are poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, two complementary datasets were used to characterize drivers and decision processes that govern the timing of rice planting in this region. The first dataset was a large agricultural management survey (rice-wheat: n = 15,245; of which rice: n = 7597) from a broad geographic region that was analyzed by machine learning methods. The second dataset was a discussion-based survey ( n = 112) from a more limited geography that we analyzed with graph theory tools to elicit nuanced information on planting decisions. By combining insights from these methods, we show for the first time that differences in rice planting times are primarily shaped by ecosystem and climate factors while social factors play a prominent secondary role. Monsoon onset, surface and groundwater availability, and land type determine village-scale mean planting times whereas, for resource-constrained farmers who tend to plant later ceteris paribus , planting is further influenced by access to farm machinery, seed, fertilizer, and labor. Also, a critical threshold for economically efficient pumping appears at a groundwater depth of around 4.5 m; below this depth, farmers do not irrigate and delay planting. Without collective action to spread risk through synchronous timely planting, ecosystem factors such as threats posed by pests and wild animals may further deter early planting by individual farmers. Accordingly, we propose a three-pronged strategy that combines targeted strengthening of agricultural input chains, agroadvisory development, and coordinated rice planting and wildlife conservation to support climate-resilient agricultural development in the Eastern Gangetic Plains.",

    "abstract": "There is broad agreement that agriculture has to become more sustainable in order to provide enough affordable, healthy food at minimal environmental and social costs. But what is \"more sustainable\"? More often than not, different stakeholders have opposing opinions on what a more sustainable future should look like. This normative dimension is rarely explicitly addressed in sustainability assessments. In this study, we present an approach to assess the sustainability of agricultural development that explicitly accounts for the normative dimension by comparing observed development with various societal visions. We illustrate the approach by analyzing farm- and landscape-scale development as well as sustainability outcomes in a Swiss case study landscape. Observed changes were juxtaposed with desired changes by Avenir Suisse, a liberal think tank representing free-market interests; the Swiss Farmers Association, representing a conservative force; and Landwirtschaft mit Zukunft, an exponent of the Swiss agroecological movement. Overall, the observed developments aligned most closely with desired developments of the liberal think-tank (72%). Farmer interviews revealed that in the case study area farms increased in size (+ 57%) and became more specialized and more productive (+ 223%) over the past 20 years. In addition, interpretation of aerial photographs indicated that farming became more rationalized at the landscape level, with increasing field sizes (+ 34%) and removal of solitary field trees (- 18%). The case study example highlights the varying degrees to which current developments in agriculture align with societal visions. By using societal visions as benchmarks to track the progress of agricultural development, while explicitly addressing their narratives and respective systems of values and norms, this approach offers opportunities to inform also the wider public on the extent to which current developments are consistent with different visions. This could help identify mismatches between desired and actual development and pave the way for designing new policies.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13593-021-00739-3.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The perennial forage grass Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth &amp; Dewey, commonly known as intermediate wheatgrass (IWG) or by the commercial name Kernza™, is being developed as a perennial grain crop, i.e. being bred for its improved agronomic performance and food qualities. Intercropping legumes and grasses is a strategy for improving resource use and sustainability in cropping systems. Here, we show for the first time the agronomic performance of IWG as a perennial cereal grown as a monocrop and as an intercrop (alternate row, 0.5:0.5) with Medicago sativa L. (alfalfa/lucerne) in southern Sweden. The seeds of cycle 3 IWG were accessed from The Land Institute (TLI) of Salinas, Kansas, USA, and used to establish a local seed production plot (in 2014) for the establishment of the perennial systems (in 2016) utilised in this study. Both the monocrop and intercrop were sown with 25 cm row spacing with alternate rows of IWG and alfalfa in the intercrop (i.e. replacement design) with unknown sowing density. Intercropping provided sustained IWG grain production under the dry conditions of 2018, but also in the following year. This was evidently associated with a higher nitrogen accumulation in intercropped practice. Thus, intercropping seems to have stabilised the IWG grain production in the dry conditions of 2018, when the grain production in the intercrop was similar to that of the monocrop in the same year. This result was further supported by the lower discrimination against 13 C (as an indicator of water use efficiency) in the intercrop components compared to the sole crop in 2018. The lower discrimination indicates high water use efficiency in the intercropped IWG in comparison to the IWG in monoculture, and we conclude that intercropping perennial cereal grain crops with legumes provides better growing conditions in terms of nitrogen acquisition, and water status, to cope with more extreme drought spells expected from climate change.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite efforts to increase agricultural production sustainably in sub-Saharan Africa, large gaps remain between actual and potential yield of food crops. Adding biochar to degraded cropland soils in the African tropics has significant potential to enhance crop productivity. Biochar-based farming can also mitigate climate change, through soil carbon storage. This study involved six smallholder farms at sites in eastern, central, and western Kenya that are characterized by different pedo-climatic conditions. We examined the response of non-fertilized and fertilized maize monoculture to three dosages of biochar that are realistic for domestic production by farmers at each of the sites over four growing seasons. Commonly available biomass wastes in each agro-ecosystem (coconut shells, coffee husks, maize cobs) were used as feedstock for biochar, which was applied at 1, 5, and 10 Mg ha −1 at the start of the experiment. Across seasons and fertilizer treatments, maize grain yield (dry matter) showed consistently positive responses, with an average increase of 1.0, 2.6, and 4.0 Mg ha −1 , respectively, above the control for the three biochar application rates. Absolute responses of maize grain yield to specific biochar doses were similar across the four investigated seasons and replicate farms within sites, and uncorrelated to yield levels in the control treatment. Here, we show for the first time that yield response to biochar decreased with increasing application rate, indicating that it may be better to spread a given amount of biochar over a large area rather than concentrating it to a smaller area, at least when biochar is applied along plant rows at rates ≥1 Mg ha −1 , as in our experiment. This study demonstrated that application of biochar, locally produced from available biomass residues, is a promising approach to enhance agricultural production and carbon storage on smallholder farms under a wide range of pedo-climatic conditions in Kenya.",

    "abstract": "Abstract As agricultural intensification affects global environmental change, a redesign of our food production systems towards practices that replace external inputs with inbuilt ecosystem services is needed. Specifically, human-induced changes to biogeochemical flows of nitrogen (N) cycling exceed the proposed planetary boundaries, highlighting a priority area for reducing nutrient inputs in agricultural production systems. A new understanding of nutrient interactions in the complete agroecosystem will allow us to better predict and mitigate the consequences of anthropogenic environmental changes compared with a reductionist approach. Here, we review for the first time system-level nutrient interactions, particularly N, in perennial horticulture using high-producing kiwifruit and apple crops grown in New Zealand as a basis to identify critical knowledge gaps and prioritize new research. The major points identified are (1) current nutrient guidelines are from the 1980s to the early 2000s and do not take into account substantial production changes since that time; (2) few studies construct complete nutrient budgets of all sources and losses; (3) nutrient loss estimates are generally low relative to those from other agricultural land uses; (4) there is a lack of studies which address nutrient interactions between above- and below-ground food webs in perennial horticultural crops; (5) there is contradictory literature where fertilizer has been found both to increase and to decrease plant chemical signaling and defense mechanisms. New tools are emerging to improve orchard nutrient management, including advances in fertilizer application techniques, new methods to monitor plant and soil nutrients, and utilizing genetic variability to breed cultivars with improved nutrient use efficiency. To reduce adverse nutrient effects on the environment, new research is needed, addressing the relationships between carbon and nutrients and nutrient demands in modern fruit cultivars and growing systems; the nutrient balance for perennial horticultural crops considering all inputs and outputs; and interactions of the above- and below-ground nutrient flows in orchard food webs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ecological engineering for pest suppression aimed at promoting ecosystem services of biological control, involves a range of environmentally-benign approaches to conserve and promote arthropod natural enemies and suppress pest populations, and thus reduce the need for insecticide use. Major components in rice pest management involve providing vegetation that favors parasitoid overwintering during the fallow seasons, growing nectar-producing flowering plants on the rice bunds to enhance the biocontrol function, and planting trap plants around rice fields to minimize the initial populations of pests. Complementary tactics involve using sex pheromone traps and mass-releasing Trichogramma spp. parasitoids to reduce the densities of Lepidoptera pests, and synergistically culturing ducks or fish to reduce other planthoppers. After a decade of laboratory and field research accompanied by on-farm demonstrations, ecological engineering for rice pest management has shown growth in both the underlying body of theory and practical adoption, especially in China. Ecological engineering approaches have been listed as a China National Recommendation by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the People’s Republic of China (MARA) since 2014. We feel this is worth documenting, especially because only a portion of that work has been reported in English-language journals so would otherwise remain “invisible” to the international scientific community. This study is the first time to systematically review the research that has allowed this rapid development and uptake in China, highlighting priorities for future research that will enhance the prospects for ecological engineering in this and other agricultural systems internationally.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The impacts of global climate warming on maize yield vary regionally. However, less is known about how soil modulates regionally specific impacts and soil properties that are able to alleviate adverse impacts of climate warming on maize productivity. In this study, we investigated the impacts of multiple soil inherent properties on the sensitivity of maize yield (S Y,T ) to growing season temperature across China. Our results show that a 1°C warming resulted in the largest yield decline (11.2 ± 6.1%) in the mid-eastern region, but the moderate yield increase (1.5 ± 2.9%) in the north-eastern region. Spatial variability in soil properties explained around 72% of the variation in S Y,T . Soil organic carbon (SOC) content positively contributed the greatest extent (28.9%) to spatial variation of S Y,T , followed by field capacity (9.7%). Beneficial impacts of increasing SOC content were pronounced in the north-eastern region where SOC content (11.9 ± 4.3 g kg −1 ) was much higher than other regions. Other soil properties (e.g., plant wilting point, sand content, bulk density, and saturated water content) were generally negatively correlated with S Y,T . This study is the first one to answer how soil inherent properties can modulate the negative impacts of climate warming on maize yield in China. Our findings highlight the importance of SOC in alleviating adverse global warming impacts on maize productivity. To ensure food security for a rapidly increasing population under a changing climate, appropriate farming management practices that improve SOC content could reduce risk of adverse effects of global climate warming through a gain in yield stability and more resilient production in China’s maize belt.",

    "abstract": "Diversification of smallholder rice-based cropping systems has the potential to increase cropping system intensity and boost food security. However, impacts on resource use efficiencies (e.g., nutrients, energy, and labor) remain poorly understood, highlighting the need to quantify synergies and trade-offs among different sustainability indicators under on-farm conditions. In southern coastal Bangladesh, aman season rice is characterized by low inputs and low productivity. We evaluated the farm-level impacts of cropping system intensification (adding irrigated boro season rice) and diversification (adding chili, groundnut, mungbean, or lathyrus) on seven performance indicators (rice equivalent yield, energy efficiency, partial nitrogen productivity, partial potassium productivity, partial greenhouse gas footprint, benefit-cost ratio, and hired labor energy productivity) based on a comprehensive survey of 501 households. Indicators were combined into a multi-criteria performance index, and their scope for improvement was calculated by comparing an individual farmer's performance to top-performing farmers (highest 20%). Results indicate that the baseline system (single-crop aman season rice) was the least productive, while double cropped systems increased rice equivalent yield 72-217%. Despite gains in productivity, higher cropping intensity reduced resource use efficiencies due to higher inputs of fertilizer and energy, which also increased production costs, particularly for boro season rice. However, trade-offs were smaller for diversified systems including legumes, largely owing to lower N fertilizer inputs. Aman season rice had the highest multi-criteria performance index, followed by systems with mungbean and lathyrus, indicating the latter are promising options to boost food production and profitability without compromising sustainability. Large gaps between individual and top-performing farmers existed for each indicator, suggesting significant scope for improvement. By targeting indicators contributing most to the multi-criteria performance index (partial nitrogen productivity, energy efficiency, hired labor energy productivity), results suggest further sustainability gains can be achieved through future field research studies focused on optimizing management within diversified systems.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13593-022-00795-3.",

    "abstract": "Ways are being sought to reduce the environmental impact of ruminant livestock farming. Integration of trees into farming systems has been advocated as a measure to deliver ecosystem services, inter alia climate regulation and adaptation, water quality regulation, provisioning of fibre, fuel and habitats to support biodiversity. Despite the rapid expansion of cattle farming in the tropics, notably in Latin America, there is little robust evidence on the extent to which trees are able to mitigate the effects of cattle farming in this ecological zone. This article describes a case study conducted on a large, specialised dairy farm in Costa Rica, where two-thirds of the field boundaries are live tree fences. For the first time, this study quantifies the offset potential of trees by estimating rate of carbon sequestration in a silvopastoral system (SPS) in the tropics. It was found that over a 30-month interval, trees sequestered 1.43 Mg C ha-1 year-1 above and below ground. Attributional life cycle assessment (LCA) (cradle to farm gate) was applied to calculate the carbon footprint of milk produced on the farm for the years 2016 to 2018. Trees in live fences offset 21-37% of milk footprints, resulting in residual net footprints of 0.75±0.25 to 0.84±0.26 kg CO2 eq. kg-1 milk. Exclusion of life cycle emissions that may not fall within national emission inventory accounting (e.g. fertiliser manufacture and feed production) increased the mean offset from 27 to 34% of gross milk footprint. Although based on temporally limited data (30 months), our findings indicate that a live fence SPS could play an important role in short- to medium-term climate mitigation from livestock production, buying time for deployment of long-term mitigation and adaptation planning.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13593-022-00834-z.",

    "abstract": "Mediterranean agriculture is markedly threatened by climate change and extreme events (drought and flooding). For the first time, the EPIC model was used in a long-term organic vegetable field experiment to evaluate the performance of agro-ecological practices, as adaptation and mitigation measures to cope with climate change in Southern Italy. These practices were a soil hydraulic arrangement (consisting of ridges and flat strips) combined with crop rotation (winter and summer cash crops), organic fertilization (poultry manure vs. no fertilization), and cover crops (pure or in mixture vs. no cover) managed as living mulch, green manure, or flattened by roller crimper. Seven treatments were selected for the simulation procedure. EPIC was calibrated and validated using measured crop yield and soil organic carbon stock values. The statistical metrics of EPIC showed r to be between 0.96 and 0.97, the Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency between 0.54 and 0.94, and the relative root mean square error between 2 and 18%. Then, the model was run under baseline current climate (1985–2014) and near-future climate change (2015–2044) scenarios. Climate change increased both microbial respiration and nitrate leaching compared to the baseline, while soil organic carbon stock change and nitrous oxide emissions were mainly influenced by agro-ecological practices. Cover crop management could be an effective solution to limit negative climate effects, since it allowed improving summer cash crop yield (32%) and soil organic carbon stock change (2%), and reducing nitrogen losses (–34%), as compared to the no-cover-crop system. Finally, under climate change, green manure increased microbial respiration (5%) and reduced nitrogen losses (− 19%), compared to roller crimper flattening. Our findings indicated that the tested agro-ecological practices contribute to re-designing new climate change-resilient vegetable systems, by involving the stakeholders in promoting a co-innovation and co-research knowledge platform and fine-tuning agro-ecological practices in a wider range of environments.",

    "abstract": "Sorghum is an important food and feed crop in the dry lowland areas of Ethiopia. Farmers grow both early-sown long-duration landraces and late-sown short-duration improved varieties. Because timing and intensity of drought stress can vary in space and time, an understanding of major traits (G), environments (E), management (M), and their interactions (G×E×M) is needed to optimize grain and forage yield given the limited available resources. Crop simulation modeling can provide insights into these complex G×E×M interactions and be used to identify possible avenues for adaptation to prevalent drought patterns in Ethiopia. In a previous study predictive phenology models were developed for a range of Ethiopian germplasm. In this study, the aims were to (1) further parameterize and validate the APSIM-sorghum model for crop growth and yield of Ethiopian germplasm, and (2) quantify by simulation the productivity-risk trade-offs associated with early vs late sowing strategies in the dry lowlands of Ethiopia. Field experiments involving Ethiopian germplasm with contrasting phenology and height were conducted under well-watered (Melkassa) and water-limited (Miesso) conditions and crop development, growth and yield measured. Soil characterization and weather records at the experimental sites, combined with model parameterization, enabled testing of the APSIM-sorghum model, which showed good correspondence between simulated and observed data. The simulated productivity for the Ethiopian dry lowlands environments showed trade-offs between biomass and grain yield for early and late sowing strategies. The late sowing strategy tended to produce less biomass except in poor seasons, whereas it tended to produce greater grain yield except in very good seasons. This study exemplified the systems approach to identifying traits and management options needed to quantify the production-risk trade-offs associated with crop adaptation in the Ethiopian dry lowlands and further exemplifies the general robustness of the sorghum model in APSIM for this task.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Agriculture faces potentially competing societal demands to produce food, fiber and fuel while reducing negative environmental impacts and delivering regulating, supporting and cultural ecosystem services. This necessitates a new generation of long-term agricultural field experiments designed to study the behavior of contrasting cropping systems in terms of multiple outcomes. We document the principles and practices of a new long-term experiment of this type at Rothamsted, established at two contrasting sites in 2017 and 2018, and report initial yield data at the crop and system level. The objective of the Large-Scale Rotation Experiment was to establish gradients of system properties and outcomes to improve our fundamental understanding of UK cropping systems. It is composed of four management factors—phased rotations, cultivation (conventional vs reduced tillage), nutrition (additional organic amendment vs standard mineral fertilization) and crop protection (conventional vs smart crop protection). These factors were combined in a balanced design resulting in 24 emergent cropping systems at each site and can be analyzed at the level of the system or component management factors. We observed interactions between management factors and with the environment on crop yields, justifying the systems level, multi-site approach. Reduced tillage resulted in lower wheat yields but the effect varied with rotation, previous-crop and site. Organic amendments significantly increased spring barley yield by 8% on average though the effect again varied with site. The plowed cropping systems tended to produce higher caloric yield overall than systems under reduced tillage. Additional response variables are being monitored to study synergies and trade-offs with outcomes other than yield at the cropping system level. The experiment has been established as a long-term resource for inter-disciplinary research. By documenting the design process, we aim to facilitate the adoption of similar approaches to system-scale agricultural experimentation to inform the transition to more sustainable cropping systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In Western Africa, agro-sylvo-pastoral systems are dominant and food demand is booming. To meet this demand, many farmers intensify the production with industrial inputs (mineral fertilizers, feeds, pesticides, herbicides). However, the price of these inputs is rocketing. To face this issue, some farmers reconsider crops, livestock, and tree synergies and by-product recycling to increase their production sustainably at a lower cost. The study aimed to characterize the diversity of Koumbia’s farming systems and to assess farming systems’ technical performance in an agroecological perspective. We surveyed 391 farms in the county of Koumbia (Burkina Faso). Considering 15 agricultural practices (4 on by-products recycling, 4 on soil protection, 4 on industrial inputs limitation, 2 on smart use of natural resources, and 1 on cropping diversification), a multivariate analysis (PCA+HAC) combined to an agroecology (Ae) scoring system (−15 to +15) based on 15 specific indicators (one/practice), we highlighted 3 agroecological farming systems clusters. These clusters are distributed along a gradient of agroecology intensity (Ae+: high degree of Ae, Ae+/−: medium degree, and Ae−: poor degree). Ae+ farms (Ae score: +3.0) group 17% of the farms, Ae+/− (Ae score: −4.5) group 58% of the farms, and Ae− (Ae score: −10.5) group 25% of the farms. Ae+ raise more livestock and recycle a higher rate of crop-livestock by-products in fodder, organic manure, and mulch. These recycling practices are facilitated by better levels of equipment for transportation and storage and soil water and crop residue conservation measures, including maintenance of the wooded park on the cultivated fields. This set of practices, which close better the agricultural system, produces a systemic effect which has a positive impact on yields and on the whole ecosystem. Our findings outline for the first time that crop-livestock synergies and by-product recycling are major factors of agroecological transition in agro-sylvo-pastoral systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The UK Government has set an ambitious target of achieving a national “net-zero” greenhouse gas economy by 2050. Agriculture is arguably placed at the heart of achieving net zero, as it plays a unique role as both a producer of GHG emissions and a sector that has the capacity via land use to capture carbon (C) when managed appropriately, thus reducing the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in the atmosphere. Agriculture’s importance, particularly in a UK-specific perspective, which is also applicable to many other temperate climate nations globally, is that the majority of land use nationwide is allocated to farming. Here, we present a systematic review based on peer-reviewed literature and relevant “grey” reports to address the question “how can the agricultural sector in the UK reduce, or offset, its direct agricultural emissions at the farm level?” We considered the implications of mitigation measures in terms of food security and import reliance, energy, environmental degradation, and value for money. We identified 52 relevant studies covering major foods produced and consumed in the UK. Our findings indicate that many mitigation measures can indeed contribute to net zero through GHG emissions reduction, offsetting, and bioenergy production, pending their uptake by farmers. While the environmental impacts of mitigation measures were covered well within the reviewed literature, corresponding implications regarding energy, food security, and farmer attitudes towards adoption received scant attention. We also provide an open-access, informative, and comprehensive dataset for agri-environment stakeholders and policymakers to identify the most promising mitigation measures. This research is of critical value to researchers, land managers, and policymakers as an interim guideline resource while more quantitative evidence becomes available through the ongoing lab-, field-, and farm-scale trials which will improve the reliability of agricultural sustainability modelling in the future.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Significant detrimental effects of agricultural intensification and specialization are becoming increasingly evident. Reliance on monocultures, few varieties, and intensive use of agrochemicals is a major factor in climate change, biodiversity decline, soil health deterioration, and pollution, putting our food system at risk. This requires sustainable agricultural processes, such as crop diversification, to be more rapidly and effectively tested, adopted, and scaled. While these processes are typically introduced at niche level, they often struggle to scale and to induce broader sustainability transitions. In this study, we investigate how scaling may occur, focusing on institutional logics, their changes, and realignment over time. In particular, we applied an abductive research strategy to collect empirical evidence from two in-depth, longitudinal case studies of innovation niches related to crop diversification. Doing so, we show for the first time that, despite their many differences, scaling processes of crop diversification in both niches converge, presenting similar progressions in terms of institutional dimensions, and facing similar obstacles when it comes to value chain formation. While initial experimentation could still be implemented using organizational forms familiar to the lead actors, we discover that a systemic lack of adequate value chain arrangements obstructed the scaling process of crop diversification in both cases. These findings have been used to reflect on the role of value chain relations in scaling processes in sustainability transitions in agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The growth of legumes, reduced tillage and addition of crop residues can be regarded as a good alternative in intercropping systems to increase soil organic matter, soil fertility and biodiversity while enhancing crop production and reducing the use of fertilizers. Despite the potential benefits, there is still a research gap about using the combination of cowpea and melon in intercropping to increase productivity and reduce external inputs. Thus, the aims of this study were to: i) assess if crop yield, crop quality and soil physicochemical properties can be improved by intercropping systems between melon ( Cucumis melo L.) and cowpea ( Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) with reduced tillage and addition of crop residues, compared with a melon monoculture with intensive tillage and removal of crop residues, all grown under organic management; and ii) evaluated if cowpea grown as intercrop with fertilization reduced by 30% in the diversified plots can partially replace the use of fertilizers with no negative effects on total crop production. In this study we compared over three crop cycles monocrops with three different melon-cowpea intercropping patterns: mixed intercropping, row intercropping 1:1 (melon:cowpea) and row intercropping 2:1 (melon:cowpea). Our results, presented in this study, showed that intercropping systems, regardless of the pattern, kept soil organic C levels, while it significantly decreased in melon monoculture. Intercropping also significantly increased soil total N, available P and exchangeable K (0.13%, 62 mg·kg -1 and 387 mg·kg -1 , respectively), compared to the melon monocrop (0.11%, 25 mg·kg -1 and 306 mg·kg -1 ). Total crop production was significantly higher under diversified systems, with land equivalent ratios &gt; 1. Hence, the introduction of cowpea associated with melon, combined with reduced tillage and the incorporation of crop residues could be considered as a feasible strategy for sustainable agriculture, with environmental gains and economic savings for fertilizers and water.",

Few studies have investigated the number, concentration, and composition of pesticides in agroecosystem food webs even though agroecosystems cover one-third of Earth’s land area. We conducted a pioneering study on the distribution of pesticides across local (i.e., on farm) and meta food webs (i.e., regional pool of local food webs) within both perennial ( N = 8) and annual crops ( N = 11), examining four trophic groups—soil (primary resource), plants (primary producers), rodents (herbivores), and spiders (predators)—for the presence of multiple residues, and comparing these findings to pesticides applied by farmers in recent years. We also undertook interviews with farmers to obtain the most precise information about pesticide applications in their fields. We detected a wide spectrum of pesticides in both annual and perennial crop types. Pesticides applied by farmers represented only a small proportion of all detected pesticides, indicating that pesticides entered local food webs from surrounding landscapes. Some detected pesticides had been banned by the European Union several years ago, which is highly alarming. Trophic group mobility and crop type drove pesticides number at local scale, as mobile groups contained larger numbers of pesticides (probably from encountering wider spectra of pesticides). At a meta scale, spiders contained the highest number of detected pesticides in perennial crops but lowest diversity in annual crops. This might be explained by how spiders’ functional traits are selected in different crops. Insecticides and fungicides concentrations mostly increased with trophic level, indicating bioaccumulation. Herbicides concentration were highest in plants suggesting (bio)degradation. As bioaccumulation outweighed (bio)degradation, pesticides increased overall with trophic level. Therefore, the distribution of pesticides in agroecosystem food webs was affected simultaneously by several mechanisms and depended upon trophic group, crop type, and, probably, surrounding landscape.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Fruit tree–based agroforestry has been promoted as an alternative farming practice in upland Northwest Vietnam to replace monocultures of staple crops. Although many studies have focused on evaluating the performance of agroforestry systems at the plot level, research on how farmers perceive and evaluate agroforestry considering whole-farm contexts is limited. We explored the perceptions and reasoned management decisions of agroforestry farmers to uncover challenges that hinder the wider use of agroforestry, and we assessed farmers’ strategies for effective management of adoption challenges. We combined the Q methodology and the systems thinking approach. With the Q methodology, we explored prevalent discourses among the members of the farming community on the impact of agroforestry. Systems thinking elucidated a system-wide understanding of farmers’ adaptive decision-making processes. By combining the two approaches, we uncovered the dynamics that shape farmers’ perceptions and the rationale behind their management of the adoption process. Through the Q method, we identified three distinct discourses among participants. Two of these discourses are in favor of agroforestry, highlighting its beneficial impacts on livelihoods and the environment, e.g., through diversification of household income and through soil erosion control. We also generated a collective development pathway outlining how farmers navigated and adapted agroforestry practices to overcome adoption challenges through a whole-system approach to farm resource management. We identified structural barriers, such as unstable farm-gate prices, that may need high-level interventions. Our study adds a new dimension to the assessment of agroforestry through farmers’ perspectives and contributes to the existing body of research on knowledge systems in agroforestry. Considering farmers’ views and their ways of reasoning during innovation processes may allow tailoring appropriate innovations by accounting for unique farm situations and local farming systems. Such locally generated knowledge will have relevance for real-world contexts and therefore be useful for guiding actions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Sorghum production system in the semi-arid region of Africa is characterized by low yields which are generally attributed to high rainfall variability, poor soil fertility, and biotic factors. Production constraints must be well understood and quantified to design effective sorghum-system improvements. This study uses the state-of-the-art in silico methods and focuses on characterizing the sorghum production regions in Mali for drought occurrence and its effects on sorghum productivity. For this purpose, we adapted the APSIM-sorghum module to reproduce two cultivated photoperiod-sensitive sorghum types across a latitude of major sorghum production regions in Western Africa. We used the simulation outputs to characterize drought stress scenarios. We identified three main drought scenarios: (i) no-stress; (ii) early pre-flowering drought stress; and (iii) drought stress onset around flowering. The frequency of drought stress scenarios experienced by the two sorghum types across rainfall zones and soil types differed. As expected, the early pre-flowering and flowering drought stress occurred more frequently in isohyets &lt; 600 mm, for the photoperiod-sensitive, late-flowering sorghum type. In isohyets above 600 mm, the frequency of drought stress was very low for both cultivars. We quantified the consequences of these drought scenarios on grain and biomass productivity. The yields of the highly-photoperiod-sensitive sorghum type were quite stable across the higher rainfall zones &gt; 600 mm, but was affected by the drought stress in the lower rainfall zones &lt; 600 mm. Comparatively, the less photoperiod-sensitive cultivar had notable yield gain in the driest regions &lt; 600 mm. The results suggest that, at least for the tested crop types, drought stress might not be the major constraint to sorghum production in isohyets &gt; 600 mm. The findings from this study provide the entry point for further quantitative testing of the Genotype × Environment × Management options required to optimize sorghum production in Mali.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Wheat is one of the most important arable crops grown worldwide, providing a significant proportion of the daily calorific intake for countries across the globe. Wheat crops are attacked by a diverse range of herbivorous invertebrates, pests, that cause significant yield loss. It is anticipated that yield loss caused by pests will increase in response to a changing climate. Currently, these pests are primarily controlled using pesticides; however, there is an increased need for more sustainable pest management solutions. Economic thresholds represent one avenue that can support the sustainable management of pests. Briefly, thresholds are the number of pests above which there is sufficient risk of yield loss. Here, we review the economic thresholds and prediction methods available for sustainable pest management in wheat. We focus on five economically damaging pests affecting wheat crops in the UK and Europe. For each, we highlight the key period of crop risk to pest attack, identify economic thresholds, and provide an overview of current decision support models that can help estimate crop risk and advise sustainable pest management; we end by proposing areas for future improvement for each pest. Furthermore, we take a novel approach by discussing economic thresholds and their applications to sustainable pest management within the context of crop physiology and the capacity for crops to tolerate pest damage, a consideration that is often overlooked when developing pest management strategies. We use the stem-boring pest, the gout fly, as a case study and use the economic injury level equation to conduct a theoretical assessment of the appropriateness of the current gout fly threshold. This theoretical assessment indicates that wheat crops can tolerate greater gout fly damage than currently considered, and shows that by incorporating crop physiology into sustainable pest tolerance schemes we can work towards developing more appropriate physiological-based pest thresholds.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Determinants of farmer well-being can be derived from objective and subjective measures of social components, environmental sustainability indicators, and quality of life indices, as well as the multiple scales that farms and farmers operate. Yet, despite multiple frameworks on farmer well-being, the extent to which farmer-expressed values are used in the development of farmer well-being indicators is unclear. Challenges can arise from extracting indicators that are insufficiently grounded in place, or that inadequately incorporate context and biocultural relations and practices. Here in this scoping review, we synthesize the methodologies in the literature on assessing farmer well-being and identify the extent to which farmer well-being domains are derived from values expressed directly by farmers. We consolidated and coded 92 papers to respond to the following questions: (1) What are the most frequent farmer well-being domains in published studies? (2) What methods are used to elicit multidimensional farmer well-being domains? (3) Do well-being domains used in the literature adequately reflect a biocultural context, including place-based influences on well-being? Our results show that economics and social relationships are frequent domains of how farmer well-being is identified and assessed. These domains tend to be measured simultaneously, while less common domains, such as governance and place, are rather isolated. A suite of methods was used to assess well-being domains, ranging from basic surveys to in-depth participant observation. Yet, we identify gaps in the methods for deriving farmer well-being indicators. Specifically, methods that refer to farmer-expressed values were rare and domains identified through a place-based approach were often not recorded, but, arguably, critical in developing multidimensionality of farmer well-being. We show that while the translocal approach is well represented in established well-being frameworks, farmer expression is not foundational in well-being assessments but is needed in order to center farmer values when generating indicators of well-being.",

    "abstract": "Food security in many countries is threatened due to rapid population growth. Rising temperatures and carbon dioxide, rainfall irregularity, and global warming may have serious consequences on rice production and hence food security. However, there is limited knowledge on the precise effects of global warming on crops, in particular on rice which is a major staple crop and contributor to food security. Most reports have focused on irrigated rice in India or China but much less is known about rainfed rice cropping systems in Madagascar. In the Malagasy highlands, the most populated part of Madagascar, land pressure has led to saturation of irrigated lands and the adoption of rainfed cropping systems on hilltops. The present article reports the impact of various climate changes on rice productivity in four cropping systems using the CERES-Rice model. The cropping systems include two tillages components, hand-plowed and no-tillage, and two fertilization rates: low and high nitrogen. A locally adapted rice cultivar was calibrated and validated using a dataset based on experiments conducted over a 6-year period. Daily weather data were generated for a set of 90 virtual years, from 2010 to 2099. Our results show that no-tillage systems have no advantage for climate change issues. Nitrogen was a major constraint for crops in hand-plowed and no-tillage systems. We found negative effects of climate change on soil carbon and nitrogen. By contrast, we found positive effects of temperature and increased CO2 on rice growth. The overall effects on rice yields are positive under the most pessimistic climate change scenarios but we demonstrate that the sustainability of these systems is threatened.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Fertilizers are required to improve productivity of cassava and meet the increasing demand for cassava as food, feed, or raw material for processing industries. Our objective was to develop nutrition indices for N, P, and K to provide quantitative insight in the dynamics of nutrient demand and uptake of cassava. On-farm experiments were conducted at six locations in Nigeria from 2016 to 2018, across the major cassava growing agro-ecologies of West Africa. Nitrogen, P, and K were applied at different rates. Uptake of nutrients was measured in leaves, stems, and storage roots at 4, 8, and 12 or 14 months after planting (MAP) and used to construct NPK dilution curves and nutrition indices. About 67, 61, and 52% of total N, P, and K were taken up at 4 MAP, with a maximum uptake rate of 0.21, 0.03, and 0.12 g/m 2 /d for N, P, and K, respectively. Nutrient concentrations in stems and storage roots declined gradually, in contrast to concentrations in the leaves that fluctuated within narrow ranges. Dilution curves and nutrition indices for N, P, and K were established for the first time in cassava. Dilution curves of N, P, and K in the crop for the highest NPK application treatment were described as N c = 82DM −0.61 , P c = 7.4DM −0.54 , and K c = 43DM −0.54 , when total biomass was between 5 and 57 t/ha dry matter (DM). The nutrition indices were linearly related to relative crop biomass. Insight into the nutrient uptake and dilution patterns during the growth cycle can help to understand the temporal nutrient demands of cassava and identify sustainable management practices. Initial ample supply of N and P and moderate K, with extra K top-dress during the second growth phase, will benefit cassava growth and yield. Furthermore, such information provides a basis to develop a dynamic model to simulate nutrient-limited growth of cassava.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Acrocomia spp., a genus of wild-growing palms in the neotropics, is rapidly gaining interest as a promising multipurpose crop. Diverse products can be derived from various components of the palm, the oils being of highest interest. Acrocomia shows similar oil yield and fatty acid composition to the African oil palm ( Elaeis guineensis ). It is, however, able to cope with a wider range of environmental conditions, including temporary water scarcity and lower temperatures, thus potentially a more sustainable alternative to its tropical counterpart. Acrocomia’s research history is recent compared to other traditional crops and thus knowledge gaps, uncertainty, and challenges need to be addressed. This review attempts to assess the acrocomia’s preparedness for cultivation by highlighting the state-of-the-art in research and identifying research gaps. Based on a systematic literature search following a value web approach, it (a) provides a comprehensive overview of research topics, (b) shows the development of publication activities over time and the drivers of this development, and (c) compiles main findings to assess the acrocomia’s preparedness for commercial cultivation. Our results confirm its multipurpose characteristic as a potential feedstock for manifold sectors. Research has continued to increase over the last decade, especially on A. aculeata and is driven by the interest in bioenergy. Increasing knowledge on botany has contributed to understanding the genetic diversity and genus-specific biology. This has enabled applied research on seed germination and propagation toward domestication and initial plantation activities, mostly in Brazil. Main research gaps are associated with genotype–environment interaction, planting material, crop management, and sustainable cropping systems. Overall, we conclude that acrocomia is at an early phase of development as an alternative and multipurpose crop and its up-scaling requires the integration of sustainability strategies tailored to location-based social-ecological conditions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The soils of Mediterranean semiarid environments are commonly characterized by low levels of organic matter and mineral elements, as well as severe weed infestations, which, taken together, cause an intensive use of auxiliary inputs (tillage, fertilizers, herbicides). Although cover crops are recognized to sustainably improve soil health, the impact of Trifolium subterraneum L. cover cropping needs specific attention. This research investigates for the first time the effects over 4 years of T. subterraneum and spontaneous flora cover crops, after either incorporating their dead mulches into the soil or leaving them on the soil surface, on soil organic matter (SOM), macroelements, mineral nitrogen, microelements, and weed seedbank dynamics as indicators of soil quality in an apricot orchard. Compared to a conventional management control, the T. subterraneum cover crop with the burying of dead mulch into the soil increased the amount of SOM (+ 15%), ammoniacal (+ 194%) and nitric (+ 308%) nitrogen, assimilable P 2 O 5 (+ 5%), exchangeable K 2 O (+ 14%), exchangeable Na (+ 32%), exchangeable K (+ 16%), Fe (+ 15%), Mn (+ 28%), Zn (+ 36%), and Cu (+ 24%), while it decreased the weed seedbank size (‒ 54%) and enhanced weed biodiversity. These findings suggest that T. subterraneum cover cropping may be an environment-friendly tool to enhance soil quality and limit auxiliary input supply in Mediterranean orchards.",

    "abstract": "Abstract No-till cropping systems with cover crops can improve soil health, but often rely on glyphosate, which is a contentious herbicide. In this study, we investigated whether a system based on the direct sowing of sunflower ( Helianthus annuus ) in the dead mulch of a roller-crimped hairy vetch ( Vicia villosa ) could be competitive with a system where glyphosate is also sprayed to terminate the cover crop and to control weeds. We hypothesized that optimum timing of roller-crimping would be key to eliminate glyphosate requirements while maintaining sunflower performance. In a 3-year on-farm experiment, we compared three vetch termination stages (early: pre-flowering; Intermediate: beginning of flowering; late: 70% flowering) and three glyphosate rates (Nil, half and full, i.e. 1440 g of active ingredient per hectare). Vetch biomass increased progressively from early to late termination stages, and ranged between 414 and 658 g m −2 . Higher vetch biomass was correlated with lower weed biomass. Treatments had inconsistent effects on weed diversity and composition, largely determined by the interactions between treatments and seasonal (different years) or local factors (different fields). Glyphosate-based treatments seemed to select for aggressive weed species, but no clear species filtering effect based on ecological or functional traits was detected. Shannon H’ was positively correlated with sunflower grain yield below a weed dry biomass threshold of 150 g m −2 . Crop yield with early termination stage was a failure without glyphosate application. However, crop yield with late vetch termination was acceptable, being at par or 15% higher (mean of first and second years) in no-glyphosate compared with glyphosate-based treatments. Crop gross margins showed the same trend (+33% for no-glyphosate compared with glyphosate-based treatments). This study, for the first time, shows that targeted timing of roller-crimped hairy vetch in no-till sunflower can result in equal agronomic and economic performances as addition of glyphosate.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Dairy products play an important role in human nutrition, but at the same time, the dairy sector is a major contributor to global warming. The conversion from conventional to organic milk production could reduce the carbon footprint due to the elimination of synthetic fertilizers and strong reliance on closed on-farm nutrient cycling. We present one of the first studies to comprehensively estimate the climate-change impacts of the conversion to organic production of a large-scale dairy operation in central Germany. We used detailed farm data and a carbon footprint approach based on the IPCC tier-2 methodology to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with feed production, animal husbandry, and animal rearing. Our results show that the carbon footprint per kg of energy-corrected milk (ECM) decreased by 9% during the first year of conversion to organic milk production. Conversely, livestock emissions per kg ECM increased by 12% in the first conversion year due to the increase in methane emissions from enteric fermentation, but this increase was more than offset by the decrease in emissions from feed production. Emissions from internal and external feed production per kg ECM decreased by 17% and 29%, respectively. Our study helps to understand how individual emission sources change as a result of a farm’s conversion to organic production. This research is important and timely, as the European Union is pursuing ambitious goals to increase the area under organic farming, although the impact of the conversion period on GHG emissions has been insufficiently studied.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Duru et al. (Agron Sustain Dev 35:1259-1281, 2015) highlighted a missing tool for studying and improving the performance of cropping systems in the transition to highly diversified agriculture. In response, this paper proposes a concept for designing, modeling, monitoring, and auditing desired ecosystem services, in intercropping and agroforestry systems. We have labelled this concept ESSU (Ecosystem Services functional Spatial Unit). It delimits the smallest spatial unit encompassing all the interacting species and other functional components (e.g., crops, trees, livestock, spontaneous vegetation, semi-natural habitats such as hedges, ditches, forest patches, and animals) that together provide a specified set of ecosystem services. The novel ESSU concept allows representation of an entire diversified agroecosystem by the repetition of the spatial unit that provides the same sets of targeted ecosystem services as the agroecosystem it represents. It can then be used for various activities, such as the (i) design of more efficient agroecological systems according to the targeted ecosystem services; (ii) rapid audit of farming practices for biodiversity/resilience across large tracts of farmland as part of achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2 targets of sustainable food systems; and (iii) modeling such diversified agroecosystems using a motif adapted to represent the targeted ecosystem services and the species spacing design. We demonstrate that the ESSU concept is highly flexible and applicable to a wide range of diversified agroecosystems, like arable intercropping, crop-tree intercropping, tree-tree agroforestry, and agro-pastoralism. We also show its relevance and suitability for representing temporal changes over 1 year, across several years, and over decades, indicating its generalizability and flexibility. We argue that ESSU could open new theoretical and practical research avenues for the study of diversified agroecosystems. Considered with all the knowledge available on practices, biodiversity, and ecosystem services, ESSU might provide a learning-support tool to fill the knowledge gap about relationships among practices, biodiversity, and associated ecosystem services.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Achieving food security remains a pressing challenge for small-scale farmers, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. Ongoing climate change, invasive noxious weeds, and crop pests further exacerbate the situation. Optimizing traditional cropping systems for sustainable yields and climate-resilient production is imperative in order to address this challenge. The pre-Columbian milpa system of intercropping maize with companion crops such as beans ( Phaseolus vulgaris ) and squash ( Cucurbita spp.) is one effective system that has been shown to produce outstanding yields per unit area compared to monoculture systems. The Push-Pull Technology developed in East Africa, based on the use of repellent and trap companion plants intercropped with maize (and to a lesser extent sorghum), is seen to be similarly effective in minimizing the impact of major pests on yields, including striga weed ( Striga spp.), maize stemborers, and the fall armyworm ( Spodoptera frugiperda ). Although both systems have the potential to compensate for each other’s limitations, there has been no cross-system learning between the Mesoamerican milpa and the East African Push-Pull Technology. Here, we review both systems and present the advantages likely to be obtained by combining these technologies in small-scale farming. The proposed milpa push-pull system could adapt to different gradients of altitude, rainfall, and soil nutrient levels, in addition to controlling pests, and therefore has the potential to become a fundamental cropping technique in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Soil health metrics with strong links to ecological function and agricultural productivity are needed to ensure that future management of agricultural systems meets sustainability goals. While ecological metrics and crop yields are often considered separately from one another, our work sought to assess the links between the two in an agricultural context where productivity is a key consideration. Here, we investigated the value of soil health tests in terms of their relevance to agricultural management practices and crop yields at contrasting long term cropping systems experiments. One site was on a sandy loam Leptic Podzol and the other on a sandy clay loam Endostagnic Luvisol. Furthermore, the experiments had different management systems. One contained legume-supported rotations with different grass-clover ley durations and organic amendment usage, while the other compared a range of nutrient input options through fertiliser and organic amendments on the same rotation without ley periods. Metrics included field tests (earthworm counts and visual evaluation of soil structure scores) with laboratory analysis of soil structure, chemistry and biology. This analysis included bulk density, macroporosity, pH, available phosphorus, exchangeable potassium, soil organic matter and potentially mineralizable nitrogen. Using a novel combination of long-term experiments, management systems and distinctive soil types, we demonstrated that as well as providing nutrients, agricultural management which resulted in better soil organic matter, pH, potassium and bulk density was correlated with higher crop yields. The importance of ley duration and potentially mineralizable nitrogen to yield in legume-supported systems showed the impact of agricultural management on soil biology. In systems with applications of synthetic fertiliser, earthworm counts and visual evaluation of soil structure scores were correlated with higher yields. We concluded that agricultural management altered yields not just through direct supply of nutrients to crops, but also through the changes in soil health measured by simple metrics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Plant biomass can be used for multiple forms of bioenergy, and there is a very large potential supply, depending on which global assessment is most accurate in terms of land area that could be available for biomass production. The most suitable plant species must be identified before the potential biomass production in a particular region can be quantified. This in turn depends on the degree of climatic adaptation by those species. In the range of climates present in New Zealand, biomass crop growth has less restriction due to water deficit or low winter temperature than in most world regions. Biomass production for energy use in New Zealand would be best utilised as transport fuel since 70 % of the country’s electricity generation is already renewable, but nearly all of its transport fossil fuel is imported. There is a good economic development case for transport biofuel production using waste streams and biomass crops. This review identified the most suitable crop species and assessed their production potential for use within the climatic range present in New Zealand. Information from published work was used as a basis for selecting appropriate crops in a 2-year selection and evaluation process. Where there were knowledge gaps, the location-specific selections were further evaluated by field measurements. The data presented have superseded much of the speculative information on the suitability of species for the potential development of a biofuel industry in New Zealand.",

    "abstract": "As the human population continues to grow, so too do the concerns regarding the sustainability of waste management from our food production systems. Faced with limited environmental resources for food production, issues related to food loss and waste are critical in mitigating challenges stemming from projected population growth and long-term food security and sustainability. The potential for using insects to consume organic waste materials and convert them into feed for animal, biofuels, and other valuable secondary products is gaining momentum as both a research discipline and as a business opportunity. Here, this ecosystem service is referred to as \"insects as bioconverters of organic waste.\" Scientific reviews of this topic have mainly focused on the challenges associated with development of commercial scale systems. To compliment existing reviews, we address this exciting topic from an artificial selection perspective, as we review and discuss aspects associated with targeted breeding and adaptation of both gut microbial communities and host insects themselves. We describe the \"ideal insect bioconverter,\" insects uniquely equipped to convert wastes into biomass and other valuable secondary products, and we present the current knowledge and existing research gaps towards the development of such organisms. We conclude that (1) targeted breeding of insects and their gut microbes can produce tailored insect lineages for bioconversion of specific waste streams; (2) research is needed to take full advantage of the existing insect diversity to identify new candidate species for bioconversion; and (3) further research into insect-gut microbial complexes will likely provide important insight into ways insects can be used as sustainable bioconverters of highly specialized waste streams.",

    "abstract": "Abstract On upland soils in tropical Africa, common production constraints of rice and maize on smallholder farms are poor soil fertility—resulting from soil erosion and nutrient depletion—and infestation by witchweeds ( Striga spp.). In Madagascar where these crops are often grown in rotation, combining legume cover crops with no-till and crop residue mulching—labelled conservation agriculture (CA)—may address these problems. Previously, it was shown that CA practices contribute to steep reductions in Striga asiatica infection. In the current study, a 4-year field experiment was conducted to test, for the first time, the hypothesis that CA practices also contribute to crop yield and soil improvements under Striga- infested conditions. The conventional mono-crop rice–maize rotation practice, involving seasonal tillage and crop residue removal, was compared to three rice–maize rotation systems following CA practices, each with a different legume cover crop option: (1) two short-cycle annual species, cowpea ( Vigna unguiculata ) and mucuna ( Mucuna pruriens ); (2) a long-cycle annual, ricebean ( Vigna umbellata ); and (3) a perennial, stylosanthes ( S. guianensis ). Rice yields, as well as yield variability, generally increased by changing from the conventional to a CA practice, and maize yields were variable and low in particular under the CA practices. CA practices significantly reduced soil displacement by rainwater runoff and increased soil nitrogen and pH levels (0–20 cm depth), in particular with stylosanthes as cover crop, but did not result in a significant change in soil organic carbon concentration. Rice yields correlated negatively with Striga asiatica plant numbers in years with moderate infection levels. This is the first study that shows mixed outcomes from CA practices in tropical cereal rotation systems on degraded, Striga -infested soils, and subsequent entry points for system improvements. Suggested improvements include judicious cover crop management, complementary fertilizer applications and selection of competitive, resistant and adapted crop varieties.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Soil fertility is key to sustainable intensification of agriculture and food security in sub-Saharan Africa. However, when soil nutrients are not adequately managed, smallholder farming practices slowly erode soils to almost inert systems. This case study contributes to the understanding of such failures in marginal areas. We integrate agronomic and social sciences approaches to explore links between smallholder households’ farming knowledge and soil fertility in an ethnopedological perspective. We interview 280 smallholder households in two areas of the Ethiopian highlands, while collecting measures of 11 soil parameters at their main field. By analyzing soil compositions at tested households, we identify a novel measure of soil management ability, which provides an effective empirical characterization of the soil managing capacity of a household. Regression analysis is used to evaluate the effects of household knowledge on the soil management ability derived from laboratory analysis. Results highlight the complexity of knowledge transmission in low-input remote areas. We are able to disentangle a home learning and a social learning dimension of the household knowledge and appraise how they can result in virtuous and vicious cycles of soil management ability. We show that higher soil management ability is associated with farmers relying to a great extent on farming knowledge acquired within the household, as a result of practices slowly elaborated over the years. Conversely, lower soil management ability is linked to households valuing substantially farming knowledge acquired through neighbors and social gatherings. The present study is the first to formulate the concept of soil management ability and to investigate the effects of the presence and the types of farming knowledge on the soil management ability of smallholder farmers in remote areas. We show that farming knowledge has a primary role on soil fertility and we advise its consideration in agricultural development policies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Due to war conditions, the local farmers had to largely rely on their own crop production, mainly by subsistence farming, in Tigray, North Ethiopia. We assessed the crop stands in 2021 and evaluated the level of resilience of the indigenous farming system. Quantitative data were collected from 161 farm parcels in various ecoregions of this tropical mountain region, in order to detect the share of sown land, crop types, and their status. This participatory monitoring was accompanied by semi-structured interviews. Farmers cultivated their farms late, left it uncultivated or marginally sowed oil crops as improved fallow (28%), due to lack of farming tools, oxen, fertilizer, seeds, or manpower. As compared to peace years, only few lands were sown with sorghum as there was active warfare in the sorghum planting period. The relatively good stands of wheat and barley (47%) are in line with the farmers’ priority given to cereals. Teff got a large land share because it could be sown up to the middle of the main rainy season and because farmers had consumed the seeds of their major cereal crops (wheat and barley) when hiding for warfare. Seeds left from consumption were only sown by late June, when troops had retreated, and the communities could revive. With almost no external support, the local farming system has proven to be remarkably resilient, relying on indigenous knowledge and local practices, block rotation, manure, improved fallow, changes in relative importance of crops, seed exchange, and support for one another. This is the first analysis of the socio-agronomic roots of the 2021–2022 Tigray hunger crisis, with a cereal harvest that could not at all sustain the local population as the planting season had been largely missed. The ability of the indigenous farming system to partially rebounce in times of autarky is another novel finding.",

As existing assessment tools are not adapted to PIUA projects, they establish their own assessment practices. Our study examines these practices to identify their original features, criteria, and indicators used. To this end, we analysed 19 case studies of different PIUA projects. We identified four dimensions underpinning sustainability assessment, namely, internal sustainability, external sustainability, the project leader’s credibility, and the innovative nature of the project. We also shed light on the wide diversity of the 67 assessment criteria identified, as well as the qualitative nature of 78% of indicators used. In addition, our study highlights that assessment practices evolve over time as the project progresses from ideation to implementation, according to the variety of assessment situations. Our study is the first to provide an in-depth exploration of PIUA stakeholders’ sustainability assessment practices and to shed light on their specific features. Our results afford a better understanding of the way the sustainability of PIUA projects is assessed and contribute to reflection on the design of a flexible assessment tool, considering the diverse criteria and practices used by stakeholders to assess the sustainability of PIUA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Livestock production is confronted with significant challenges across all dimensions of sustainability. There is an urgent need to identify sustainable livestock systems that are environmentally friendly, economically viable for farmers, and socially acceptable. To this end, diversity assessments and data-driven indicator-based sustainability assessments can be helpful tools. These two mutually reinforcing approaches each have their own dilemmas and strengths; however, their combination is not straightforward. In this paper, we propose a method that simultaneously assesses the diversity and sustainability of production systems within one agricultural sector, without compromising either aspect, while overcoming the dilemmas of diversity and sustainability assessments. We test our method on the Walloon dairy and beef sectors (Belgium) and base our assessment on data from the European Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). We apply relevant classification criteria to the sample farms to group them into production systems. The core data was complemented with calculated environmental indicators to perform a comprehensive sustainability assessment, including structural, socio-economic, and environmental indicators. Our results confirm the importance of complementing sustainability assessments with diversity assessments. Our case study results show that a diversity of livestock systems coexist and that it is possible to overcome trade-offs between economic and environmental performances. Extensive grass-based systems present the best combination of economic and environmental results, which highlights the importance of preserving grassland resources at the regional level. The proposed method proves effective to improve the relevance of FADN data and supports the ongoing call to transform the FADN into a more comprehensive database that satisfactorily covers all dimensions of sustainability.",

Phenology models are typically driven by temperature and photoperiod, but chickpea phenology is also modulated by soil water, which is not captured in these models. This study is aimed at evaluating the hypotheses that accounting for soil water improves (i) the prediction of flowering, pod-set, and flowering-to-pod-set interval in chickpea and (ii) the computation of yield-reducing frost and heat events after flowering. To test these hypotheses, we compared three variants of the Agricultural Production System Simulator (APSIM): (i) APSIMc, which models development with no temperature threshold for pod-set; (ii) APSIMx, which sets a threshold of 15 °C for pod-set; and (iii) APSIMw, derived from APSIMc with an algorithm to moderate the developmental rate as a function of soil water, in addition to temperature and photoperiod common to all three models. Comparison of modelled and actual flowering and pod-set of a common cheque cultivar PBA Boundary A in 54 diverse environments showed that accuracy and precision were superior for APSIMw. Because of improved prediction of flowering and pod-set timing, APSIMw improved the computation of the frequency of post-flowering frosts compared to APSIMc and APSIMx. The number of heat events was similar for all three models. We conclude that accounting for water effects on plant development can allow better matching between phenology and environment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Conservation agriculture (CA) is the key agricultural soil management approach for Mediterranean rainfed systems facing extreme droughts and soil degradation. Yet, CA uptake and applicability is still marginal and disputed in the Mediterranean region, where smallholder farmers are most representative. Lack of widespread adoption of CA in the Mediterranean region despite international efforts is perplexing. In order to investigate this paradox and provide solutions, we set out to examine the perceived constraints to CA implementation among farmers and stakeholders. Our approach is based on systems analysis of Mediterranean grain production systems, considering plant and livestock production, as well as sustainability and social-ecological interactions. CA promotion efforts are rarely adapted to the context of the Mediterranean region. We argue for adopting a more pragmatic and flexible approach to CA. Such an approach should be based on site-specific bio-physical and sociocultural considerations and augmented with principles of agroecology. Our review of perceived constraints allows us to suggest five pathways that could promote CA adoption in the Mediterranean across two main areas: (i) introduction of flexible, context-specific technical solutions and (ii) change of social perceptions and literacy on soil. Our five pathways aim to enhance farmers’ resilience to challenges of climate and market shocks, while integrating agroecological principles that enhance ecosystem multifunctionality. We advocate using agroecological principles to enable a more pragmatic application of CA with respect to its strict application—such as continuous no-till—to rehabilitate degraded lands, to increase water use efficiency, and to improve food security and economic well-being of communities in the Mediterranean region.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Understanding the environmental consequences associated with dairy cattle production systems is crucial for the implementation of targeted strategies for emission reduction. However, few studies have modelled the effect of tailored emission mitigation options across key European dairy production systems. Here, we assess the single and combined effect of six emission mitigation practises on selected case studies across Europe through the Sustainable and Integrated Management System for Dairy Production model. This semi-mechanistic model accounts for the interacting flows from a whole-farm perspective simulating the environmental losses in response to different management strategies and site-specific conditions. The results show how reducing the crude protein content of the purchased fraction of the diet was an adequate strategy to reduce the greenhouse gas and nitrogen emission intensity in all systems. Furthermore, implementing an anaerobic digestion plant reduced the greenhouse gas emissions in all tested case studies while increasing the nitrogen emissions intensity, particularly when slurry was applied using broadcast. Regarding the productivity increase, contrasting effects were observed amongst the case studies modelled. Moreover, shallow slurry injection effectively mitigated the intensity of nitrogen losses from the fields due to strong reductions in ammonia volatilisation. When substituting urea with ammonium nitrate as mineral fertiliser, site-specific conditions affected the mitigation potential observed, discouraging its application on sandy-loam soils. Rigid slurry covers effectively reduced the storage-related nitrogen emissions intensity while showing a minor effect on total greenhouse gas emission intensity. In addition, our results provide novel evidence regarding the advantages of cumulative implementation of adapted mitigation options to offset the negative trade-offs of single-option applications (i.e. slurry covers or anaerobic digestion and slurry injection). Through this study, we contribute to a better understanding of the effect of emission mitigation options across dairy production systems in Europe, thus facilitating the adoption of tailored and context-specific emission reduction strategies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Conservation Agriculture (CA) is actively promoted as an alternative farming system that combines environmental, economic, and social sustainability. Three pillars define CA: (i) minimum mechanical soil disturbance, (ii) permanent soil organic cover, and (iii) species diversification. The local context, constraints, and needs of the farmers influence the translation of the pillars into practices. Currently, there is no method for categorizing this diversity of CA practices, which hampers impact assessment, understanding of farmer choices and pathways, stakeholder communication, and policymaking. This paper presents a systematic method to identify and categorize the diversity of CA practices at the regional level, anchored in the three pillars and based on practices implemented by CA farmers. The classification method is grounded on the intersection of an archetypal analysis and a hierarchical clustering analysis. This method was used to study CA practices in Wallonia, Belgium, based on a survey of practices in a sample of 48 farmers. Combining the two clustering methods increases the proportion of classified farmers while allowing for the distinction between three CA-types with extreme and salient practices, and two intermediate CA-types comprising farmers whose practices fall between these references. The study reveals that three explanatory factors influence the implementation of CA practices in Wallonia: (i) the proportion of tillage-intensive crops and (ii) temporary grasslands in the crop sequence, and (iii) the organic certification. These factors lead to trade-offs that hinder the three pillars of CA from being fully implemented simultaneously. This new classification method can be replicated in other regions where CA is practiced, by adapting input variables according to context and local knowledge.",

The underlying drivers contributing to the increase in burning have been linked to the adoption of mechanized (combine) harvesting but, in general, are inadequately understood. We hypothesize that the adoption of burning as a management practice results from a set of socio-technical interactions rather than emerging from a single factor.

    "abstract": "Information on the environmental impact of maize production is actually inconsistent. Indeed some experiments report good nitrogen (N) efficiencies and small residual N. Other experiments show large leaching losses, while in practice maize production is often coupled with an intensive production and large N surpluses. Here, we present data from a 4-year experiment with silage maize on a sandy soil of high mineralization potential. The experimental set-up included three N input forms, mineral, cattle and pig slurry and four rates of total N, of 0, 80, 160 and 240 kg N ha−1 year−1 and the use of suction cups. Results show that dry matter and N yields for N0–N240 were relatively high and consistent (158–192 kg N ha−1). Further findings show large residual soil mineral nitrogen, of 138–237 kg N ha−1, and high nitrate concentrations in leaching water during winter, of 39–73 mg NO3–N L−1, corresponding to leaching losses of 86–152 kg N ha−1. Response to N input was small with apparent N recoveries of 14–22% for manures and mineral fertilizers. We conclude that caution is needed when maize production is extended to fields with an apparently high potential for mineralization and that use as grassland would be a better alternative with regard to N leaching losses.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Walnut trees are among the most important hardwood species in the northern hemisphere, ecologically and economically. They are mainly cultivated for timber and nut production but are also attractive ornamental trees in parks. Establishing walnut orchards is difficult because seedlings have a coarse root architecture and few of them survive to transplanting. Planting success is mainly determined by the root system morphology and the nutrient status of the seedlings, so that rhizosphere conditions are critical for plant performance. Walnut trees can associate with soil-borne arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, which are obligate biotrophs. In this association, plant-produced carbon compounds are traded against fungus-acquired soil mineral nutrients. The beneficial effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis on hardwood seedling quality and field performance has long been known, but an integrated view is lacking about the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizas on walnut cropping. Therefore, we surveyed the literature published over the last 40 years to provide up-to-date knowledge on the relationships between arbuscular mycorrhizas and walnut trees. Our review outlines the major following points: (1) the arbuscular-mycorrhiza-mediated nutrient uptake capacity of walnut trees is associated with first- to third-order roots, and fibrous tip-ended roots are dependent on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, whereas pioneer roots are not; (2) early inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi improves the survival and seedling performance attributes of transplanted walnut trees: biotization enhances walnut transplant success by increasing the number of lateral roots and plant P uptake, but these benefits are fungus- and host-dependent; (3) in the context of walnut agroforestry, deeply rooted walnut trees play a role as reservoirs of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal propagules for the surrounding vegetation, but tree shade and soluble phosphate availability decrease walnut mycorrhizal dependency; and (4) the arbuscular mycorrhizal mycelium mediates the transport of juglone and thus plays a role in walnut tree allelopathy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Organic farming relies on ecological processes to replace chemical inputs, and organic farmers have developed various strategies, including several forms of diversification, to remain viable. Herein, we hypothesized that diversified organic farming systems can enhance their performance by increasing the level of interactions between system components. We therefore performed an ecological network analysis to characterize both within-farm and farm-environment interactions. Flows were expressed on an annual basis according to the quantity of biomass exchanges multiplied by nitrogen content. Seventeen organic farms were surveyed in French grassland areas, each associating beef cattle with either sheep, pigs, or poultry. The ecological network analysis was then coupled with the assessment of farm economic, environmental, and social performances. A hierarchical clustering on principal components distinguished five groups of farms based on farm and herd size, presence of monogastrics, percentage of crops in the farm area, and system activity indicators. A large farm size, in terms of area or number of workers, can limit the implementation of a homogeneous flow network within the system. A higher level of within-system interactions did not lead to better farm economic, environmental, and social performances. Systems with large monogastric production enterprises were highly dependent on inputs, which led to less homogeneous flow networks and a poor farm nitrogen balance without gaining economic efficiency. Managing a complex system with a dense and complex flow network did not appear to increase farmers’ mental workload. To our knowledge, this study is the first to quantify farm-scale interactions using ecological network indicators in temperate livestock farms and to analyze the links between farm performance and operating processes. The ecological network analysis thus potentially provides a common framework for comparing a wide range of livestock farms. Given the variability of multispecies livestock farms, a larger database will be used to extend our conclusions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cotton-winter fallow is the major cropping system of cotton in the Yellow River basin of China, which not only leads to a considerable waste of land and natural resources, but also high greenhouse emissions and a loss of reactive nitrogen. Replacing winter bare fallow in cotton production with February orchid as a cover crop is a new cropping system in this area, but its sustainability is still unknown. Therefore, a field experiment was conducted with two cropping systems (cotton-winter fallow and cotton-February orchid) under four nitrogen application rates (0, 112.5, 168.75, and 225 kg N ha −1 ). Field observations were incorporated into a life cycle assessment to estimate the carbon footprint, nitrogen footprint, net ecosystem economic benefits, and economic benefits. The estimated carbon footprint per unit of sown area was 43.6–76.1% lower in the cotton-February orchid system than in the cotton-winter fallow system, mainly because of the increase in soil organic carbon. The cotton-February orchid system significantly increased the nitrogen footprint per unit of sown area by 6.7–11.5% under different application rates mainly because of the increase in N 2 O emissions. The nitrogen application rate significantly impacted the carbon and nitrogen footprints. After accounting for changes in the nitrogen and carbon footprints, the cotton-February orchid system with 168.75 kg N ha −1 , which resulted in the highest net ecosystem economic benefits and economic benefits, resulted in a 25.0% reduction in nitrogen fertilizer applied and a 9.5% increase in net ecosystem economic benefits compared with the conventional cotton-winter fallow system and nitrogen fertilizer application rate (225.75 kg N ha −1 ). Thus, adopting an integrated strategy combining February orchid as a cover crop and a reduced nitrogen fertilizer application contributes to improvements in green and sustainable cotton production systems in the Yellow River basin and other regions with similar ecological conditions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Eating “less but better” meat can be a strategy to guide meat consumption in Western or high-income countries towards sustainability, but what “better” means depends on the perspective. Multiple studies and reports suggest that agroecological farming systems could contribute to a broad range of sustainability benefits, but few studies have examined the implications for people and nature following trade-offs between sustainability priorities at the farm level. Therefore, this study explored the effects on a broad range of sustainability themes following agroecological transition on a case farm in east-central Sweden. We applied a novel mixed-methods approach, combining the indicator-based SMART-Farm tool with additional quantitative and qualitative analysis of the farm’s climate impact, contribution to global food security, economic performance, and working conditions. The results showed improvements for aspects within environmental, social, economic, and governance-related sustainability dimensions, with corroborating results across methods. The case farm thus served as an example of transition to a more sustainable production system, but as expected, there were both trade-offs and synergies between sustainability aspects. Negative effects were found for economic aspects at the farm and societal level. For this case, one may conclude that “better” meat production both supports and depends on, a more sustainable farm; but that “better” meat and a more sustainable farm cannot be viewed in isolation from the wider food system. Also, “better” can be described by several states along a transition pathway. Key contributions of the study are threefold, a) articulation of the links between agroecology and the concept “less but better,” b) empirically demonstrating synergies and trade-offs in striving for more sustainable meat production, and c) a novel methodological approach for sustainability assessment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract With many of the world’s poor engaged in agriculture, agricultural development programmes often aim to improve livelihoods through improved farming practices. Research on the impacts of agricultural technology interventions is dominated by comparisons of adopters and non-adopters. By contrast, in this literature study, we critically review how technology evaluation studies assess differentiated impacts in smallholder farming communities. We searched systematically for studies which present agricultural technology impacts disaggregated for poor and relatively better-off users (adopters). The major findings of our systematic review are as follows: (1) The number of studies that assessed impact differentiation was startlingly small: we were able to identify only 85, among which only 24 presented empirical findings. (2) These studies confirm an expected trend: absolute benefits are larger for the better-off, and large relative benefits among the poor are mostly due to meagre baseline performance. (3) Households are primarily considered as independent entities, rather than as connected with others directly or indirectly, via markets or common resource pools. (4) Explanations for impact differentiation are mainly sought in existing distributions of structural household characteristics. We collated the explanations provided in the selected studies across a nested hierarchy: the field, the farm or household, and households interacting at the farming system level. We also consider impact differentiation over time. With this, we provide a structured overview of potential drivers of differentiation, to guide future research for development towards explicitly recognizing the poor among the poor, acknowledging unequal impacts, aiming to avoid negative consequences, and mitigating them where they occur.",

Here, with a particular view to the potential application of OFE in Australian farming systems, we consider the synergies between OFE and the use of precision agriculture (PA) technologies such as yield monitors, crop and soil sensors, and variable rate application of inputs. Indeed, it is suggested that whilst the tools of PA greatly facilitate the conduct of OFE, it is arguably the case that OFE is an essential part of the optimal deployment of PA. We also address statistical issues associated with OFE conducted using PA, including the use of replication, randomization for experimental design, and concerns about spatial autocorrelation in data collected at the within-field scale. However, whilst farmers are generally disengaged from data analysis and place greater emphasis on the magnitude of gross effects and benefit:cost than on statistical significance, they nevertheless want robust and interpretable results. Accordingly, we identify some tools which facilitate simple assessment of alternative management actions across the range of variation in the production systems which farmers encounter. The need for farmer-trustworthy systems of data governance and data sharing amongst those engaged in OFE is also highlighted.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Mountain pastures are embedded in highly sensitive mountain ecosystems and provide forage for livestock during summer. In years when forage in the lowlands becomes scarce due to over-grazing and land degradation, or climate-related extreme events such as droughts, increasing stocking densities or expanding grazed areas in mountain pastures provide an additional and cost-efficient forage source. Their utilization highly depends on the management decisions of farmers and practices on their own agricultural land. To predict future land use and concomitant ecological impacts, it is crucial to understand the complex interplay between the decisions of farmers as well as the socio-economic and climatic environment. To understand these interactions, we use the agent-based part of the SECLAND model to analyze the future systemic feedback between climate change, land owner’s decisions on land use, and land use change on agricultural land and mountain pastures in the department of Ariège, France. We develop three land use scenarios for a sustainability-driven, a business-as-usual, and a scenario driven by fossil-fueled economic growth. In all scenarios, 32–46% of farms cease to exist, while active farms intensify their land use. On mountain pastures, results show increasing stocking densities up to the maximum carrying capacity of 0.3 livestock units per hectare, especially under the scenario with strong climate change effects and increased extreme events. Additionally, these patterns are strongly shaped by farm succession, vegetation regrowth on unused mountain pastures, and the search for cost-efficient forage resources. Such high stocking densities on mountain pastures increase the pressure on the ecosystem through manure droppings and the introduction of alien microbes, calling for considerate management to avoid conflicting situations. Agent-based models such as that used in this study enable researchers to untangle the described complex interactions between grazing livestock, and the utilization of lowland and mountain pastures in European mountain agroecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Crop–livestock integration exploits the synergies between cropping and livestock systems, mainly by using animal excreta as an organic crop fertilizer or using crop products as animal feed. From an environmental and economic point of view, crop–livestock integration is thought to increase system autonomy and resilience. However, little research has addressed its social impact and particularly the relationship between crop-livestock integration and work organization although, like most agroecological practices, crop-livestock integration was considered time- and labor-intensive. Here we used quantitative indicators based on the “Qualification and Evaluation of Work” method coupled with qualitative interviews with farmers to understand how implementation of crop–livestock integration practices is affected by work characteristics (perception, organization, duration, and arduousness). This framework was implemented on 14 farms selected from a typology of mixed crop–livestock systems in Guadeloupe (French West Indies), where high labor costs heighten the tension between work organization and agroecological practices. Our results show that three patterns of crop–livestock integration shaped work organization: family farms with strong crop–livestock integration (Pattern 1, n=6 farms), farms with moderate crop–livestock integration (Pattern 2, n=5 farms), and intensive productivity-driven farms (Pattern 3, n=3 farms). We also show for the first time that farmer perceptions of work, especially with animals, influences level of implementation of crop–livestock integration practices. In Pattern 1, work with livestock is done by the farmers themselves or by skilled and trusted persons from their inner circle. In Pattern 3, livestock was considered a source of on-farm income, and work with livestock, including crop–livestock integration practices, is readily delegated to employees or volunteers. Whatever the pattern, the time burden of collecting crop-products and excreta was cited as a primary barrier to further implementation. Actionable opportunities for further implementation of these patterns of crop–livestock integration practices are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Crop models have evolved over the past decade to incorporate more soil-related processes. While this may open avenues to support farmers regarding fertilization practices, it also widens the pitfalls related to model parametrization. Open-access georeferenced soil databases are often a solution for modelers to derive soil parameters. However, they can potentially add to model uncertainty depending on database resolution and the variability of the characteristics it contains. Fertimap is an online spatial database recently released in Morocco. In this study, we aim at assessing how Fertimap could support the use of crop model in the rainfed wheat production areas of Morocco. Data including local soil analysis, farmers’ practices, wheat biomass, and yield were collected on 126 farmers’ fields distributed across the rainfed wheat production area in Morocco from 2018 to 2020. Data were first used to parameterize, calibrate, and assess the model, using site-specific data to infer soil parameters. Then, the impact of soil data source on model uncertainty was assessed by rerunning the simulations while using alternatively locally measured soil inputs or inputs extracted from Fertimap. To disentangle the effect of data source from model sensitivity on model outputs, the model’s sensitivity to labile phosphorus, pH, and organic carbon parameters was also tested. The APSIM-wheat model was found to reasonably simulate wheat phenological stages, biomass, and yield. The comparison of model outputs using one or another source of soil data indicated that using Fertimap had no significant effect on the model’s outputs. This study provides the first assessment of the APSIM-wheat model for simulation of widely used wheat cultivars in Moroccan rainfed areas. It is also the first proof of the practical utility of Fertimap database for modeling purposes in Morocco. This preliminary study delivers a robust basis for model-assisted agricultural advising to take off in Morocco.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In face of the current environmental challenges, developing multifunctional cropping systems is increasingly needed, and crop variety mixtures are particularly interesting since they can deliver diverse services including grain production, yield stability, N 2 O production regulation, disease control, and reduction of N-fertilizer losses. However, the relationships between intraspecific diversity and ecosystem multifunctionality are poorly understood so far, and practitioners lack science-based guidance to design mixtures. We used a pool of 16 bread wheat varieties classified into 4 functional groups based on 26 below- and aboveground functional traits, to conduct a field trial (88 large plots cultivated with single varieties or mixtures of 2, 4, or 8 varieties), quantifying 15 provisioning and regulating services for each plot. To assess yield stability between local conditions and years, the trial was replicated at 4 other locations and for 2 years, using 2 managements each time. We analyzed how variety number and functional groups predicted the variance in services, and applied in an innovative manner the RLQ co-inertia analysis to relate the (variety × traits) matrix Q to a (plot × services) matrix R , using a (plot × variety) composition matrix L as a link. Our results show that using variety mixtures allowed delivery of baskets of services not reachable when cultivating single varieties, and that mixtures mitigated tradeoffs between different pairs of services. Variety number or functional groups poorly predicted the variance in services, but the RLQ approach allowed the identification of groups of plots delivering consistent baskets of services. Moreover, we demonstrated for the first-time significant relationships between specific baskets of services and bundles of variety traits. We discuss how our results increase our understanding of intraspecific diversity–agroecosystem multifunctionality relationships, and propose the next steps using our new approach to support practitioners for designing variety mixtures that provide particular baskets of services.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Simulation models have co-evolved with agricultural research methods over the last 60 years and they are now a widely accepted and deployed component of agricultural research and development. Modelling supports research in a very diverse range of disciplines and situations, but nowhere more so than in farming systems research. The complex interactions in space and time in the face of climate variability and change that characterise contemporary farming systems research create a situation in which farming systems models are vital tools in interpreting and generalising research results. This review examines the evolution of one of the most widely used farming systems modelling platforms, the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM). The review sets the scene for APSIM development with an account of research approaches in agronomy during the 1960s and 1970s. The early innovations in crop and soil modelling in the 1980s are covered briefly and a more explicit history of APSIM development is reported from the 1990s. Reports of APSIM use and impact are reviewed over the 2000s and 2010s. The review concludes with reflections on the forces that have shaped and enabled this more than 30-year history of APSIM development and use, together with a look forward to future challenges. Recent developments in proximal and remote sensing together with advances in the power of empirical models arising from machine learning are not seen as threats but more so opportunities for sound bio-physical models to be deployed with greater effect.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Effects of climate change and especially the associated climate variability require farmers to adjust to increasing frequencies of extreme events. In the agriculturally highly productive Romanian Plain, the frequency, intensity, and duration of heatwaves and drought have increased over the past 20 years. Although recent surveys revealed farmers’ awareness of climate change and enumerated a number of farm adaptation measures in the Romanian context, a systems approach to adaptation that allows conclusions on farm vulnerability and adaptive capacity is missing. Here, we use archetypal analysis to elucidate and characterize for the first time the types of adaptation responses of arable farmers in southern Romania. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 farmers managing 51,500 ha located across the southern lowlands of Romania, selected for their diversity of management approaches. Farmers were asked about experienced climatic disturbances, crop production losses during the most extreme events over the past 5–10 years, and the adaptation measures they implemented over that period of time. In addition, structural characteristics of the farm were recorded. The adaptation measures were classified and mapped on the efficiency, substitution, and redesign gradient used to classify sustainability stages. Results revealed three archetypes of adaptation, consisting of measures at field and farm level ranging from predominantly efficiency-enhancing ones (e.g., crop choice and management and risk insurance) to complete farm redesign involving agrotechnical and financial management changes. Structural farm characteristics did not explain differences between farms in their association with one of the archetypes. Our approach and results show for the first time both the need for strengthening farmer-level support in one of Europe’s key food production areas and the lessons that can be drawn from the outlier adaptation examples. Current European and national policies offer opportunities for farmer organizations in Romania to make these conclusions actionable.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Accurate production estimates, months before the harvest, are crucial for all parts of the food supply chain, from farmers to governments. While methods have been developed to use satellite data to monitor crop development and production, they typically rely on official crop statistics or ground-based data, limiting their application to the regions where they were calibrated. To address this issue, a new method called VeRsatile Crop Yield Estimator (VeRCYe) has been developed to estimate wheat yield at the pixel and field levels using satellite data and process-based crop models. The method uses the Leaf Area Index (LAI) as the linking variable between remotely sensed data and APSIM crop model simulations. In this process, the sowing dates of each field were detected (RMSE = 2.6 days) using PlanetScope imagery, with PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 data fused into a daily 3 m LAI dataset, enabling VeRCYe to overcome the traditional trade-off between satellite data that has either high temporal or high spatial resolution. The method was evaluated using 27 wheat fields across the Australian wheatbelt, covering a wide range of pedo-climatic conditions and farm management practices across three growing seasons. VeRCYe accurately estimated field-scale yield (R 2 = 0.88, RMSE = 757 kg/ha) and produced 3 m pixel size yield maps (R 2 = 0.32, RMSE = 1213 kg/ha). The method can potentially forecast the final yield (R 2 = 0.78–0.88) about 2 months before the harvest. Finally, the harvest dates of each field were detected from space (RMSE = 2.7 days), indicating when and where the estimated yield would be available to be traded in the market. VeRCYe can estimate yield without ground calibration, be applied to other crop types, and used with any remotely sensed LAI information. This model provides insights into yield variability from pixel to regional scales, enriching our understanding of agricultural productivity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Agricultural systems strongly impact ecosystems by driving terrestrial degradation, water depletion, and climate change. The Life Cycle Assessment allows for comprehensive analyses of the environmental impacts of food production. Nonetheless, its application still faces challenges due to cropping systems’ increased complexity and multifunctionality. Past research has emphasized the need for more holistic approaches to consider dynamic crop interactions and diverse functions of cropping systems, beyond just meeting the demand for foods and feeds. In this context, this study applied an alternative combined and multifunctional modelling approach to compare the environmental performances of two durum wheat cropping systems. The latter differed in crop rotation schedules, farming methods, tillage techniques, and genotypes grown (including both modern and old ones). Novel methodological choices were adopted in this study, aiming at best representing the complexity and peculiarities of these systems, by considering crop rotation effects and reflecting the main durum wheat stakeholders’ perspectives. The results showed that the organic low-input landrace-growing system (Case 1) had considerably lower environmental impacts than the conventional high-input one (Case 2), regardless of the functional unit. The environmental hotspots were the increased land occupation and the bare fallow for Case 1 and Case 2, respectively. At the endpoint level, the most affected impact categories for both the systems of analysis were land use, fine particulate matter formation, global warming (human health), and human non-carcinogenic toxicity. Also, the midpoint analysis pointed out important differences in terms of other assessed impact categories, with Case 1 better performing for the majority of them. The identified improvement solutions include the following: the enhancement of the yield performances and the optimization of nitrogen provision from the leguminous crop for Case1, the shift toward a more efficient rotational scheme, the reduction of the use of external inputs, and the avoidance of unnecessary soil tillage operations for Case 2.",

Much less is known about how trees and their biotic interactions (e.g. with natural enemies of pests and wild understory plants) impact crop yield stability to biotic stresses such as crop pests and disease. Modelling these interactions using conventional approaches is complex and time consuming, and we take a simplified approach, representing the agroecosystem as a Boolean regulatory network and parameterising Boolean functions using expert opinion. This allies our approach with decision analysis, which is increasingly finding applications in agriculture. Despite the naivety of our model, we demonstrate that it outputs complex and realistic agroecosystem dynamics. It predicts that, in English silvoarable, the biotic interactions of in-field trees boost arable crop yield overall, but they do not increase yield stability to biotic stress. Sensitivity analysis shows that arable crop yield is very sensitive to disease and weeds. We suggest that the focus of studies and debate on ecosystem service provision by English agroforestry needs to shift from natural enemies and pests to these ecosystem components. We discuss how our model can be improved through validation and parameterisation using real field data. Finally, we discuss how our approach can be used to rapidly model systems (agricultural or otherwise) than can be represented as dynamic interaction networks.",

    "abstract": "Glasshouse tomato production is reduced by the whitefly Trialeurodes vaporariorum, a major worldwide pest of glasshouse crops. Whitefly control is achieved using pesticides or parasitoids, which have drawbacks. There is thus a need for other control methods. For instance, the use of volatile compounds from plant odours could profoundly change the behaviour of plant-eating insects. This practice should be safe because plant odours are usually harmless to humans. Therefore, we have studied the effect of plant volatiles on whiteflies feeding on tomato plants. The rationale was to use the confusion effect by supplying whiteflies with a super-abundance of volatiles. We removed plant headspace volatiles from multiple whitefly host plants. Then, we presented these volatiles to whiteflies feeding on tomato plants. At the same time, whitefly stylet penetration is monitored using electrical penetration graphs (EPG). Plant colonisation, egg laying and honeydew production are analysed in separate experiments. Data are compared to controls in which extracted volatiles from tomato and air alone are presented to the whiteflies. The only significant effect produced by exposure to multiple-host volatiles is a pronounced reduction in the incidence of phloem-related waveforms during the 15-h EPG recording. This represents a delay in, rather than a cessation of, phloem-related activities as there is no related reduction in long-term performance. The confusion effect thus does not appear to exert strong effects on whitefly behaviour here.",

The West African Sahel requires attention to balancing the need for increasing agricultural production against harsh environmental conditions. While there is much research documenting technologies for soil regeneration in the Sahel, there has been limited focus on how agricultural practices contribute or exacerbate these efforts. Previous assessments of agricultural practices in this region have been largely descriptive, and some soil ameliorating practices have been promoted with little empirical evidence on their effectiveness. Here we systematically review the literature on soil fertility and conservation practices that have been studied within West African Sahelian agricultural systems. We identified practices in the West African Sahel that have been tested to improve soil fertility and reduce land degradation, and summarized the outcomes of these practices. A unique contribution of this review is the assessment of site-specific conditions and contexts under which practices are most effective in studies which recorded these specific characteristics. We found that research in this area is dominated by chemical fertilizer and organic amendment practices, with moderate to few studies focused on soil and water conservation, crop diversification, or agroforestry. Additionally, most studies consisted of single practices rather than combining practices that target the range of biophysical limitations farmers face in agricultural production. These limitations highlight the need for increased research testing combinations of practices across long-term on-farm studies to generate stronger evidence of conditions under which practices best perform. These findings provide key lessons for research and extension on sustainable agricultural management under the challenging conditions of the Sahel.",

    "abstract": "Abstract It has been shown that the COVID-19 pandemic affected some agricultural systems more than others, and even within geographic regions, not all farms were affected to the same extent. To build resilience of agricultural systems to future shocks, it is key to understand which farms were affected and why. In this study, we examined farmers’ perceived robustness to COVID-19, a key resilience capacity. We conducted standardized farmer interviews ( n = 257) in 15 case study areas across Europe, covering a large range of socio-ecological contexts and farm types. Interviews targeted perceived livelihood impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on productivity, sales, price, labor availability, and supply chains in 2020, as well as farm(er) characteristics and farm management. Our study corroborates earlier evidence that most farms were not or only slightly affected by the first wave(s) of the pandemic in 2020, and that impacts varied widely by study region. However, a significant minority of farmers across Europe reported that the pandemic was “the worst crisis in a lifetime” (3%) or “the worst crisis in a decade” (7%). Statistical analysis showed that more specialized and intensive farms were more likely to have perceived negative impacts. From a societal perspective, this suggests that highly specialized, intensive farms face higher vulnerability to shocks that affect regional to global supply chains. Supporting farmers in the diversification of their production systems while decreasing dependence on service suppliers and supply chain actors may increase their robustness to future disruptions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract European dairy production faces significant economic, environmental, and social sustainability challenges. Given the great diversity of dairy cattle production systems in Europe, region-specific concepts to improve environmental and socioeconomic sustainability are needed. Regionally integrated dairy cattle-crop systems emerge as a more resilient and sustainable alternative to highly specialized farming systems. Identifying different dairy cattle production typologies and their potential interactions with fodder crop production is presented as a step in transitioning to optimized agricultural systems. Currently existing typologies of integrated systems are often insufficient when characterizing structural, socioeconomic, and environmental components of farms. We fill this gap in the literature by identifying, describing, and comparing representative dairy cattle production system typologies and their interrelation with regional fodder crop production at the European regional scale. This is a necessary step to assess the scope for adapted mitigation and sustainability measures in the future. For this purpose, a multivariate statistical approach is applied. We show how different land-use practices, farm structure characteristics, socio-economic attributes, and emission intensities condition dairy production. Furthermore, the diversity of regional fodder crop production systems is demonstrated by analyzing their distribution in Europe. Together with identified typologies, varying degrees of regional specialization in milk production allow for identifying future strategies associated with the application of integrated systems in key European dairy regions. This study contributes to a better understanding of the existing milk production diversity in Europe and their relationship with regional fodder crop production. In addition, we discuss the benefits of integrated systems as a clear, viable, and resilient alternative to ongoing livestock intensification in the European context. Identifying interactions between components of integrated systems will facilitate decision-making, the design and implementation of measures to mitigate climate change, and the promotion of positive socio-economic and environmental interactions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the recent past, pulse crops have become increasingly important to agricultural producers as they contribute significantly to the economy. However, the research surrounding the economics of pulse crops is limited. This study determined the net returns and risks of 14 different rotations with various frequencies and sequences of pulse crops and quantified the long-term economic effects. An 8-year field experiment (two 4-year rotation cycles) was carried out at Swift Current, Saskatchewan, and Brooks, Alberta, Canada, during 2010–2019. The crops in the rotation included spring and durum wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) (W), field pea ( Pisum sativum L.) (P), chickpea ( Cicer arietinum L.) (C), lentil ( Lens culinaris Medik) (L), and Oriental mustard ( Brassica juncea L.) (M). Net revenue was estimated and a simulation model was used to conduct the risk-return analysis. Net revenue was significantly different among the 14 rotations, where rotations with either high frequencies of lentil or diverse crops generated the highest net income. More diverse rotations such as P-M-L-W or L-C-P-W provided net income that were statistically comparable to the L-L-L-W rotation and were significantly greater than wheat monoculture systems. Risk analysis suggested that neutral or slightly risk averse producers may select rotations with higher frequencies of lentils, whereas more risk averse producers may prefer more diverse rotations. Inclusion of pulses in a rotation as preceding crops had a positive economic impact on the following non-pulse crops and reduced nitrogen cost by 37%, which can lead to a low carbon footprint. Long-term studies with comprehensive datasets are rare and here for the first time we had two full 4-year cycles of experimental data for 14 diverse rotations at three sites, enabling us to make sound conclusions—adopting diverse cropping rotations that include pulses, especially lentil, can reduce economic risks and improve farm profitability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Organic agriculture and organic food have expanded in recent decades but have undergone conventionalisation. Some claim that this contradicts some or all of the principles of ‘health’, ‘ecology’, ‘fairness’ and ‘care’ established by the International Federation of Organic Agricultural Movement (IFOAM). It is currently unclear how research on organic food/agriculture is structured, whether it embraces these principles, or how key crop diversification, driving sustainability, are addressed. To fill these knowledge gaps, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of 10,030 peer-reviewed articles published from 1945 to 2021 with topic and textual analysis. Our main findings were the following: (1) research is compartmentalised into scales and disciplines, with at field-scale ‘weed’, ‘soil’, ‘pest and disease’ management and ‘livestock farming’ seldom addressed together, or with environmental assessment separated from socioeconomic studies at farm scale. (2) The proportion of publications on ‘consumers’ preferences’ and ‘product quality’ research almost tripled in 20 years, from 10 to 27%, emphasizing the consumer orientation of research on organic agriculture and organic food. (3) Only 4% of articles covered all four IFOAM principles, while associated values such as ‘resilience’, ‘integrity’, ‘equity’, ‘transparency’ and ‘justice’ were even less frequently addressed. (4) Fewer diversification practices have been tested in organic than in conventional agriculture research, with fewer articles on ‘crop mixtures’ or ‘bee-friendly crops’ and a smaller range of legumes considered. (5) Research on genetic improvement and processing of organic legumes is lacking, which could constrain adoption of legumes in organic farming even more than in conventional agriculture. These results indicate a need for increasing interdisciplinary efforts at field level, with systematic measurement of multiple processes (weed-nutrient-pest dynamics). Future studies on organic agriculture should combine several diversification practices and legumes, with relevant indicators addressing the IFOAM values explicitly, and consider the whole value chain by linking producers with consumers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Livestock production is central to the livelihoods of smallholder farmers in low- and middle-income countries, but livestock are often poorly fed which limits their potential for reducing poverty. Efforts to improve livestock nutrition are often driven by supply-push thinking and fail to engage meaningfully with farmers and the realities they face. The Feed Assessment Tool (FEAST) was developed as a way of involving farmers more closely in decision making on livestock feed improvement. FEAST is a participatory tool which uses focus group discussions and individual farmer interviews to develop a broad overview of the livestock farming system. FEAST has been applied in many countries in the last 10 years. Examples of intensive use come from the Accelerated Value Chain Development Project in Kenya and the Rwanda Dairy Development Project in Rwanda. In both cases the tool was used to inform feed options with strong input from farmers. Although the primary purpose of FEAST is to support improved feed strategies at farm level, the data collected through the FEAST app and published in FEAST reports are a rich information resource that can be useful for developing broader system-level understanding of livestock feed issues. FEAST data can be uploaded into a global data repository where they are available for researchers. These data are also used to generate visualizations of key feed metrics further extending the use of secondary data. FEAST is an example of a participatory tool that moves decision making in the direction of farmers, while providing insights to researchers working across farming systems. Its widespread use across many countries is an indication that it fills a gap in in the livestock feed development space. Its novelty lies in bridging the knowledge gap (both ways) between livestock researchers and small-scale livestock keepers.",

    "abstract": "Early energy analyses of agriculture revealed that behind higher labor and land productivity of industrial farming, there was a decrease in energy returns on energy (EROI) invested, in comparison to more traditional organic agricultural systems. Studies on recent trends show that efficiency gains in production and use of inputs have again somewhat improved energy returns. However, most of these agricultural energy studies have focused only on external inputs at the crop level, concealing the important role of internal biomass flows that livestock and forestry recirculate within agroecosystems. Here, we synthesize the results of 82 farm systems in North America and Europe from 1830 to 2012 that for the first time show the changing energy profiles of agroecosystems, including livestock and forestry, with a multi-EROI approach that accounts for the energy returns on external inputs, on internal biomass reuses, and on all inputs invested. With this historical circular bioeconomic approach, we found a general trend towards much lower external returns, little or no increases in internal returns, and almost no improvement in total returns. This \"energy trap\" was driven by shifts towards a growing dependence of crop production on fossil-fueled external inputs, much more intensive livestock production based on feed grains, less forestry, and a structural disintegration of agroecosystem components by increasingly linear industrial farm managements. We conclude that overcoming the energy trap requires nature-based solutions to reduce current dependence on fossil-fueled external industrial inputs and increase the circularity and complexity of agroecosystems to provide healthier diets with less animal products.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13593-023-00925-5.",

    "abstract": "Land degradation, population growth, and chronic poverty in Eastern and Southern Africa challenge the sustainability of livelihoods for smallholder farmers. These farmers often manage soils depleted of nutrients, apply limited amounts of mineral fertilizer, and take decisions about their cropping systems that involve multiple trade-offs. The rotation of cereals with legumes bears agronomic and ecological merit; however, the socio-economic implications of the cereal-legume rotation require a deeper understanding. This study explores the yield, labor, profit, and risk implications of different legume and mineral fertilizer practices in maize-based cropping systems in central Malawi. Our method involves coupling crop modeling and an agricultural household survey with a socio-economic analysis. We use a process-based cropping systems model to simulate the yield effects of integrating legumes into maize monocultures and applying mineral fertilizer over multiple seasons. We combine the simulated yields with socio-economic data from an agricultural household survey to calculate indicators of cropping-system performance. Our results show that a maize-groundnut rotation increases average economic profits by 75% compared with maize monoculture that uses more mineral fertilizer than in the rotation. The maize-groundnut rotation increases the stability of profits, reduces the likelihood of negative profits, and increases risk-adjusted profits. In contrast, the maize-groundnut rotation has a 54% lower average caloric yield and uses more labor than the maize monoculture with mineral fertilization. By comparing labor requirements with labor supply at the household scale, we show for the first time that the additional labor requirements of the maize-groundnut rotation can increase the likelihood of experiencing a labor shortage, if this rotation is undertaken by farm households in central Malawi. We demonstrate that risk and labor factors can be important when examining trade-offs among alternative cropping systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Facing the challenge of the ecological transition of agriculture, biodiversity opens new avenues to enhance ecological interactions and reduce chemical input dependency. Designing biodiversity-based agrosystems requires an agroecological approach that combines key principles: exploring a wide range of concepts and solutions, adopting systemic reasoning, implementing a site-specific approach, developing an action-oriented process, and maintaining a continuous improvement dynamic. This type of approach has never been developed to harness mycorrhizal fungi, which are key components of soil biodiversity, because their beneficial action on crops depends on complex and underexploited ecological interactions. At present, mycorrhizae are mainly used through industrial inoculants that fit within the productionist paradigm. To shift toward agroecological approaches, we implemented a methodological framework conceived to better address the design of mycorrhiza-friendly cropping systems by sharing knowledge with farmers in four different study areas (Provence, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, and Martinique). This framework includes participative workshops, a board game, and prospective exercises to collect farmers’ proposals and the factors that prevent from implementing mycorrhiza-friendly cropping systems. We showed that 90% of the farmers proposed alternatives to industrial inoculants, 50% of them adopted systemic reasoning by combining these alternative proposals. Most farmers understood that they were all potential “mycorrhizae producers”. We showed, for the first time through on-farm experiments that valorization of indigenous mycorrhizal fungi strains using a donor plant is an effective practice to increase root colonization before planting (up to a frequency of 95% and an intensity of 32%). Considering the increasing supply of mycorrhizal inoculants and despite the uncertainty of related knowledge, we codesigned innovative practices. Learning communities (technical advisors, high school teachers, etc.) assumed responsibility for continuous improvement in knowledge and practices. Finally, beyond the issue of mycorrhizae, we showed that an agroecological approach could bring stakeholders one step further into the design of biodiversity-based agrosystems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Perennial grain crops are gaining increased attention from researchers as one possible solution to agriculture’s many sustainability challenges. In the Sub-Saharan African context, perennial varieties of crops such as sorghum, rice, and pigeon pea have potential to provide numerous benefits for smallholder farmers. The introduction and adoption of new crops and practices is however a complex process that needs to be approached from an interdisciplinary and participatory perspective. We here review the small but growing body of knowledge about on-farm adoption and the use of perennial grains around the world, as well as the more extensive literature of farming systems research. We conclude that a farming systems approach offers a fruitful entry point for informing the emerging research agenda around perennial grains in African smallholder agriculture. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of the potentials and challenges of perennial grains also requires cross-scalar analysis capable of looking beyond the farming system. We thus outline five key considerations for developing and studying new perennial grains in smallholder contexts, i.e., (1) smallholder farming systems are complex, diverse, and locally adapted; (2) decision-making is shaped by various resource constraints; (3) farming is often “semi-subsistence” and forms part of broader livelihood strategies, wherein risk is an important factor; (4) gender relations and roles influence many aspects of smallholder farming systems; and (5) analyses of farmers’ production systems, decision-making, and livelihood strategies must be embedded within a broader political-economic context. Based on these considerations, we suggest directions and examples of key questions for future research and derive methodological implications for how such research could be approached.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Intervening into agricultural systems necessarily includes risks, uncertainties, and ultimately unknown outcomes. Decision analysis embraces uncertainty through an interdisciplinary approach that involves relevant stakeholders in evaluating complex decisions. We applied decision analysis approaches to prioritize 21 farm management interventions, which could be considered in certification schemes for banana production. We estimated their contribution to climate change adaptation and mitigation as well as ecological outcomes. We used a general model that estimated the impacts of each intervention on adaptation (benefits minus costs), mitigation (global warming potential), ecological parameters (e.g., biodiversity and water and soil quality), and farming aspects (e.g., yield, implementation costs and production risks). We used expert and documented knowledge and presented uncertainties in the form of 90% confidence intervals to feed the model and forecast the changes in system outcomes caused by each intervention compared to a baseline scenario without the measure. By iterating the model function 10,000 times, we obtained probability distributions for each of the outcomes and farm management interventions. Our results suggest that interventions associated with nutrient management (e.g., composting and nutrient management plan) positively affect climate change adaptation, mitigation, and ecological aspects. Measures with no direct yield benefits (e.g., plastic reduction) correlate negatively with adaptation but have positive impacts on ecology. Creating buffer zones and converting low-productivity farmland (incl. unused land) also have positive ecological and adaptation outcomes. Decision analysis can help in prioritizing farm management interventions, which may vary considerably in their relationship with the expected outcomes. Additional work may be required to elaborate a comprehensive assessment of the underlying aspects modulating the impacts of a given measure on the evaluated outcome. Our analysis provides insights on the most promising interventions for banana plantations and may help practitioners and researchers in focusing further studies.",

Growing winter cereals on perennial legume living mulch such as white clover ( Trifolium repens L.) or lucerne ( Medicago sativa L.) is one of several options to reduce the need for mineral nitrogen fertilizer and herbicides in winter cereal production. Given the importance of winter cereals in the world, adopting this technique could greatly improve the sustainability of crop production. Through competition with the crop however, the living mulch can negatively affect cereal yield. Here, we (i) review how living mulch can be introduced in the system, (ii) synthetize potential advantages and disadvantages of that system, and (iii) explore different strategies to control the competition between the crop and living mulch. The major findings are that (i) competition between cereals and mulch can lead to significant yield reductions if not controlled properly and (ii) perennial legume varieties used as living mulch so far are varieties bred for forage production. We hypothesize that a dedicated breeding program might lead to living mulch varieties with a smaller impact on cereal yield compared to forage varieties, allowing to grow cereals with reduced nitrogen and herbicide inputs. We propose the main characteristics of an ideotype for such a perennial legume variety.",

    "abstract": "This study is based on the observation that many digital tools and services for agriculture do not put farmers' expectations and interests first, resulting in top-down research and development. On-Farm Experimentation (OFE) contributes to overcoming these limitations because it places farmers at the center of innovation processes, while ensuring rich interactions with various value chain actors. The richness of OFE is in part explained by the diversity of stakeholders involved and the co-learning that results from their interactions. Studies in management and social sciences show that such open innovation processes can be difficult to manage. Aligning the visions and interests of the different stakeholders, fostering the sharing of resources and knowledge to produce value, and sharing the value created in an equitable manner remain a real challenge. Although these issues can refine the understanding of the mechanisms that condition the success of OFE, they have yet to be sufficiently analyzed. Recent publications underline the need to explore the organizational and managerial aspects of OFE to facilitate its implementation in various contexts. This work proposes to fill this gap by providing ten key lessons for conducting OFE with the aim of creating shared value, i.e., developing innovative technologies and practices that benefit all parties but, first and foremost, farmers. These ten key lessons stem from the reflexive monitoring of an OFE process aimed at developing the SoYield® decision support system for helping mango value chain actors to estimate fruit production in Africa. This reflexive monitoring was conducted by the main actors involved in this process, namely, farmers, a private firm and research centers. These key lessons lay the foundations for strengthening a community of practice on OFE implementation and for facilitating its development worldwide. This study also provides insights into the contributions and limitations of digital tools for conducting OFE.",

    "abstract": "Abstract There is an urgent need for agriculture in general, and for viticulture in particular, to reduce their impacts on the environment. Doing so requires an approach that supports transitioning to more environmentally friendly practices. Involving farmers and agricultural advisors is key to lifting technical, economic, and social barriers to this transition. Participatory methods can help to consider specific contexts and concerns, but few suitable tools are available. We developed a methodological framework to address both environmental and economic dimensions at the field and farm scales in three participatory ecodesign workshops with winegrowers. We applied our framework to the ecodesign of pathways of technical operations in the Middle Loire Valley, France. The first two workshops focused on the field scale, and group interactions were facilitated using a serious game and a “live” assessment of the environmental performance of the ecodesigned system. The third workshop focused on implementation at farm level. The aggregated environmental impact of the ecodesigned farm decreased by 4%, while the economic performance of its four pathways of technical operations improved. We showed that combining environmental and economic assessment tools, suitable for use in participatory workshops, addresses most mechanisms for and barriers to changing practices at the farm scale. The typology of activities at the farm scale allows farm characteristics and the diversity of production systems to be represented in the ecodesign without over-complicating the process. The use of farm maps takes advantage of the collective expertise of the group and increases participant involvement. This process highlighted the need to continue to extend the scope and criteria of ecodesign to decrease environmental impacts even more. Here, we show for the first time the need to quantify the influence of a farm’s environmental practices on its economic performance to reduce the perception of risk and facilitate adoption of these practices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The challenges of soil degradation and low crop yield are being addressed in East Africa using a number of soil health-promoting farming systems including Conservation Agriculture (CA). CA is based on principles of minimal soil disturbance, continuous soil cover, and crop diversity, though implementation on farms may vary due to local circumstances. This study evaluated the effect of CA, as practiced by farmers, and compared farmer descriptions of soil health with scientific measures. CA and non-CA fields were compared in regions of Ethiopia (23 farms), Kenya (23 farms), and Tanzania (13 farms) with most fields repeatedly sampled for 2 to 3 years. CA and non-CA fields were located within meters, on soils with the same texture, growing similar crops. CA systems used precision planting, mostly with basins. Soil parameters were assessed using a participatory approach where farmers and field technicians collected data. CA practices improved qualitative soil characteristics as sensed by farmers (e.g., hoe-ability, crusting, smell, water infiltration), and this positive response was consistent across most fields. For qualitative data, the logarithm of the odds ratio estimates method was used to test the probability that CA would provide soil improvement. Fields under the CA treatment had a higher probability of rating better than non-CA fields. Quantitative measurements of pH and microbial respiration validated farmer assessments. CA-managed soils were weakly associated with darker colour, indicating higher soil organic matter. Sandy soils did not appear to improve with CA as dramatically as clay and loam soils, suggesting different CA strategies may be required. We discuss both benefits and drawbacks of this type of participatory, on-farm research. We conclude that farmer participation as citizen scientists will advance soil restoration in East Africa and increase the potential for farmer-to-farmer knowledge exchange of soil-improving practices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Factors affecting fertilizer decisions made by grain growers are changing in the context of changing climatic conditions and growing volatility in global fertilizer and grain markets. To ensure sustainable development of grain industries in light of this uncertainty, research, development, extension, and adoption activities associated with growers’ fertilizer decisions need to be focused on factors to which they are most sensitive. The aim of this paper is to understand the factors that have the greatest influence on grain producer’s fertilizer strategies, how these factors have changed over recent years, and what is the relative importance of agronomic, socioeconomic, and logistical factors affecting these strategies. A telephone survey of 425 grain-growing businesses in Western Australia was conducted, and survey results were analyzed statistically. We show for the first time that grain growers’ fertilizer decisions are most sensitive to agronomic factors (especially the amount and distribution of rainfall). Logistic factors (such as difficulties fertilizing increasing areas in short periods of time) are growing in influence as farm size, cropping areas, and the number of fertilizer applications within seasons increase. Fertilizer decisions have become less sensitive to socioeconomic factors over the last 10 to 15 years. To ensure sustainable development of grain production, research through to adoption activities should focus on agronomic issues (such as seasonal forecasting) and logistic issues (such as improving planning, organizational, and technical capacity for developing and implementing fertilizer strategies).",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the French West Indies, and particularly in Guadeloupe, agricultural policies mainly support the banana and sugarcane export sectors. However, driven by consumer demand, policy-makers are increasingly interested in developing local and agroecological food systems. Plantain ( Musa spp., AAB), cultivated by a wide range of farmers, plays a key role in the diversification of local production and food systems, contributing to food security. However, important gaps in knowledge about plantain cropping systems are hindering the understanding of their contribution to the agroecological transition of farms. Farmers are also requesting more guidance from technical advisers and research. The aim of the work, presented in this article, was to co-design agroecological plantain cropping systems with farmers in order to fill this knowledge gap and to support local food systems. The co-design process was based on the characterization of the diversity of plantain farming systems, the evaluation of changes in practices implemented between 2017 and 2019, and the co-design of a system experiment. We identified six types of plantain farming systems defined by the role of plantain in the production strategy of the farm and a gradient of agroecology in plantain management practices. Our results also show progress toward agroecology between 2017 and 2019. Four innovative plantain cropping systems were designed based on a combination of existing knowledge held by farmers from the six types of farming systems. These results confirm that plantain cropping systems are contributing to the agroecological transition of farms in Guadeloupe and highlight that there are multiple possible agroecological transition pathways for plantain farmers. These results also provide a concrete example of integration of academic and non-academic knowledge for the co-design of agroecological systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The management of climate-resilient grassland systems is important for stable livestock fodder production. In the face of climate change, maintaining productivity while minimizing yield variance of grassland systems is increasingly challenging. To achieve climate-resilient and stable productivity of grasslands, a better understanding of the climatic drivers of long-term trends in yield variance and its dependence on agronomic inputs is required. Based on the Park Grass Experiment at Rothamsted (UK), we report for the first time the long-term trends in yield variance of grassland (1965–2018) in plots given different fertilizer and lime applications, with contrasting productivity and plant species diversity. We implemented a statistical model that allowed yield variance to be determined independently of yield level. Environmental abiotic covariates were included in a novel criss-cross regression approach to determine climatic drivers of yield variance and its dependence on agronomic management. Our findings highlight that sufficient liming and moderate fertilization can reduce yield variance while maintaining productivity and limiting loss of plant species diversity. Plots receiving the highest rate of nitrogen fertilizer or farmyard manure had the highest yield but were also more responsive to environmental variability and had less plant species diversity. We identified the days of water stress from March to October and temperature from July to August as the two main climatic drivers, explaining approximately one-third of the observed yield variance. These drivers helped explain consistent unimodal trends in yield variance—with a peak in approximately 1995, after which variance declined. Here, for the first time, we provide a novel statistical framework and a unique long-term dataset for understanding the trends in yield variance of managed grassland. The application of the criss-cross regression approach in other long-term agro-ecological trials could help identify climatic drivers of production risk and to derive agronomic strategies for improving the climate resilience of cropping systems.",

This study assesses the complex interrelations between external framework conditions such as climate change or adjustments in the agricultural price and subsidy schemes with farmers' decision-making. As social aspects remain understudied drivers for agricultural decisions, we also consider value-based characteristics of farmers as internal factors relevant for decision-making. We integrate individual learning as response to extreme weather events into an agent-based model that simulates farmers' decision-making. We applied the model to a region in Eastern Austria that already experiences water scarcity and increasing drought risk from climate change and simulated three future scenarios to compare the effects of changes in socio-economic and climatic conditions. In a cross-comparison, we then investigated how farmers can navigate these changes through individual adaptation. The agricultural trajectories project a decline of active farms between -27 and -37% accompanied by a reduction of agricultural area between -20 and -30% until 2053. The results show that regardless of the scenario conditions, adaptation through learning moderates the decline in the number of active farms and farmland compared to scenarios without adaptive learning. However, adaptation increases the workload of farmers. This highlights the need for labor support for farms.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13593-023-00890-z.",

This trend can also be observed in Quinoa production systems, where few varieties are commercialized while maintaining traditional varieties of quinoa remains a key agricultural activity in the high-Andes landscape. In recent decades, the “boom” of quinoa production has given rise to national projects intended to ensure that farmers benefit from their agricultural heritage, including the development of a collective trademark. However, little is known about the opinions of smallholder farmers regarding quinoa varieties cultivation, farming practices, market choices, or the development of a collective trademark as a tool to safeguard a position in the booming international quinoa market. To address these questions, we developed our research in three villages in the Puno region of Peru, quinoa’s center of origin. We applied a novel combination of participatory methods: the Q methodology to interpret the perceptions of smallholder quinoa farmers concerning the activities that are important on their farms, and the Four-Square Analysis workshops to explore quinoa biodiversity management. The results of our Q -analysis revealed three types of opinions emerging among farmers: (Type 1) Conservationist , (Type 2) Intensification sustainer , and (Type 3) Collaboration seeker . Type 1 assigns importance to maintaining and promoting quinoa biodiversity through collective practices and markets. Type 2 focuses on developing export-oriented production based on certified and improved varieties, combined with efficient ways of storing quinoa. Type 3 appears to value the collective aspects of organizations and cooperation among stakeholders. According to the results of the Four-Square Analysis, most landraces of quinoa are threatened by genetic erosion, as they are cultivated in situ in small plots and on few farms. Our results are an important baseline for further project development for biodiversity conservation in situ and market inclusion engaging local communities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The increasing human population and demand for animal food products raise the issue of impacts of animal systems on food security caused by their use of human-edible feed and/or tillable land. The utility of replacing animal systems with potential food-crop systems needs to be assessed but is associated with many uncertainties. Some metrics analyse the contribution of current animal systems to food security, especially the dimension of food availability. These methods address feed conversion efficiency (i.e. total (‘gross’) or human-edible (‘net’)) or the efficiency of agricultural land use (i.e. total, permanent grassland, and tillable land) but never both simultaneously. The purpose of this study was to develop a new metric—‘net productivity’—to represent the performances of current animal systems more accurately by considering both the use of human-edible feed and agricultural land. Through a protein assessment, we analysed the ability of the existing and the new metrics to assess the performances of 111 dairy farms in Wallonia (Belgium). We found that net productivity was positively correlated with both metrics of feed conversion efficiency and negatively correlated with the three metrics of land use. To analyse the influence of farm characteristics, we grouped the farms into four clusters using k -means clustering based on these metrics of contribution to food security and then performed redundancy analysis to select the most influential farm characteristics aiming to highlight contrasted farm strategies. The highest net productivity was reached by an ‘intensive and net efficient’ farm strategy, which had intensive grass-based management, high milk production per cow, appropriate use of concentrates, and well-managed dairy followers (i.e. replacement heifers and calves). The newly developed metric of net productivity can be useful to quantify the contribution of dairy systems to food security by considering both the use of human-edible protein and agricultural land simultaneously.",

For this purpose, a 3-year field experiment was initiated in northeast Italy involving a maize-soybean rotation. The objectives of this study were to (i) evaluate the use of time series vegetation indices (VIs) obtained from the Sentinel-2 satellite for monitoring the growth of CCs and estimating their biomass and N uptake at termination; (ii) investigate the effects of different CCs on cash crop yield and SWC; and (iii) use the simulation model CC-NCALC to predict the nitrogen contribution of CCs to subsequent cash crops. Three CC systems were tested: a fixed treatment with triticale; a 3-year succession of rye, crimson clover, and mustard; and a control with no CCs. Satellite imagery revealed that rye and triticale grew faster during the winter season than clover but slower compared to mustard, which suffered a frost winterkilling. Both grasses and mustard produced greater biomass at termination compared to clover, but none of the CC species affected SWC or yield and N uptake of the cash crop. A net N mineralization of all the CC residues was estimated by the model (except for the N immobilization after triticale roots residues). During the subsequent cash crop season, the estimated clover and mustard N released was around 33%, and the triticale around 3% of their total N uptake, with a release peak 2 months after their termination. The use of remote sensing imagery and a prediction model of CC residue decomposition showed potential to be used as instruments for optimizing the CCs utilization and enhancing cropping water and N fertilization management efficiency; however, it must be further analyzed with other CCs species, environmental conditions, and cropping systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Integrated crop-livestock systems (ICLS) are more complex to properly manage than specialized farming systems due to multiple interactions between crops, livestock, and grassland. Despite individual and structural barriers to adopting sustainable ICLS, some innovative producers have successfully conducted integrated production practices. In this context, a research gap exists in understanding the motivations and incentives for transitioning to such systems. This study aims to address ICLS adoption barriers by analyzing the trajectory, achievements, and thought processes of 15 producers practicing ICLS. Our objectives were to (1) highlight producers’ perceptions of ICLS levers and barriers and (2) identify turning point factors that enabled producers to overcome the barriers. We used a unique set of cases in three continental regions (southern Brazil, the northern Great Plains region in the United States, and southern France) and conducted semi-structured interviews. Interviewees emphasized that ICLS imply dealing with barriers ranging from mindset change to operational adaptations, but they also emphasized the rewarding nature of ICLS when properly managed. All their trajectories had important turning points, such as programs or initiatives, human influence, and broader social and economic reasons that resulted in shifts in their production practices and thought processes. The cases also highlighted that integrating crops and livestock positively impacted family producers’ business outcomes, soil health, and livelihood options. Still, individual barriers, including operational management, and structural barriers, including stakeholder awareness and commitment, must be overcome. Encouraging initiatives that offer a systemic approach and promote knowledge exchange can address part of ICLS adoption barriers. Initiatives must embrace a broader innovation ecosystem, having extension teams in close contact with researchers and stakeholders to assist producers in providing support for a more sophisticated level of management that ICLS require. Overall, we found commonalities in consciousness and proactiveness in remarkable cases that could inspire broader sustainability transitions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Sustainable food production for a growing world population will pose a central challenge in the coming decades. Organic farming is among the feasible approaches to achieving this goal if the yield gap to conventional farming can be decreased. However, uncertainties exist to which extend—and for which phenotypes in particular—organic and conventional agro-ecosystems require differentiated breeding strategies. To answer this question, a heterogeneous spring barley population was established between a wild barley and an elite cultivar to examine this question. This initial population was divided into two sets and sown one in organic and the other in conventional managed agro-ecosystems, without any artificial selection for two decades. A fraction of seeds harvested each year was sown the following year. Various generations, up to the 23th were whole-genome pool-sequenced to identify adaptation patterns towards ecosystem and climate conditions in the allele frequency shifts. Additionally, a meta-data analysis was conducted to link genomic regions’ increased fitness to agronomically related traits. This long-term experiment highlights for the first time that allele frequency pattern difference between the conventional and organic populations grew with subsequent generations. Further, the organic-adapted population showed a higher genetic heterogeneity. The data indicate that adaptations towards new environments happen in few generations. Drastic interannual changes in climate are manifested in significant allele frequency changes. Particular wild form alleles were positively selected in both environments. Clustering these revealed an increased fitness associated with biotic stress resistance, yield physiology, and yield components in both systems. Additionally, the introduced wild alleles showed increased fitness related to root morphology, developmental processes, and abiotic stress responses in the organic agro-ecosystem. Concluding the genetic analysis, we demonstrate that breeding of organically adapted varieties should be conducted in an organically managed agro-ecosystem, focusing on root-related traits, to close the yield gap towards conventional farming.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The perennial grain intermediate wheatgrass ( Thinopyrum intermedium , commercial name Kernza TM ) has been proposed as a diversification crop for producing forage and grain and providing ecosystem services to farmers. Although a few studies have addressed farmers’ interests in the crop, information is lacking about the links between farmers’ goals and crop management, i.e., how farmers aim at integrating this crop in their systems. Closing this gap, this paper analyzes for the first time the introduction of intermediate wheatgrass (IWG) from a farmer perspective, as a set of decision plans and goals. The overarching orientations of the farm and organization of the production system, referred as strategic decisions, interact with short-term crop management (i.e., tactical decisions) and farmers’ goals for IWG. In total, 17 individual semi-structured interviews and 2 collective crop management prototyping workshops in France were used to analyze farmers’ rationales as a function of their farm systems, agronomic constraints, and know-how. The study demonstrates that farmers’ interests in IWG revolved around multiple ecosystem services and financial returns. Three ideal-types of farms testing IWG emerged from the relationships between existing farming systems and goals for IWG. The strategic and tactical decisions regarding the integration and management of IWG were contingent on the farming systems, the goals for IWG, the farmers’ know-how, and their ability to mitigate risks. Implications for the future development of intermediate wheatgrass as a niche innovation are considered based on farmers’ points of view. This study provides insights into the ideas and concerns of French farmers regarding IWG and proposes a framework for discussing the introduction of a new crop in a farm system.",

    "abstract": "Plant breeders' knowledge of precise traits preferred by variety users would accelerate varietal turnover and widen adoption of newly developed maize varieties in Ghana. The objective of this research was to provide empirical evidence of trait preferences of farmers and other actors in the maize value chain in northern Ghana, based on which research strategies for maize improvement could be formulated. Participatory rural appraisal was conducted in 2016 to determine key traits preferred by maize value chain actors across the three regions in northern Ghana. A total of 279 maize value chain actors were interviewed. Different scoring and ranking techniques were used to assess the maize traits preferred by the different actors. Participatory variety selection trials were also conducted in the Tolon, West Gonja, Binduri, and Sissala East districts in northern Ghana from 2014 to 2016. The mother-baby trial approach was used to evaluate eight hybrids with 3000 farmers. Data on yield and agronomic performance of the hybrids and farmer's selection criteria were collected. Data analyses were performed using GenStat Edition 16 and SPSS Edition 20 statistical packages. The participatory rural appraisal method identified farmers, input dealers, traders, and processors as the primary maize value chain actors in the study areas. Trait preferences of the different actors overlapped and revolved around grain quality including nutritional value, and stress tolerance and grain yield. Results of the participatory variety selection study revealed that across districts, farmers preferred high-yielding varieties with multiple cobs per plant, white grain endosperm color, and bigger and fully filled cobs. For the first time, our holistic assessment of the trait preferences of key actors of the maize value chain in northern Ghana revealed a comprehensive list of traits, which could be used by breeders to develop varieties that may be preferred by all value chain actors in northern Ghana.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13593-021-00708-w.",

    "abstract": "Most studies on climate change's impacts on agriculture focus on modeling techniques based on large-scale meteorological data, while few have investigated how farmer's perception of climate change's impacts can affect crop diversity and crop management practices, especially in industrialized contexts. To fill this gap, we conducted 24 semi-structured interviews in a study site located in the Catalan Pyrenees. Our results show for the first time in an industrialized context that farmers perceive multiple interrelated climate change impacts on local agroecosystems. For instance, snowfall and freeze events have decreased, which respondents associated with the increase of pests and diseases affecting both wild flora and cultivated plants. Similarly, changes in precipitation patterns lead to a perceived decrease in useful rain for agriculture. Farmers are also reporting changes in their management practices, such as increased irrigation or use of pesticides, which respond to these climatic factors but also to changes in the crops that are cultivated. Crop diversity is in decline in the area both at the species and landrace levels, especially in rainfed fields. This is mainly driven by socioeconomic factors such as agricultural abandonment or access to commercial seeds, although climate change factors such as increased pests or decreased rainfall can have an impact. Despite the crop diversity losses found, many landraces have been maintained, mainly due to their cultural value, and also new crop species have been introduced, which are now viable due to the increase in temperature. Although we focused on a specific case study, we found several trends that are also present in other contexts. Therefore, the results of this research are relevant at a global scale since they show that climate change is affecting mountain agroecosystems in industrialized contexts and may affect more drastically both agrobiodiversity and crop management practices in agroecosystems worldwide.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13593-022-00806-3.",

    "abstract": "Organic livestock farming can help to make agroecosystems more sustainable. We hypothesized, however, that not all organic farm management models contribute in the same way. One way to assess this is to perform energy analyses of livestock farms, establishing not only how efficient the systems are at producing goods and services for society, but also the investment in the fund elements that sustain the system itself and its environmental sustainability. But to be effective, such studies must go beyond a classic input-output analysis: they must also address the internal energy flows that maintain the quality of agroecosystem fund elements as well as some ecosystem services they provide. In the present work, we implemented the energy return on investment methodology and combined classic economic energy indicators with new agroecological measurements that allow to assess the quality of agroecosystem fund elements. We applied these agroecological energy indicators to organic pig and beef cattle farms with the aim of differentiating the organic forms of management that best contribute to sustainability. This is the first time that this methodology has been applied on pig farms. Based on this methodology, we identified five management models of organic beef and pork production in Mediterranean systems that presented different degrees of sustainability. The most efficient and environmentally sustainable model was the breeding of beef cattle/pigs in agrosilvopastoral dehesa pasturelands. These dehesa systems include farms that are highly self-sufficient in terms of animal feed as well as farms that import certain feed stuffs because they fatten animals until slaughter. It was the breed together with the stocking densities that conditioned livestock functionality more than the livestock species orientation. The results allowed us to distinguish the various forms of organic livestock management implemented and their degree of sustainability, thus providing public policy orientations on the most efficient models.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Wheat cultivar mixtures provide a more complex and functional cropping system than monocultures. Their functionality may result in the delivery of agroecosystem services. However, research on cultivar mixture performance has mainly been done in controlled environments. Greenhouses and laboratory experiments do not account for environmental or agronomic factors that may influence the polyculture’s functionality. To fill this research gap, we set up a novel strip-split-block experimental design with three factors (wheat treatment, tillage, and fertilization) in a field long-term trial. We assessed the performance of the modern wheat cultivar Florence-Aurora and the traditional cultivars Xeixa ( Triticum aestivum L. subsp. aestivum ) and Forment ( Triticum turgidum L. subsp. durum ) monocultures and their mixture in providing aphid and weed control and promoting crop yield under contrasting tillage practices (moldboard ploughing vs. chisel ploughing) and fertilization (farmyard manure applied or not applied). We analyzed aphid abundance, number of aphids per tiller, parasitism rate, weed abundance and richness, and crop yield. Additionally, we examined wheat establishment, cover, phenology, and height for cultivar characterization. We observed that soil management practices affected some aspects of the cropping system. The wheat cultivars differed in their aphid susceptibility and weed suppression ability, with Florence-Aurora being less suppressant to weeds and more prone to aphid infestation. Most remarkably, our study shows for the first time that mixing wheat cultivars with distinguished traits enhances associational resistance for aphid and weed control. These benefits were specifically important under high weed infestations generated by reduced tillage. Moreover, the yield of Florence-Aurora monoculture and the mixture was found to be influenced by tillage and fertilization. Our study underscores how soil management practices impact the functionality of cultivar mixtures. This emphasizes the need for further field research to better understand the complexity of farming conditions that influence the delivery of agroecosystem services by cultivar mixtures.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Contextualization of generic scientific knowledge to context-specific farmer knowledge is a necessary step in farmers’ innovation process, and it can be achieved using crop and farm models. This work explores the possibility to simulate a large number of scenarios based on farmers’ descriptions of their environment and practices in order to contextualize the discussion for each participating farmer. It presents a novel framework consisting of six actions divided in three phases, namely, phase I—reaching out to the farmers’ world: (i) project initialization; (ii) determination of the agronomical question anchored in farmers’ context; (iii) characterization of the environment, the management options, and the indicators to describe the system under consideration; phase II—within researchers’ world: (iv) crop model parametrization; (v) translation of model outputs into farmer-proposed indicators; and phase III—back to farmers’ world: (vi) exploration of contextualized management options with farmers. Two communication tools are created during the process, one containing the results of simulations to feed the discussions and a second one to create a record of it. The usefulness of the framework is exemplified with the exploration of soil fertility management with manure and compost applications for sorghum production in the smallholder context of Sudano-Sahelian Burkina Faso. The application of the framework with 15 farmers provided evidence of farmers’ and agronomists’ understanding of options to improve cropping system performance with better organic amendment management. This approach allowed farmers to identify and relate to the scenarios simulated, but highlighted interrogations on how to adapt the crop model outputs to particular situations. Though applied on issues related to tactical change at field level, the framework offers the opportunity to explore broader issues with farmers, such as farm reconfiguration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Climate change-driven extreme events are reducing barley productivity. The high use of mineral fertilizers, combined with low nutrient use efficiency, leads to environmental and economic concerns. Indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) inoculants offer a sustainable alternative, especially in intensive farming systems where AM colonization and diversity are low. However, poor adaptation to local conditions limits inoculant success. Few studies have tested indigenous AMF inoculated on field crops, with limited research on barley. No research has yet explored how barley genotype and environment modulate field inoculation outcomes in terms of crop productivity. Key factors such as AM fungal abundance and community structure shifts remain unidentified. This study evaluated the agroecological effects of an indigenous AM fungal consortium on three barley varieties (Atlante, Atomo, and Concerto) over 2 years. In 2020, Atomo and Concerto responded positively to inoculation in terms of root colonization, with grain yield increases of 64% and 37%, respectively. In 2021, only Concerto showed enhanced root colonization, while grain yield increased by 78% in Concerto and 134% in Atlante. Multivariate analysis revealed a strong impact of environment on barley productivity, with a significant third-order interaction among AMF, genotype, and environment. Inoculation slightly altered AM composition but strongly influenced community structure, particularly at different plant growth stages. Root colonization was strongly correlated with barley productivity, with root length containing arbuscules being the best predictor. Changes in the AM community structure, rather than composition, drove barley response, with Glomus and Septoglomus , present in the inoculum, being main players. These findings support the use of indigenous AMF for sustainable biofertilization and highlight the importance of selecting genotypes with a stable AM response across environments. Our results disclose for the first time the role of barley genotype and plant growth stage on AM host preference with and without indigenous AM fungal inoculants.",

Apart from the seedball technology, which targets majorly early phosphorus supply to the plants, the recommended practices of mineral fertilization and seed treatments (coating and priming) are barely affordable to the local farmers in particular. In the case of female farmers, who usually have chemically infertile farmlands often located far away from their homestead, low pearl millet grain yield can be exacerbated. In quest for a cheap, affordable, and effective solution, we hypothesized that the application of sanitized human urine (Oga), in combination with organic manure (OM) or solely, increases pearl millet panicle yield in women’s fields and on different local soils. In on-farm large -N trials ( N = 681) with women farmers in two regions of Niger (Maradi, Tillabery), pearl millet panicle yields were compared between the control (farmer practice), and a combination of Oga and OM in the first and second year, and Oga alone in the third year. Our results showed an average panicle yield increase of about +30%, representing +200 to +300 kg ha −1 . Major factors determining the yield effect are season, village, and local soil type. This study shows for the first time that Oga innovation can be used to increase pearl millet panicle yield particularly in the low fertile soils of women’s farmlands in Niger. Oga innovation is affordable, locally available, and does not pose a risk to resource-poor female farmers of Niger.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV) causes severe rice ( Oryza sativa L.) yield loss. It has been endemic to sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar since 1966. Transmission (plant community level) and long-dispersal (regional and continental scale) models have been established but viral spread in farming communities continues, while the conditions causing local disease outbreaks remain unclear. We hypothesized that local outbreaks, comprising inter-plot virus spread and intra-plot disease aggravation, are significantly associated with individual farmers’ attributes and agronomic practices. To test this hypothesis, spatial autoregressive models were constructed using variables collected by visual observation and farmer interviews. Field surveys were conducted during four consecutive cropping seasons from 2011 to 2013 in the Lower Moshi Irrigation Scheme of Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. Our models detected spatial dependence in inter-plot virus spread, but not in intra-plot disease aggravation. The probability of inter-plot virus spread increased with use of the IR64 cultivar (26.9%), but decreased with straw removal (27.8%) and crop rotation (47.7%). The probability of intra-plot disease aggravation decreased with herbicide application (24.3%) and crop rotation (35.4%). A simple cost-benefit analysis suggested that inter-plot virus spread should be mitigated by cultivar replacement and straw removal. When disease severity is critical, intra-plot disease aggravation should be inhibited by herbicide application, and rice should be rotated with other crops. This is the first study to upscale the spatial autoregressive model from the experimental field level to the farming community level, by obtaining variables through easy-to-implement techniques such as visual observation and farmer interview. Our models successfully identified candidate agronomic practices for the control of RYMV. However, as the causal relationships between agronomic practices and RYMV outbreaks remain unknown, field trials are needed to develop robust control measures.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Carbon sequestration and storage in biomass is one of the most important measures to mitigate climate change. Mediterranean woody crops can sequestrate carbon in the biomass of their permanent structures for decades; however, very few studies have focused on an assessment of biomass and carbon sequestration in these types of crops. This study is the first to estimate above- and belowground biomass carbon stock in Mediterranean woody crops through a bottom-up approach in the NE Iberian Peninsula in 2013. Moreover, this is the first time that an assessment of the annual changes in carbon stock in the study area over a six-year period is presented. For this purpose, eight crop- and site-specific equations relating biomass or biometric variables to crop age were calculated. Most of the data were our own measurements, but unpublished data supplied from other authors as well as data from literature were also considered. Census of Agriculture data was used to scale results from individual data up to the municipality level at the regional scale. Results show that in woody cropland in NE Spain the total biomass carbon stock in 2013 was 5.48 Tg C, with an average value of 16.44 ± 0.18 Mg C ha −1 . Between 2013 and 2019, although there was a 2.8% mean annual decrease in the area covered by woody crops, the carbon stock in the biomass of these crops increased annually by 3.8% due to the growth of the remaining woody cropland. This new estimation of carbon stocks may contribute to better understand carbon balances and serve as a baseline to global inventories. It may also serve to assess and manage carbon storage as an ecosystem service provided by Mediterranean woody cropland for mitigating climate change and, in combination with adaptive strategies, for supporting a productive and resilient agro-food system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Soil organic matter (SOM) is important in maintaining soil fertility and other ecosystem functions. Yet, land management in intensive agriculture has caused SOM level to decrease, with knock-on effects for soil fertility and quality. Therefore, land management options that ensure that SOM is not depleted and that soil functions are better sustained are of increasing interest. However, there is limited knowledge on how different land managements affect the composition of SOM and associated microbial functional profiles. Twelve long-term field experiments, covering a wide range of climatic zones and soil types, were selected in Sweden. They focused on the role of combining ley in crop rotations with the manure application (livestock farm), as opposed to the management without ley and receiving only inorganic fertilizer (arable farm). In ten out of the 12 study sites, livestock farm management tended to have higher proportions of aliphatic and double bonded C groups, as estimated by mid-infrared spectroscopy. This was further confirmed by 13 C NMR analysis, which found greater proportions of O-alkyl and di-O-alkyl groups and less aromatic C in livestock farm than arable farm management in five of the eight sites analyzed. The changes in SOM composition were reflected in microbial functional profiles across many sites: soils from livestock farm management utilized more carbohydrates and amino acids, while polymer and aromatic compounds were associated with arable farm management. Overall, shifts in both microbial functional profiles and SOM composition showed great consistency across geographical and climatic zones. Livestock farm management maintained higher levels of microbial functional diversity and were associated with higher proportions of “reactive” C functional groups. Our investigation demonstrates that livestock farm management could maintain soil fertility over the long-term via the changes in SOM composition and the regulation of microbial functional profiles.",

    "abstract": "Abstract One of the key ways to improve the sustainability of agricultural systems is through diversification, taking advantage of synergies between farm enterprises. Among diversified systems, multispecies livestock farms with at least two animal enterprises have rarely been studied. We explored 95 organic farms from six countries, accounting for the proportion of animal enterprises, sales management, workforce size, and work organization. The study reveals various types of interactions between animal enterprises. Complementarities were observed between ruminant and monogastric enterprises, particularly fertilizer transfer from monogastric manure to grasslands. Milk production was often associated with on-farm processing and short distribution channels, which enhanced farm viability and reduced its dependency on herd productivity. Eleven out of the 95 farms combined above-average production efficiency, on-farm processing, and the majority of sales in short distribution channels. Their labor productivity converged toward 22 livestock units per annual work unit, regardless of the number of workers. Combining farm structure; livestock production efficiency; social elements, such as the workforce; and sales management led us to distinguish four types of farms: (i) small and very autonomous grassland farms with on-farm processing and short distribution channels; (ii) dairy farms associated with a high-density pig or poultry enterprise, whose feed purchase contributes to high rates of cattle feeding self-sufficiency and stocking rate; (iii) large farms with an extensive, grassland beef enterprise associated with either sheep or monogastrics; and (iv) dairy sheep associated with goat or beef cattle on rangelands, with high added-value products enhancing salaries. This study highlights for the first time the diversity of organic multispecies livestock farms and how consistent patterns of interactions among farm structure, livestock management, sales management, and workforce management shape them. The results are a preliminary basis for designing policy interventions aiming to scale up organic farming and value social assets of diversified and small farms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Production increases in lowland rice-based systems of Southeast Asia will not be possible without the addition of nutrients. Recent productivity gains were largely based on increasing the use efficiency of the applied nutrients through integrated and site-specific approaches. The adoption of such strategies has evolved differentially in the various country. We need to understand such recent trends, their driving forces, and their effectiveness to harness or leverage them for regional food security and sustainable development. To gain this understanding, we analyzed changes in fertility-related agronomic practices in six representative rice-based production systems of Southeast Asia (three favorable and three marginal sites). We implemented a diachronic survey (comparing the years 2000 and 2018) combined with field sampling and measurements in 1024 rice-producing households and, where applicable, in both dry and wet seasons (3638 complete data sets). We observed that soil fertility management followed similar trends across sites. However, the timing and the extent of changes were location specific, and differed primarily by the favorability/marginality of the site, and farmers’ capability to adopt technological innovations. The irrigated rice double cropping benefitted most from recent technology innovations (hybrid seeds, farm machinery), accelerating the adoption of improved fertility management practices to an aggregated level of up to 75% (mean across the six soil fertility-related management practices) at favorable sites. Most prominent were multiple splitting of mineral N and the application of mineral fertilizers other than N (P, K, Zn). At marginal sites, aggregate changes toward intensification were rather low with 35–55%, and farmers tended to intensify the non-rice component in the system by applying mineral fertilizers and organic amendments to dry season upland crops. A balanced use of nutrients will require the targeting of options to specific extrapolation domains (social-ecological target environments) based on site attributes and farmers’ resource endowment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Agriculture and forestry are facing numerous challenges, driven by a complex set of social, economic, and ecological factors. Innovation is a key to devising viable, resilient, and sustainable solutions to these challenges, but for innovations to have impact, they need to be “scaled.” The current policy context, in the European Union (EU) and elsewhere, encourages the use of the “interactive” model of innovation through the so-called “multi-actor” approach. In this study, we explore the dynamics of scaling in agricultural and forestry co-innovation partnerships. We ask whether such partnerships can be effective instruments to scale innovations and what factors play a role in the scaling process. Thus, the novelty of our paper is that it is the first published study of the dynamics of scaling within the current EU policy framework. Our analysis draws upon evidence from eight co-innovation case studies across Europe, encompassing varied contexts, scales, and funding mechanisms, and identifies three distinct forms of scaling: scaling out, up, and deep. The selection by co-innovation partnerships of strategies and enabling mechanisms in pursuit of scaling is dependent on factors such as funding conditions, contextual norms, and partnership objectives. Partnerships need to be clear about the type of scaling they aim to achieve, have an in-depth understanding of contextual complexities, and ensure that scaling is an integral part of the entire project cycle. Co-innovation partnerships can be effective catalysts for transformative change, provided scaling complexities are navigated, and enabling mechanisms leveraged adeptly. Our insights advance the understanding of scaling dynamics in co-innovation and offer evidence-based strategies for practitioners, policymakers, and researchers to bolster the impact of co-innovation initiatives in agriculture and forestry.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Agroecology is increasingly proposed in literature as a possible solution to mitigate the impact of anthropic agricultural activity on the environment, even though in Europe its potential is still not entirely clear. Many principles of agroecology have been put forward to bridge the gap between theory and real farming practices; however, its practical applicability remains complex. To quantify the potential of agroecology, it is necessary to find effective indicators, especially when assessing the management of grassland-based farming systems. Here, we reviewed the literature to take stock of the indicators used to characterize agroecology in grassland-based farming systems and at farm level, with the aim to evaluate how the different agroecological principles are addressed and to define multidisciplinary indicators to implement in real farming conditions. The two sets of principles used were addressed through a varying number of indicators, ranging from 7 to 33 and 7 to 58 indicators, respectively. The major findings of this review were the following: (i) principles of agroecology are useful to drive an assessment, particularly addressing different levels of analysis and sustainability dimensions; (ii) a single indicator can cover multiple principles and one principle can span multiple dimensions; (iii) economy and biodiversity categories are addressed through a limited number of indicators, while farming practices (including pasture management) and input categories offer multiple possibilities and lack consensus on the indicators used; (iv) animal health and socio-economic aspects are well targeted but underapplied in Europe. In order to assess the level of agroecology of a given grassland-based farming system, we propose indicators to be tested on-farm in order to understand their effectiveness and possible synergies at system level in real farming conditions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Agriculture faces multiple challenges, including reducing negative environmental impacts and producing quality food for a growing world population. One of the significant issues is the need for an increased proportion of plant-based foods in diets in the developed world and its combination with the ecosystemic services provided, such as those provided by legumes, allowing a reduction in the use of nitrogen fertilizers. This requires systemic innovation in order to increase the sustainable production and consumption of diverse plant protein sources in an interaction between knowledge, tools, regulation, and acceptability. The case of France is chosen to reflect on these innovation issues. There have been a number of recent reviews either on production or on food processing, but none has addressed their systemic interrelations, critical to select the levers such as genetics, agronomy, and processing to improve protein quality and use while maintaining crop performance in an environmentally friendly manner. Here, we review the issues of proteins for healthy and sustainable diets in synergy with agronomical benefits and recommend research priorities to address this topic from farm to fork. This review includes (1) analysis of the economic context for plant-based protein production for food in the context of the agroecological transition towards sustainability and on the consequences in plant breeding schemes; (2) assessment of overall protein production from a diversity perspective, including genetics and diversity of the production systems and territories; and (3) plant proteins in healthy and attractive foods: protein content and quality, typology of processing options for the production of protein-rich food products in relation to consumer needs and demands. Next, we identify major knowledge gaps and emphasize the need for transdisciplinary research from plant breeding to the food market, involving the various stakeholders in the food value chain, to address such complex issues for more sustainable agri-food systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Soil fertility in organic farming systems relies on the use of organic fertilizers and on the introduction of N-fixing crops in rotations. In such systems, the management of phosphorus fertilization can be challenging. Field phosphorus nutrient budgets and soil phosphorus status are useful indicators for assessing the sustainability of fertilization practices. However, the factors driving soil phosphorus budgets of organic fields for different management practices and farm types are still not fully understood. Here we propose to fill this knowledge gap by investigating, through semi-directive interviews, the variability of 5-year soil phosphorus budgets in 177 French organic farms to identify relationships between the P budgets and farm characteristics, covering farm territorial specialization, and soil fertilization practices. Changes in Olsen-P measurements were also computed to test their coherence with the phosphorus budgets. Based on our unprecedented large and diverse dataset, we found contrasting soil P budgets ranging from -32.3 to 50.3 kg·P ha −1 y −1 . Our work also revealed that P management was not at the core of farmers’ preoccupations, as 72% of them did not pay any specific attention to P management practices. The two most important factors driving soil phosphorus budgets were the cumulated phosphorus inputs and the frequency of N-fixing crops. We also identified 5 plot types — through a cluster analysis — with contrasting phosphorus management practices and soil phosphorus budgets. Our results highlight the need for a strategic management of phosphorus resources to prevent the occurrence of soil phosphorus imbalances that may be challenging to rectify in the medium to long term. This is particularly important in the case of organic farms that rely on the use of N-fixing crops for their nitrogen fertilization strategy, leading to low or negative soil phosphorus budgets.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cereal/legume intercropping enables complementary nitrogen (N) uptake, whereas relay intercropping allows temporal complementarity. However, how these mechanisms contribute to N uptake under moderate, species-tailored N fertilization remains unclear, and clarifying this could inform intercropping practices aligned with Good Agricultural Practices in Europe. We therefore determined N uptake of maize ( Zea mays L.), wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.), faba bean ( Vicia faba L.), and pea ( Pisum sativum L.) in six bi-specific strip intercrops and corresponding monocrops. We compared relay intercrops involving maize (late sown) with simultaneous intercrops without maize, across cereal/legume, cereal/cereal, and legume/legume combinations. All species received locally recommended fertilizer amounts for conventional agriculture in the Netherlands. In relay strip intercrops, the early-sown wheat, faba bean, and pea had higher N uptake than the respective monocrops, especially in the border rows of strips. Maize N uptake increased when intercropped with wheat or pea in a year with substantial temporal complementarity. Intercropping with faba bean did not result in increased N uptake for either cereals or pea. Relay intercrops showed land equivalent ratios for N uptake and fertilizer N equivalent ratios mostly above one, while for simultaneous intercrops these were mostly close to one. Therefore, relay intercrops used land more efficiently for N uptake and saved fertilizer N for yield compared to monocrops, whereas simultaneous intercrops did not. We investigated, for the first time, the relative importance of temporal complementarity and cereal-legume N acquisition complementarity for N uptake in strip intercropping under conventional European agriculture, showing that complementary N uptake was strongly associated with temporal complementarity. While inclusion of legumes in intercropping was not required to achieve complementary N capture, it allowed for reduced N input. Relay strip intercropping with species-tailored N input is a pathway toward more sustainable N use in agriculture that can complement cereal-legume complementarity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In temperate Europe, agroforestry practice is gaining interest due to its potential to enhance carbon (C) sequestration and mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in agriculture. To date, the effects of agroforestry on the spatial and temporal dynamics of soil carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ) fluxes are still poorly quantified. Here we present a systematic comparison of soil CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes between agroforestry and monoculture cropland systems for the first time, based on two-year field measurements at three sites on different soils in Germany. Each site had an adjacent alley cropping agroforestry system and monoculture, and the agroforestry was established on former monoculture croplands 1 to 11 years prior to this study. We found that area-weighted soil CO 2 emissions from agroforestry (3.5−8.1 Mg C ha −1 yr −1 ) were comparable to monocultures (3.4−9.8 Mg C ha −1 yr −1 ), whereas area-weighted agroforestry generally had higher soil CH 4 uptake (0.4−1.3 kg C ha −1 yr −1 ) compared to monocultures (0.1−1.2 kg C ha −1 yr −1 ). Seasonal variations of soil CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes were strongly regulated by soil temperature and moisture, and the spatial variations were influenced by soil texture. Our results suggest that conversion of monoculture cropland to long-term alley cropping agroforestry system could be considered as a sustainable agriculture practice for its great potential for mitigating CH 4 emissions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Agronomic research provides management recommendations based on small-plot trials (SPTs) and on-farm trials (OFTs) with very different characteristics. SPTs are traditionally conducted at agricultural experiment stations by research institutes or universities, while OFTs are conducted under commercial-scale conditions and managed by farmers using their own equipment. Several researchers claimed that discrepancies could occur between these two types of trials, which can make the extrapolation of results from SPTs to the farm level difficult. In our study, we conducted an extensive comparison of small-plot and on-farm trials to analyze the effect of foliar fungicide application on maize and soybean yields. We collected data on maize and soybean from five US states. Analysis of the soybean data showed similar mean yield responses and within-trial standard deviation to fungicide application between 479 OFTs and 83 SPTs. For maize, our comparison of 300 OFTs and 114 SPTs showed similar mean yield response in both. Nevertheless, the within-trial standard deviation was three times smaller in on-farm compared to small-plot trials. On the other hand, the between-trial standard deviation (measuring the variability of the effects of fungicide application across different environments) was almost twice as large in SPTs than in OFTs for both crops. Hence, the differences in the effects of fungicide on yield were similar whether they were estimated using OFTs or SPTs for both crops. This implies that OFTs can potentially detect significant yield differences with fewer replicates and thus reduce the cost of data generation. We argue that SPTs can be seen as a preliminary step before scaling up to OFTs to facilitate technology transfer and extrapolate the results in real farming conditions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite the acknowledged benefits of crop diversification, the transition towards more diversified cropping systems needs to be supported, mainly due to socio-technical lock-ins favoring major dominant crop species. This calls for the development of new approaches to support the design of locally tailored diversified cropping systems. This paper aims to present an original participatory and multi-actor design approach, developed to support the introduction of camelina ( Camelina sativa ) into the cropping systems of northern France and to provide some insights about the characteristics, the specificities, and the limits of this approach to support its use and adaptation to other contexts. For 3 years, and in connection with the development of an oilseed biorefinery, we gathered a variety of actors (farmers, advisors, engineers in agronomy, researchers, and industrialists) to locally support the introduction of camelina in the cropping systems. First, we illustrate the diversity of the modalities that have been collectively imagined to introduce and manage camelina in the local cropping systems. Then, we describe the originality and the diversity of the knowledge produced on camelina, especially during the assessment of some of these modalities within on-farm experiments. Finally, drawing on concepts and theories from design sciences, we show that (i) the pre-existence of networks of actors, (ii) the rationale involvement of the actors, (iii) the implementation of a situated design process fueled by action and distributed among actors, (iv) the sharing and the circulation of knowledge among a diversity of actors involved in the production and use of the new crop, and (v) the implementation of an effective network management contributed to foster the three key elements that we identified as crucial to support crop diversification, namely, the production of actionable knowledge, the exploration of new ideas/concepts, and the active participation of a diversity of actors of the agri-food system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract It is difficult to identify farm management practices that consistently provide greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement at different locations because effectiveness of practices is greatly influenced by climates and soils. We address this knowledge gap by identifying practices that provide abatement in eight case studies located across diverse conditions in Australian’s grain-producing areas. The case studies focus on soil-based emissions of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and changes in soil organic carbon (SOC), simulated over 100 years for 15 cropping management scenarios. Average changes in the balance of GHG from both N 2 O emissions and SOC sequestration (∆GHG balance) and gross margins compared to a high emissions baseline were determined over 25 and 100 simulated years. Because scenarios providing the greatest abatement varied across individual case studies, we aggregated the data over all case studies and analysed them with a random forest data mining approach to build models for predicting ∆GHG balance. Increased cropping intensity, achieved by including cover crops, additional grains crops, or crops with larger biomass in the rotation, was the leading predictor of ∆GHG balance across the scenarios and sites. Abatement from increased cropping intensity averaged 774 CO 2 -e ha −1 year −1 (25 years) and 444 kg CO 2 -e ha −1 year −1 (100 years) compared to the baseline, with reduced emissions from SOC sequestration offsetting increased N 2 O emissions for both time frames. Increased cropping intensity decreased average gross margins, indicating that a carbon price would likely be needed to maximise GHG abatement from this management. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the random forest approach has been applied to assess management practice effectiveness for achieving GHG abatement over diverse environments. Doing so provided us with more general information about practices that provide GHG abatement than would have come from qualitative comparison of the variable results from the case studies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract To ensure regular and high yields, current agriculture is based on intensive use of pesticides and fertilizers, which are detrimental to the environment and human health. Moreover, as pest resistance to pesticides increases, and more and more pesticides are taken off the market, national and European policies are becoming powerful drivers to deliver pesticide-free farming systems. Whereas numerous studies have compared organic versus conventional systems, our study assessed, for the first time, the performances of a pesticide-free arable cropping system (No-Pesticide), using synthetic fertilizers, specifically designed to produce high yields and meet environmental goals. This system was compared with an input-based cropping system designed with the same environmental targets (PHEP: productive with high environmental performances) in an 11-year field trial in France (Paris Basin). Banning pesticides did not result in a significant average yield gap (in GJ.ha −1 .year −1 or in kg N.ha −1 .year −1 ) calculated over the crop sequence. Yet, some crops’ yields significantly decreased, due either to pest damages, or to limited nitrogen nutrition. In the No-Pesticide system, the mycotoxin content of cereal grains was lower than the regulatory threshold, and the average wheat protein content was higher than the required standard for baking. Indirect energy consumption, total greenhouse gas emissions, number of technical operations, nitrogen fertilizer amounts, and treatment frequency indexes were significantly lower compared to the PHEP system. Conversely, results showed significantly higher direct energy consumption, direct greenhouse gas emissions, and number of work hours for weed control. We identify highly effective agricultural strategies to avoid pesticide use (e.g., widely diverse and long crop sequence; introduction of hemp) and pinpoint several technical lock-ins hampering steady production in pesticide-free systems. We argue that more experiments should be undertaken to deliver technical knowledge for managing major or orphan species within pesticide-free systems, and to provide supplementary results, including economic and social performances.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Thanks to their low fertilization requirements and high consumer demand, ancient wheats and old durum wheat cultivars represent an attractive option for the marginal areas of Mediterranean environments no longer cultivated due to the low grain yields attainable using modern wheat cultivars. Dual-purpose utilization may increase their value in these cropping systems, but no information is available on the suitability of ancient wheat species to this type of utilization. To fill this gap, Khorasan, einkorn, and emmer wheats, clipped at the terminal spikelet stage or left unclipped, were compared in a two-year field trial. The grains were sown in the month of October, in Sardinia (41°N, 80 m asl), Italy, on low-fertility soils and with low-medium fertilization rates. Einkorn cultivars produced the highest biomass yield (2–3 t ha −1 ), reflecting the longer time to the onset of the terminal spikelet stage (119–138 days). After clipping, all species recovered their ability to intercept radiation to the levels of the unclipped crops, but clipping lowered their radiation use-efficiency. Grain yield was not penalized by clipping: the increase in the harvest index compensated for the decrease in biomass. Here we show for the first time that ancient wheat species are suitable for dual-purpose utilization (herbage plus grain in the same season) rendering them valuable for marginal areas; this was because the early sowing adopted for dual-purpose utilization allowed them to take full advantage of their lateness in terms of herbage yield, and to bring flowering forward (i.e. make it earlier) so that a satisfactory grain yield was obtained, even under severe water stress. Dual-purpose utilization of ancient wheats increases the sustainability of mixed cropping systems, by making herbage available to animals in a critical period, without decreasing the grain yield attainable after grazing in the same season.",

    "abstract": "Validation of models for plant disease management is a crucial part in the development of decision support systems in plant protection. Bespoke field trials are usually conducted to determine the performance of a model under practical conditions. However, field trials are very resource-demanding, and the use of already existing field trial data could significantly reduce costs for model validation. In this study, we took this novel approach to verify the performance of models for determining the need of fungicide applications against leaf blotch diseases in wheat by utilising historical weather data and yield data available from fungicide efficacy field trials. Two models based on humidity factors were used in the study. To estimate how specific humidity settings in the two models affect the number of recommended fungicide treatments per season, historical weather data from a 5-year period from weather stations in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Lithuania was used. The model output shows major differences between seasons and regions, typically recommending between one and three treatments per season. To determine the prediction potential of the models, data on yield gains from either one or two fungicide applications in fungicide efficacy trials conducted in wheat over a 5-year period in the five countries was utilised. The yield responses from fungicide treatments in the efficacy trials varied considerably between years and countries, as did the proportion of predictions of profitable treatments. In general, there was a tendency for the models to overestimate the need to apply fungicides (low specificity), but they rarely failed to recommend an application that was needed (high sensitivity). Despite the importance of having specific trials across regions in order to adjust models to local cropping and weather conditions, our study shows that historical weather data and existing field trial data have the potential to be used in model validation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A better understanding of gendered perception on the prevalence and management of pests in irrigated agriculture in the context of a changing climate can help recommend more gender-sensitive policies, particularly in smallholder farming systems. Limited studies have been conducted to assess gender differences in perception of the prevalence and management of pests among smallholder irrigation schemes especially in Zimbabwe. This study is the first one to assess gendered perceptions on the change in prevalence and management of pests in Exchange, Insukamini, and Ruchanyu irrigation schemes in Zimbabwe. Semi-structured questionnaires were administered using face-to-face interviews with participants. Data from focus group discussions and key informant interviews were used for validating data from questionnaire interviews. Mann-Whitney U test was employed to assess perception on the prevalence of pests between male and female farmers. Findings from this study depict that the females perceived a higher prevalence of bollworms ( Helicoverpa armigera ) ( P ≤ 0.01), fall armyworms ( Spodoptera frugiperda ) ( P ≤ 0.01), red spider mites ( Tetranychus urticae ) ( P ≤ 0.01), and maize grain weevils ( Sitophilus zeamais ) ( P ≤ 0.01) than males, while males perceive a higher prevalence of termites ( Isoptera ) ( P ≤ 0.01) and cutworms ( Noctuidae ) ( P ≤ 0.01) than females. Both male and female farmers perceived a greater increase in prevalence of aphids ( Aphidoidea ). Here, we show that farmers’ perceptions of changes in pest prevalence and pest management strategies differ by gender. Gender perception on change in prevalence of pests can be a valuable resource for the sustainable development of smallholder irrigation farming system and scientific research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The need for better understanding and conservation of wild plant resources with potential for domestication or utilization in crop improvement has been highlighted in recent years. Botanical resources such as herbaria, databases, and floras offer an information-rich platform from which to select species of interest based on desirable traits. To demonstrate the potential of these resources, wild, native forage legumes were screened for inclusion in northern Swedish grassland agricultural systems (leys). The poor persistence of red clover in multi-year leys is a limitation to the current management strategy in the region. Wild, native forage legumes with the potential for longer persistence were considered for inclusion as minor components in leys to contribute to the system in later years of production. Using the Umeå University Herbarium, local floras, and both regional and international biodiversity databases, seven wild forage legume species were selected based on phenology, morphology, and native range. Particular focus was given to the potential for species to provide pollinator resources early in the season, leading to species with early flowering being preferred. Biodiversity databases were also used to locate wild populations of the selected species to facilitate seed collection for future cultivation, as additional study of the agronomic potential of the selected species is necessary. Here, we have shown that the rich biodiversity data stored in botanical institutions can jumpstart the selection of wild species for utilization in the agriculture sector based on various traits of interest.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The rapid expansion of cities in sub-Saharan Africa generates increasing volumes of diversified organic wastes that require management and a high population need for local and fresh vegetables. Linking the different sources of organic materials generated in these cities with the needs of local food producers for fertilizers prepared from recycled organic materials is challenging. This requires that producers obtain the results they expect from the organic materials they recycle. Thus, recycling these organic materials in their raw form or after composting presents an opportunity for periurban agriculture, although the great variability in the quantity and quality of these materials raises questions about the consistency between their agronomic value and their economic value. In two large cities of Cameroon (Yaoundé and Bafoussam), different types of organic materials were sampled: unprocessed livestock waste and composts from manure or municipal solid waste. From an agronomic perspective, we calculated the fertilization value based on the nutrient (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) content of the organic materials. From an economic perspective, we calculated the value based on the nutrient content of the organic materials and their substitution unit prices and recorded the current market price. This is the first time that this combined approach has been used in sub-Saharan Africa. Our results showed considerable variability and discrepancy in both the agronomic and the economic values. The market prices overvalued the urban composts by a factor of 6, while chicken feces were undervalued by a factor of 3. The unprocessed organic materials were the most interesting from an economic and agronomic perspective. Our findings suggest that (i) the composting process needs to be improved and (ii) the humus potential should be calculated to better assess the amendment value of organic materials and as a basis for adjusting their market price.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Agri-environment schemes are a key mechanism by which agricultural sustainability is encouraged by subsidising farmers to adopt environmentally friendly management (e.g. reduction of inputs) to maintain and enhance the delivery of biodiversity-associated ecosystem services. Studies testing the efficacy of agri-environment schemes have yielded varying results, and few have focused on upland (marginal or Less Favoured Area) grassland (&gt; 150 m above sea level) where productivity is poor. This study used a factorial field experiment to examine patterns in plant communities and terrestrial invertebrates between agri-environment scheme and conventionally managed semi-improved and improved upland grasslands, using 90 spatially paired fields. Total plant species richness and rare plant species richness (those with &lt; 10% occurrence) were unaffected by agri-environment scheme management, but were significantly higher on semi-improved than improved grasslands. Total and rare invertebrate abundance and family-level richness were unrelated to grassland type (semi-improved or improved). Total and rare invertebrate abundances were 4% and 218% higher, and total and rare invertebrate family-level richness were 17% and 14% higher in agri-environment scheme than conventionally managed fields, respectively. Here, we show that agri-environment scheme management of marginal or Less Favoured Area upland grassland was associated with higher multi-taxa invertebrate abundance and richness associated with swards indicative of wetter conditions with lower dominance of perennial ryegrass ( Lolium perenne ) and greater coverage of other native grass species compared to conventional management. This suggests that agri-environment schemes may maintain, enhance or offset declines in terrestrial invertebrates and their associated ecosystem service delivery by maintaining more diverse swards, and suggests that they make a positive contribution to biodiversity conservation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Agriculture can benefit from crop diversification to facilitate its transition to more sustainable agrifood systems. However, these practices remain rare in Europe. One major barrier is the existence of sociotechnical lock-ins. To clarify the dynamics at work, we analyzed the relationships between actors involved in 23 crop diversification experiences across 11 European countries. The novelty of this paper lies in the systemic analysis of the network of actors involved in crop diversification experiences. Using data from qualitative interviews and cognitive mapping approaches, we identify and describe the role of actors and the key relationships in crop diversification and detect relationships that are currently missing. Our study shows that in the different European countries, similar relationships act as levers or barriers to crop diversification, with farmers and researchers playing a crucial role. The most important cognitive factors that influence the choice of farmers to diversify are environmental and health concerns and the desire to make profit and innovate. We relate the cognitive factors to organizational, technical, economic, and political factors and suggest levers for crop diversification based on successful crop diversification experiences.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Growing awareness of global challenges and increasing pressures on the farming sector, including the urgent requirement to rapidly cut greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, emphasize the need for sustainable production, which is particularly relevant for dairy production systems. Comparing dairy production systems across the three sustainability dimensions is a considerable challenge, notably due to the heterogeneity of production conditions in Europe. To overcome this, we developed an ex post multicriteria assessment tool that adopts a holistic approach across the three sustainability dimensions. This tool is based on the DEXi framework, which associates a hierarchical decision model with an expert perspective and follows a tree shaped structure; thus, we called it the DEXi-Dairy tool. For each dimension of sustainability, qualitative attributes were defined and organized in themes, sub-themes, and indicators. Their choice was guided by three objectives: (i) better describe main challenges faced by European dairy production systems, (ii) point out synergies and trade-offs across sustainability dimensions, and (iii) contribute to the identification of GHG mitigation strategies at the farm level. Qualitative scales for each theme, sub-theme, and indicator were defined together with weighting factors used to aggregate each level of the tree. Based on selected indicators, a list of farm data requirements was developed to populate the sustainability tree. The model was then tested on seven case study farms distributed across Europe. DEXi-Dairy presents a qualitative method that allows for the comparison of different inputs and the evaluation of the three sustainability dimensions in an integrated manner. By assessing synergies and trade-offs across sustainability dimensions, DEXi-Dairy is able to reflect the heterogeneity of dairy production systems. Results indicate that, while trade-offs occasionally exist among respective selected sub-themes, certain farming systems tend to achieve a higher sustainability score than others and hence could serve as benchmarks for further analyses.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Eggplant shoot and fruit borer, Leucinodes orbonalis , is a major pest in eggplant production in South and South-East Asia. Farmers frequently spray insecticides to control it. Integrated pest management (IPM) based on mass trapping or pheromone trapping and sanitation (removal of infested shoots and fruits) has been suggested but poorly adopted. This study tested, together with farmers, combinations of IPM components that fit their farming practices, increase income, and preserve natural enemy populations. A 2-year participatory study was negotiated with these farmers, comparing (i) an untreated control, (ii) farmers’ conventional weekly spraying, with pheromone trapping either (iii) alone, or combined with (iv) trap-based biorational spraying, or (v) bi-weekly conventional insecticide spraying. Farmers rejected testing sanitation as too labor-intensive. In both years, pheromone trapping alone or combined with biorational spraying reduced fruit infestation, increased yield and income, and preserved natural enemies, showing technical efficacy at costs comparable with farmers’ practice. Replacing biorational spraying by conventional insecticides did not provide any control beyond pheromone trapping alone but reduced natural enemies. In contrast, farmers’ practice neither reduced infestation nor increased yield but reduced populations of natural enemies. Aphid and jassid populations were reduced only by biorational and conventional spraying. As farmers were reluctant to use only pheromone trapping, the addition of biorational spraying might be suitable. Discussion with farmers allowed us to understand how practical applicability of the tested IPM depends on farmers’ knowledge levels on insect biology, farmers’ desire to still use some spraying, and labor constraints to sanitation. Although technically and economically viable, the tested IPM may prove difficult to scale out, as farmers had difficulty understanding the lifecycle of Leucinodes orbonalis and the pheromone trapping mechanisms. This study is the first to disentangle the technical efficacy of pheromone-trapping-based IPM from its practical applicability for the targeted smallholder eggplant growers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Summer mountain pastures (also called alpages ) are a central element for many agro-pastoral livestock systems in the alpine region, by providing the feedstock for herds during the summer transhumance. However, vegetation phenology and productivity in mountain pastures are increasingly affected by climate hazards exacerbated by climate change, such as early snow removal, late frost events, or droughts. Difficulties can then arise to match animal demand with forage resource on alpages and, in the long term, threaten the sustainable management of these highly multifunctional socio-ecological systems. To help agro-pastoral actors adapt, an essential step is to quantify the risk of impacts on the forage resource, due to an increased occurrence or intensity of climate hazards. Exposure to climate hazards on alpages is defined locally by topographic aspects in combination with the broader influence of the regional climate. Our work therefore aimed at providing a tailored assessment of potential climate risk for the forage resource at the individual scale of each alpage in the French Alps. To this end, we developed agro-climatic indicators based on atmospheric and snow cover data accounting for geographic and topographic conditions, and applied them to a database providing unique spatially explicit information at the alpage level. For the first time, we introduce a description of agro-climatic conditions and provide a classification of agro-climatic profiles of alpages in the French Alps, ranging from low to high potential risk for the forage resource, mainly following a North-South gradient combined with altitude. We also bring insights on the evolutions of the climate risk with climate change and discuss management implications for agro-pastoral livestock systems using alpages . We finally present a web-based visualization tool that aim at communicating agro-climatic profiles and their evolution to practitioners and at assisting decision makers in understanding climate-related risks on the alpages of the French Alps.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Potato production in low-income countries is threatened by seed degeneration, i.e., the accumulation of seed-borne diseases and pests in potato seed tubers when these are vegetatively propagated over consecutive cycles, leading to a reduction in seed quality and yielding ability. Agroecological settings and seed recycling (on-farm propagation over consecutive cycles) determine the process of seed degeneration. However, it is poorly understood how these factors affect this process. Therefore, to reduce this knowledge gap, we analysed two datasets collected in Ecuador, one from a multi-annual field experiment and one from a farmers’ seed study. The experiment, carried out from 2013 to 2016, aimed to assess seed degeneration at agroecological settings present in three different altitudes. The farmers’ seed study, in which 260 farmers were surveyed in 2018, aimed to understand potato seed degeneration in farmers’ fields under diverse agroecological settings. Our results of the multi-annual field experiment showed that agroecological settings have a heterogeneous influence on the presence of seed-borne diseases and pests. We also found that both the agroecological settings at the three altitudes and the number of on-farm propagation cycles affected the rates at which seed-borne diseases and pests on the seeds increased and yield decreased. However, the farmers’ seed study challenged these results by indicating that this was not clear on farms. Combining these results, this article shows that agroecological settings and seed recycling only partially explain the process of seed degeneration. This suggests that more research about seed degeneration needs to also take place under farmers’ conditions to fully understand the complex of potato performance factors. We expect that such research will support the design of improved seed interventions, while simultaneously it may generate discussion about when potato seed degeneration plays an important role in productivity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Urban agriculture is often associated with sustainable agricultural practices. However, the variety of systems qualifying as urban agriculture and the limited information available about their sustainability question this direct relationship. To better understand differences in intra-urban agriculture systems and their sustainability, this paper proposed an holistic classification of urban agricultural systems and collected knowledge about the environmental, social, and economic sustainability of these systems. Such a classification is important to evaluate sustainability claims on urban agricultural systems, anticipate potential sustainability trade-offs between urban agricultural systems and propose preventive measures to address these, and ultimately guide the sustainable deployment of these systems. Compared with existing classifications, the novel classification scheme proposed here accounts for technological, social and economic characteristics of urban agriculture systems to better distinguish between all systems. It was built on 91 scientific papers. The economic intensity of production was, for example, an important characteristic to coherently group urban agriculture systems. The intensity of cooperation between all actors was another characteristic emphasized for certain urban agriculture systems. One end of the classification scheme describes ground-based open, socially motivated urban agriculture systems with high cooperation intensity and low production intensity. The other end of the classification scheme describes building-integrated quasi-closed systems with high production intensity. In between, we find: building-integrated conditioned systems, ground-based conditioned systems, and building-integrated open systems. Mapping sustainability claims from literature in the classification scheme supported its definition along the three characteristics. For example, urban farming was associated with job creation, food safety, water savings, and higher yields while urban gardening with educational potentials, biodiversity improvements, and lower yields. Their display in the classification scheme was therefore supported. To further support the use of the proposed scheme, additional quantitative research to better understand and quantify the sustainability of urban agriculture systems is required.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Livestock farming occupies 57% of agricultural area in France and has contrasting impacts on the environment. Studies have analyzed relations between livestock farming and soil organic carbon (SOC) content, but the influence of livestock farming on soils is difficult to perceive at a large scale. The objective of this study was to increase understanding of impacts of livestock farming on soils that receive livestock manure depending on different initial levels of SOC content, at cantonal level. To this end, we used French soil and agricultural databases to analyze relations between livestock farming practices and SOC content. We used statistical data calculated from the French soil test database for the periods 2000–2004 and 2010–2014. For livestock farming practices, we used data from the French agricultural census of 2000 and 2010, and for spreading of livestock manure, data from the French program to control pollution of agricultural origin (2002–2007) and data from the French Livestock Institute. The novelty of our large-scale analysis is to differentiate the origin of livestock manure (herbivore or granivore) and the type of crop on which it was spread (crops or grasslands). Statistical analysis was performed at the cantonal scale for France using the method of generalized least squares. We show for the first time that, at the national scale, spreading of livestock manure influences SOC content and dynamics significantly. Our results also show the importance of the nature of the manure; solid manure increases SOC content, unlike liquid manure. Spreading herbivore manure on crops increases SOC content, but spreading granivore manure may decrease it. Livestock manure spread on grasslands has no significant effect on SOC content, possibly due to under-representation of grassland soils in the soil database. These results demonstrate the importance of the complementary between crop and livestock to maintain soil ecosystem services, including soil fertility.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Sustainable intensification aims to increase production and improve livelihoods of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. Many farmers, however, are caught in a vicious cycle of low productivity and lack of incentives to invest in agricultural inputs. Moving towards sustainable intensification therefore requires support such as input subsidies and learning about new options through, for instance, co-learning approaches. Yet such support is not straightforward as agricultural developments often diverge from the envisaged pathways: extensification may occur instead of intensification and specialization instead of diversification. Understanding of farmers’ responses to incentives such as input subsidies and new knowledge is lacking. Our overarching aim was to improve this understanding, in order to better support future pathways for agricultural development in smallholder farming. Over five seasons, we compared the responses of farmers in western Kenya taking part in a novel co-learning program we developed, which included provision of an input voucher, with the responses of farmers who only received a voucher. We also assessed the differences before and during the program. We used diverse indicators that were related to the different agricultural development pathways. Farmer responses were mainly a result of the input voucher. Farmers increased maize yields (intensification) and maize area (specialization) for maize self-sufficiency. Increased farm and maize areas in combination with relatively low N application rates also pointed to extensification coupled with the risk of soil N mining. Diversification by increasing the soybean and groundnut area share was facilitated by the integrated co-learning approach, which thereby supported relatively complex farm management changes. Our results highlight the difficulty of enabling yield and production increases, while also meeting environmental and economic goals. The diversity of farmer responses and constraints beyond the farm level underlined the importance of wider socio-economic developments in addition to support of sustainable intensification at farm level.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Brown rot (BR) in relation to codling moth damage (CMD) is a key issue in apple production but the impact of these pests has not been assessed jointly. In addition, categorising cultivar reaction to these two pests for sustainable production systems could be essential for improving pest management. Therefore, in a 12-year study, 27 apple cultivars (9 scab-resistant, 9 commercial, and 9 old) were assessed for their reactions to BR in relation to CMD in integrated and organic production systems, and classified into 3 categories (“low”, “medium”, and “high”) based on their season-long BR and CMD incidences. Then the 12-year temporal BR and CMD progresses in each category were analysed by fitting three-parameter logistic functions to process data and then by deriving 5 model variables for BR and CMD incidences. Here, we showed BR-CMD relationships in both production systems, which indicated that final BR and CMD incidences were significantly higher in organic systems. Our results show that season-long BR and CMD incidences were “low” for most resistant cultivars, and “medium” or “high” for most commercial and old ones. The area under the disease and pest progress curves indicated consistent differences among all categories in both production systems; and they were used to differentiate cultivar reactions to BR and CMD. Based on these categories and BR-CMD relationships, here we developed a new brown rot and codling moth forecasting and management strategy (BRCM-FMS). BRCM-FMS and general pest management programme (GPMP) were then compared in an additional 4-year study. This was the first study to show that the BRCM-FMS reduced annual spray applications by 21.4–41.7% in integrated and 12.5–31.3% in organic production system compared to GPMP. Disease incidences in the two programmes were similar in all years, production systems and classification categories. Less sprays and similar disease incidences provide economic and environmental benefits for growers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Grape growers are often constrained by available time and labor to conduct trials that deliver informative results. Spatially distributed trial designs coupled with data collection using sensing technologies can introduce efficiencies and also account for the impact of land variability on trial results. Various spatial approaches have been proposed, yet how farmers perceive them is largely unknown. We collaborated with four wine businesses in Australia to explore how grape growers and viticultural consultants perceive a simplified spatial approach to experimentation involving one or more vineyard rows or “strips.” In each case, the simplified strip approach was applied alongside growers’ or consultants’ own methods to compare the perceived value of different methods. The Theory of Planned Behavior was used as an analytical framework to identify factors influencing participants’ intentions towards adopting the strip approach. Our findings show that growers and consultants perceived several advantages of the strip approach over their own methods. Key factors impeding uptake were resource constraints for collecting trial data and lack of skills and knowledge to use and analyze spatial data to position the trial and interpret results. These constraints highlight the need to support growers and consultants who see value in this approach by developing automated and affordable measurements for viticultural variables beyond yield, and by providing training on how to analyze and interpret spatial and response data. This study provides novel insights for private and public sectors on where to focus efforts to facilitate adoption of spatial approaches to On-Farm Experimentation by specific target audiences.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Leafcutter ants are a major pest in vineyards in Argentina, but their damage to vine plants has not been sufficiently quantified. Biological control against leafcutter ants has not been successful so far. Sugary rewards can trigger ants to act as plant bodyguards against a wide range of herbivores. The Argentine ant Linepithema humile (Mayr) is a common invader of vineyards worldwide and has a strong preference for carbohydrates. In a first 10-week field experiment, we attracted L. humile ants to a group of plants using sugar feeders, while no feeders were used for a second group. Ant-excluded control plants were also deployed. We quantified the damage inflicted by the leafcutter ant Amoimyrmex bruchi (Forel) on potted vines with and without L. humile ants. In a second short field experiment, we evaluated the impact of L. humile on A. bruchi foraging through the quantification of foraging activity and the amount of transported material as a function of L. humile presence. We found that A. bruchi caused &gt;90% leaf area reductions in plants without L. humile , while plants where the species was present were rarely attacked and leaves developed similar to those of ant-excluded controls. Active interaction with L. humile decreased A. bruchi ’s foraging activity and the amount of material transported by it. This is the first report of A. bruchi as a vineyard pest and the first quantification of the damage inflicted by a leafcutter ant on organic grapevines. We demonstrate that L. humile defends vine plants against herbivore pests and artificial sugar sources boost can this defense service. The development of biological control strategies that include the ecological services of ants as natural enemies of herbivorous pests could become a useful tool in sustainable viticulture and horticulture.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Up to 75% of nitrogen (N) taken up during cauliflowers production is allocated to leaves, which are left as crop residues after harvest. The inclusion of cauliflower, cultivated alone or intercropped with legumes, in rotation schemes, is a promising tool to optimize N availability to subsequent crops. This original study assessed, for the first time in South Tyrol, Italy, the effect of removal or soil incorporation of cauliflower and clover residues on the growth and N uptake of subsequent lettuce. In 2015, cauliflower was sole-cropped or intercropped with clover, under different N regimes (N0, N1, N2, N3 = 0, 75, 150, 300 kg N ha −1 ). Cauliflower and clover residues were either removed or incorporated in the soil in 2016. The effects of the residual fertility left by the N fertilizer, the two cropping systems, and the crop residues were assessed on the yield and N uptake of two subsequent lettuce crops. Isotopic 15 N-labeled cauliflower residues were additionally used to quantify the N contribution of cauliflower residues to lettuce growth. During the first lettuce crop, residues incorporation was the only factor increasing lettuce yields (+41%) and N uptake (+58%). The residual effect of N1 and N2 rates increased the lettuce N uptake when clover residues were incorporated. During the second lettuce crop, residues incorporation increased lettuce yields (+26%) and N uptake (+44%). On average, 64% and 35% of the lettuce N amounts, in the first and second cycles, respectively, derived from cauliflower residues, and accounted for 38% of the total N contained in cauliflower residues (214 kg N ha −1 ). Results from this experiment, uncommon for the examined species, demonstrate that incorporation of cauliflower and clover residues provides an excellent source of N for lettuce. Incorporating residues of the preceding cauliflower crop, alone or intercropped with clover, before establishing the lettuce crop, substantially reduce the N fertilization needs of subsequent lettuce crops.",

Here, we compile the first inventory of food CWR of Tajikistan. A total of 549 food CWR taxa belonging to 36 families and 125 genera were documented as occurring in the country. Among them, 71 taxa were recognized as native close relatives of globally important crops (category 1A), 67 as native distant relatives of these crops (1B) and 411 as native taxa with an undetermined relationship to these crops (1C). This documented CWR diversity far exceeds previous scientific assessments for the country and, in doing so, distinguishes the Tajik region from surrounding countries. Within the country, the results indicate a clear gradient of food CWR taxonomic richness from the eastern part of the country (least diversity) to the western part (greatest diversity). This trend adds important new information to the body of literature published by N. I. Vavilov and others, who mainly stressed the importance of the Pamir region (Eastern Tajikistan) for crop and CWR diversity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Herd health management is a critical issue for the future of dairy systems. The right combination of preventive and curative practices will depend on management system, level of work productivity, and self-sufficiency objectives, and will entail specific skills and work organizations. However, the combination of work dimensions and animal health management has rarely been explored in the literature on a livestock farming system scale. The Grand Ouest region of France spans a diverse array of livestock farming systems that can serve to design herd health management indicators, farming objectives and work arrangements, and explore their linkages. Here we ran semi-structured interviews on 10 dairy farms, analyzed the farmers’ discourses, and built 7 variables and 25 modalities that, for the first time, cover three components, namely herd health, farming objectives and work arrangements, and we tested various associations between these variables. Our interview data confirms that consultants and veterinarians have a key role to play in building a pool of skills adapted to various types of health management system. Data suggests linkages between prevention measures, alternative or conventional curative interventions, and work-related parameters.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The intercropping of winter oilseed rape with frost-sensitive service plants can provide a diversity of services including weed control and N supply for oilseed rape. This practice started to be adopted by farmers and has therefore become one of the most popular intercropping in Western Europe. However, in Switzerland, such intercropping leads to contrasting yields. The growth of service plants and the benefits they provide have also been found to be variable. The factors explaining these variabilities remain unclear. Our study aimed to better understand this variability under a temperate climate thanks to the regional agronomic diagnosis framework. In this study, we first investigated the main factors explaining this variability and then aimed to rank them to identify ways to better manage such intercropping systems. A network of 28 farmers’ fields planted with winter oilseed rape intercropped with service plant mixtures was studied. Farmers’ practices were diverse in terms of specific composition of the service plant mixture, pest management, and fertilization. We observed that the growth of oilseed rape and service plants in fall was highly variable. We determined that in late fall, the main drivers of the service plant mixture dry weight were specific composition of the mixture and precipitation. The introduction of buckwheat in the service plant mixture enhanced its late fall biomass. The oilseed rape grain yields ranged from 0.4 to 5.0 t ha −1 and were lower than that of the local reference in 75% of the fields. This was mainly explained by insect pest damage in spring due to a very limited use of insecticide in our field network combined with a lack of alternative pest management strategies. This work provides further elements to investigate the causes leading to the high variability we observed, together with the local observations that will benefit the farmers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Yield gaps between organic and conventional agriculture raise concerns about future agricultural systems which should reduce external inputs and face an unpredictable climate. In the UK, the performance gap is especially severe for wheat that, as a result, has a small and shrinking organic acreage. In organic wheat production, most determinants of crop performance are managed at a rotation level, which leaves cultivar choice as the major decision on a seasonal basis. Yet, conventionally generated cultivar recommendations might be inappropriate to organic farms. Furthermore, uncertainty about field-scale crop performance hinders positive developments of the supply chain of organic grains and seeds. Here, we present a field-scale evaluation of winter wheat cultivars, integrated with an agronomic crop performance survey, across a network of organic farms. The relation between crop performance and climatic patterns is explored, to capitalise past growing seasons in cultivar and management decisions on-farm. Grain yield and grain protein content were linked by a dual relation, positive across environments and negative across cultivars. Feed-grade cultivars showed a relatively high yield (4.5–5.5 t/ha) but low protein (8.5–9.3%), whereas breadmaking and historic cultivars showed higher protein (10.4–11.1%) and lower yields (3.5–4.0 t/ha). Historic phenotypes showed better weed suppressive ability than modern ones, without trade-offs with yield or quality. Multiple regressions showed that weed abundance at wheat anthesis was the main yield predictor. The effects of two different post-emergence weed management strategies were observed. Farms relying on interrow hoeing showed lower weed abundance, but a higher relative abundance of the dominant species than that of those relying on spring tine harrowing. Future wheat breeding and cultivar testing should account for crop-weed relations, weed management strategies and their effects on nutrient use efficiency. Further data collection can inform plant breeding on critical traits for low-input farming and shed light on cultivar-environment-management interactions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Agricultural intensification has led to dramatic declines in bird populations. In particular, the acknowledged role of synthetic pesticides on direct bird intoxication or food resource depletion urges us to seek alternative crop protection methods. Pest exclusion netting systems have recently gained popularity among fruit growers as an efficient means of reducing pest attacks, allowing their transition to organic farming. Single-row exclusion nets, which only cover fruit trees and leave uncovered both the inter-row grassy strips and the hedges, are increasingly being used in apple orchards of Southern Europe. However, net-induced effects on wildlife remain unknown. This study is the first to assess the impacts of single-row exclusion nets on breeding bird communities. We hypothesized that the exclusion net effects would be weaker than those associated with synthetic pesticide use, except for bird species that forage in the tree canopy. We monitored breeding bird abundance, and species richness in 46 commercial apple orchards managed using integrated pest management (IPM) or organic standards with or without exclusion nets. We counted 705 birds belonging to 32 different species. Total bird abundance, the number of observed species, and the Chao1 estimate of species richness were influenced by orchard management strategy. Breeding bird assemblages in organic orchards were as numerous and diverse in both the presence and absence of exclusion nets. In contrast, both bird abundance and species richness were significantly decreased in IPM orchards. The abundance and species richness of bird assemblages and the abundance of a few individual species also increased with the number of hedgerows bordering the orchards. Our results demonstrate that single-row netting systems for organic farming represent an effective pest control strategy with no significant impact on bird communities and highlight the importance of hedgerows along the orchards’ edges.",
