Adaptive immunity, on the other hand, is antigen-dependent and antigen-specific; it has the capacity for memory, which enables the host to mount a more rapid and efficient immune response upon subsequent exposure to the antigen. There is a great deal of synergy between the adaptive immune system and its innate counterpart, and defects in either system can provoke illness or disease, such as inappropriate inflammation, autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiency disorders and hypersensitivity reactions.

    "abstract": "Neutrophils are critical inflammatory cells that cause tissue damage in a range of diseases and disorders. Being bone marrow-derived white blood cells, they migrate from the bloodstream to sites of tissue inflammation in response to chemotactic signals and induce inflammation by undergoing receptor-mediated respiratory burst and degranulation. Degranulation from neutrophils has been implicated as a major causative factor in pulmonary disorders, including severe asphyxic episodes of asthma. However, the mechanisms that control neutrophil degranulation are not well understood. Recent observations indicate that granule release from neutrophils depends on activation of intracellular signalling pathways, including beta-arrestins, the Rho guanosine triphosphatase Rac2, soluble NSF attachment protein (SNAP) receptors, the src family of tyrosine kinases, and the tyrosine phosphatase MEG2. Some of these observations suggest that degranulation from neutrophils is selective and depends on nonredundant signalling pathways. This review focuses on new findings from the literature on the mechanisms that control the release of granule-derived mediators from neutrophils.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The panallergen concept encompasses families of related proteins, which are involved in general vital processes and thus, widely distributed throughout nature. Plant panallergens share highly conserved sequence regions, structure, and function. They are responsible for many IgE cross-reactions even between unrelated pollen and plant food allergen sources. Although usually considered as minor allergens, sensitization to panallergens might be problematic as it bears the risk of developing multiple sensitizations. Clinical manifestations seem to be tightly connected with geographical and exposure factors. Future population- and disease-based screenings should provide new insights on panallergens and their contribution to disease manifestations. Such information requires molecule-based diagnostics and will be valuable for developing patient-tailored prophylactic and therapeutic approaches. In this article, we focus on profilins, non-specific lipid transfer proteins, polcalcins, and Bet v 1-related proteins and discuss possible consequences of panallergen sensitization for the allergic patient. Based on their pattern of IgE cross-reactivity, which is reflected by their distribution in the plant kingdom, we propose a novel classification of panallergens into ubiquitously spread \"real panallergens\" (e.g. profilins) and widespread \"eurallergens\" (e.g. polcalcins). \"Stenallergens\" display more limited distribution and cross-reactivity patterns, and \"monallergens\" are restricted to a single allergen source.",

These guidelines describe controversies in the management of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) and include recommendations that take into account changes in the bacteriologic landscape. Recent guidelines in ABRS have been released by American and European groups as recently as 2007, but these are either limited in their coverage of the subject of CRS, do not follow an evidence-based strategy, or omit relevant stakeholders in guidelines development, and do not address the particulars of the Canadian healthcare environment.Advances in understanding the pathophysiology of CRS, along with the development of appropriate therapeutic strategies, have improved outcomes for patients with CRS. CRS now affects large numbers of patients globally and primary care practitioners are confronted by this disease on a daily basis. Although initially considered a chronic bacterial infection, CRS is now recognized as having multiple distinct components (eg, infection, inflammation), which have led to changes in therapeutic approaches (eg, increased use of corticosteroids). The role of bacteria in the persistence of chronic infections, and the roles of surgical and medical management are evolving. Although evidence is limited, guidance for managing patients with CRS would help practitioners less experienced in this area offer rational care. It is no longer reasonable to manage CRS as a prolonged version of ARS, but rather, specific therapeutic strategies adapted to pathogenesis must be developed and diffused.Guidelines must take into account all available evidence and incorporate these in an unbiased fashion into management recommendations based on the quality of evidence, therapeutic benefit, and risks incurred. This document is focused on readability rather than completeness, yet covers relevant information, offers summaries of areas where considerable evidence exists, and provides recommendations with an assessment of strength of the evidence base and degree of endorsement by the multidisciplinary expert group preparing the document.These guidelines have been copublished in both Allergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology and the Journal of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.",

    "abstract": "Multiple studies have demonstrated that early-life exposure to pets or siblings affords protection against allergic disease; these associations are commonly attributed to the \"hygiene hypothesis\". Recently, low diversity of the infant gut microbiota has also been linked to allergic disease. In this study, we characterize the infant gut microbiota in relation to pets and siblings.The study population comprised a small sub-sample of 24 healthy, full term infants from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) birth cohort. Mothers reported on household pets and siblings. Fecal samples were collected at 4 months of age, and microbiota composition was characterized by high-throughput signature gene sequencing.Microbiota richness and diversity tended to be increased in infants living with pets, whereas these measures were decreased in infants with older siblings. Infants living with pets exhibited under-representation of Bifidobacteriaceae and over-representation of Peptostreptococcaceae; infants with older siblings exhibited under-representation of Peptostreptococcaceae.This study provides new evidence that exposure to pets and siblings may influence the early development of the gut microbiota, with potential implications for allergic disease. These two traditionally protective \"hygiene hypothesis\" factors appear to differentially impact gut microbiota composition and diversity, calling into question the clinical significance of these measures. Further research is required to confirm and expand these findings.",

To evaluate the inhaler technique among asthmatic patients seen in ED, and to investigate the characteristics of these patients and factors associated with improper use of inhaler devices and its relationship with asthma control and ED visits. A cross-sectional study of all the patients who visited the ED with bronchial asthma attacks over a 9-month period was undertaken at two major academic hospitals in Saudi Arabia. Information was collected about demographic data and asthma management and we assessed the inhaler techniques for each patient using an inhaler technique checklist. A total of 450 asthma patients were included in the study. Of these, 176(39.1%) were males with a mean age of 42.3 ±16.7 years and the mean duration of asthma was 155.9 ± 127.1 weeks. The improper use of asthma inhaler devices was observed in 203(45%) of the patients and was associated with irregular clinic follow-ups (p = 0.0001), lack of asthma education (p = 0.0009), uncontrolled asthma ACT (score ≤ 15) (p = 0.001), three or more ED visits (p = 0.0497), and duration of asthma of less than 52 weeks (p = 0.005). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that a lack of education about asthma disease (OR =1.65; 95% CI: 1.07, 2.54) or a lack of regular follow-up (OR =1.73; 95% CI: 1.08, 2.76) was more likely to lead to the improper use of an asthma inhaler device. Improper asthma inhaler device use is associated with poor asthma control and more frequent ED visits. We also identified many avoidable risk factors leading to the improper use of inhaler devices among asthma patients visiting the ED.",

Omalizumab was administered for 8 weeks prior to and 8 weeks following the initiation of a rush mOIT schedule. Home reactions were recorded with diaries.Twenty-five (25) participants were enrolled in the protocol (median age 7 years). For each included food, participants had failed an initial double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge at a protein dose of 100 mg or less. After pre-treatment with omalizumab, 19 participants tolerated all 6 steps of the initial escalation day (up to 1250 mg of combined food proteins), requiring minimal or no rescue therapy. The remaining 6 were started on their highest tolerated dose as their initial daily home doses. Participants reported 401 reactions per 7,530 home doses (5.3%) with a median of 3.2 reactions per 100 doses. Ninety-four percent (94%) of reactions were mild. There was one severe reaction. Participants reached their maintenance dose of 4,000 mg protein per allergen at a median of 18 weeks.These phase 1 data demonstrate that rush OIT to multiple foods with 16 weeks of treatment with omalizumab could allow for a fast desensitization in subjects with multiple food allergies. Phase 2 randomized controlled trials are needed to better define safety and efficacy parameters of multi OIT experimental treatments with and without omalizumab.",

    "abstract": "Primary immunodeficiency disorder (PID) refers to a large heterogeneous group of disorders that result from defects in immune system development and/or function. PIDs are broadly classified as disorders of adaptive immunity (i.e., T cell, B-cell or combined immunodeficiencies) or of innate immunity (e.g., phagocyte and complement disorders). Although the clinical manifestations of PIDs are highly variable, many disorders involve an increased susceptibility to infection. Early consultation with a clinical immunologist is essential, as timely diagnosis and treatment are imperative for preventing significant disease-associated morbidity. PIDs should be suspected in patients with: recurrent sinus or ear infections or pneumonias within a 1 year period; failure to thrive; poor response to prolonged use of antibiotics; persistent thrush or skin abscesses; or a family history of PID. Patients with multiple autoimmune diseases should also be evaluated. Diagnostic testing often involves lymphocyte proliferation assays, flow cytometry, measurement of serum immunoglobulin (Ig) levels, assessment of serum specific antibody titers in response to vaccine antigens, neutrophil function assays, stimulation assays for cytokine responses, and complement studies. The treatment of PIDs is complex and generally requires both supportive and definitive strategies. Ig replacement therapy is the mainstay of therapy for B-cell disorders, and is also an important supportive treatment for many patients with combined immunodeficiency disorders. The disorders affecting the activity of the T-cell arm of the adaptive system, such as severe combined immunodeficiency, require immune reconstitution as soon as possible. The treatment of innate immunodeficiency disorders varies depending on the type of defect, but may involve antifungal and antibiotic prophylaxis, cytokine replacement, vaccinations and bone marrow transplantation. This article provides an overview of the major categories of PIDs and strategies for the appropriate diagnosis and management of these rare disorders.",

Together with DNA methylation, histone modifications (including histone acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, etc.) represent the classical epigenetic mechanisms. However, much less attention has been given to histone modifications than to DNA methylation in the context of allergy. A systematic review of the literature was undertaken to provide an unbiased and comprehensive update on the involvement of histone modifications in allergy and the mechanisms underlying this development. In addition to covering the growing interest in the contribution of histone modifications in regulating the development of allergic diseases, this review summarizes some of the evidence supporting this contribution. There are at least two levels at which the role of histone modifications is manifested. One is the regulation of cells that contribute to the allergic inflammation (T cells and macrophages) and those that participate in airway remodeling [(myo-) fibroblasts]. The other is the direct association between histone modifications and allergic phenotypes. Inhibitors of histone-modifying enzymes may potentially be used as anti-allergic drugs. Furthermore, epigenetic patterns may provide novel tools in the diagnosis of allergic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This is an update to the 2014 Canadian Hereditary Angioedema Guideline with an expanded scope to include the management of hereditary angioedema (HAE) patients worldwide. It is a collaboration of Canadian and international HAE experts and patient groups led by the Canadian Hereditary Angioedema Network. The objective of this guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations, using the GRADE system, for the management of patients with HAE. This includes the treatment of attacks, short-term prophylaxis, long-term prophylaxis, and recommendations for self-administration, individualized therapy, quality of life, and comprehensive care. New to the 2019 version of this guideline are sections covering the diagnosis and recommended therapies for acute treatment in HAE patients with normal C1-INH, as well as sections on pregnant and paediatric patients, patient associations and an HAE registry. Hereditary angioedema results in random and often unpredictable attacks of painful swelling typically affecting the extremities, bowel mucosa, genitals, face and upper airway. Attacks are associated with significant functional impairment, decreased health-related quality of life, and mortality in the case of laryngeal attacks. Caring for patients with HAE can be challenging due to the complexity of this disease. The care of patients with HAE in Canada, as in many countries, continues to be neither optimal nor uniform. It lags behind some other countries where there are more organized models for HAE management, and greater availability of additional licensed therapeutic options. It is anticipated that providing this guideline to caregivers, policy makers, patients, and advocates will not only optimize the management of HAE, but also promote the importance of individualized care. The primary target users of this guideline are healthcare providers who are managing patients with HAE. Other healthcare providers who may use this guideline are emergency and intensive care physicians, primary care physicians, gastroenterologists, dentists, otolaryngologists, paediatricians, and gynaecologists who will encounter patients with HAE and need to be aware of this condition. Hospital administrators, insurers and policy makers may also find this guideline helpful.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Oral immunotherapy (OIT) is an emerging approach to the treatment of patients with IgE-mediated food allergy and is in the process of transitioning to clinical practice. Objective To develop patient-oriented clinical practice guidelines on oral immunotherapy based on evidence and ethical imperatives for the provision of safe and efficient food allergy management. Materials and methods Recommendations were developed using a reflective patient-centered multicriteria approach including 22 criteria organized in five dimensions (clinical, populational, economic, organizational and sociopolitical). Data was obtained from: (1) a review of scientific and ethic literature; (2) consultations of allergists, other healthcare professionals (pediatricians, family physicians, nurses, registered dieticians, psychologists, peer supporters), patients and caregivers; and patient associations through structured consultative panels, interviews and on-line questionnaire; and (3) organizational and economic data from the milieu of care. All data was synthesized by criteria in a multicriteria deliberative guide that served as a platform for structured discussion and development of recommendations for each dimension, based on evidence, ethical imperatives and other considerations. Results The deliberative grid included 162 articles from the literature and media reviews and data from consultations involving 85 individuals. Thirty-eight (38) recommendations were made for the practice of oral immunotherapy for the treatment of IgE mediated food allergy, based on evidence and a diversity of ethical imperatives. All recommendations were aimed at fostering a context conducive to achieving objectives identified by patients and caregivers with food allergy. Notably, specific recommendations were developed to promote a culture of shared responsibility between patients and healthcare system, equity in access, patient empowerment, shared decision making and personalization of OIT protocols to reflect patients’ needs. It also provides recommendations to optimize organization of care to generate capacity to meet demand according to patient choice, e.g. OIT or avoidance. These recommendations were made acknowledging the necessity of ensuring sustainability of the clinical offer in light of various economic considerations. Conclusions This innovative CPG methodology was guided by patients’ perspectives, clinical evidence as well as ethical and other rationales. This allowed for the creation of a broad set of recommendations that chart optimal clinical practice and define the conditions required to bring about changes to food allergy care that will be sustainable, equitable and conducive to the well-being of all patients in need.",

    "abstract": "Quercetin is a naturally occurring polyphenol flavonoid which is rich in antioxidants. It has anti-allergic functions that are known for inhibiting histamine production and pro-inflammatory mediators. Quercetin can regulate the Th1/Th2 stability, and decrease the antigen-specific IgE antibody releasing by B cells. Quercetin has a main role in anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory function which makes it proper for the management of different diseases. Allergic diseases are a big concern and have high health care costs. In addition, the use of current therapies such as ß2-agonists and corticosteroids has been limited for long term use due to their numerous side effects. Since the effect of quercetin on allergic diseases has been widely studied, in the current article, we review the effect of quercetin on allergic diseases, such as allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis (AR), and atopic dermatitis (AD).",

    "abstract": "Urticaria is a group of diseases that share a distinct skin reaction pattern. Triggering of urticaria by infections has been discussed for many years but the exact role and pathogenesis of mast cell activation by infectious processes is unclear. In spontaneous acute urticaria there is no doubt for a causal relationship to infections and all chronic urticaria must have started as acute. Whereas in physical or distinct urticaria subtypes the evidence for infections is sparse, remission of annoying spontaneous chronic urticaria has been reported after successful treatment of persistent infections. Current summarizing available studies that evaluated the course of the chronic urticaria after proven Helicobacter eradication demonstrate a statistically significant benefit compared to untreated patients or Helicobacter-negative controls without urticaria (p < 0.001). Since infections can be easily treated some diagnostic procedures should be included in the routine work-up, especially the search for Helicobacter pylori. This review will update the reader regarding the role of infections in different urticaria subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Acquired angioedema (AAE) is characterized by acquired deficiency of C1 inhibitor (C1-INH), hyperactivation of the classical pathway of human complement and angioedema symptoms mediated by bradykinin released by inappropriate activation of the contact-kinin system. Angioedema recurs at unpredictable intervals, lasts from two to five days and presents with edema of the skin (face, limbs, genitals), severe abdominal pain with edema of the gastrointestinal mucosa, life-threateing edema of the upper respiratory tract and edema of the oral mucosa and of the tongue. AAE recurs in association with various conditions and particularly with different forms of lymphoproliferative disorders. Neutralizing autoantibodies to C1-INH are present in the majority of patients. The therapeutic approach to a patient with AAE should first be aimed to avoid fatalities due to angioedema and then to avoid the disability caused be angioedema recurrences. Acute attacks can be treated with plasma-derived C1-INH, but some patients become non-responsive and in these patients the kallikrein inhibitor ecallantide and the bradykinin receptor antagonist icatibant can be effective. Angioedema prophylaxis is performed using antifibrinolytic agents and attenuated androgens with antifibrinolytic agents providing somewhat better results. Treatment of the associated disease can resolve AAE in some patients.",

    "abstract": ": It is widely believed that stress suppresses immune function and increases susceptibility to infections and cancer. Paradoxically, stress is also known to exacerbate allergic, autoimmune, and inflammatory diseases. These observations suggest that stress may have bidirectional effects on immune function, being immunosuppressive in some instances and immunoenhancing in others. It has recently been shown that in contrast to chronic stress that suppresses or dysregulates immune function, acute stress can be immunoenhancing. Acute stress enhances dendritic cell, neutrophil, macrophage, and lymphocyte trafficking, maturation, and function and has been shown to augment innate and adaptive immune responses. Acute stress experienced prior to novel antigen exposure enhances innate immunity and memory T-cell formation and results in a significant and long-lasting immunoenhancement. Acute stress experienced during antigen reexposure enhances secondary/adaptive immune responses. Therefore, depending on the conditions of immune activation and the immunizing antigen, acute stress may enhance the acquisition and expression of immunoprotection or immunopathology. In contrast, chronic stress dysregulates innate and adaptive immune responses by changing the type 1-type 2 cytokine balance and suppresses immunity by decreasing leukocyte numbers, trafficking, and function. Chronic stress also increases susceptibility to skin cancer by suppressing type 1 cytokines and protective T cells while increasing suppressor T-cell function. We have suggested that the adaptive purpose of a physiologic stress response may be to promote survival, with stress hormones and neurotransmitters serving as beacons that prepare the immune system for potential challenges (eg, wounding or infection) perceived by the brain (eg, detection of an attacker). However, this system may exacerbate immunopathology if the enhanced immune response is directed against innocuous or self-antigens or dysregulated following prolonged activation, as seen during chronic stress. In view of the ubiquitous nature of stress and its significant effects on immunoprotection and immunopathology, it is important to further elucidate the mechanisms mediating stress-immune interactions and to meaningfully translate findings from bench to bedside.",

    "abstract": "Thirty percent of children with food allergy are allergic to more than one food. Previous studies on oral immunotherapy (OIT) for food allergy have focused on the administration of a single allergen at the time. This study aimed at evaluating the safety of a modified OIT protocol using multiple foods at one time.Participants underwent double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFC) up to a cumulative dose of 182 mg of food protein to peanut followed by other nuts, sesame, dairy or egg. Those meeting inclusion criteria for peanut only were started on single-allergen OIT while those with additional allergies had up to 5 foods included in their OIT mix. Reactions during dose escalations and home dosing were recorded in a symptom diary.Forty participants met inclusion criteria on peanut DBPCFC. Of these, 15 were mono-allergic to peanut and 25 had additional food allergies. Rates of reaction per dose did not differ significantly between the two groups (median of 3.3% and 3.7% in multi and single OIT group, respectively; p = .31). In both groups, most reactions were mild but two severe reactions requiring epinephrine occurred in each group. Dose escalations progressed similarly in both groups although, per protocol design, those on multiple food took longer to reach equivalent doses per food (median +4 mo.; p < .0001).Preliminary data show oral immunotherapy using multiple food allergens simultaneously to be feasible and relatively safe when performed in a hospital setting with trained personnel. Additional, larger, randomized studies are required to continue to test safety and efficacy of multi-OIT.Clinicaltrial.gov NCT01490177.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory immune disorder of the airways affecting one in ten children in westernized countries. The geographical disparity combined with a generational rise in prevalence, emphasizes that changing environmental exposures play a significant role in the etiology of this disease. The microflora hypothesis suggests that early life exposures are disrupting the composition of the microbiota and consequently, promoting immune dysregulation in the form of hypersensitivity disorders. Animal model research supports a role of the microbiota in asthma and atopic disease development. Further, these model systems have identified an early life critical window, during which gut microbial dysbiosis is most influential in promoting hypersensitivity disorders. Until recently this critical window had not been characterized in humans, but now studies suggest that the ideal time to use microbes as preventative treatments or diagnostics for asthma in humans is within the first 100 days of life. This review outlines the major mouse-model and human studies leading to characterization of the early life critical window, emphasizing studies analyzing the intestinal and airway microbiotas in asthma and atopic disease. This research has promising future implications regarding childhood immune health, as ultimately it may be possible to therapeutically administer specific microbes in early life to prevent the development of asthma in children.",

    "abstract": "Primary immunodeficiency disorder (PID) refers to a heterogeneous group of over 130 disorders that result from defects in immune system development and/or function. PIDs are broadly classified as disorders of adaptive immunity (i.e., T-cell, B-cell or combined immunodeficiencies) or of innate immunity (e.g., phagocyte and complement disorders). Although the clinical manifestations of PIDs are highly variable, most disorders involve at least an increased susceptibility to infection. Early diagnosis and treatment are imperative for preventing significant disease-associated morbidity and, therefore, consultation with a clinical immunologist is essential. PIDs should be suspected in patients with: recurrent sinus or ear infections or pneumonias within a 1 year period; failure to thrive; poor response to prolonged use of antibiotics; persistent thrush or skin abscesses; or a family history of PID. Patients with multiple autoimmune diseases should also be evaluated. Diagnostic testing often involves lymphocyte proliferation assays, flow cytometry, measurement of serum immunoglobulin (Ig) levels, assessment of serum specific antibody titers in response to vaccine antigens, neutrophil function assays, stimulation assays for cytokine responses, and complement studies. The treatment of PIDs is complex and generally requires both supportive and definitive strategies. Ig replacement therapy is the mainstay of therapy for B-cell disorders, and is also an important supportive treatment for many patients with combined immunodeficiency disorders. The heterogeneous group of disorders involving the T-cell arm of the adaptive system, such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), require immune reconstitution as soon as possible. The treatment of innate immunodeficiency disorders varies depending on the type of defect, but may involve antifungal and antibiotic prophylaxis, cytokine replacement, vaccinations and bone marrow transplantation. This article provides a detailed overview of the major categories of PIDs and strategies for the appropriate diagnosis and management of these rare disorders.",

Expression of SLPI decreased inflammation in the lungs, plasma IgE levels, and lung resistance, whereas the ablation of SLPI has the opposite effect. Treatment with resiquimod improved airway resistance and inflammation of the lungs in SLPI knockout and wild type, demonstrating that its effect is independent of the expression of SLPI. Conclusions SLPI plays an immunoregulatory role in the respiratory tract by reducing the inflammatory process and by improving lung physiology in a murine model of acute allergic asthma.",

Although the pathogenesis of the disorder is not completely understood, it appears to result from the complex interplay between defects in skin barrier function, environmental and infectious agents, and immune dysregulation. There are no diagnostic tests for AD; therefore, the diagnosis is based on specific clinical criteria that take into account the patient's history and clinical manifestations. Successful management of the disorder requires a multifaceted approach that involves education, optimal skin care practices, anti-inflammatory treatment with topical corticosteroids and/or topical calcineurin inhibitors, the management of pruritus, and the treatment of skin infections. Systemic immunosuppressive agents may also be used, but are generally reserved for severe flare-ups or more difficult-to-control disease. Topical corticosteroids are the first-line pharmacologic treatments for AD, and evidence suggests that these agents may also be beneficial for the prophylaxis of disease flare-ups. Although the prognosis for patients with AD is generally favourable, those patients with severe, widespread disease and concomitant atopic conditions, such as asthma and allergic rhinitis, are likely to experience poorer outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is the most common respiratory disorder in Canada. Despite significant improvement in the diagnosis and management of this disorder, the majority of Canadians with asthma remain poorly controlled. In most patients, however, control can be achieved through the use of avoidance measures and appropriate pharmacological interventions. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) represent the standard of care for the majority of patients. Combination ICS/long-acting beta2-agonist inhalers are preferred for most adults who fail to achieve control with ICS therapy. Biologic therapies targeting immunoglobulin E or interleukin-5 are recent additions to the asthma treatment armamentarium and may be useful in select cases of difficult to control asthma. Allergen-specific immunotherapy represents a potentially disease-modifying therapy for many patients with asthma, but should only be prescribed by physicians with appropriate training in allergy. In addition to avoidance measures and pharmacotherapy, essential components of asthma management include: regular monitoring of asthma control using objective testing measures such as spirometry, whenever feasible; creation of written asthma action plans; assessing barriers to treatment and adherence to therapy; and reviewing inhaler device technique.

The objectives of our study were to examine all cases of fatal anaphylaxis in Ontario to determine cause of death, associated features, co factors and trends in mortality. The identification of these factors is important for developing effective strategies to overcome gaps in monitoring and treatment of patients with food allergies and risk for anaphylaxis. This was a retrospective case-series analysis of all causes of anaphylaxis-related deaths using data from the Ontario Coroner's database between 1986 and 2011. Quantitative data (e.g. demographic) were analyzed using descriptive statistics and frequency analysis using SPSS. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis of grounded theory methodology. We found 92 deaths in the last 26 years related to anaphylaxis. Causes of death, in order of decreasing frequency, included food (40 cases), insect venom (30 cases), iatrogenic (16 cases), and idiopathic (6 cases). Overall, there appears to be a decline in the frequency of food related deaths, but an increase in iatrogenic causes of fatalities. We found factors associated with fatal anaphylaxis included: delayed epinephrine administration, asthma, allergy to peanut, food ingestion outside the home, and teenagers with food allergies. Our findings indicate the need to improve epinephrine auto-injector use in acute reactions, particularly for teens and asthmatics with food allergies. In addition, education can be improved among food service workers and food industry in order to help food allergic patients avoid potentially fatal allergens. The increasing trend in iatrogenic related anaphylaxis is concerning, and requires monitoring and more investigation.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetics of asthma and allergic disease is a field that has expanded greatly in the last decade. Previously thought only in terms of cell differentiation, it is now evident the epigenetics regulate many processes. With T cell activation, commitment toward an allergic phenotype is tightly regulated by DNA methylation and histone modifications at the Th2 locus control region. When normal epigenetic control is disturbed, either experimentally or by environmental exposures, Th1/Th2 balance can be affected. Epigenetic marks are not only transferred to daughter cells with cell replication but they can also be inherited through generations. In animal models, with constant environmental pressure, epigenetically determined phenotypes are amplified through generations and can last up to 2 generations after the environment is back to normal. In this review on the epigenetic regulation of asthma and allergic diseases we review basic epigenetic mechanisms and discuss the epigenetic control of Th2 cells. We then cover the transgenerational inheritance model of epigenetic traits and discuss how this could relate the amplification of asthma and allergic disease prevalence and severity through the last decades. Finally, we discuss recent epigenetic association studies for allergic phenotypes and related environmental risk factors as well as potential underlying mechanisms for these associations.",

Symptoms and signs of ocular allergy can lead to decreased productivity and negatively impact quality of life (QoL). Various treatment options exist to achieve symptom control. For allergic conjunctivitis, ophthalmic agents include antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, dual-activity agents, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), steroids and some off-label treatments. Immunotherapy is recommended as a therapeutic option. This review provides a summary of the forms of ocular allergies, with a focus on symptoms and signs, impact on QoL, physical examination, diagnosis and therapeutic options of allergic conjunctivitis. Through multidisciplinary collaborations, a simplified algorithm for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis is proposed for Canadian clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "The human microbiome can be defined as the microorganisms that reside within and on our bodies and how they interact with the environment. Recent research suggests that numerous mutually beneficial interactions occur between a human and their microbiome, including those that are essential for good health. Modern microbiological detection techniques have contributed to new knowledge about microorganisms in their human environment. These findings reveal that the microbiomes of the lung and gut contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma and allergy. For example, evidence indicates that the microbiome of the gut regulates the activities of helper T cell subsets (Th1 and Th2) that affect the development of immune tolerance. Moreover, recent studies demonstrate differences between the lung microbiomes of healthy and asthmatic subjects. The hygiene and biodiversity hypotheses explain how exposure to microorganisms is associated with asthma and allergy. Although those living in developed countries are exposed to fewer and less diverse microorganisms compared with the inhabitants of developing countries, they are experiencing an increase in the incidence of asthma and allergies. Detailed analyses of the human microbiome, as are being conducted under the auspices of the Human Microbiome Project initiated in 2007, promise to contribute insights into the mechanisms and factors that cause asthma and allergy that may lead to the development of strategies to prevent and treat these diseases.",

    "abstract": "Drug allergy encompasses a spectrum of immunologically-mediated hypersensitivity reactions with varying mechanisms and clinical presentations. This type of adverse drug reaction not only affects patient quality of life, but may also lead to delayed treatment, unnecessary investigations, and even mortality. Given the myriad of symptoms associated with the condition, diagnosis is often challenging. Therefore, referral to an allergist experienced in the identification, diagnosis and management of drug allergy is recommended if a drug-induced allergic reaction is suspected. Diagnosis relies on a careful history and physical examination and, in some instances, skin testing and graded challenges. Induction of drug tolerance procedures may also be required. The most effective strategy for the management of drug allergy is avoidance or discontinuation of the offending drug. When available, alternative medications with unrelated chemical structures should be substituted. Cross-reactivity among drugs should be taken into consideration when choosing alternative agents. Additional therapy for drug hypersensitivity reactions is largely supportive and may include topical corticosteroids, oral antihistamines and, in severe cases, systemic corticosteroids. In the event of anaphylaxis, the treatment of choice is injectable epinephrine. If a particular drug to which the patient is allergic is indicated and there is no suitable alternative, induction of drug tolerance procedures may be considered to induce temporary tolerance to the drug. This article provides a background on drug allergy and strategies for the diagnosis and management of some of the most common drug-induced allergic reactions, such as penicillin, sulfonamides, cephalosporins, radiocontrast media, local anesthetics, general anesthetics, acetylsalicylic acid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies.",

    "abstract": "The heterogeneous nature of asthma has been understood for decades, but the precise categorization of asthma has taken on new clinical importance in the era of specific biologic therapy. The simple categories of allergic and non-allergic asthma have given way to more precise phenotypes that hint at underlying biologic mechanisms of variable airflow limitation and airways inflammation. Understanding these mechanisms is of particular importance for the approximately 10% of patients with severe asthma. Biomarkers that aid in phenotyping allow physicians to \"personalize\" treatment with targeted biologic agents. Unfortunately, testing for these biomarkers is not routine in patients whose asthma is refractory to standard therapy. Scientific advances in the recognition of sensitive and specific biomarkers are steadily outpacing the clinical availability of reliable and non-invasive assessment methods designed for the prompt and specific diagnosis, classification, treatment, and monitoring of severe asthma patients. This article provides a practical overview of current biomarkers and testing methods for prompt, effective management of patients with severe asthma that is refractory to standard therapy.",

The Allergic Rhinitis - Clinical Investigator Collaborative (AR-CIC) aims to optimize the protocol, ensuring reliability and repeatability of symptoms to better evaluate the therapies under investigation.20 AR participants were challenged, with 4-fold increments of their respective allergens every 15 minutes, to determine the qualifying allergen concentration (QAC) at which the Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) of ≥10/12 OR a Peak Nasal Inspiratory Flow (PNIF) reduction of ≥50% from baseline was achieved. At the NAC visit, the QAC was used in a single challenge and TNSS and PNIF were recorded at baseline, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, and hourly up to 12 hours. 10 additional ragweed allergic participants were qualified at TNSS of ≥8/12 AND ≥50% PNIF reduction; the Cumulative Allergen Challenge (CAC) of all incremental doses was used during the NAC visit. 4 non-allergic participants were challenged with the highest allergen concentration.In the QAC study, a group qualified by only meeting PNIF criteria achieved lower TNSS than those achieving either TNSS criteria or PNIIF+TNSS (p<0.01). During the NAC visit, participants in both studies reached their peak symptoms at 15minutes followed by a gradual decline, significantly different from non-allergic participants. The \"PNIF only\" group experienced significantly lower TNSS than the other groups during NAC visit. QAC and CAC participants did not reach the same peak TNSS during NAC that was achieved at screening. QAC participants qualifying based on TNSS or TNSS+PNIF managed to maintain PNIF scores.Participants experienced reliable symptoms of AR in both studies, using both TNSS and PNIF reduction as part of the qualifying criteria proved better for qualifying participants at screening. Phenotyping based on pattern of symptoms experienced is possible and allows the study of AR pathophysiology and can be applied in evaluation of efficacy of a novel medication. The AR-CIC aims to continue to improve the model and employ it in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials.",

Older, first-generation AHs (e.g. diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine) have significant and common side effects including sedation, impairment with decreased cognitive function, poor sleep quality, dry mouth, dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension. These drugs have also been found to result in death from accidents, intentional or unintentional overdoses, and sudden cardiac death. The unfavourable risk-benefit profile of first-generation AHs led to the development of newer, less-sedating second- and third-generation AHs, which first became available in Canada in the 1980s. High-quality trials have proven that newer generation AHs are superior in safety compared to older first-generation AHs. On average, they have improved potency and efficacy. Second- and third-generation AHs are the recommended first-line treatment for mild allergic rhinitis and acute and chronic urticaria. Despite this evidence, older first-generation AHs continue to be over-utilized because of their over-the-counter (OTC) status and long history of use. The Canadian Society of Allergy Clinical Immunology (CSACI) recommends that newer generation AHs should be preferred over first-generation AHs for the treatment of allergic rhino-conjunctivitis and urticaria. To promote this recommendation, education of health professionals and the public is necessary. Further, given the dangers of older first-generation AHs, we believe they should be used only as a last resort with eventual consideration given to having them only available behind the counter in pharmacies.",

    "abstract": "Many studies have identified associations between qualities of maternal-child relationships and childhood asthma, but few have examined associations with childhood atopic dermatitis (AD), a common precursor to asthma. Moreover, maternal psychological distress, including prenatal and postnatal depression, anxiety and stress, may increase risk, while social support from partners may reduce risk for childhood AD. We sought to uncover the association between maternal-infant relationship qualities (maternal sensitivity towards infant behavioral signals, controlling behavior, and unresponsiveness) and child AD after accounting for risk (i.e., prenatal and postnatal maternal depression, anxiety and stress) and protective (i.e., social support) factors.We conducted a secondary analysis of data collected on a subsample of 242 women and their infants enrolled during pregnancy in the ongoing Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition cohort study. Inclusion criteria required mothers to be >16 years of age, English speaking and <22 weeks gestational age at enrollment. Data on depression, anxiety and stress in the prenatal and postnatal periods and physician diagnosis of childhood AD at 18 months were gathered via maternal report. Maternal sensitivity, unresponsiveness and controlling behaviours were assessed via videotaped observations using the Child-Adult Relationship Experimental (CARE)-Index at 6 months of infant age.Higher maternal sensitivity, or the inability of the mother to appropriately understand and respond to infant needs based on behavioral signals, predicted reduced odds of AD independent of and in combination with low prenatal and postnatal anxiety and high paternal support. After adjustment, higher maternal controlling behaviours and unresponsiveness also predicted greater odds of AD.Low maternal sensitivity is a risk factor for childhood AD, independently and in combination with perinatal anxiety and low social support. Thus, interventions that improve maternal-infant relationship quality, especially sensitivity, reduce anxiety and improve social support from partners could reduce odds of childhood AD.",

In particular, we consider how a new AR preparation, MP-AzeFlu (Dymista®, Meda, Sweden), comprising a formulation of an intranasal antihistamine (azelastine hydrochloride), an intranasal corticosteroid (fluticasone propionate), and excipients delivered in a single spray, may offer benefits over and above single and multiple AR therapy options.

The present study was conducted to determine the association between SC and childhood asthma. Material and method The present study was conducted based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. All the steps of the study were conducted independently by two reviewers from the inception until February 1, 2019. In case of disagreement, the third reviewer resolved it. We searched international online databases, including Scopus, Cochrane Library, PubMed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science (ISI), Science Direct, and Google scholar. The results of studies were combined using random effects model, and heterogeneity was measured through I 2 index and Cochran’s Q test. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software was used for meta-analysis. The significance level of all tests was considered to be P &lt; 0.05. Results The heterogeneity rate was high (I 2 = 67.31%, P &lt; 0.001) in 37 studies. The results showed that SC increased the risk of childhood asthma (RR (relative risk) = 1.20 [95% CI 1.15–1.25, P &lt; 0.001]). The association between emergency and elective SC and childhood asthma was significant with RR of 1.18 (95% CI 1.07–1.29, P &lt; 0.001) in 13 studies and 1.23 (95% CI 1.20–1.26, P &lt; 0.001) in 13 studies, respectively. The subgroup analysis for RR of childhood asthma in SC indicated that study design (P = 0.306), prospective/retrospective studies (P = 0.470), quality of studies (P = 0.514), continent (P = 0.757), age of diagnosis (P = 0.283) and year of publication (P = 0.185) were not effective in the heterogeneity of studies. Sensitivity analysis by removing one study at a time indicated that the overall estimate is robust. Conclusion According to the meta-analysis, SC (overall, elective, and emergency) increased the risk of childhood asthma. Therefore, it is hoped that developing clinical guidelines and implementing appropriate management plans would diminish the risk of asthma.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disease characterized by unpredictable, potentially life-threatening attacks, resulting in significant physical and emotional burdens for patients and families. To optimize care for patients with HAE, an individualized management plan should be considered in partnership with the physician, requiring comprehensive assessment of the patient’s frequency and severity of attacks, disease burden, and therapeutic control. Although several guidelines and consensus papers have been published concerning the diagnosis and treatment of HAE, there has been limited specific clinical guidance on the assessment of disease burden and quality of life (QoL) in this patient population. Practical guidance is critical in supporting effective long-term clinical management of HAE and improving patient outcomes. The objective of this review is to provide evidence-based guidelines for an individualized assessment of disease burden and QoL in patients with HAE. Methods A consensus meeting was held on February 29, 2020, consisting of 9 HAE experts from the United States and Europe with extensive clinical experience in the treatment of HAE. Consensus statements were developed based on a preliminary literature review and discussions from the consensus meeting. Results Final statements reflect the consensus of the expert panel and include the assessment of attack severity, evaluation of disease burden, and long-term clinical management of HAE caused by C1-esterase inhibitor deficiency. Patient-reported outcome measures for assessing HAE attack severity and frequency are available and valuable tools; however, attack frequency and severity are insufficient markers of disease severity unless they are evaluated in the broader context of the effect on an individual patient’s QoL. QoL assessments should be individualized for each patient and minimally, they should address the interference of HAE with work, school, social, family, and physical activity, along with access to and burden of HAE treatment. Advances in HAE therapies offer the opportunity for comprehensive, individualized treatment plans, allowing patients to achieve minimal attack burden with reduced disease and treatment burden. Conclusion This consensus report builds on existing guidelines by expanding the assessment of disease burden and QoL measures for patients with HAE.",

    "abstract": "Primary immunodeficiencies (PI), which include more than 450 single-gene inborn errors of immunity and may affect up to 1% of the population, are genetic disorders that impair the immune system. If not properly identified and treated, individuals with PI are subject to serious, prolonged, and sometimes life-threatening infections or autoimmunity. Despite advancements, awareness of PI remains a critical issue for physicians and the public alike, as this leads to the enhanced and expedited management of these conditions. To address this critical issue, the Jeffrey Modell Foundation (JMF) formed a global network of specialized centers. The goal of this endeavor was to raise awareness of PI to better identify, diagnose, and treat patients, reducing associated mortality and morbidity and improving quality of life (QOL). For more than two decades, the Jeffrey Modell Centers Network (JMCN) has served as the foundation upon which these goals have been pursued. The JMCN currently includes 909 Expert Physicians at 400 institutions, in 316 cities, and 86 countries spanning six continents.A survey was developed by JMF for members of the JMCN, following the most recent Classification of PI from the IUIS Expert Committee, to periodically describe the patient population, including treatment modalities and demographics. Physician-reported data from 2021 was compared to that from 2018 and 2013. Physicians in the JMCN also reported on select outcomes of their PI patients one year prior to and one year following diagnosis.A total of 300 JMF Physician Surveys from 681 physicians were included in this analysis. This is a 75% physician response rate. From 2013 to 2021, there was a 96.3% increase in patients followed in the US and an 86.1% increase globally. During the same period, patients identified with a specific PI defect increased by 46.6% in the US and 47.9% globally. Patients receiving IgG and HSCT increased by 110% and 201% respectfully since 2013. Early diagnosis led to reported decreased morbidity and mortality and reduced calculated healthcare costs.This global analysis of physician-reported data on patients with PI demonstrates an increase in both diagnosed and treated patients. This substantial increase from within the JMCN is a testament to its impact. In addition to building an extensive global patient database, the expanding JMCN serves as a unique and critical resource, providing the infrastructure for earliest diagnosis, optimized treatments, and implementation of standard-of-care and best practices. The JMCN provides a critical platform that facilitates the education of physicians and patients, awareness initiatives, and research advances, through collaboration and connectivity, ultimately resulting in improved outcomes and QOL for patients with PI. The JMCN has steadily and substantially grown for more than two decades and continues to substantively impact the field of Immunology globally.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Primary immunodeficiencies (PID), now often referred to as inborn errors of immunity (IEI), are a large heterogeneous group of disorders that result from deficiencies in immune system development and/or function. IEIs can be broadly classified as disorders of adaptive immunity (e.g., combined or humoral immunodeficiencies) or of innate immunity (e.g., phagocyte and complement disorders). Although the clinical manifestations of IEIs are highly variable, traditionally many disorders involve an increased susceptibility to infection. Research in recent years has underscored how IEI can present with features other than infection such as: severe atopy, autoimmunity, autoinflammation, lymphoproliferation, and/or malignancy resulting from immune dysregulation. Early consultation with a clinical immunologist is essential, as timely diagnosis and treatment are imperative for preventing significant disease-associated morbidity and mortality. The treatment of IEIs is complex and generally requires both supportive and definitive strategies, including but not limited to, immunoglobulin replacement therapy, antibiotic prophylaxis, immune response modifiers, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This article provides an overview of the major categories of IEIs and strategies for the appropriate diagnosis and management of these disorders.",

In 2000, families with hereditary angioedema, normal C1 inhibitor activity and protein in plasma were described. Since then numerous patients and families with that condition have been reported. Most of the patients by far were women. In many of the affected women, oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy containing estrogens, and pregnancies triggered the clinical symptoms. Recently, in some families mutations in the coagulation factor XII (Hageman factor) gene were detected in the affected persons.",

    "abstract": "Hereditary angioedema (HAE) resulting from the deficiency of the C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) is a rare, life-threatening disorder. It is characterized by attacks of angioedema involving the skin and/or the mucosa of the upper airways, as well as the intestinal mucosa. In approximately 50 per cent of cases, clinical manifestations may appear during childhood. The complex management of HAE in pediatric patients is in many respects different from the management of adults. Establishing the diagnosis early, preferably before the onset of clinical symptoms, is essential in cases with a positive family history. Complement studies usually afford accurate diagnosis, whereas molecular genetics tests may prove helpful in uncertain cases. Appropriate therapy, supported by counselling, suitable modification of lifestyle, and avoidance of triggering factors (which primarily include mechanical trauma, mental stress and airway infections in children) may spare the patient unnecessary surgery and may prevent mortality. Prompt control of edematous attacks, short-term prophylaxis and intermittent therapy are recommended as the primary means for the management of pediatric cases. Medicinal products currently used for the treatment of children with hereditary angioedema include antifibrinolytics, attenuated androgens, and C1-INH replacement therapy. Current guidelines favour antifibrinolytics for long-term prophylaxis because of their favorable safety profile but efficacy may be lacking. Attenuated androgens administered in the lowest effective dose are another option. C1-INH replacement therapy is also an effective and safe agent for children. Regular monitoring and follow-up of patients are necessary.",

As in many illnesses, psychological variables may affect outcome in asthma via their effects on treatment adherence and symptom reporting. Emerging evidence suggests that the relation between asthma and psychological factors may be more complex than that, however. Central cognitive processes may influence not only the interpretation of asthma symptoms but also the manifestation of measurable changes in immune and physiologic markers of asthma. Furthermore, asthma and major depressive disorder share several risk factors and have similar patterns of dysregulation in key biologic systems, including the neuroendocrine stress response, cytokines, and neuropeptides. Despite the evidence that depression is common in people with asthma and exerts a negative impact on outcome, few treatment studies have examined whether improving symptoms of depression do, in fact, result in better control of asthma symptoms or improved quality of life in patients with asthma.",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common, chronic skin disorder that can significantly impact the quality of life of affected individuals as well as their families. Although the pathogenesis of the disorder is not completely understood, it appears to result from the complex interplay between defects in skin barrier function, environmental and infectious agents, and immune abnormalities. There are no specific diagnostic tests for AD; therefore, the diagnosis is based on specific clinical criteria that take into account the patient's history and clinical manifestations. Successful management of the disorder requires a multifaceted approach that involves education, optimal skin care practices, anti-inflammatory treatment with topical corticosteroids and/or topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), the use of first-generation antihistamines to help manage sleep disturbances, and the treatment of skin infections. Systemic corticosteroids may also be used, but are generally reserved for the acute treatment of severe flare-ups. Topical corticosteroids are the first-line pharmacologic treatments for AD, and evidence suggests that these agents may also be beneficial for the prophylaxis of disease flare-ups. Although the prognosis for patients with AD is generally favourable, those patients with severe, widespread disease and concomitant atopic conditions, such as asthma and allergic rhinitis, are likely to experience poorer outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are the most effective anti-inflammatory agents available for the treatment of asthma and represent the mainstay of therapy for most patients with the disease. Although these medications are considered safe at low-to-moderate doses, safety concerns with prolonged use of high ICS doses remain; among these concerns is the risk of adrenal suppression (AS). AS is a condition characterized by the inability to produce adequate amounts of the glucocorticoid, cortisol, which is critical during periods of physiological stress. It is a proven, yet under-recognized, complication of most forms of glucocorticoid therapy that can persist for up to 1 year after cessation of corticosteroid treatment. If left unnoticed, AS can lead to significant morbidity and even mortality. More than 60 recent cases of AS have been described in the literature and almost all cases have involved children being treated with ≥500 μg/day of fluticasone.The risk for AS can be minimized through increased awareness and early recognition of at-risk patients, regular patient follow-up to ensure that the lowest effective ICS doses are being utilized to control asthma symptoms, and by choosing an ICS medication with minimal adrenal effects. Screening for AS should be considered in any child with symptoms of AS, children using high ICS doses, or those with a history of prolonged oral corticosteroid use. Cases of AS should be managed in consultation with a pediatric endocrinologist whenever possible. In patients with proven AS, stress steroid dosing during times of illness or surgery is needed to simulate the protective endogenous elevations in cortisol levels that occur with physiological stress.This article provides an overview of current literature on AS as well as practical recommendations for the prevention, screening and management of this serious complication of ICS therapy.",

Second-generation, non-sedating H1-receptor antihistamines represent the mainstay of therapy for both acute and chronic urticaria. Angioedema can occur in the absence of urticaria, with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced angioedema and idiopathic angioedema being the more common causes. Rarer causes are hereditary angioedema (HAE) or acquired angioedema (AAE).

Other problems experienced were fatigue (46%), poor concentration (32%), and reduced productivity (23%). Most (77%) had not seen a physician in the past year. Physicians estimated they prescribed intranasal cortico steroids (INCS) to most AR patients (77%) consistent with guidelines but only 19% of patients had used one in the last month. Only 48% of patients were very satisfied with their current INCS. 41% of AR patients reported discontinuing their INCS with the most common reason being a perceived lack of long-lasting symptom relief (44%). 52% of patients felt that their current INCS lost effectiveness over 24 h. The most common INCS side effects included dripping down the throat, bad taste, and dryness. Most AR patients reported lifestyle limitations despite treatment (66%). 61% of patients felt that their symptoms were only somewhat controlled or poorly/not controlled during their worst month in the past year.AR symptoms are common and many patients experience inadequate control. Physicians report they commonly prescribe intranasal corticosteroids, but patient's perceived loss of efficacy and side effects lead to their discontinuation.

However, management approaches to allergen immunotherapy (AIT) in polysensitized and polyallergic patients are not standardized. An international group of clinicians with in-depth expertise in AIT product development, clinical trials and clinical practice met to generate up-to-date, unambiguous, pragmatic guidance on AIT in polysensitized and polyallergic patients. The guidance was developed after reviewing (1) the current stance of regulatory bodies and learned societies, (2) the literature data on single- and multi-AIT and (3) the members' confirmed clinical experience with polysensitized patients. AIT is safe and effective in polysensitized and polyallergic patients, and should always be based on the identification of one or more clinically relevant allergens (based on the type and severity of symptoms, the duration of induced symptoms, the impact on quality of life and how difficult an allergen is to avoid). Single-AIT is recommended in polyallergic patients in whom one of the relevant allergens is nevertheless clearly responsible for the most intense and/or bothersome symptoms. Parallel 2-allergen immunotherapy or mixed 2-allergen immunotherapy is indicated in polyallergic patients in whom two causal relevant allergens have a marked clinical and QoL impact. In parallel 2-allergen immunotherapy (whether subcutaneous or sublingual), high-quality, standardized, single-allergen formulations must be administered with an interval of 30 min. Mixing of allergen extracts may be considered, as long as (1) the mixture is technically feasible, (2) the mixture is allowed from a regulatory standpoint, (3) the allergen doses are reduced in proportion to the number of components but are still at concentrations with demonstrated efficacy. Physicians can prescribe AIT (preferably with high-quality, standardized, single-allergen formulations) with confidence in polysensitized and polyallergic patients by focusing on clinical/QoL relevance and safety.",

Angioedema can occur in the absence of urticaria and can be broadly divided into histamine-mediated and non-histamine-mediated angioedema. Histamine-mediated angioedema can be allergic, pseudoallergic or idiopathic. Non-histamine mediated angioedema is largely driven by bradykinin and can be hereditary, acquired or drug-induced, such as with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Although bradykinin-mediated angioedema is often self-limited, laryngeal involvement can lead to fatal asphyxiation. The mainstay of management for angioedema is to avoid specific triggers, if possible.

Attacks are associated with significant functional impairment, decreased Health Related Quality of Life, and mortality in the case of laryngeal attacks. Caring for patients with HAE can be challenging due to the complexity of this disease. The care of patients with HAE in Canada is neither optimal nor uniform across the country. It lags behind other countries where there are more organized models for HAE management, and where additional therapeutic options are licensed and available for use. The objective of this guideline is to provide graded recommendations for the management of patients in Canada with HAE. This includes the treatment of attacks, short-term prophylaxis, long-term prophylaxis, and recommendations for self-administration, individualized therapy, quality of life, and comprehensive care. It is anticipated that by providing this guideline to caregivers, policy makers, patients and their advocates, that there will be an improved understanding of the current recommendations regarding management of HAE and the factors that need to be considered when choosing therapies and treatment plans for individual patients. The primary target users of this guideline are healthcare providers who are managing patients with HAE. Other healthcare providers who may use this guideline are emergency physicians, gastroenterologists, dentists and otolaryngologists, who will encounter patients with HAE and need to be aware of this condition. Hospital administrators, insurers and policy makers may also find this guideline helpful.",

Ten cat allergens have been identified. The major allergen responsible for symptoms is Fel d 1, a secretoglobin and not a lipocalin, making the cat a special case among mammals. Given its clinical predominance, it is essential to have a good knowledge of this allergenic fraction, including its basic structure, to understand the new exciting diagnostic and therapeutic applications currently in development. The recent arrival of the component-resolved diagnosis, which uses molecular allergens, represents a unique opportunity to improve our understanding of the disease. Recombinant Fel d 1 is now available for in vitro diagnosis by the anti-Fel d 1 specific IgE assay. The first part of the review will seek to describe the recent advances related to Fel d 1 in terms of positive diagnosis and assessment of disease severity. In daily practice, anti-Fel d 1 IgE tend to replace those directed against the overall extract but is this attitude justified? We will look at the most recent arguments to try to answer this question. In parallel, a second revolution is taking place thanks to molecular engineering, which has allowed the development of various forms of recombinant Fel d 1 and which seeks to modify the immunomodulatory properties of the molecule and thus the clinical history of the disease via various modalities of anti-Fel d 1-specific immunotherapy. We will endeavor to give a clear and practical overview of all these trends.",

    "abstract": "Determining the cellular and molecular phenotypes of inflammation in asthma can identify patient populations that may best benefit from targeted therapies. Although elevated IL-6 and polymorphisms in IL-6 signalling are associated with lung dysfunction in asthma, it remains unknown if elevated IL-6 levels are associated with a specific cellular inflammatory phenotype, and how IL-6 blockade might impact such inflammatory responses.Patients undergoing exacerbations of asthma were phenotyped according to their airway inflammatory characteristics (normal cell count, eosinophilic, neutrophilic, mixed granulocytic), sputum cytokine profiles, and lung function. Mice were exposed to the common allergen, house dust-mite (HDM), in the presence or absence of endogenous IL-6. The intensity and nature of lung inflammation, and levels of pro-granulocytic cytokines and chemokines under these conditions were analyzed.Elevated IL-6 was associated with a lower FEV1 in patients with mixed eosinophilic-neutrophilic bronchitis. In mice, allergen exposure increased lung IL-6 and IL-6 was produced by dendritic cells and alveolar macrophages. Loss-of-function of IL-6 signalling (knockout or antibody-mediated neutralization) abrogated elevations of eosinophil and neutrophil recruiting cytokines/chemokines and allergen-induced airway inflammation in mice.We demonstrate the association of pleiotropic cellular airway inflammation with IL-6 using human and animal data. These data suggest that exacerbations of asthma, particularly those with a combined eosinophilic and neutrophilic bronchitis, may respond to therapies targeting the IL-6 pathway and therefore, provide a rational basis for initiation of clinical trials to evaluate this.",

    "abstract": "Allergic rhinitis is the most common form of allergy worldwide. The accuracy of skin testing for allergic rhinitis is still debated. Our primary objective was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of skin-prick testing for allergic rhinitis using the nasal provocation as the reference standard. We also evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of intradermal testing as a secondary objective. We searched EBM Reviews from 2005 to March 2015; Embase from 1980 to March 2015; and Ovid MEDLINE(R) from 1946 to until March 2015. We included any study with at least 10 subjects including children. We excluded non-English studies. We performed data extraction and quality assessment using the QUADAS-2 tool. We meta-analysed seven studies assessing the accuracy of skin-prick testing using the bivariate random-effects model, including a total of 430 patients. The pooled estimate for sensitivity and specificity for skin-prick testing was 85 and 77 % respectively. We did not pool results for intradermal testing due to few number of studies (n = 4), each with very small sample size. Of these, two evaluated the accuracy of intradermal testing in confirming skin-prick testing results, with sensitivity ranging from 27 to 50 % and specificity ranging from 60 to 100 %. The other two evaluated the accuracy of intradermal testing as a stand-alone test for diagnosing allergic rhinitis with sensitivity ranging from 60 to 79 % and specificity ranging from 68 to 69 %. Findings from this review suggest that skin-prick testing is accurate in discriminating subjects with or without allergic rhinitis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is often associated with organ specific autoimmunity but is rarely caused by food allergy. Colourings and preservatives in pre-packaged foods, so called pseudoallergens, have also been implicated. Factors that promote inflammation or reduce anti-inflammatory mechanisms may however, predispose susceptible individuals to CSU. Chronic underlying infection and mental and emotional stress can sometimes precede the onset of CSU and once established can exacerbate the symptoms. There is early evidence of dysbiosis within the gastrointestinal tract in people with CSU and reduced levels of vitamin D are also evident. The latter may be related to the importance of vitamin D3 in increasing T regulatory function which can control a tendency to autoimmunity. It is quite possible that a state of on-going chronic inflammation with reduced anti-oxidant mechanisms may underlie the not infrequent association between CSU and metabolic syndrome. Effective treatment of CSU should involve the use of anti-histamines, intermittent steroids and anti-IgE therapy. For recalcitrant disease immune modulatory therapy has a place. However, talking therapies that reduce stress and anxiety, vitamin D3 supplementation, correction of intestinal dysbiosis and treatment of any chronic infection should also be considered.",

    "abstract": "Food allergy (FA) negatively affects quality of life in caregivers of food-allergic children, imposing a psychosocial and economic burden. Oral immunotherapy (OIT) is a promising investigational therapy for FA. However, OIT can be a source of anxiety as it carries risk for allergic reactions. The effect of OIT with multiple food allergens (mOIT) on FA-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL) has never been studied in participants with multiple, severe food allergies. This study is the first to investigate the effects of mOIT on FA-related HRQL in caregivers of pediatric subjects. Caregiver HRQL was assessed using a validated Food Allergy Quality of Life – Parental Burden (FAQL-PB) Questionnaire (J Allergy Clin Immunol 114(5):1159-1163, 2004). Parents of participants in two single-center Phase I clinical trials receiving mOIT (n = 29) or rush mOIT with anti-IgE (omalizumab) pre-treatment (n = 11) completed the FAQL-PB prior to study intervention and at 2 follow-up time-points (6 months and 18 months). Parents of subjects not receiving OIT (control group, n = 10) completed the FAQL-PB for the same time-points. HRQL improved with clinical (change < -0.5) and statistical (p < 0.05) significance in the mOIT group (baseline mean 3.9, 95% CI 3.4-4.4; 6-month follow-up mean 2.5, 95% CI 2.0-3.0; 18-month follow-up mean 1.8, 95% CI 1.4-2.1) and rush mOIT group (baseline mean 3.9, 95% CI 3.1-4.7; 6-month follow-up mean 1.7, 95% CI 0.9-2.6; 18-month follow-up mean 1.3, 95% CI 0.3-2.4). HRQL scores did not significantly change in the control group (n = 10). Multi-allergen OIT with or without omalizumab leads to improvement in caregiver HRQL, suggesting that mOIT can help relieve the psychosocial and economic burden FA imposes on caregivers of food-allergic children.",

This study aimed to characterize the sleep disorders associated with respiratory allergy to house dust mites (HDM) at the time of initiation of sublingual allergen immunotherapy (SLIT) in routine clinical practice.This prospective, cross-sectional, observational study was conducted between November 2014 and March 2015 at 189 French trial sites and included 1750 participants suffering from HDM allergy who were initiating SLIT. Participants aged less than 5 years old and those who had previously started an allergen immunotherapy (AIT) for HDM allergy were not enrolled in the study. Sleep disorders were assessed by self-administered questionnaires: the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and a modified version of the Hotel Dieu-42 (HD-42) sleep disorder questionnaire. Logistic regression models adjusted for obesity, smoking status, asthma control and nasal obstruction were used to study the relationship between allergic rhinitis (AR) classification and sleep disorders/complaints.Of the 1786 participants enrolled, 1750 (907 adults and 843 children) composed the analysis population. The majority of participants (73.5% of adults and 65.8% of children) reported that their sleep disorders had prompted them to consult their physician. The most commonly observed sleep complaints were poor-quality sleep (50.3% of adults and 37.3% of children), snoring (48.1 and 41.4%, respectively) and nocturnal awakening (37.6 and 28.2%, respectively). Difficulties falling asleep were reported by 27.0% of adults and 24.7% of children. Adults and children suffering from severe persistent AR experienced sleep complaints significantly more often than participants with intermittent or mild persistent AR.This study highlights the high frequency of sleep disorders and their significant impact on patients with AR induced by HDM, in particular when AR is persistent and severe. Consequently, asking allergic patients about the quality of their sleep appears to be important, especially when the patient has persistent and severe AR.",

This review will focus on the following more common non-IgE-mediated food hypersensitivity syndromes: food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES), allergic proctocolitis (AP), food protein-induced enteropathy (FPE) and celiac disease. FPIES, AP and FPE typically present in infancy and are most commonly triggered by cow's milk protein or soy. The usual presenting features are profuse emesis and dehydration in FPIES; blood-streaked and mucousy stools in AP; and protracted diarrhea with malabsorption in FPE. Since there are no confirmatory noninvasive diagnostic tests for most of these disorders, the diagnosis is based on a convincing history and resolution of symptoms with food avoidance. The mainstay of management for FPIES, AP and FPE is avoidance of the suspected inciting food, with periodic oral food challenges to assess for resolution, which generally occurs in the first few years of life. Celiac disease is an immune-mediated injury caused by the ingestion of gluten that leads to villous atrophy in the small intestine in genetically susceptible individuals. Serologic tests and small intestinal biopsy are required to confirm the diagnosis of celiac disease, and management requires life-long adherence to a strict gluten-free diet.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Allergic rhinitis (AR) is an inflammatory disease of the nasal mucosa impacting up to 25% of Canadians. The standard of care for AR includes a treatment plan that takes into account patient preferences, the severity of the disease, and most essentially involves a shared decision-making process between patient and provider. Body Since their introduction in the 1940s, antihistamines (AHs) have been the most utilized class of medications for the treatment of AR. First-generation AHs are associated with adverse central nervous system (CNS) and anticholinergic side effects. On the market in the 1980s, newer generation AHs have improved safety and efficacy. Compared to antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) have significantly greater efficacy but longer onset of action. Intranasal AH and INCS combinations offer a single medication option that offers broader disease coverage and faster symptom control. However, cost and twice-per-day dosing remain a major limitation. Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is the only disease-modifying option and can be provided through subcutaneous (SCIT) or sublingual (SLIT) routes. While SCIT has been the definitive management option for many years, SLIT tablets (SLIT-T) have also been proven to be safe and efficacious. Conclusion There is a range of available treatment options for AR that reflect the varying disease length and severity. For mild to moderate AR, newer generation AHs should be the first-line treatment, while INCS are mainstay treatments for moderate to severe AR. In patients who do not respond to INCS, a combination of intranasal AH/INCS (AZE/FP) should be considered, assuming that cost is not a limiting factor. While SCIT remains the option with the most available allergens that can be targeted, it has the potential for severe systemic adverse effects and requires weekly visits for administration during the first 4 to 6 months. SLIT-T is a newer approach that provides the ease of being self-administered and presents a reduced risk for systemic reactions. In any case, standard care for AR includes a treatment plan that takes into account disease severity and patient preferences.",

    "abstract": "New therapeutic approaches with biologic agents such as anti-cytokine antibodies are currently on trial for the treatment of asthma, rhinosinusitis or allergic diseases necessitating patient selection by biomarkers. Allergic rhinitis (AR), affecting about 20 % of the Canadian population, is an inflammatory disease characterised by a disequilibrium of T-lymphocytes and tissue eosinophilia. Aim of the present study was to describe distinct cytokine patterns in nasal secretion between seasonal and perennial AR (SAR/PAR), and healthy controls by comparing cytokines regulating T-cells or stimulating inflammatory cells, and chemokines. Nasal secretions of 44 participants suffering from SAR, 45 participants with PAR and 48 healthy controls were gained using the cotton wool method, and analysed for IL-1β, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, GM-CSF, G-CSF, IFN-γ, MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, eotaxin, and RANTES by Bio-Plex Cytokine Assay as well as for ECP and tryptase by UniCAP-FEIA. Participants with SAR or PAR presented elevated levels of tryptase, ECP, MCP-1, and MIP-1β, while values of GM-CSF, G-CSF, IL-1β, and IL-6 did not differ from the controls. Increased levels of IL-5, eotaxin, MIP-1α, and IL-17 and decreased levels of IFN-γ, IL-12 and IL-10 were found in SAR only. RANTES was elevated in SAR in comparison to PAR. Interestingly, we found reduced levels of IL-4 in PAR and of IL-13 in SAR. Elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines were seen in both disease entities. They were, however, more pronounced in SAR, indicating a higher degree of inflammation. This study suggests a downregulation of TH1 and Treg-lymphocytes and an upregulation of TH17 in SAR. Moreover, the results display a prominent role of eosinophils and mast cells in AR. The observed distinct cytokine profiles in nasal secretion may prove useful as a diagnostic tool helping to match patients to antibody therapies.",

Nevertheless, the clinical application of the correlation between sputum eosinophils, FeNO and blood eosinophils is controversial.To investigate the clinical application of the correlation between sputum eosinophils, FeNO and blood eosinophils with uncontrolled asthmatic patients. It also examined the relationships between these biomarkers in bronchial reversibility and bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR).This study evaluated 75 uncontrolled asthmatic patients (symptom control and future risk of adverse outcomes). All patients underwent the following on the same day: FeNO, spirometry, BHR or bronchodilator reversibility, sputum induction and blood collection. Eosinophilic airway inflammation was defined as sputum eosinophils ≥ 2.5% or FeNO levels ≥ 32 parts per billion (ppb).A significant positive relationship was between percentage of sputum eosinophils and FeNO (r = 0.4556; p < 0.0001) and percentage of blood eosinophils (r = 0.3647; p = 0.0013), and a significant negative correlation was between percentage of sputum neutrophils and FeNO (r = - 0.3653; p = 0.0013). No relationship between FeNO and percentage of blood eosinophils (p = 0.5801). ROC curve analysis identified FeNO was predictive of sputum eosinophilia [area under the curve (AUC) 0.707, p = 0.004] at a cutoff point of 35.5 ppb (sensitivity = 67.3%, specificity = 73.9%). Percentage of blood eosinophils was also highly predictive with an AUC of 0.73 (p = 0.002) at a cut-off point of 1.5%, sensitivity and specificity were 61.5 and 78.3%, respectively. Although the sputum neutrophil percentage was correlated with FeNO, ROC curve of these parameters did not show useful values (AUC = 0.297, p = 0.003; AUC = 0.295, p = 0.021).Blood eosinophils and FeNO can accurately predict eosinophilic airway inflammation in uncontrolled asthmatic patients. FeNO is poor surrogates for sputum neutrophils and blood eosinophils. The FeNO level and blood eosinophils, which determine an optimal cutoff for sputum eosinophilia, need more studies.",

A search of PUBMED, EMBASE, SCOPUS, LILACS, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Web of Science for relevant randomized control trials or cross over studies yielded 10 eligible studies. The heterogeneity of trials were high, preventing valid meta-analysis of data. Most trials indicated that LTRA are not superior to placebo or antihistamine therapy, while combination therapy of LTRA and antihistamines appear to be more efficacious compared to antihistamine alone. The side effect profile and tolerability of this group of drugs is acceptable. The use of LTRA as monotherapy cannot be recommended. LTRA are effective add-on therapy to anti-histamines, and their use in patients responding poorly to antihistamines is justifiable.

The PROXIMA observational study assessed these outcomes in a cohort of Italian severe allergic asthma (SAA) patients. This post hoc analysis of the PROXIMA results was aimed at assessing gender differences in SAA in a real-world setting, focusing on disease perception and impact on quality of life (QoL).The PROXIMA study was an observational, multicenter study, consisting of a cross-sectional and a prospective longitudinal phase, including adult outpatients diagnosed with SAA at step 4 requiring a therapeutic step-up. Patients on omalizumab treatment at baseline were included in the 12-month longitudinal phase. Disease control was assessed by the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) score, patients' disease perception by the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ), and QoL by the EuroQoL five-dimensional three-level questionnaire (EQ-5D-3 L) at baseline and after 6 and 12 months. Two regression models were used to evaluate the association between gender and BIPQ total score and EQ-5D-3L score, respectively.357 patients (65% females) were analyzed for the cross-sectional phase and 99 (62.6% females) for the longitudinal phase. The prevalence of perennial and seasonal aeroallergens was similar between genders. ACQ score decreased similarly during omalizumab treatment at 6 and 12 months in both genders; no gender differences were observed in control rates. Asthma perception was worse among females at all study visits reaching statistical significance at 12 months (mean (SD) B-IPQ total score 41.8 (9.4) vs 35.6 (12.0); T test p-value (males vs females) < 0.05). Statistically significant gender differences were observed for some specific items, with males reporting less symptom experience, concern about the disease, and emotional impact at 12-months. The results of the multivariate regression model for repeated measures showed that overall treatment with omalizumab improved disease perception overtime regardless from gender. Males reported a significantly better QoL compared to females at both 6 and 12 months.In this real-world setting, females confirmed to have a worse perception of asthma, feel it as more symptomatic and suffer a greater impact on their QoL, even though having similar baseline severity and obtaining similar level of control.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) presents with progressive dyspnea, which results from acute lung inflammatory edema leading to hypoxia. As with other infectious diseases that affect the respiratory tract, asthma has been cited as a potential risk factor for severe COVID-19. However, conflicting results have been published over the last few months and the putative association between these two diseases is still unproven. Methods Here, we systematically reviewed all reports on COVID-19 published since its emergence in December 2019 to June 30, 2020, looking into the description of asthma as a premorbid condition, which could indicate its potential involvement in disease progression. Results We found 372 articles describing the underlying diseases of 161,271 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Asthma was reported as a premorbid condition in only 2623 patients accounting for 1.6% of all patients. Conclusions As the global prevalence of asthma is 4.4%, we conclude that either asthma is not a premorbid condition that contributes to the development of COVID-19 or clinicians and researchers are not accurately describing the premorbidities in COVID-19 patients.",

To estimate the incidence rates of anaphylactic and nonanaphylactic reactions after COVID-19 vaccines and describe the demographic and clinical characteristics, triggers, presenting signs and symptoms, treatment and clinical course of confirmed cases. A systematic review and meta-analysis. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses [PRISMA] statement was followed. Electronic databases (Proquest, Medline, Embase, Pubmed, CINAHL, Wiley online library, and Nature) were searched from 1 December 2020 to 31 May 2021 in the English language using the following keywords alone or in combination: anaphylaxis, non-anaphylaxis, anaphylactic reaction, nonanaphylactic reaction, anaphylactic/anaphylactoid shock, hypersensitivity, allergy reaction, allergic reaction, immunology reaction, immunologic reaction, angioedema, loss of consciousness, generalized erythema, urticaria, urticarial rash, cyanosis, grunting, stridor, tachypnoea, wheezing, tachycardia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and tryptase. We included studies in adults of all ages in all healthcare settings. Effect sizes of prevalence were pooled with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). To minimize heterogeneity, we performed sub-group analyses. Of the 1,734 papers that were identified, 26 articles were included in the systematic review (8 case report, 5 cohort, 4 case series, 2 randomized controlled trial and 1 randomized cross-sectional studies) and 14 articles (1 cohort, 2 case series, 1 randomized controlled trial and 1 randomized cross-sectional studies) were included in meta-analysis. Studies involving 26,337,421 vaccine recipients [Pfizer-BioNTech (n = 14,505,399) and Moderna (n = 11,831,488)] were analyzed. The overall pooled prevalence estimate of anaphylaxis to both vaccines was 5.0 (95% CI 2.9 to 7.2, I2 = 81%, p = < 0.0001), while the overall pooled prevalence estimate of nonanaphylactic reactions to both vaccines was 53.9 (95% CI 0.0 to 116.1, I2 = 99%, p = < 0.0001). Vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech resulted in higher anaphylactic reactions compared to Moderna (8.0, 95% CI 0.0 to 11.3, I2 = 85% versus 2.8, 95% CI 0.0 to 5.7, I2 = 59%). However, lower incidence of nonanaphylactic reactions was associated with Pfizer-BioNTech compared to Moderna (43.9, 95% CI 0.0 to 131.9, I2 = 99% versus 63.8, 95% CI 0.0 to 151.8, I2 = 98%). The funnel plots for possible publication bias for the pooled effect sizes to determine the incidence of anaphylaxis and nonanaphylactic reactions associated with mRNA COVID-19 immunization based on mRNA vaccine type appeared asymmetrical on visual inspection, and Egger's tests confirmed asymmetry by producing p values < 0.05. Across the included studies, the most commonly identified risk factors for anaphylactic and nonanaphylactic reactions to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were female sex and personal history of atopy. The key triggers to anaphylactic and nonanaphylactic reactions identified in these studies included foods, medications, stinging insects or jellyfish, contrast media, cosmetics and detergents, household products, and latex. Previous history of anaphylaxis; and comorbidities such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic and contact eczema/dermatitis and psoriasis and cholinergic urticaria were also found to be important. The prevalence of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine-associated anaphylaxis is very low; and nonanaphylactic reactions occur at higher rate, however, cutaneous reactions are largely self-limited. Both anaphylactic and nonanaphylactic reactions should not discourage vaccination.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Atopic dermatitis is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease and presents a major public health burden worldwide. Recent observational studies revealed the potential association between atopic dermatitis with autoimmune disorders. However, there is no meta-analysis of the prevalence or incidence of autoimmune diseases in atopic dermatitis. Therefore, considering the potential clinical implications of these associations, we aimed to assess the risk of autoimmune diseases in patients with atopic dermatitis using this method. Methods PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched from inception to October, 2020. Observational studies which provided estimate effects with 95% CI or raw data were included. The quality of selected studies was evaluated using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. Odds ratio and relative risks were pooled using a random effects model and expressed with 95% confidence intervals. Results Fourteen observational studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The random-effects meta-analysis of case–control and cross-sectional studies showed a significant association of atopic dermatitis with mutiple autoimmune diseases, including alopecia areata, celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, systematic lupus erythematosus, ulcerative colitis and vitiligo. Furthermore, pooling of the results of cohort studies showed that patients with atopic dermatitis were more likely to develop these autoimmune diseases. Conclusion Our meta-analysis showed that patients with atopic dermatitis were at higher risk of multiple autoimmune diseases including alopecia areata, celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, systematic lupus erythematosus, ulcerative colitis and vitiligo. It is important for early detection of the affected group so that timely management can be initiated. Dermatologists and allergists should be aware of the autoimmune diseases in patients with atopic dermatitis and develop interventions if necessary. Also, limited by the present research, we still require more large-scale studies to further establish the association between atopic dermatitis and autoimmune diseases.",

However, most studies provide conflicting results and the relationships between maternal preconceptional diet and risks of childhood asthma and allergic disease have not previously been explored. The objective of this study was to assess maternal diet during the year before pregnancy and the last 3 months of pregnancy and investigate their associations with the risks of asthma, wheezing, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis in young children. The study sample consisted of 1140 mother-child pairs from the EDEN cohort. Mothers had responded to the food frequency questionnaires used to assess diet before and during pregnancy. Children were followed up using health questionnaires. The health outcomes studied were: asthma, wheezing, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis by the age of 3 years. Using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models, significant inverse associations were observed between cooked green vegetable consumption before pregnancy and childhood asthma; consumption of eggs and raw vegetables before and during pregnancy, consumption of grains before pregnancy, and consumption of cooked green vegetables during pregnancy and allergic rhinitis. For the first time, a significant positive association was found between meat intake during the preconceptional period and a risk of wheezing, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis. Based on our findings, preconceptional and prenatal maternal intake of certain type of food groups may be preventive against asthma, wheezing and allergic rhinitis, whereas higher maternal intake of meat before pregnancy may increase the risk of wheezing, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis in young children.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Penicillin allergy is the most commonly reported drug allergy in the US. Despite evidence demonstrating that up to 90% of labels are incorrect, scalable interventions are not well established. As part of a larger mixed methods investigation, we conducted a qualitative study to describe the barriers to implementing a risk-based penicillin de-labeling protocol within a single site Veteran’s hospital. Methods We conducted individual and group interviews with multidisciplinary inpatient and outpatient healthcare teams. The interview guides were developed using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to explore workflows and contextual factors influencing identification and evaluation of patients with penicillin allergy. Three researchers iteratively developed the codebook based on TDF domains and coded the data using thematic analysis. Results We interviewed 20 clinicians. Participants included three hospitalists, five inpatient pharmacists, one infectious disease physician, two anti-microbial stewardship pharmacists, four primary care providers, two outpatient pharmacists, two resident physicians, and a nurse case manager for the allergy service. The factors that contributed to barriers to penicillin allergy evaluation and de-labeling were classified under six TDF domains; knowledge, skills, beliefs about capabilities, beliefs about consequences, professional role and identity, and environmental context and resources. Participants from all groups acknowledged the importance of penicillin de-labeling. However, they lacked confidence in their skills to perform the necessary evaluations, such as test dose challenges. The fear of inducing an allergic reaction and adding further complexity to patient care exacerbated their reluctance to de-label patients. The lack of ownership of de-labeling initiative was another significant obstacle in establishing consistent clinical workflows. Additionally, heavy workloads, competing priorities, and ease of access to alternative antibiotics prevented the prioritization of tasks related to de-labeling. Space limitations and nursing staff shortages added to challenges in outpatient settings. Conclusion Our findings demonstrated that barriers to penicillin allergy de-labeling fall under multiple behavioral domains. Better role clarification, opportunities to develop necessary skills, and dedicated resources are needed to overcome these barriers. Future interventions will need to employ a systemic approach that addresses each of the behavioral domains influencing penicillin allergy de-labeling with stakeholder engagement of the inpatient and outpatient health care teams.",

Once thought to primarily be a pediatric disorder, it is now estimated that more than 50% of worldwide incident IEI cases are accounted for by adults. Delayed diagnosis, late symptom onset, and IEI phenocopies can all lead to adult-onset recognition of IEIs. Lack of awareness regarding the diversity of IEI manifestations in adults contributes to diagnostic and treatment delays. Prompt referral to immunology is critical so that patients can receive a precise molecular diagnosis and targeted therapy when available. This article serves as a primer on IEIs in adulthood, highlighting the pathophysiology, epidemiology and clinical features. We present clinical vignettes of three key IEIs to assist clinicians in building illness scripts on their presentations. We provide a framework for the laboratory evaluation of IEIs and their initial treatment, with the aim of improving recognition and management of these conditions.",

Methods From January 2021 to December 2022,200 AR patients diagnosed in the Otolaryngology Clinic of Ordos Central Hospital were selected as the AR group, and 50 healthy people who underwent physical examination in the hospital during the same period were randomly selected as the healthy control (HC) group. The levels of GATA-3mRNA, RORγtmRNA and FoxP3mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). The proportions of Th2, Th17 and Treg cells were detected by flow cytometry. The concentrations of IL-4, IL-5, IL-17 and IL-10 in serum were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The differences of transcription gene level, immune cell ratio and cytokine concentration between the two groups were analyzed. Results There was no difference in age and gender between the two groups. The levels of GATA-3mRNA and RORγtmRNA transcription genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the percentage of Th2, Th17 and Treg immune cells, the levels of eosinophils and basophils in peripheral blood, the concentrations of IL-4, IL-5, IL-17, IL-10 cytokines and IgE in serum of AR patients were significantly higher than those in HC group ( P &lt; 0.05).

The objective of this study is to identify comorbidities and measure the prevalence in HAE patients, compared to the prevalence in the general population using multiple Canadian sources when available. Methods A quantitative survey design via a self-administered anonymous online questionnaire was conducted from October 13, 2022, to January 11, 2023. Respondents were individuals with HAE, enrolled in the CSL Behring patient support program (CSL Behring PLUS+; PSP). Results This study included 123 patients (81% female; 60% HAE-1/HAE-2, 24% HAE Normal C1-INH (nC1-INH), 16% unsure of HAE type; 85% of patients were on long-term prophylaxis plus on-demand). Patients reported using the following HAE treatments: C1-esterase inhibitor (subcutaneous or intravenous), lanadelumab, icatibant, danazol, and tranexamic acid. Respondents (69%) reported at least one: autoimmune condition, asthma, or allergy. Reported autoimmune conditions (psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic urticaria, lupus, and psoriatic arthritis) were much higher than the general population (31% versus 5–8%). Patient-reported allergies were two times higher than the general population (54% versus 27%; i.e., aeroallergens) and asthma rates nearly two times higher than the general population (17% versus 8–11%). Conclusion This cohort of HAE patients, most of whom were on prophylaxis, reported an increased prevalence of certain comorbidities compared to the general Canadian population. Healthcare professionals should be aware of the potentially increased risk of autoimmune conditions, allergies, and asthma in patients with HAE.",

Food-related reactions are associated with a broad array of signs and symptoms that may involve many bodily systems including the skin, gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, and cardiovascular system. Food allergy is a leading cause of anaphylaxis and, therefore, referral to an allergist for appropriate and timely diagnosis and treatment is imperative. Diagnosis involves a careful history and diagnostic tests, such as skin prick testing, serum-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) testing and, if indicated, oral food challenges. Once the diagnosis of food allergy is confirmed, strict elimination of the offending food allergen from the diet is generally necessary.

We aimed to dissect the influence of TSLP on immunosuppressive activities of Treg and its potential consequences in human allergic asthma.In vitro culture system was utilized to study the effects of TSLP on human Treg. The functional competency of pulmonary Treg from a cohort of 15 allergic asthmatic, 15 healthy control, and 15 non-allergic asthmatic subjects was also evaluated by suppression assays and flow cytometric analysis.Activated pulmonary Treg expressed TSLP-R and responded to TSLP-mediated activation of STAT5. TSLP directly and selectively impaired IL-10 production of Treg and inhibited their suppressive activity. In human allergic asthma, pulmonary Treg exhibited a significant decrease in suppressive activity and IL-10 production compared to healthy control and non-allergic asthmatic counterparts. These functional alterations were associated with elevated TSLP expression in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) of allergic asthmatic subjects. Furthermore, allergic asthmatic BAL could suppress IL-10 production by healthy control pulmonary Treg in a TSLP-dependent manner.These results provide the first evidences for a direct role of TSLP in the regulation of suppressive activities of Treg. TSLP mediated inhibition of Treg function might present a novel pathologic mechanism to dampen tolerogenic immune responses in inflamed asthmatic airway.",

    "abstract": "Oral corticosteroids (OCS) are commonly administered in patients with severe persistent allergic asthma. Despite their efficacy, they are associated with a wide variety of adverse events. The eXpeRience registry was set up to investigate real-world outcomes among patients receiving omalizumab for the treatment of uncontrolled allergic asthma. Here, we present the effect of omalizumab treatment on OCS use. eXpeRience was a 2-year, multinational, non-interventional, observational registry of patients receiving omalizumab for uncontrolled allergic asthma. OCS use (proportion of patients on maintenance OCS, mean total daily OCS dose and change in status of OCS therapy) was assessed at baseline, 16 weeks, and 8, 12, 18, and 24 months after the initiation of omalizumab. Response to omalizumab was assessed using the physician's Global Evaluation of Treatment Effectiveness (GETE) at approximately Week 16. Safety data were also recorded. A total of 943 patients (mean age, 45 years; female, 64.9%) were enrolled in the registry, 263 of whom were receiving maintenance OCS at baseline. The proportion of patients taking maintenance OCS was markedly lower at Months 12 (16.1%) and 24 (14.2%) than at baseline (28.6%; intent-to-treat population). GETE status was determined in 915 patients receiving omalizumab: 64.2% were responders (excellent or good response), 30.7% were non-responders (moderate, poor or worsening response); 5.1% had no assessment. The frequency of serious adverse events was comparable to that seen in controlled trials of omalizumab. Omalizumab use is associated with an OCS-sparing effect in patients with uncontrolled persistent allergic asthma in the real-world setting.",

    "abstract": "Primary immunodeficiency disease (PIDD) with hypogammaglobulinemia is characterized by recurrent and severe bacterial infections and IgG replacement is the standard of care in many of these patients. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is becoming increasingly recognized as a factor that affects patient well-being and treatment preferences. In an effort to better understand what factors affect HRQOL in patients with PIDD, we reviewed the published literature that used standardized instruments for the measurement of HRQOL. We investigated HRQOL in PIDD patients compared with normal controls and patients with other chronic diseases; we also investigated the impact of treatment administration on patient satisfaction. The most commonly encountered health-related quality of life instruments were the child heath questionnaire parental form 50, short form 36, PedsQL 4.0, Lansky's play performance scale, and Life Quality Index. Patients with PIDD scored significantly lower on many of the instruments compared with normal controls. Also, while it appears that many patients appreciate home-based and subcutaneous IgG replacement therapy, patient satisfaction ultimately involves various clinical factors and individual patient preferences. By further analyzing what factors impact HRQOL, therapy adjustments can be made to maximize patient well-being and minimize disease impact on daily functioning.",

    "abstract": "Drug allergy encompasses a spectrum of immunologically-mediated hypersensitivity reactions with varying mechanisms and clinical presentations. This type of adverse drug reaction (ADR) not only affects patient quality of life, but may also lead to delayed treatment, unnecessary investigations, and even mortality. Given the myriad of symptoms associated with the condition, diagnosis is often challenging. Therefore, referral to an allergist experienced in the identification, diagnosis and management of drug allergy is recommended if a drug-induced allergic reaction is suspected. Diagnosis relies on a careful history and physical examination. In some instances, skin testing, graded challenges and induction of drug tolerance procedures may be required. The most effective strategy for the management of drug allergy is avoidance or discontinuation of the offending drug. When available, alternative medications with unrelated chemical structures should be substituted. Cross-reactivity among drugs should be taken into consideration when choosing alternative agents. Additional therapy for drug hypersensitivity reactions is largely supportive and may include topical corticosteroids, oral antihistamines and, in severe cases, systemic corticosteroids. In the event of anaphylaxis, the treatment of choice is injectable epinephrine. If a particular drug to which the patient is allergic is indicated and there is no suitable alternative, induction of drug tolerance procedures may be considered to induce temporary tolerance to the drug. This article provides a backgrounder on drug allergy and strategies for the diagnosis and management of some of the most common drug-induced allergic reactions, such allergies to penicillin, sulfonamides, cephalosporins, radiocontrast media, local anesthetics, general anesthetics, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.",

    "abstract": "Heparins are one of the most used class of anticoagulants in daily clinical practice. Despite their widespread application immune-mediated hypersensitivity reactions to heparins are rare. Among these, the delayed-type reactions to s.c. injected heparins are well-known usually presenting as circumscribed eczematous plaques at the injection sites. In contrast, potentially life-threatening systemic immediate-type anaphylactic reactions to heparins are extremely rare. Recently, some cases of non-allergic anaphylaxis could be attributed to undesirable heparin contaminants. A 43-year-old patient developed severe anaphylaxis symptoms within 5–10 minutes after s.c. injection of enoxaparin. Titrated skin prick testing with wheal and flare responses up to an enoxaparin dilution of 1:10.000 indicated a probable allergic mechanism of the enoxaparin-induced anaphylaxis. The basophil activation test as an additional in-vitro test method was negative. Furthermore, skin prick testing showed rather broad cross-reactivity among different heparin preparations tested. In the presented case, history, symptoms, and results of skin testing strongly suggested an IgE-mediated allergic hypersensitivity against different heparins. Therefore, as safe alternative anticoagulants the patient could receive beneath coumarins the hirudins or direct thrombin inhibitors. Because these compounds have a completely different molecular structure compared with the heparin-polysaccharides.",

    "abstract": "Background: Childhood asthma may have a fetal origin through fetal growth and development of the immunocompetence or respiratory organs. Objective: We examined to which extent short gestational age, low birth weight and fetal growth restriction were associated with an increased risk of asthma hospitalization in childhood. Methods: We undertook a cohort study based on several national registers in Denmark, Sweden and Finland. We included all live singleton born children in Denmark during 1979-2005 (N = 1,538,093), in Sweden during 1973-2004 (N = 3,067,670), and a 90% random sample of singleton children born in Finland during 1987-2004 (N = 1,050,744). The children were followed from three years of age to first hospitalization for asthma, emigration, death, their 18th birthday, or the end of study (the end of 2008 in Denmark, and the end of 2007 in Sweden or Finland), whichever came first. We computed the pseudo-values for each observation and used them in a generalized estimating equation to estimate relative risks (RR) for asthma hospitalization. Results: A total of 131,783 children were hospitalized for asthma during follow-up. The risk for asthma hospitalization consistently increased with lower birth weight and shorter gestational age. A 1000-g decrease in birth weight corresponded to a RR of 1.17 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15-1.18). A one-week decrease in gestational age corresponded to a RR of 1.05 (95% CI 1.04-1.06). Small for gestational age was associated with an increased risk of asthma hospitalization in term but not in preterm born children. Conclusions: Fetal growth and gestational age may play a direct or indirect causal role in the development of childhood asthma.",

Some naturally occurring compounds are known to activate TRPA1 by forming a Michael addition product with a cysteine residue of TRPA1 through covalent protein modification and, in consequence, to cause allergic reactions. The anti-allergic property of TRPA1 agonists may be due to the activation and subsequent desensitization of TRPA1 expressed in sensory neurons. In this review, naturally occurring TRPA1 antagonists, such as camphor, 1,8-cineole, menthol, borneol, fenchyl alcohol and 2-methylisoborneol, and TRPA1 agonists, including thymol, carvacrol, 1'S-1'- acetoxychavicol acetate, cinnamaldehyde, α-n-hexyl cinnamic aldehyde and thymoquinone as well as isothiocyanates and sulfides are discussed.",

The aim of the study was to compare the prevalence of allergic sensitization to common airborne allergens among adults 15 years apart and to identify risk factors for allergic sensitization. Clinical examinations including skin prick test (SPT) and structured interviews were performed in two random population samples in 1994 and 2009. Furthermore, specific IgE was analyzed in 2009. SPT data were available for 483 subjects in 1994 and for 463 subjects in 2009 in ages 20–60 years. Specific IgE was analyzed in 692 subjects in ages 20–79 years. Sensitization to cat (16% to 26%, p < 0.001), dog (13% to 25%, p < 0.001), birch (13% to 18%, p = 0.031) and timothy (12% to 21%, p < 0.001), based on SPT, increased significantly from 1994 to 2009. Sensitization to any positive SPT increased from 35% to 39%, p = 0.13.The proportion of having ≥3 positive SPT reactions increased from 40% to 56%, p = 0.002. The sensitization pattern yielded similar results based on specific IgE. Risk factors for allergic sensitization were having a family history of allergy (OR 3.1, 95% CI 2.0-4.8 for any positive SPT; OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.8-4.0 for any elevated IgE) and urban living (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.0-2.7; OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.0-2.4). The prevalence of allergic sensitization to major airborne allergens as well as multi-sensitization increased significantly between the study years. Young age, a family history of allergy and urban living were significant risk factors for allergic sensitization.",

    "abstract": "Allergic diseases such as asthma and allergic rhinitis constitute a significant burden of disease among women of childbearing age and those who are pregnant. Adequately managing these conditions is paramount in reducing negative fetal outcomes as well as maternal complications during pregnancy. However, the potential for harm to both the mother and fetus demands carefully balancing efficacy and safety of treatment. Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) has emerged as a relatively safe and efficacious mode of therapy in both children and adults. AIT has also been considered for use during pregnancy.A review of the literature was conducted for data regarding the safety of initiation and continuation of AIT during pregnancy as well as the effect of AIT on the development of atopy in offspring. MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library were searched for clinical trials, randomized control trials, observational studies and journal articles in English using the terms \"Pregnancy\" and \"Immunotherapy\" from 1900 to present. This yielded 4 studies (totaling 422 pregnancies receiving AIT) investigating the continuation of AIT in pregnancy, 2 (totaling 31 pregnancies receiving AIT) evaluating AIT initiation during pregnancy and 5 observing the effect of AIT on atopy in offspring.No significant difference was found in the incidence of prematurity, hypertension (HTN)/proteinuria, congenital malformations or perinatal deaths between the women continued on AIT (both subcutaneous (SC) IT and sublingual (SL) IT to inhalant allergens as well as venom IT) during pregnancy and controls. Similarly, there was no significant difference in maternal or fetal complications between pregnant women initiated on AIT and controls. Among the few pregnant women (10/453 pregnancies) who experienced generalized reactions while receiving AIT, none were found to have fetal complications. Neither SCIT nor SLIT during pregnancy altered the risk of developing atopic disease in offspring.Based on these data, the continuation of AIT during pregnancy appears safe. Furthermore, the few data available suggest that the initiation of AIT during pregnancy might also be safe, however, more data is required for a definitive conclusion. Lastly, available studies do not show a convincing reduction in the development of atopy in offspring from the administration of AIT during pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is caused by both environmental and genetic factors. The ADRB2 gene, which encodes the beta 2-adrenergic receptor, is one of the most extensively studied genes with respect to asthma prevalence and severity. The Arg16Gly (+46A > G) and Gln27Glu (+79C > G) polymorphisms in the ADRB2 gene cause changes in the amino acids flanking the receptor ligand site, altering the response to bronchodilators and the risk of asthma through complex pathways. The ADRB2 polymorphisms affect beta-adrenergic bronchodilator action and are a tool to identify at-risk populations.To determine the frequency of these two polymorphisms in allergic asthma patients and healthy subjects and to correlate these data with the occurrence and severity of asthma.Eighty-eight allergic asthma patients and 141 healthy subjects were included in this study. The ADRB2 polymorphisms were analyzed using the amplification-refractory mutation system - polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) technique. The statistical analysis was performed with the SPSS 21.0 software using the Fisher's Exact and χ2 tests.The ADRB2 polymorphisms were associated with asthma occurrence. The Arg16Arg, Gln27Gln and Gln27Glu genotypes were risk factors; the odds ratios were 6.782 (CI = 3.07 to 16.03), 2.120 (CI = 1.22 to 3.71) and 8.096 (CI = 3.90 to 17.77), respectively. For the Gly16Gly and Glu27Glu genotypes, the odds ratios were 0.312 (CI = 0.17 to 0.56) and 0.084 (CI = 0.04 to 0.17), respectively.

Subjects self-monitored HRmax levels using heart rate monitors; exercise diaries and recreation center sign-in logs were also used.Functional measures, including lung function and asthma control scores, were evaluated for all subjects at pre- and post-study time-points; fitness measures were also assessed for subjects in the exercise group. Peripheral blood and nasal lavage fluid were collected from all subjects at pre- and post-study visits in order to evaluate cellular and molecular measures, including cell differentials and eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP).Sixteen subjects completed the prescribed protocol. Results show that subjects randomized to the exercise group adhered well (80%) to the exercise prescription and exhibited a trend toward improved fitness levels upon study completion. Both groups exhibited improvements in ACQ scores. No changes were observed in lung function (FEV1, FEV1/FVC), cell differentials, or ECP between groups.Results indicate that a moderate intensity aerobic exercise training program may improve asthma control and fitness levels without causing asthma deterioration in adult asthmatics. As such, these findings demonstrate the feasibility of the study protocol in preparation for a larger, clinical trial that will elucidate the functional consequences of aerobic exercise on asthmatic cellular and molecular responses.",

Therefore, we sought to test the hypothesis that neutrophils might be an important source of interleukin (IL)-17 in allergic asthma.Whole peripheral blood cells from non-asthmatic control subjects (n = 17) and patients with mild asthma (n = 7), moderate but persistent asthma (n = 4), or acute asthma (n = 6) were analyzed for IL-17A expression in CD177+ neutrophils. IL-17A expression was also analyzed in CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ lymphocyte populations. Asthmatic patients were classified as allergic to fungi, indoor allergens, or other allergens (e.g., pollen) based on a positive intradermal allergy test reaction.The percentage of CD177+ neutrophils in whole blood of asthmatic patients was higher than in healthy controls and highest in the moderate asthma group. Furthermore, the percentage of CD177+IL-17+ neutrophils was elevated in patients with mild asthma, whereas the CD4+ IL-17+ lymphocyte population was higher in asthmatic patients and highest in those with moderate but persistent asthma. We also found that the four patients that were allergic to fungi had the highest percentage of CD177+IL17+ neutrophils and CD8+IL17+ lymphocytes.IL17+CD177+ Neutrophils increase in allergic asthma patients especially when allergic to fungi. This cell population, through release of IL-17, might be contributing during the initial phase asthmatic disease and/or during disease progression but its role has not yet been established.",

Furthermore, there was no relationship between atopy and asthma severity, asthma control, and the quality of life. The anxiety and depression scores were significantly higher and the quality of life scores lower in the uncontrolled asthma group. The ACT and AQLQ scores were also lower in the anxiety and depression groups.It was concluded that anxiety and depression are prevalent in patients with uncontrolled asthma, and atopic status did not affect the scores in ACT, AQLQ, and emotional status tests.",

Although prompt recognition and treatment of anaphylaxis are imperative, both patients and healthcare professionals often fail to recognize and diagnose early signs and symptoms of the condition. Clinical manifestations vary widely; however, the most common signs are cutaneous symptoms, including urticaria, angioedema, erythema and pruritus. Immediate intramuscular administration of epinephrine into the anterolateral thigh is first-line therapy, even if the diagnosis is uncertain. The mainstays of long-term management include specialist assessment, avoidance measures, and the provision of an epinephrine auto-injector and an individualized anaphylaxis action plan. This article provides an overview of the causes, clinical features, diagnosis and acute and long-term management of this serious allergic reaction.",

    "abstract": "Anti-interleukin (IL)-5 monoclonal antibodies as an eosinophil-depleting strategy is well established, with Mepolizumab being the first biologic approved as an adjunct treatment for severe eosinophilic asthma. A 62-year old woman diagnosed with severe eosinophilic asthma showed poor response to Mepolizumab therapy (100 mg subcutaneous dose/monthly) and subsequent worsening of symptoms. The treatment response to Mepolizumab was monitored using both blood and sputum eosinophil counts. The latter was superior in assessing deterioration in symptoms, suggesting that normal blood eosinophil count may not always indicate amelioration or adequate control of the ongoing eosinophil-driven disease process. This perplexing situation of persistent airway eosinophilia and increased steroid insensitivity despite an anti-eosinophil therapy can be explained if the administered dose of the mAb was inadequate in comparison to the target antigen. The resultant immune complexes could act as 'cytokine depots', protecting the potency of the 'bound' IL-5, thereby sustaining the eosinophilic inflammation within the target tissue. Molecular analysis of the sputum indicated the development of a polyclonal autoimmune response as well as an increase in group 2 innate lymphoid cells, two novel observations in severe eosinophilic asthma, which were associated with indices of disease severity and progression. This case highlights the possibility of a previously unrecognised autoimmune-mediated worsening of asthma perhaps triggered by immune complexes formed due to inadequate dosing of administered monoclonal antibodies in the target tissue. While anti-IL5 mAb therapy is an exciting novel option to treat patients with severe asthma, there is the rare possibility of worsening of asthma as observed in this case study, due to local autoimmune mechanisms precipitated by potential inadequate airway levels of the monoclonal antibody.",

The objective of this study was to investigate the expression of key transcription factors for Treg and Th1/Th2/Th17 cells, in relation to the mRNA expression of representative cytokines in these two subtypes of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. The expression of forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), T-box transcription factor (T-bet), GATA3, retinoid acid-related orphan receptor C (RORc), the suppressive cytokines TGF-β1 and IL-10, and Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-17) were analyzed by means of RT-PCR in eosinophilic polyps. Eosinophilic polyps were defined as having an eosinophil count of more than 50 per microscopic field (×400 magnification) using five fields located in the subepithelial area of the polyps, while the non-eosinophilic polyps and controls did not fulfill this criteria. The numbers of T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and Treg were histologically counted using sections that were immunostained for CD3, CD4, CD8, and FOXP3, respectively. In eosinophilic polyps, we observed significantly fewer CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells, and lower GATA3, RORc and IL-10 mRNA expression, but a significantly higher IL-5, and IL-13 mRNA expression compared with controls, whereas FOXP3 and T-bet mRNA expression were not significantly different compared with controls. In non-eosinophilic polyps, FOXP3, IL-10, IL-17A, TGFβ1 and IFNγ mRNA expression was significantly higher compared with controls, whereas IL-4, 5 and 13 expression was not significantly different from controls. We showed a reduction of GATA3 and RORc mRNA, low Treg-related cytokines and elevated Th2 cytokine levels in eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis, whereas we demonstrated the upregulation of Treg cells and increases of Th1 and Th17 cytokines in non-eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis in the Japanese population. The different mRNA expression profiles of Treg and Th1/Th2/Th17 signature transcription factors and cytokines between eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis and non-eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis suggests heterogeneity in the pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of allergic rhinitis and related comorbidities in school-age children in Budapest, capital of Hungary. Data and epidemiological studies on this disease are still limited. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted in 21 representative and randomly selected primary schools in 2019. International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood-based questionnaires (n = 6869) inquiring about prevalence and related risk factors of allergic rhinitis were distributed to all parents. The data were characterised with standard descriptive statistics: frequencies (percentages) and means for categorical and quantitative data, respectively. Results 3836 of the questionnaires (1857 M/1979F) were completed. The prevalence of current allergic rhinitis was 29.3% (1043), physician-diagnosed allergic rhinitis was 9.7% (373), cumulative allergic rhinitis was 36.2% (1289) and current allergic rhinoconjunctivitis was 16.2% (577). The presence of physician diagnosed atopic disease–asthma (p &lt; 0.0001, OR = 4.398, 95% CI 3.356–5.807), food allergy (p &lt; 0.0001, OR = 2.594, 95% CI 1.995–3.378), and eczema (p &lt; 0.0001, OR = 1.899, 95% CI 1.568–2.300)-were significantly related to an increased risk of cumulative allergic rhinitis. Significant factors associated with allergic rhinitis include male gender (p &lt; 0.0001), family history of atopy (p &lt; 0.0001), frequent upper respiratory tract infections (p &lt; 0.0001), tonsillectomy (p = 0.0054), antibiotics given in the first year of life (p &lt; 0.0001), paracetamol given in the first year of life (p = 0.0038), long-lasting common infections caused by viruses and/or bacteria before the appearance of the allergy (p &lt; 0.0001), consumption of drinks containing preservatives or colourants (p = 0.0023), duration of living in Budapest (p = 0.0386), smoking at home (p = 0.0218), smoking at home in the first year of life (p = 0.0048), birds at home (p = 0.0119), birds at home in the first year of life (p = 0.0052), visible mould in the bedroom (p = 0.0139), featherbedding (p = 0.0126), frequent or constant heavy-vehicle traffic (p = 0.0039), living in a weedy area (p &lt; 0.0001) and living in the vicinity of an air-polluting factory or mine (p = 0.0128). Conclusions The prevalence of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in 6–12-year-old children in Budapest is higher than reported for most of the surrounding European countries. While asthma (OR = 4.398) is the most significant comorbidity, environmental factors such as birds at home in the first year of life (OR = 2.394) and living in a weedy area (OR = 1.640) seem to be the most important factors associated with AR. Strategies for preventive measures should be implemented. Trial registration number : KUT-19/2019. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee at Heim Pál National Pediatric Institute,",

Results Adults: seven studies (n = 2159) ascertaining exacerbation rate showing a 37% (95% CI 21–50) reduction in favor of omalizumab, larger than the pre-specified minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 25%. Only one open-label study (n = 82) was identified assessing the percentage of patients experiencing reduction of OCS-maintenance treatment showing a significantly greater decrease in the omalizumab group (− 45% vs. + 18.3%, p = 0.002). Children and adolescents: four studies (n = 1551) reported data on exacerbations (no meta-analysis conducted), showed overall improvements in exacerbation rate and some passed MCID. No OCS studies were identified. No included studies provided systematic assessment of severe asthma according to current guidelines. Conclusions Omalizumab provides clinically relevant improvements in exacerbation rate among children, adolescents, and adults and in OCS-reduction among adults.

    "abstract": "Abstract Allergic rhinitis (AR) is the most common undiagnosed chronic condition in children. Moderate/severe AR symptoms significantly impair quality of life, and cause sleep disruption, absenteeism and decreased productivity. Additionally, untreated AR predisposes children to asthma and other chronic conditions. Although intranasal corticosteroids are the most effective pharmacologic treatment for AR, oral antihistamines are often preferred. First-generation antihistamines may be chosen to relieve AR symptoms as they are inexpensive and widely available; however, they cause sedative and cardiovascular negative effects due to poor receptor selectivity. Therefore, second-generation antihistamines were developed to reduce adverse effects while retaining efficacy. There are fewer clinical trials in children than adults, therefore, efficacy and safety data is limited, particularly in children under 6 years, highlighting the need to generate these data in young children with AR. Fexofenadine, a highly selective second-generation antihistamine, effectively alleviates symptoms of AR, is non-sedating due to decreased blood–brain barrier permeability, and is devoid of cardiovascular side effects. Importantly, fexofenadine relieves the ocular symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis, which occur concomitantly with AR, improving quality of life. Overall, fexofenadine displays a favorable safety profile and results in greater treatment satisfaction in children compared with other second-generation antihistamines. This review aimed to evaluate and compare the safety and efficacy of fexofenadine with other available first- and second-generation antihistamines in children with AR.",

The objective of this study was to assess the validity of serum IL-6 test for diagnosis of asthma. Methods A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library from January 2007 to March 2021 to identify relevant studies. Eleven studies were included in this analysis, involving 1977 patients with asthma and 1591 healthy non-asthmatic controls. The meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3 software and Stata 16.0. Random effect model or fixed effect model (FEM) was used to estimate the standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results The meta-analysis results revealed that the serum IL-6 levels were higher in asthmatic patients than healthy non-asthmatic controls (SMD 1.31, 95% CI 0.82–1.81, P &lt; 0.00001). IL-6 levels are significantly elevated in pediatric patients with asthma (SMD 1.58, 95% CI 0.75–2.41, P = 0.0002) and mildly elevated in adult patients with asthma (SMD 1.08, 95% CI 0.27–1.90, P = 0.009). In addition, a subgroup analysis of asthma disease status showed that IL-6 levels were increased in stable (SMD 0.69, 95% CI 0.28–1.09, P = 0.009) and exacerbation asthma (SMD 2.15, 95% CI 1.79–2.52, P &lt; 0.00001) patients. Conclusion The results of this meta-analysis suggest that serum IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in asthmatic patients as compared to normal population. IL-6 levels can be used as an auxiliary indicator to distinguish individuals with asthma from healthy non-asthmatic controls.",

The primary aim of this study was to characterize the outcomes in an initial cohort of patients with CRSwNP who have undergone dupilumab therapy.A retrospective study was conducted of patients with CRSwNP who were treated with dupilumab. Demographic information, comorbidities, number of previous surgeries, and insurance information were collected. The primary outcome were changes in the sinonasal outcome test (SNOT-22) scores from baseline to timepoints after receiving dupilumab.Forty-eight patients were considered for dupilumab therapy, and 27 (56%) received coverage or were able to fund the medication independently. Patients waited an average of 3.6 months to obtain access to the medication. The mean age of the patients was 43. Forty-one percent (11/27) of patients had aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease, and 96% (26/27) had a diagnosis of asthma. The mean length of time on dupilumab was 12.1 months. The baseline SNOT-22 score was 60.6. The mean decrease at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after starting dupilumab was 8.8, 26.5, 42.8, and 33.8, respectively. There were no serious adverse events.Patients treated with dupilumab in a Canadian tertiary care rhinology clinic demonstrated substantial clinical improvement as measured by disease-specific sinonasal outcomes. Further studies are needed to determine the longer-term effectiveness and adverse event profile of this novel therapy.",

The material consisted of a group of 57 subjects (32 subjects with hen's egg white allergy and 25 healthy controls). The method consisted in a nasal allergen provocation test carried out with the use of hen's egg white allergen and assessed using the visual analog scale and optical rhinometry as well as by determination of sIgE and tryptase levels in nasal lavage fluid. Subjective nasal symptoms and objective evaluations following the application of 100 µg of hen's egg white allergen revealed a moderately positive nasal mucosal response in optical rhinometry tests (ΔE = 0.34 OD). Nasal food challenge with hen's egg white allergen is a good diagnostic alternative in the group of food allergy patients. Due to the insufficient number of studies carried out so far, further attempts at standardization of the method are required.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of allergic diseases has been increasing in Japan. In particular, a serious decline in the age of onset of allergic rhinitis has been observed. Passive smoking from parental smoking has a significant impact on children's health; however, it is difficult to restrict smoking in the home. While various studies have previously reported on the relationship between passive smoking and the development of allergic diseases in children. However, there have been no reports on passive smoking and allergic diseases on a national scale. Using Japanese national longitudinal survey data (n = 38,444) for newborns born between May 10 and 24, 2010, we assessed parental smoking habits when their children were 6 months old and investigated the association with the development of allergic diseases until the age of 5.5 years. The risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the development of different allergic diseases were analyzed after adjusting for potential confounders using Poisson regression with a robust error variance. The risk ratio for developing allergic rhinitis/allergic conjunctivitis (AR/AC) in children was significantly higher in the maternal smoking groups ( ≦ 10 cigarettes/day; RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.02-1.30; ≧11 cigarettes/day; RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.93-1.44). Furthermore, associations were found between the maternal smoking group in the presence of paternal smoking and the risk of developing bronchial asthma ( ≦ 10, RR 1.33 95% CI 1.17-1.52; ≧11, RR 1.71 95% CI 1.38-2.1), food allergy ( ≦ 10, RR 1.36 95% CI 1.12-1.63; ≧11, RR 1.25 95% CI 0.84-1.86), atopic dermatitis ( ≦ 10, RR 1.42 95% CI 1.22-1.66; ≧11, RR 1.6 95% CI 1.2-2.13), and AR/AC ( ≦ 10, RR 1.21 95% CI 1.07-1.36; ≧11, RR 1.35 95% CI 1.09-1.67). Maternal smoking during infancy increases the risk of developing AR/AC in children. Considering paternal smoking, maternal smoking further increased the risk of developing allergic diseases in children, suggesting that reducing parental smoking at home may reduce the risk of developing allergic diseases in children.",

Methods Data from CRS patients ( N = 1,255) and healthy controls ( N = 1,032) were reviewed retrospectively to investigate associations between clinical characteristics and CRS. Data from white blood cells in the UK biobank ( N = 173,480), asthma in the Trans-National Asthma Genetic Consortium (127,669) and CRS ( N = 272,922) or nasal polyps ( N = 264,107) in the FinnGen consortium were used to conduct genetic study, including linkage disequilibrium score regression analysis to detect genetic associations between aforementioned variables, Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate causal relationships of asthma and blood eosinophil levels on CRS, and Bayesian co-localization to consolidate MR findings and to identify shared genetic signals. Results We found that blood eosinophil count, blood eosinophil percentages and asthma shared positive and causal genetic correlations with CRS (all q &lt; 0.0001) and CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) (all q &lt; 0.0001) in both our observational and genetic study. Through colocalization analysis, 4 loci are shared among asthma, CRS and CRSwNP, 7 loci are shared among blood eosinophil count, CRS and CRSwNP, 2 loci are unique to blood eosinophil count and CRS, and 3 loci are unique to blood eosinophil count and CRSwNP. Conclusions These findings contribute to understanding CRS etiology, and provide insights for intervention and treatment target for CRS comorbid with asthma or high blood eosinophil levels.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Food insecurity is a growing concern, that is currently estimated to affect 1 in 4 Canadian children. Due to the additional effort required for management and the disproportionate cost of allergy friendly foods, households with food allergy may be at increased risk of experiencing food insecurity. With this in mind, we aimed to describe and compare the prevalence of food insecurity amongst children in households managing pediatric food allergy between 2019, 2020 and 2022 using a repeated cross-sectional design. A total of 117 participants were recruited via social media between these three distinct timepoints, referred to as waves. All participants completed an anonymous online survey consisting of demographic questions and the Household Food Security Module from the Canadian Community Health Survey. Rates of child food insecurity were comparable between Waves 1 and 2 (34% and 35%, respectively; p=0.75), but, increased significantly between Waves 2 and 3 (35% and 56%, respectively; p=0.005). Amongst children identified as food insecure, the proportion who were marginally food insecure remained relatively stable, whereas, levels of moderate food insecurity appeared to increase, although not significantly. Conversely, the proportion classified as severely food insecure decreased across the waves, but again, this difference was not statistically significant. Our findings demonstrate an upward trend in child food insecurity levels, showcasing the need for a larger scale, longitudinal evaluation of the intersection between food allergy and food insecurity. We call on researchers and policy makers to attend to this important issue.",

Clinical and laboratory studies indicate that a cell-mediated pathogenic mechanism is often involved in maculopapular rashes. However, this mechanism has also been demonstrated in other non-immediate reactions, such as urticarial and/or angioedematous manifestations, TEN, bullous exanthems, and AGEP. Patch tests, together with delayed-reading intradermal tests, lymphocyte transformation tests, and challenges, are useful tools for evaluating non-immediate drug eruptions. Patch tests can be performed with any form of commercial drugs and are safer than intradermal tests. However, patch tests are less sensitive than intradermal tests, and their sensitivity may vary, depending on the vehicle used.",

However, pollen-exposed epithelia do not encounter pure allergen but rather a plethora of protein and non-protein substances. We demonstrated that pollen liberate lipids with chemical and functional similarities to leukotriens and prostaglandins - the pollen associated lipid mediators (PALMs). To date, two main groups of PALMs have been characterized: The immunostimulatory PALMs activating innate immune cells such as neutrophils and eosinophils, and the immunomodulatory E 1 -phytoprostanes blocking IL-12 production of dendritic cells, resulting in the preferential induction of T H 2 responses. This article reviews our work in the field of PALMs and their effects on cells of the innate and adoptive immune system. From recent results a general picture starts to emerge in which PALMs (and possibly other pollen-associated substances) may - independently from protein allergens - propagate an overall T H 2 favoring micromilieu in pollen exposed tissue of predisposed individuals.",

    "abstract": "The Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (CSACI) is very concerned about the increased marketing of food-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) testing towards the general public over the past few years, supposedly as a simple means by which to identify “food sensitivity”, food intolerance or food allergies. In the past, this unvalidated form of testing was usually offered by alternative or complementary health providers, but has now become more widely available with direct-to-consumer marketing through a nationwide chain of pharmacies.\r\n\r\nThere is no body of research that supports the use of this test to diagnose adverse reactions to food or to predict future adverse reactions. The literature currently suggests that the presence of specific IgG to food is a marker of exposure and tolerance to food, as seen in those participating in oral immunotherapy studies. Hence, positive test results for food-specific IgG are to be expected in normal, healthy adults and children. Furthermore, the inappropriate use of this test only increases the likelihood of false diagnoses being made, resulting in unnecessary dietary restrictions and decreased quality of life. The immediate expense of the test to individuals (see below for details on cost) will be compounded by the costs incurred by an already-overburdened health care system. Confused by the information provided by IgG testing, individuals are likely to request additional specialist referrals and investigations which would otherwise not be necessary.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, and perhaps of greater potential concern, a person with a true immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergy, who is at significant risk for life-threatening anaphylaxis, may very well not have elevated levels of specific IgG to their particular allergen, and may be inappropriately advised to reintroduce this potentially deadly item into their diet.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these serious and growing concerns, the CSACI has elected to issue a formal statement supporting the opinions expressed by the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) [1], and by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) [2]. Both of these organizations warn about the inappropriate measurement of food-specific IgG or IgG4 to suggest the presence or potential of adverse reactions to food. Recent guidelines emphasize that such testing plays no role in the diagnosis of food allergy or intolerance [3]. A recent Canadian publication also elaborates similar concerns from the perspective of community allergy practice [4].\r\n\r\nIn addition to content of all of the above documents, the CSACI is very concerned about the following issues:\r\n\r\n1. The testing process is widely available in Canada, through a variety of complementary health providers, paramedical clinics, and some physicians.\r\n\r\n2. A testing kit product is being sold directly to customers, in pharmacies.\r\n\r\n3. Marketing strategies for the testing have included the placing of promotional materials in the waiting rooms of physicians without their knowledge or consent.\r\n\r\n4. The price of the testing is often in the $400-$700 range, and some third-party payers offer reimbursement despite a clear lack of supporting evidence.\r\n\r\n5. The test is also being marketed to concerned parents, and may lead to exclusion diets which carry risks of poor growth and malnutrition for their children: for example, the elimination of dairy products, wheat, eggs, and/or other foods found in healthy balanced diets.",

Literature surveys were conducted to determine the adherence to repeated calls for development and implementation of proficiency testing standards in the 1990's, the mid-2000's and the 2008 allergy diagnostics practice parameters. Authors publishing clinical research in peer-reviewed journals and conducting workshops at annual scientific meetings have recommended proficiency testing based primarily on its potential to reduce variability, minimize confounding test results, and promote more effective immunotherapeutic treatments. Very few publications of clinical studies, however, appear to report proficiency testing data for SPT performance. Allergen immunotherapy recommendations are updated periodically by the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters representing the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI), the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI), and the Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (JCAAI). Despite consensus that all staff who perform SPT should meet basic quality assurance standards that demonstrate their SPT proficiency, the gap between recommendations and daily practice persists. By embracing standards, the accuracy of SPT and allergy diagnosis can be optimized, ultimately benefiting patients with allergic disease.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the role of specific IgG4 antibodies to hen's egg white and determine their utility as a marker for the outcome of oral challenge test in children sensitized to hen's eggThe hen's egg oral food challenge test was performed in 105 sensitized children without atopic dermatitis, and the titers of egg white-specific immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) and immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies were measured. To set the cut-off values of IgG4, IgE, and the IgE/IgG4 ratio for predicting positive results in oral challenges, receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted and the area under the curves (AUC) were calculated.Sixty-four of 105 oral challenges with whole eggs were assessed as positive. The AUC for IgE, IgG4, and IgE/IgG4 for the prediction of positive results were 0.609, 0.724, and 0.847, respectively. Thus, the IgE/IgG4 ratio generated significantly higher specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (%), and negative predictive value (%) than the individual IgE and IgG4. The negative predictive value of the IgE/IgG4 ratio was 90% at a value of 1.We have demonstrated that the egg white-specific serum IgE/IgG4 ratio is important for predicting reactivity to egg during food challenges.",

    "abstract": "Bjerkandera adusta (B. adusta) is one of the most important etiological fungi associated with chronic cough. However, precise details of the inflammatory response to exposure are not well understood yet. B. adusta was recently identified in Asian sand dust (ASD) aerosol. Therefore, in the present study the exacerbating effects of ASD on B. adusta-induced lung inflammation and B. adusta + ASD on ovalbumin (OVA)-induced murine lung eosinophilia were investigated using experimental mice. In order to prepare testing samples, B. adusta obtained from ASD aerosol was inactivated by formalin and ASD collected from the atmosphere was heated to remove toxic organic substances (H-ASD). CD-1 mice were instilled intratracheally with 12 different samples prepared with various combinations of B. adusta, H-ASD, and OVA in a normal saline solution. The lung pathology, cytological profiles in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and the levels of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in BALF were investigated. H-ASD aggravated the lung eosinophilia induced by B. adusta alone, which also aggravated the lung eosinophilia induced by OVA. The mixture of OVA, H-ASD, and B. adusta caused serious fibrous thickening of the subepithelial layer, eosinophil infiltration, and proliferation of goblet cells in the airways along with remarkable increases of IL-13, eotaxin, IL-5, and MCP-3 in BALF. The results of the present study demonstrated that B. adusta isolated from ASD aerosol induces allergic lung diseases. H-ASD enhanced allergic reactions caused by OVA or B. adusta. A mixture of B. adusta, H-ASD, and OVA caused the most remarkable exacerbation to the allergic airway inflammation via remarkable increases of pro-inflammatory mediators.",

Baseline characteristics were compared between patients with a STBDmax <12.7 mm vs. ≥12.7 mm. Linear regression including variables such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI) and race was performed. The proportion of patients with a STBDmax <12.7 mm was compared in those weighing <10 kg vs. 10-14.9 kg.One hundred patients were included; 29 (29%) had STBDmax <12.7 mm. Height (p = 0.02) and weight (p = 0.0002) differed significantly between the two groups. Approximately 19% of those weighing 10-14.9 kg and 60% of those <10 kg had a STBDmax <12.7 mm.

The purpose of this study is to define the natural course of wheat allergy in children with dominant gastrointestinal symptoms and identify factors that help predict development of tolerance.The prospective analysis covered 50 children with positive food challenge results (DBPCFC) and positive wheat IgE test result. Resolution of wheat allergy was determined on the basis of food challenge results (open challenge). The impact of each of the studied factors on the age when tolerance developed was assessed by means of the Cox proportional hazard regression model.The median age of tolerance development was 69.5 months (37-192 mo.). The rates of resolution were 20% by the age of 4 years, 52% by the age of 8 years, and 66% by 12 years, and 76% by 18 years. The median age of the tolerance development in children with peak wheat IgE level below10 kU/L was 41.4 months, with peak wheat IgE from 10 to 19.9 kU/L was 44.5 months, with peak IgE from 20 to 49.9 kU/L - 84,9 months and with peak IgE ≥ 50 kU/L - 190.5 months. The median of the age when the highest levels of IgE for wheat were reached was 33 months (2-52 mo.) in children with resolved wheat allergy and 67 months (36-178 mo.) in children with persistent allergy (p = .001).1. The majority of children with wheat allergy can tolerate wheat by adolescence. 2. The age when tolerance to wheat developed depended on the level and the age of reaching the highest levels of specific IgE for wheat. The higher the values of the above parameters, the older a child was when they developed tolerance to wheat.",

CRSsNP presents itself with a TH1 milieu and neutrophil infiltration, while NP is characterised by a mixed TH1/TH2 profile and an influx of predominantly eosinophils, plasma cells and mast cells. For the purpose of discovering disease-specific cytokine profiles, the present study compares levels of mediators and cytokines in nasal secretions between CRSsNP, NP, and healthy controls.The study included 45 participants suffering from NP, 48 suffering from CRSsNP and 48 healthy controls. Allergic rhinitis constituted an exclusion criterion. Nasal secretions, sampled using the cotton wool method, were analysed for IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, IL-8, GM-CSF, G-CSF, IFN-γ, MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, eotaxin, and RANTES, and for ECP and tryptase, using Bio-Plex Cytokine assay or ELISA, respectively.Elevated levels of IL-5, IL-17, G-CSF, MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, ECP, and tryptase, as well as decreased levels of IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, and IFN-γ were detected in NP. CRSsNP presented increased levels of RANTES and MIP-1β while IL-13 was decreased. No differences between the three groups were found for IL-4, IL-8, GM-CSF, and eotaxin.The present work suggests a disequilibrium of TH1 and TH2, together with a down-regulation of regulatory T lymphocytes and up-regulated TH17 in NP. Moreover, elevated levels of diverse mediators represent the activation of various inflammatory cells in this disease entity. The inflammation in CRSsNP, however, is only weakly depicted in nasal secretions. Therefore, cytokines in nasal secretions may provide helpful information for differential diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Sub-cutaneous immunotherapy is an effective treatment for allergy. It works by helping to modify or re-balance an individual's immune response to allergens and its efficacy is greatly improved by the use of adjuvants, most commonly, aluminium hydroxide. Aluminium salts have been used in allergy therapy for many decades and are assumed to be safe with few established side-effects. This assumption belies their potency as adjuvants and their potential for biological reactivity both at injection sites and elsewhere in the body. There are very few data purporting to the safety of aluminium adjuvants in allergy immunotherapy and particularly so in relation to longer term health effects. There are, if only few, published reports of adverse events following allergy immunotherapy and aluminium adjuvants are the prime suspects in the majority of such incidents. Aluminium adjuvants are clearly capable of initiating unwanted side effects in recipients of immunotherapy and while there is as yet no evidence that such are commonplace it is complacent to consider aluminium salts as harmless constituents of allergy therapies. Future research should establish the safety of the use of aluminium adjuvants in sub-cutaneous allergy immunotherapy.",

This study investigated the effects of IT on FA-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL) over a 24 month-follow-up in caregivers of children with single and multiple food allergies. We hypothesized that characteristics such as age, asthma at baseline and respiratory allergic reactions during therapy were key characteristics that influenced HRQL scores. A validated Food Allergy Quality of Life – Parental Burden Questionnaire (FAQL-PB) was used to assess HRQL. It was randomly distributed to and filled out by caregivers of 57 food-allergic children enrolled in clinical trials of IT. The same parent answered the FABQL-PB questionnaire at baseline and for 6-month, 12- month, 18- month, and 24-month time points on IT. Caregiver HRQL improved significantly (change < - 0.5, p <0.0001) at each follow-up time point compared to baseline. The percentages of caregivers with improvement in HRQL progressively increased (92% at 24 month-follow-up time point compared to baseline). HRQL improved more in caregivers of participants older than 10 years or desensitized to more than 4 food allergens than those who were not (p <0.0001). Caregivers of participants with pre-existing asthma or dose-related respiratory allergic reactions had less improvement in HRQL than those who did not (p <0.01).

Asthmatic patients have elevated expression levels of this gene. ORMDL3 encodes a transmembrane protein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that may be involved in ER stress and inflammation. It is essential to validate the genetic associations linking ORMDL3 with asthma through functional studies that confirm the biological relevance of this gene in disease. We investigated the effects of manipulating ORMDL3 expression levels in vitro in airway cells on innate immune inflammatory responses, ER stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR).ORMDL3 expression levels were manipulated in airway cells using an overexpression plasmid and siRNA technologies. Successful modulation of ORMDL3 was confirmed at both the gene and protein level. The functional impact of modulation of ORMDL3 expression levels on inflammatory responses and activation of the UPR were quantified using complementary cellular and molecular immunology techniques.Cells with altered ORMDL3 levels responded equally well to innate immune stimuli and produced similar levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to wild-type cells. Treatment with ER stress inducers, thapsigargin and tunicamycin, resulted in activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). However, we observed no difference in UPR activation in cells with ORMDL3 knockdown compared to cells with normal ORMDL3 levels.Our results suggest that ORMDL3 variation in the airway epithelium is unlikely to play a significant role in modulating innate immune responses and the UPR in the lung.",

Intramuscular delivery into the anterolateral aspect of the thigh is recommended for optimal onset of action of epinephrine.

Currently, it is unknown whether this needle length is adequate for intramuscular delivery of epinephrine in adult patients at risk of anaphylaxis. One hundred consecutive adult patients with confirmed food allergy requiring an epinephrine auto-injector were recruited. Skin to muscle depth (STMD) at the right mid-anterolateral thigh was measured using ultrasound under minimal (min) and maximum (max) pressure. The EpiPen® needle length was considered adequate if STMDmax was ≤15.2 mm. Baseline characteristics including age, gender, ethnicity, and body mass index (BMI) were compared in patients with STMDmax ≤15.2 mm vs. >15.2 mm. The EpiPen® needle length of 15.2 mm was inadequate for intramuscular delivery in 19 of the 100 enrolled patients (19%), all of whom were female; 28% of women had a STMDmax >15.2 mm. The mean STMDmax in the ≤15.2-mm and >15.2-mm groups were 9 ± 4 mm and 20 ± 4 mm, respectively (p = 0.0001). Linear regression analysis found BMI to be significantly associated with STMDmax after adjusting for age (p < 0.001). The needle length of the epinephrine auto-injectors may not be adequate for intramuscular delivery of epinephrine in a large proportion of women with food allergy; this may impact morbidity and mortality from anaphylaxis in this patient population.",

Familial ABPA is reported, and some genetic factors have been associated with the disease, however, these are small studies (n ≤ 38) and do not explain all cases of ABPA.We analysed SNPs in 95 ABPA patients, comparing frequencies to 152 atopic asthmatic and 279 healthy controls. Twenty two genes were selected from literature, and 195 tagging SNPs were analysed for genetic association with ABPA using logistic regression corrected for multiple testing. We also analysed monocyte-derived macrophage gene expression before and during co-culture with A. fumigatus.Seventeen ABPA-associated SNPs (ABPA v Atopic asthma) were identified. Three remained significant after correction for multiple testing; IL13 rs20541, IL4R rs3024656, TLR3 rs1879026. We also identified minor differences in macrophage gene expression responses in the ABPA group compared to the control groups.Multiple SNPs are now associated with ABPA. Some are novel associations. These associations implicate cytokine pathways and receptors in the aberrant response to A. fumigatus and susceptibility to ABPA, providing insights into the pathogenesis of ABPA and/or its complications. We hope these results will lead to increased understanding and improved treatment and diagnostics for ABPA.",

    "abstract": "Omalizumab is approved in the UK as add-on treatment for chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in patients with inadequate response to H1-antihistamines. Ciclosporin is an established but unlicensed 3rd line option for CSU. Two parallel retrospective observational studies were conducted to describe outcomes of treatment and adverse events with omalizumab or ciclosporin for CSU treatment.Data from UK specialist centres prescribing omalizumab (five centres) or ciclosporin (three centres) in CSU patients were collected from hospital records by clinical staff and pooled for analysis.Forty-six patients prescribed omalizumab and 72 patients prescribed ciclosporin were included. Twenty-two (48%) omalizumab-treated patients had paired Urticaria Activity Scores (UAS7), showing a 25.4 point improvement during treatment (P < 0.0001). Paired Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) was available in 28 (61%) omalizumab-treated and 17 (24%) ciclosporin-treated patients. At least a 75% improvement in DLQI score was observed in 79% of omalizumab-treated and 41% of ciclosporin-treated patients, and 65% of omalizumab-treated patients had complete resolution of their quality-of-life impairment (DLQI 0-1) versus 21% of ciclosporin-treated patients. Clinician comments reported symptom clearance in 15/36 (42%) omalizumab-treated and 10/60 (17%) ciclosporin-treated patients. Proportions of patients with adverse events were similar but those for omalizumab resembled CSU symptoms, making causality assignment difficult, whereas those for ciclosporin were consistent with its known adverse effect profile.Validated patient-reported measures of disease severity and quality of life should be used routinely in CSU management. Based on clinician comments and DLQI scores, symptoms and quality of life showed a greater improvement in the omalizumab-treated cohort than in the ciclosporin-treated cohort.",

    "abstract": "The immunological literature has been redefining clinical phenomena as hypotheses emerge regarding causal links between triggers, immunologic manifestations, and their specific inflammatory cascades. Of late, autoimmune manifestations that appear to be caused by an external adjuvant have been grouped into a complex syndrome referred to as autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA). This syndrome may present with diverse clinical problems, which may include neurocognitive impairment, inflammatory musculoskeletal changes, and constitutional symptoms. There is evidence in the literature linking vaccines to different auto-immune manifestations. Vaccines have not traditionally been reported to trigger ASIA, although reports are emerging linking the human papilloma virus and hepatitis B vaccines to it.We report the first suspected case of ASIA in a previously healthy patient who received the Fluad seasonal influenza vaccine, which contains the MF59 adjuvant. He presented to hospital with profound weakness and was diagnosed with severe rhabdomyolysis. He also had elevated troponin-I and extensive cardiac investigations enabled the diagnosis of myocarditis. His infectious and rheumatologic work-ups were negative. He responded well to conservative management and did not require immune suppressive therapy.Given the benefits of the influenza vaccine, and the low incidence of clinically significant complications, we encourage ongoing seasonal influenza immunization. However, ongoing surveillance is required to evaluate the occurrence of rare adverse events, including ASIA.",

This inflammatory disease can be debilitating and thus result in considerable health-related and economic consequences.In a cross-sectional study, adult subjects with AR (N = 683) completed three allergy-specific questionnaires that assessed the impact of AR on the work/academic performance, daily activities, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and satisfaction with allergen immunotherapy (AIT). Regression analyses were used to examine the associations between several clinical variables and the patient-reported outcomes.Total loss of productivity was 21.0 and 21.2 % for employed and student patients, respectively, whereas the impairment of daily activities was 22.0 %. The mean overall HRQOL score was 1.94 ± 1.29 (on the scale of 0-6 points). Global score for satisfaction with AIT was 65.5 ± 24.8 (on a 0-100 scale). Simple regression analysis found statistically significant associations between loss of work and academic productivity, impairment of daily activities and the type and severity of AR. AIT was a protective factor. The persistent and more severe types of AR and lack of AIT contributed to the worsening of HRQOL.AR (the persistent and more severe form of the disease) has an impact on functional characteristics of adult patients in Spain. AIT might reduce the effect of this disease on the work/academic performance and HRQOL. Trial registration Retrospectively registered.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have reported that oral immunotherapy (OIT) is effective for children with cow's milk (CM) allergy. These studies reported the efficacy of OIT in terms of desensitization, but did not describe sustained unresponsiveness to CM. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the OIT protocol using microwave heated cow's milk (MH-CM) in terms of 2-weeks-sustained unresponsiveness (2-weeks-SU) and safety. Forty-eight children were enrolled in this study. Thirty-one children agreed to receive rush OIT using MH-CM (the OIT group) and another 17 children who did not want to receive rush OIT formed the untreated group. Rates of desensitization and 2-weeks-sustained unresponsiveness were compared between the two groups at 1 year after the start of OIT. We followed up these rates and safety data for another year and for longer in the OIT group. No children in the untreated group did not pass an open food challenge to CM. Of the 31 children in the OIT group, 14 (P = 0.002) achieved desensitization, and 8 (P = 0.036) achieved 2-weeks-SU to CM at 1 year from the start of OIT. Two years after the start of OIT, both the rate of desensitization and the rate of 2-weeks-SU in the OIT group significantly increased compared with the rates at 1 year (P = 0.025 and P = 0.008 respectively). The rush OIT protocol using MH-CM was effective at inducing 2-weeks-SU s to CM and had a good safety profile in children with CM allergy.

FA cases born between 2007 and 2009 were matched to controls without FA on birth month/year, sex, race/ethnicity. Conditional logistic regression was used to model the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of FA diagnosis. All models were adjusted for presence of asthma, wheeze, or atopic dermatitis.A total of 1504 cases and 5995 controls were identified. Receipt of an antibiotic prescription within the initial 12 months of life was associated with FA diagnosis in unadjusted and adjusted models (aOR 1.21; 95 % CI 1.06-1.39). Compared to children with no antibiotic prescriptions, a linear increase in the aOR was seen with increasing antibiotic prescriptions. Children receiving five or more (aOR 1.64; 95 % CI 1.31-2.05) antibiotic prescriptions were significantly associated with FA diagnosis. The strongest association was noted among recipients of cephalosporin and sulfonamide antibiotics in both unadjusted and adjusted models.Receipt of antibiotic prescription in the first year of life is associated with FA diagnosis code in young children after controlling for common covariates. Multiple antibiotic prescriptions are more strongly associated with increases in the odds of FA diagnosis.",

In this study, 1525 patients (754 women and 771 men with a mean age of 52.7 ± 11.9 years) with different types of cancer were examined for the presence of allergies. Allergies were confirmed based on retrospective analysis of allergy diagnostic procedures in patients previously diagnosed with cancer. All patients were also analyzed for bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis according to relevant guidelines. A control group of patients without cancer diagnoses was used for comparison. Patients with cancer had significantly fewer IgE-mediated allergic diseases than the control population. For the oncological group compared to the non-cancer patients, the odds ratios (ORs) for allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and bronchial asthma were 0.67 (95 % CI 0.52–0.81), 0.89 (95 % CI 0.78–0.99), and 1.03 (95 % CI 0.91–1.13), respectively.

There were no significant correlations between the type of cancer diagnosed and the form of allergy. Our results indicate that the overall incidence of allergies, particularly allergic rhinitis, was lower in patients with some types of cancer. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings.",

In this prospective cohort study, we included children and youth <18 years diagnosed with EoE and treated with swallowed fluticasone or oral viscous budesonide for more than 1 month. First morning cortisol and low dose adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test (LDST) were performed 2 weeks following GC discontinuation. AS was defined as an abnormal LDST result (cortisol peak <500 nmol/L). We determined the prevalence and duration of AS related to swallowed topical GC therapy in EoE by LDST, as well as the diagnostic accuracy of first morning cortisol compared to LDST. Of 29 participants enrolled, 26 (89.7 %) received oral viscous budesonide and 3 (10.3 %) received swallowed fluticasone. Nineteen (65.5 %) participants had AS. Median duration of AS was 43 weeks. Five (17.2 %) participants had persistent AS at 12 months. There were no identifiable risk factors for the development of AS. First morning cortisol was highly specific but had poor sensitivity for detection of AS. The majority of children with EoE had AS after discontinuation of swallowed topical GC therapy. Stress steroids should be considered in children treated with swallowed topical GC therapy for EoE, even after GC discontinuation, to prevent possible adrenal crisis.",

We previously demonstrated safety and tolerability of a rapid OIT protocol using omalizumab in a phase 1 study to achieve desensitization to multiple (up to 5) food allergens in parallel, rapidly (7–36 weeks; median = 18 weeks). In the current long-term, observational study, we followed 34 food allergic participants for over 5 years, who had originally undergone the phase 1 rapid OIT protocol. Methods After reaching the maintenance dose of 2 g protein for each of their respective food allergens as a part of the phase 1 study, the long-term maintenance dose was reduced for some participants based on a pragmatic team-based decision. Participants were followed up to 62 months through standard oral food challenges (OFCs), skin prick tests, and blood tests. Results Each participant passed the 2 g OFC to each of their offending food allergens (up to 5 food allergens in total) at the end of the long-term follow-up (LTFU) study. Conclusion Our data demonstrate the feasibility of long-term maintenance dosing of a food allergen without compromising the desensitized status conferred through rapid-OIT.

    "abstract": "Eosinophilia is not an uncommon clinical finding. However, diagnosis of its cause can be a dilemma once common culprits, namely infection, allergy and reactive causes are excluded. Primary immunodeficiency disorders (PID) are among known differentials of eosinophilia. However, the list of PIDs typically reported with eosinophilia is small and the literature lacks an inclusive list of PIDs which have been reported with eosinophilia. This motivated us to review the literature for all PIDs which have been described to have elevated eosinophils as this may contribute to an earlier diagnosis of PID and further the understanding of eosinophilia. A retrospective PubMed, and Google Scholar search using the terms \"eosinophilia\" and \"every individual PID\" as classified by Expert Committee of the International Union of Immunological Societies with the limit of the English language was performed. Results were assessed to capture case(s) which reported eosinophilia in the context of PID conditions. Absolute eosinophil counts (AEC) were retrieved from manuscripts whenever reported. In addition to the typical PID conditions described with eosinophilia, we document that MHC class II deficiency, CD3γ deficiency, STAT1 deficiency (AD form), Kostmann disease, cyclic neutropenia, TCRα deficiency, Papillon-Lefevre syndrome, CD40 deficiency, CD40L deficiency, anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immune deficiency, ataxia-telangiectasia, common variable immunodeficiency disorders (CVID), Blau syndrome, CARD9 deficiency, neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease or chronic infantile neurologic cutaneous and articular syndrome (NOMID/CINCA), chronic granulomatous disease, MALT1 deficiency and Roifman syndrome have been noted to have elevated eosinophils. Severe eosinophilia (>5.0 × 109/L) was reported in Omenn syndrome, Wiskott Aldrich syndrome, ADA deficiency, autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, immunodysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked, STAT3 deficiency, DOCK8 deficiency, CD40 deficiency, MHC II deficiency, Kostmann disease, Papillon-Lefevre syndrome, and CVID. This literature review shows that there is an extensive list of PIDs which have been reported with eosinophilia. This list helps clinicians to consider an extended differential diagnoses when tasked with exclusion of PID as a cause for eosinophilia.",

Groups of sensitized animals were treated orally with either vehicle (0.4 mL/kg), standard dexamethasone (2.5 mg/kg) or alcoholic extract of V. vinifera dried fruits (31 and 42.5 mg/kg) from day 1 to 28 (n = 6 for all groups). Inflammatory markers including cell counts, cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor, immunoglobulin E (IgE), leukotrienes and nitrite levels in both blood/serum and bronchoalveolar fluid were analysed. Breathing rate and tidal volume as lung function parameters were examined by spirometer. Lung tissues were studied for histamine content and histopathology.Treatment of sensitized animals with dexamethasone or two doses of V. vinifera fruits extract inhibited recruitment of inflammatory cytokines, IgE, nitrites and circulating cells particularly eosinophils in blood/serum and bronchoalveolar fluid (p < 0.001, p < 0.01 and p < 0.05). Dexamethasone and V. vinifera fruits extract treatment also normalized lung functions and histamine levels compared to ovalbumin-sensitized controls (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01). Moreover, both drugs exhibited protection against airway inflammation in lung histology.Results of study demonstrate the effectiveness of V. vinifera fruits in allergic asthma possibly related to its ability to inhibit cellular response and subsequent production of inflammatory cytokines.",

Availability of short-acting beta agonists (SABA), inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and short acting anti-muscarinic agents (SAMA) ranged between 19.9-100%, 0-45.5% and 0-14.3% respectively. Combination of ICS-long acting beta agonists (LABA) were available in 0-14.3% of facilities surveyed.

Research about this subject in this region is still limited. More robustly performed studies are required to further understand the magnitude of inequity in access to these medicines and diagnostic tests in SSA and also to formulate simple pragmatic solutions to address this challenge.",

    "abstract": "Previous proof-of-concept studies have shown that a short course of omalizumab can safely accelerate the oral immunotherapy schedule for multiple allergens simultaneously. Considering the high cost of medication, the dose-related efficacy of omalizumab at decreasing the duration of oral immunotherapy up-dosing phase must be objectively quantified before cost-benefit analyses can be performed. The primary objective of this trial will be to compare the efficacy of 2 omalizumab dosages to placebo at decreasing time-to-maintenance dose during a symptom-driven multi-food OIT protocol.A total of 90 participants aged 6 to 25 with multiple food allergies (3 or more) will be enrolled at four sites in Canada. Participants will be randomized to: (A) Omalizumab 8 mg/kg per month (n = 36); (B) Omalizumab 16 mg/kg per month (n = 36); or (C) Placebo (n = 18). Study drug will be administered at full dosage for 12 weeks, then progressively tapered at 50% dosage (8 mg/kg vs 4 mg/kg vs placebo) for 4 weeks and at 25% dosage (4 mg/kg vs 2 mg/kg vs placebo) for another 4 weeks. After a pre-treatment period of 8 weeks, participants will undergo an initial food escalation (IFE) to an OIT mix containing 3 allergens and start daily home dosing with biweekly increases until a target daily maintenance of 1500 mg protein is achieved. The amount escalated at each visit will vary based on treatment tolerance according to a standardized up-dosing algorithm. Participants will be followed for at least 12 months following the initial food escalation. The primary endpoint will be time from IFE to the target maintenance dose of 1500 mg protein. Time-to-event analytic methods, including the log-rank test, will be used to compare the 3 arms.This trial uses a novel pragmatic approach to compare OIT with omalizumab to OIT without omalizumab in a blinded manner, which allows to single out the effect of this anti-IgE medication on treatment effectiveness speed without the recourse to predetermined schedules. The innovative patient-centered up-dosing algorithm allows to maximise treatment effectiveness speed without compromising patient safety, regardless of whether the patient is on omalizumab or not. This study will also provide novel prospective data to inform on the optimal and most cost-effective dosage for this indication.Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04045301, Registered 5 August 2019, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04045301.",

    "abstract": "Allergic diseases are increasing yearly. We aimed to evaluate the difference in allergen sensitization pattern between adults and children in southern China by analyzing a large sample size of real-life data, and to provide the evidence for formulating the prevention and management strategies. Retrospective analysis was conducted on 39,813 serum allergen-specific IgE (sIgE) results collected in southern China from January to December in 2017. Sensitization patterns and how these allergens could lead to the allergic diseases were analyzed for adults and children respectively. The difference of allergen positive rate between groups was calculated using the Chi square test. The top five most sensitized allergens in southern China were house dust mite (28.1%), cockroach (24.3%), shrimp (19.2%), crab (15.5%) and egg white (9.9%). While cockroach had the highest positive rate in adults (29.2%), the most sensitized allergen in children was house dust mite (29.7%). The positive rates of egg white and cow's milk in children were higher than in adults for the whole year (p < 0.001); whereas for adults, the positive rate to cockroach, shrimp and crab were higher than in children (p < 0.001). The positive rate of house dust mite in coastal cities (32.4%) was higher than that in landlocked cities (24.0%) in children, but in adults, the rate in landlocked cities (31.1%) was higher than that in coastal cities (25.3%). Optimal scaling analysis showed that the sIgEs of crab and shrimp had the closest correlation with cockroach-sIgE (Cronbach's α = 0.891). The positive rate to mold allergens increased from summer to autumn, reaching its plateau in October (6.2%). Patients with skin diseases were found to receive the highest sIgE prescription from doctors (56.9%). Doctors tend to prescribe more sIgE tests for patients with skin disorders in southern China. In addition to house dust mite, cockroach was found to be another important allergen. Adults with multiple sensitization always showed co-sensitization with shrimp, crab and house dust mite. These should be taken into consideration when giving allergen avoidance advice to patients.",

Whether T helper (Th)17-mediated immunity contributes to the pathogenesis of neutrophilic asthma in human is still under investigation. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between Th17-mediated immunity and airway inflammation in childhood neutrophilic asthma. Methods Twenty-eight children with exacerbated asthma and without using any glucocorticoids were divided into three groups: eosinophilic asthma (EA, n = 12) group, neutrophilic asthma (NA, n = 10) group and paucigranulocytic asthma (PGA, n = 6) group according to the induced sputum cytology. Ten healthy children were recruited as healthy control (HC, n = 10) group. Peripheral Th17 and Th2 cells, and the expression of Ki-67 in peripheral Th17 cells were detected by flow cytometry. The mRNA expression of retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γt (RORγt) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was detected by qRT-PCR. The concentrations of IL-17, IL-8 and IL-5 in sputum, as well as IL-17 in plasma and culture supernatant of activated PBMCs were measured by ELISA. Results The percentage of Th17 cells in peripheral Th cells, and the concentrations of IL-17, IL-8 in sputum, as well as IL-17 in culture supernatant of activated PBMCs were all increased in NA group, and positively correlated with neutrophil level in sputum and with each other. Also, the mRNA expression of RORγt in PBMCs and Ki-67 positivity in peripheral Th17 cells were both increased in NA group. The percentage of Th2 cells in peripheral Th cells, and the concentration of IL-5 in sputum were both increased in EA group, and positively correlated with eosinophil level in sputum and with each other. Conclusions Both Th17- and Th2-mediated immunity are involved in the pathogenesis of childhood asthma. There is predominance of Th17-mediated immunity and Th17 cells proliferation in childhood neutrophilic asthma.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Safe and effective vaccines provide the first hope for mitigating the devastating health and economic impacts resulting from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related public health orders. Recent case reports of reactions to COVID-19 vaccines have raised questions about their safety for use in individuals with allergies and those who are immunocompromised. In this document, we aim to address these concerns and provide guidance for allergists/immunologists. Methods Scoping review of the literature regarding COVID-19 vaccination, adverse or allergic reactions, and immunocompromise from PubMed over the term of December 2020 to present date. We filtered our search with the terms “human” and “English” and limited the search to the relevant subject age range with the term “adult.” Reports resulting from these searches and relevant references cited in those reports were reviewed and cited on the basis of their relevance. Results Assessment by an allergist is warranted in any individual with a suspected allergy to a COVID-19 vaccine or any of its components. Assessment by an allergist is NOT required for individuals with a history of unrelated allergies, including to allergies to foods, drugs, insect venom or environmental allergens. COVID-19 vaccines should be offered to immunocompromised patients if the benefit is deemed to outweigh any potential risks of vaccination. Interpretation This review provides the first Canadian guidance regarding assessment of an adolescent and adult with a suspected allergy to one of the COVID-19 vaccines currently available, or any of their known allergenic components, and for patients who are immunocompromised who require vaccination for COVID-19. As information is updated this guidance will be updated accordingly.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The impact of childhood food allergy on household costs has not been examined in Canada. The current study sought to examine differences in direct, indirect, and intangible costs among Canadian families with and without a food-allergic child. Methods Families with a child with a specialist-diagnosed food allergy (cases) were recruited from two tertiary pediatric allergy clinics in the Province of Manitoba, Canada, and matched, based on age and sex, to families without a food-allergic child (controls). Cost data for the two groups were collected via an adapted version of the Food Allergy Economic Questionnaire (FA-EcoQ). Consideration was given to income, defined as above vs. below the provincial annual median income. Results Results from 35 matched case/control pairs revealed that while total household costs did not significantly differ between cases and controls, food-allergic families did incur higher direct costs ($12,455.69 vs. $10,078.93, p = 0.02), which were largely attributed to spending on food. In contrast, cases reported lower, but not statistically significant, total indirect costs compared to controls ($10,038.76 vs. $12,294.12, p = 0.06). Families also perceived their food-allergic child as having poorer quality of life relative to their healthy peers. Lastly, stratification of the analyses by annual income revealed several differences between the higher and lower income groups. Conclusions Relative to families without a food-allergic child, food-allergic families incurred higher direct costs across a number of different areas.",

For 40 years, autoinjectors have been used for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Over the last 20 years, intramuscular epinephrine injected into the thigh has been recommended for optimal effect. Objective To review the literature on pharmacokinetics of epinephrine autoinjectors. Results Six studies assessing epinephrine autoinjector pharmacokinetics were identified. The studies, all on healthy volunteers, were completed by Simons, Edwards, Duvauchelle, Worm and Turner over the span of 2 decades. Simons et al. published two small studies that suggested that intramuscular injection was superior to subcutaneous injection. These findings were partially supported by Duvauchelle. Duvauchelle showed a proportional increase in C max and AUC 0-20 when increasing the dose from 0.3 to 0.5 mg epinephrine intramuscularly. Turner confirmed these findings. Simons, Edwards and Duvauchelle documented the impact of epinephrine on heart rate and blood pressure. Turner confirmed a dose-dependent increase in heart rate, cardiac output and stroke volume. Based on limited data, confirmed intramuscular injections appeared to lead to faster C max . Two discernable C max’s were identified in most of the studies. We identified similarities and discrepancies in a number of variables in the aforementioned studies. Conclusions Intramuscular injection with higher doses of epinephrine appears to lead to a higher C max . There is a dose dependent increase in plasma concentration and AUC 0-20 . Most investigators found two C max’s with T max 5–10 min and 30–50 min, respectively. There is a need for conclusive trials to evaluate the differences between intramuscular and subcutaneous injections with the epinephrine delivery site confirmed with ultrasound.",

    "abstract": "Prolidase deficiency (PD) is an autosomal recessive inborn multisystemic disease caused by mutations in the PEPD gene encoding the enzyme prolidase D, leading to defects in turnover of proline-containing proteins, such as collagen. PD is categorized as a metabolic disease, but also as an inborn error of immunity. PD presents with a range of findings including dysmorphic features, intellectual disabilities, recurrent infections, intractable skin ulceration, autoimmunity, and splenomegaly. Despite symptoms of immune dysregulation, only very limited immunologic assessments have been reported and standard therapies for PD have not been described. We report twin females with PD, including comprehensive immunologic profiles and treatment modalities used.Patient 1 had recurrent infections in childhood. At age 13, she presented with telangiectasia, followed by painful, refractory skin ulcerations on her lower limbs, where skin biopsy excluded vasculitis. She had typical dysmorphic features of PD. Next-generation sequencing revealed pathogenic compound heterozygous mutations (premature stop codons) in the PEPD gene. Patient 2 had the same mutations, typical PD facial features, atopy, and telangiectasias, but no skin ulceration. Both patients had imidodipeptiduria. Lymphocyte subset analysis revealed low-normal frequency of Treg cells and decreased frequency of expression of the checkpoint molecule CTLA-4 in CD4+ TEM cells. Analysis of Th1, Th2, and Th17 profiles revealed increased inflammatory IL-17+ CD8+ TEM cells in both patients and overexpression of the activation marker HLA-DR on CD4+ TEM cells, reflecting a highly activated proinflammatory state. Neither PD patient had specific antibody deficiencies despite low CD4+CXCR5+ Tfh cells and low class-switched memory B cells. Plasma IL-18 levels were exceptionally high.Immunologic abnormalities including skewed frequencies of activated inflammatory CD4+ and CD8+ TEM cells, decreased CTLA-4 expression, and defects in memory B cells may be a feature of immune dysregulation associated with PD; however, a larger sample size is required to validate these findings. The high IL-18 plasma levels suggest underlying autoinflammatory processes.",

    "abstract": "Allergic rhinitis (AR) and allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) are prevalent allergic diseases and have significant impacts on patients' daily life. Despite many studies on AR or ACD have been conducted separately, little is known about the immune responses in patients of AR combined with ACD and the interplay between AR and ACD. Our study compared various aspects of immune elements in patients with AR or/and ACD, aiming to characterize the immune responses in AR, ACD, and AR combined with ACD.A total of 57 patients diagnosed with AR or/and ACD and 28 healthy volunteers were included. AR patients were further divided into seasonal AR (SAR) and perennial AR (PAR). All subjects' blood samples were taken to assess the concentration of immunoglobulins, complement C3, C4, autoantibodies and cytokines in serum by immunoturbidimetry, ELISA or Luminex200 platform. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were subjected to the analysis of lymphocyte subpopulations by flow cytometry.It indicated that AR disease caused elevated levels of IgE, IgA, IgG, IgG4, as well as IL-4, IL-15, IL-8 and IL-6 in serum. AR patients possessed a decreased CD4/CD8 ratio and an increased proportion of memory CD4 + T-cell subset, with a skewed Th2 response and an enhanced CD8 + T-cell activation. Compared with patients with sole AR or ACD condition, AR + ACD patients presented with a significantly increased proportion of memory CD8 + T-cell subset and were prone to autoimmune disorders as indicated by the increased autoantibodies. The immune elements in patients with ACD only were least affected compared with those in other conditions. Additionally, seasonal or perennial AR patients exhibited different cytokine profiles and proportions of memory T-cell subsets.In this study, we illuminated the respective characteristics of immune responses in AR, ACD, and AR combined with ACD. Meanwhile, we discovered that the PAR and SAR patients possessed different cytokine profiles and T-cell compartments. It suggested that these allergic conditions belong to different disease entities. Characterizing the detailed immune changes in these allergic diseases would help to develop proper treatments targeting particular immune elements in different allergic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects children and adults. Poor treatment adherence in AD requires interventions to promote self-management; patient education in chronic diseases is key to self-management. Many international AD management guidelines published to date include a recommendation for educating patients as part of their treatment but there are no formal recommendations on how to deliver this knowledge. Main We performed a scoping review to map the existing literature on patient education practices in AD and to highlight the clinical need for improved patient education in AD. The literature search was performed with the online databases MEDLINE, Embase, Grey Matters, ClinicalTrails.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). The search strategy yielded 388 articles. Of the 388 articles screened, 16 studies met the eligibility criteria, and the quantitative data was summarized by narrative synthesis. The majority of studies were randomized controlled trials conducted in Europe, Asia and North America. Since 2002, there have been limited studies evaluating patient education in the treatment of AD. Frequent education methods used included group-based educational programs, educational pamphlets, individual consultations and online resources. Education was most commonly directed at caregivers and their children. Only one study compared the efficacy of different education methods. In all included studies, the heterogenous nature of outcome measures and study design limited the consistency of results. Despite the heterogeneity of studies, patient education was shown to improve quality of life (QoL), disease severity and psychological outcomes in AD patients. Conclusion This scoping review highlights that patient education is effective in a variety of domains relevant to AD treatment. Further comparative studies and randomized trials with longer-term follow-up are needed to provide validated and consistent patient education recommendations for AD; these may depend on age and population.",

    "abstract": "Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disease characterized by unpredictable, recurring subcutaneous or submucosal swelling. Without effective therapy, HAE can negatively impact patients' quality of life. Management of HAE includes on-demand treatment of attacks and short- and long-term prophylaxis (LTP) to prevent attacks. Newer therapies may be more tolerable and effective in managing HAE; however, therapies such as androgens are still widely used in some countries owing to their relative ease of access and adequate disease control for some patients. This study evaluated the characteristics, treatment patterns, clinical outcomes, and healthcare resource utilization of a multinational cohort of patients with HAE, with a focus on understanding reasons for recommending or discontinuing available therapies.A retrospective chart review was conducted at 12 centers in six countries and included data from patients with HAE type 1 or 2 who were ≥ 12 years of age at their first clinical visit. The relationship between LTP use and attack rates was evaluated using a multivariable Poisson regression model. Data were collected between March 2018 and July 2019.Data from 225 patients were collected (62.7% female, 86.2% White, 90.2% type 1); 64.4% of patients had their first HAE-related visit to the center prior to or during 2014. Treatment patterns varied between countries. Overall, 85.8% of patients were prescribed on-demand treatment and 53.8% were prescribed LTP, most commonly the androgen danazol (53.7% of patients who used LTP). Plasma-derived C1 inhibitor (Cinryze®) was used by 29.8% of patients for LTP. Patients who received LTP had a significantly lower rate of HAE attacks than patients who did not receive any LTP (incidence rate ratio (95% confidence interval) 0.90 (0.84-0.96)). Androgens were the most commonly discontinued therapy (51.3%), with low tolerability cited as the most frequent reason for discontinuation (50.0%).Overall, findings from this study support the use of LTP in the prevention of HAE attacks; a lower rate of attacks was observed with LTP compared with no LTP. However, the type of LTP used varied between countries, with tolerability and accessibility to specific treatments playing important roles in management decision-making.",

While our current understanding of this relationship is limited, a type 2 inflammatory (T2) phenotype has often been identified in CF patients. Research question This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between the eosinophilic CF T2 inflammatory phenotype and CF-related pulmonary outcomes and microbiological data. Study design and methods We conducted a retrospective chart review of adult patients with CF (18 and older; n = 93) receiving their care at University of Virginia Medical Center adult program from January, 2013 through December, 2018. Data collected included demographic data, CFTR (CF transmembrane conductance regulator) mutation, CF comorbidities, medications, Absolute Eosinophil Counts (AEC) in cells/µL and Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in IU/mL. Results Of 93 patients screened for study eligibility, 74 were included in the final analysis; 19 patients were excluded due to lack of longitudinal data across the study timeline. Lung function decline correlated with increased AEC (p &lt; 0.001) and IgE (p &lt; 0.001) even when adjusting for covariates: age, gender, presence of Pseudomonas spp ., MRSA, other bacterial spp., Aspergillus spp ., and other fungi (p &lt; 0.001). Univariate analysis demonstrated that people with CF who experienced more than 2 exacerbations requiring hospitalizations and/or intravenous antibiotics a year were more likely to have high AEC (p = 0.018). Logistic regression showed that as AEC increases, the probability that the measurement was taken during a CF exacerbation increases (p = 0.0039). A linear mixed model showed that each additional annual exacerbation event increased on average the log IgE by 0.04. (p = 0.015). This finding remained stable in a multivariate model (p = 0.0145). When adjusted for atopy, log IgE increases as the number of exacerbation events increases (p = 0.022). There was no association between AEC and IgE and microbiological colonization. Interpretation This study has shown that in CF patients, T2 inflammation based on serum AEC and IgE correlated with pulmonary exacerbations requiring hospitalizations and/or intravenous antibiotics, independent of bacterial airway colonization. In addition, lung function decline correlated with increased IgE and AEC. Further studies are needed to explore these correlations and potential impact on treatment.",

However, the functional relevance of this interaction still remains to be elucidated. Such associations have been found in the intestine between nerves and mast cells as well as between eosinophils and plasma cells. Similar morphologic associations have been demonstrated in the liver, mesentery, urinary bladder, and skin. Unmyelinated axons especially were found to associate with mast cells as well as Langerhans' cells in primate as well as murine skin. Although there are several pathways by which immune cells interact with the nervous system, the focus in this review will be on the interaction between mast cells and nerves.",

    "abstract": "Omalizumab has demonstrated efficacy among patients with moderate to severe persistent allergic asthma, whose symptoms are inadequately controlled with other controller agents. This therapy is generally well tolerated, but there are some safety considerations, the most important of which is the rare, but potentially life-threatening, occurrence of omalizumab-associated anaphylaxis. In Canada, data from the manufacturer of omalizumab indicate that the frequency of anaphylaxis attributed to Xolair in post-marketing use is approximately 0.2%. Other researchers, including the American Omalizumab Joint Task Force (OJTF), have suggested a lower overall frequency of 0.09%. This paper provides a summary of the epidemiologic research carried out to date and presents a concise, practical set of recommendations for the prevention, monitoring and management of omalizumab-associated anaphylaxis. Prevention tips include advice on patient education measures, concomitant medications and optimal administration. For the first three injections, the recommendation is to monitor in clinic for two hours after the omalizumab injection; for subsequent injections, the monitoring period should be 30 minutes or an appropriate time agreed upon by the individual patient and healthcare professional. In the event that a patient does experience omalizumab-associated anaphylaxis, the paper provides recommendations for handling the situation in-clinic and recommendations on how to counsel patients to recognize the potential signs and symptoms in the community and react appropriately.",

Flexible therapy options are needed. We describe and report on the outcomes of the highly individualized approach to HAE therapy practiced at our HAE center in Frankfurt (Germany). The HAE center at the Frankfurt University Hospital currently treats 450 adults with HAE or AAE and 107 pediatric HAE patients with highly individualized therapeutic approaches. 73.9% of the adult patients treat HAE attacks by on-demand therapy with pasteurized pd C1-INH concentrate, 9.8% use additional prophylaxis with attenuated androgens, 1% of the total patient population in Frankfurt has been treated with Icatibant up to now. In addition adult and selected pediatric patients with a high frequency of severe attacks are instructed to apply individual replacement therapy (IRT) with pasteurized pd C1-INH concentrate. Improvement on Quality of Life items was shown for these patients compared to previous long-term danazol prophylaxis. Home treatment of HAE patients was developed in the Frankfurt HAE center in line with experiences in hemophilia therapy and has so far been implemented over a period of 28 years. At present 248 (55%) of the adult patients and 26 (24%) of the pediatric patients are practicing home treatment either as on demand or IRT treatment. In conclusion, the individualized home therapies provided by our HAE center, aim to limit the disruption to normal daily activities that occurs for many HAE patients. Furthermore, we seek to optimize the economic burden of the disease while offering a maximum quality of life to our patients.",

    "abstract": "The history of the allergy pandemic is well documented, enabling us to put the vitamin D hypothesis into its historical context. The purpose of this study is to compare the prevalence of rickets, vitamin D supply, and allergy prevalence at 50-year intervals by means of a retrospective analysis of the literature since 1880. English cities in 1880 were characterized by an extremely high rickets prevalence, the beginning of commercial cod liver oil production, and the near absence of any allergic diseases. By 1930 hay fever prevalence had risen to about 3% in English-speaking countries where cod liver oil was preferentially used for the treatment of rickets. In 1980 vitamin D was used nation-wide in all industrialized countries as supplement to industrial baby food, thus eradicating nearly all cases of rickets. At the same time the allergy prevalence reached an all-time high, affecting about 30% of the population. Time trends are therefore compatible with the vitamin D hypothesis although direct conclusions cannot be drawn. It is interesting, however, to note that there are at least two earlier research papers linking synthesized vitamin D intake and allergy (Reed 1930 and Selye 1962) published prior to the modern vitamin D hypothesis first proposed in 1999.",

Our study aims to evaluate the effects of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) administration on CMA development using whole cow's milk proteins (CMP) sensitized Balb/C mice by two different sensitization methods. Methods LGG supplemented mice were either sensitized orally with CMP and cholera toxin B-subunit (CTB) as adjuvant, or intraperitoneally (IP) with CMP but without the adjuvant. Mice were then orally challenged with CMP and allergic responses were accessed by monitoring hypersensitivity scores, measuring the levels of CMP-specific immunoglobulins (IgG1, IgG2a and IgG) and total IgE from sera, and cytokines (IL-4 and IFN-γ) from spleen lysates. Results Sensitization to CMP was successful only in IP sensitized mice, but not in orally sensitized mice with CMP and CTB. Interestingly, LGG supplementation appeared to have reduced cow's milk allergy (CMA) in the IP group of mice, as indicated by lowered allergic responses. Conclusions Adjuvant-free IP sensitization with CMP was successful in inducing CMA in the Balb/C mice model. LGG supplementation favourably modulated immune reactions by shifting Th2-dominated trends toward Th1-dominated responses in CMP sensitized mice. Our results also suggest that oral sensitization by the co-administration of CMP and CTB, as adjuvant, might not be appropriate to induce CMA in mice.",

Since that publication, there have been multiple phase III clinical trials published on either prophylaxis or therapy of hereditary angioedema and some of these products have changed approval status in various countries. This manuscript was prepared to review and update the management of hereditary angioedema.To review approaches for the diagnosis and management of hereditary angioedema (HAE) circa December 2010 and present thoughts on moving from HAE management from international evidence-based consensus to facilitate more local health unit considerations balancing costs, efficacies of treatments, and risk benefits. Thoughts will reflect Canadian and international experiences.PubMed searches including hereditary angioedema and diagnosis, therapy, management and consensus were reviewed as well as press releases from various pharmaceutical companies to early December 2010.The 2010 International Consensus Algorithms for the Diagnosis, Therapy and Management of Hereditary Angioedema is reviewed in light of the newly published phase III Clinical trials for prevention and therapy of HAE. Management approaches and models are discussed.Consensus approach and double-blind placebo controlled trials are only interim guides to a complex disorder such as HAE and should be replaced as soon as possible with large phase IV clinical trials, meta analyses, data base registry validation of approaches including quality of life and cost benefit analyses, safety, and head-to-head clinical trials investigating superiority or non-inferiority comparisons of available approaches. Since not all therapeutic products are available in all jurisdictions and since health care delivery approaches and philosophy vary between countries, each health care delivery sector will likely devise their own algorithms based on local practicalities for implementing evidence-based guidelines and standards for HAE disease management. Quality-of-life and cost affordability benefit conclusions will likely vary between countries and health care units. Data base registries for rare disorders like HAE should be used to detect early adverse events for new therapies and to facilitate phase IV clinical trials and encourage superiority and non-inferiority comparisons of HAE management approaches.",

    "abstract": "Airway remodeling is not specifically targeted by current asthma medications, partly owing to the lack of understanding of remodeling mechanisms, altogether posing great challenges in asthma treatment. Increased airway smooth muscle (ASM) mass due to hyperplasia/hypertrophy contributes significantly to overall airway remodeling and correlates with decline in lung function. Recent evidence suggests that IgE sensitization can enhance the survival and mediator release in inflammatory cells. Human ASM (HASM) cells express both low affinity (FcεRII/CD23) and high affinity IgE Fc receptors (FcεRI), and IgE can modulate the contractile and synthetic function of HASM cells. IgE was recently shown to induce HASM cell proliferation but the detailed mechanisms remain unknown. We report here that IgE sensitization induces HASM cell proliferation, as measured by 3H-thymidine, EdU incorporation, and manual cell counting. As an upstream signature component of FcεRI signaling, inhibition of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) abrogated the IgE-induced HASM proliferation. Further analysis of IgE-induced signaling depicted an IgE-mediated activation of Erk 1/2, p38, JNK MAPK, and Akt kinases. Lastly, lentiviral-shRNA-mediated STAT3 silencing completely abolished the IgE-mediated HASM cell proliferation. Collectively, our data provide mechanisms of a novel function of IgE which may contribute, at least in part, to airway remodeling observed in allergic asthma by directly inducing HASM cell proliferation.",

The potentially fatal and disfiguring nature of HAE impacts the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with this condition. To assess the health-related quality of life of Canadian patients with HAE using the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36v2). Twenty-one patients living in Canada over age 18 with known diagnosis of hereditary angioedema due to C1-INH deficiency (HAE), completed the SF-36v2 (generic HRQoL questionnaire). Results were compared to Canadian normative data by converting the SF-36 scores into z scores. The SF-36v2 showed a significant reduction in general health (p = 0.0063) in patients with HAE when compared with healthy Canadians. Percentage of patients with z scores below 0.8 (large effect) was 47.6% for general health subscale, 33.3% for bodily pain and vitality subscales and 28.6% for physical component scores. Mean scores of eight dimensions ranged from 57.7 to 88.9. Mean Physical and mental component scores were 49.1 and 50.4. Internal consistency of evaluation was demonstrated by Cronbach's alpha value above 0.7 for all scales. General perception of health was significantly different in these patients, compared to Canadian normative data. This study of Canadian patients with HAE shows that General Health is most frequently affected followed by Bodily Pain and Vitality, as measured by SF-36v2. The SF-36v2 offers valuable insight to assess quality of life in patients with HAE, however a larger number of Canadian patients and specific tools for assessment are needed for better evaluation.",

An accurate interpretation of these results allows better insight into the evolution of a given patients sensitizations, and allows for a more precise evaluation of their prognoses. 70 patients (42 women and 28 men, aged 18–65, with the average of 35.5) with a positive feline or canine allergy diagnosis were included in the research group. 30 patients with a negative allergy diagnosis were included in the control group. The total IgE levels of all patients with allergies as well as their allergen-specific IgE to feline and canine allergens were measured. Specific IgE levels to canine (Can f 1, Can f 2, Can f 3, Can f 5) and feline (Fel d 1, Fel d 2, Fel d 4) allergen components were also measured with the use of the ImmunoCap method. Monosensitization for only one canine or feline component was found in 30% of patients. As predicted, the main feline allergen was Fel d 1, which sensitized as many as 93.9% of patients sensitized to felines. Among 65 patients sensitized to at least one feline component, for 30 patients (46.2%) the only sensitizing feline component was Fel d 1. Only 19 patients in that group (63.3%) were not simultaneously sensitized to dogs and 11 (36.7%), the isolated sensitization to feline Fel d 1 notwithstanding, displayed concurrent sensitizations to one of the canine allergen components. Fel d 4 sensitized 49.2% of the research group.64.3% of patients sensitized to canine components had heightened levels of specific IgE to Can f 1. Monosensitization in that group occurred for 32.1% of the patients. Sensitization to Can f 5 was observed among 52.4% of the patients. Concurrent sensitizations to a few allergic components, not only cross-reactive but also originating in different protein families, are a significant problem for patients sensitized to animals.",

    "abstract": "This article provides a new view of the cellular mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the links between infant formula feeding and the development of atopy and obesity. Epidemiological evidence points to an allergy- and obesity-preventive effect of breastfeeding. Both allergy and obesity development have been traced back to accelerated growth early in life. The nutrient-sensitive kinase mTORC1 is the master regulator of cell growth, which is predominantly activated by amino acids. In contrast to breastfeeding, artificial infant formula feeding bears the risk of uncontrolled excessive protein intake overactivating the infant's mTORC1 signalling pathways. Overactivated mTORC1 enhances S6K1-mediated adipocyte differentiation, but negatively regulates growth and differentiation of FoxP3(+) regulatory T-cells (Tregs), which are deficient in atopic individuals. Thus, the \"early protein hypothesis\" not only explains increased mTORC1-mediated infant growth but also the development of mTORC1-driven diseases such as allergy and obesity due to a postnatal deviation from the appropriate axis of mTORC1-driven metabolic and immunologic programming. Remarkably, intake of fresh unpasteurized cow's milk exhibits an allergy-preventive effect in farm children associated with increased FoxP3(+) Treg numbers. In contrast to unprocessed cow's milk, formula lacks bioactive immune-regulatory microRNAs, such as microRNA-155, which plays a major role in FoxP3 expression. Uncontrolled excessive protein supply by formula feeding associated with the absence of bioactive microRNAs and bifidobacteria in formula apparently in a synergistic way result in insufficient Treg maturation. Treg deficiency allows Th2-cell differentiation promoting the development of allergic diseases. Formula-induced mTORC1 overactivation is thus the critical mechanism that explains accelerated postnatal growth, allergy and obesity development on one aberrant pathway.",

Due to a leaky clinical phenotype, diagnosis and appropriate treatment are challenging in these patients. We report a 16-year-old patient with a Tlow B+ NK+ cellular immunodeficiency due to a novel nonsense mutation in exon 8 (p.R328X) of the IL2RG gene. Functional impairment of the IL2RG was confirmed by IL2-Janus kinase 3-signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling pathway investigation. In addition, the characteristics of the mutations previously described in 39 patients with an atypical phenotype were reviewed and analyzed from the literature. This is the first report of an atypical X-SCID phenotype due to an exon 8 mutation in the IL2RG gene. The variability in the phenotypic spectrum of classic X-SCID associated gene highlights the necessity of multi-disciplinary cooperation vigilance for a more accurate diagnostic workup.",

    "abstract": "Allergic rhinitis (AR) is one of the most common diseases globally and usually persists throughout life. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether the expression of inflammatory biomarkers has a relationship with the severity of allergic rhinitis and with comorbid asthma or other allergic diseases in children.For diagnosis of AR, the skin prick test was performed to measure the responses to 18 allergens. Blood levels of eosinophils and immunoglobulin E (IgE) were examined. We classified the patients into 2 groups based on the severity of the condition as Group 1 [intermittent AR (IAR) or mild persistent AR (PAR)] and Group 2 (moderate to severe PAR). To determine the expression of inflammatory biomarkers, in serum and several biomarkers (caspase-1, IL-1β, CCL-11, CCL-24 and IL-33) were measured in the serum using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Additionally, we analyzed the correlation between clinical variables and the expression of biomarkers (eosinophils count, IL-1β and CCL-24) and the severity of AR.We found that eosinophils count, IL-1β, a marker of activation of inflammasomes, and CCL-24 were significantly increased in the moderate to severe PAR group (p = 0.008, p = 0.003, p = 0.039). Additionally, the expressions of eosinophil count, IL-1β and CCL-24 were significantly higher in patients with active asthmatic symptoms than in those without these conditions. On univariate analysis, allergic rhinitis in sibling, paternal allergic rhinitis, high expression of eosinophils count, IL-1β and CCL-24, history of active asthma and atopy correlated with severity of AR. Multivariate analysis showed only paternal allergic rhinitis and high expression of IL-1β as significant risk factors of moderate to severe PAR with 6.4 fold and 4.7 fold-increase in risk, respectively (p = 0.011 and p = 0.030).In conclusion, this study provides the first evidence that an excessive release of biologically active IL-1β may promote inflammation in severe PAR. It demonstrates that IL-1β can be a biomarker for active allergic diseases such as AR, asthma, and atopy. Moreover, this finding suggests that IL-1B should be investigated as a therapeutic target in severe PAR and other allergic diseases.",

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the mainstay of treatment in persistent asthma, with a stepwise approach to increasing doses of ICS depending on asthma severity and control. ICS have known local and systemic side effects, of which adrenal suppression is still under-recognized. The latter is associated with chronic exposure and higher doses, although it has rarely been reported in children receiving low doses for a short period of time. The Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (CSACI) therefore recommends that physicians screen for adrenal suppression in children receiving high doses for more than 6 months and to consider screening those on medium dose if the risk is deemed higher by factors that increase an individual's systemic corticosteroid exposure. Morning serum cortisol level can be used as a screening tool and abnormal results or normal results with a high index of suspicion should be confirmed with low-dose ACTH stimulation tests.",

This retrospective study of adults enrolled in several health plans across the U.S. (n = 2,860,305) examined the interacting effects of obesity, age, race, and sex on adult-onset asthma and asthma control. Multivariable adjusted Cox and logistic regression models estimated hazard ratios (HR), and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for the associations between body mass index (BMI) and study outcomes, and interactions of BMI with demographic characteristics. Compared with individuals who had a BMI <25 kg/m2, the hazard of adult-onset asthma progressively increased with increasing BMI, from a 12 % increase among persons with a BMI of 25.0–29.9 kg/m2 (HR 1.12, 95 % CI 1.10, 1.14) to an almost 250 % increase among persons with a BMI ≥50 kg/m2 (HR 2.49, 95 % CI 2.38, 2.60). The magnitude of the association between obesity and asthma risk was greater for women (compared with men) and lower for Blacks (compared with non-Hispanic Whites). Among individuals with asthma, obesity was associated with poorly controlled and high-risk asthma. The present study demonstrates that the magnitude of the associations between obesity and adult-onset asthma incidence and control are modified by race, age, and sex. Understanding the role of obesity in the development of adult-onset asthma will help to improve asthma treatment algorithms and to develop targeted interventions.",

One of the ancient prescriptions from Persian Medicine was selected. The participants were divided to three groups randomly. On group received fenugreek syrup one received honey syrup and the third received placebo. Duration of treatment was 4 weeks. Quality of life, Lung function tests and IL-4 levels were evaluated before and after treatment. Results From 90 participants to study 79 completed the process. After study there was significant increase in quality of the life and lung function tests and IL-4 levels in fenugreek and honey groups. Conclusion FEV1 level was improved more than 10% in fenugreek group. Treatment was well tolerated. No serious side effects were reported during the study. The aqueous extract of fenugreek seeds appears to be effective and safe in treatment of mild asthma.

However, comparative analyses between these two major compartments (PBMCs and whole blood) are few and far between. In this study, we compared gene expression profiles of PBMCs and whole blood samples obtained from research subjects with or without mild allergic asthma. Methods Whole blood (PAXgene) and PBMC samples were obtained from 5 mild allergic asthmatics and 5 healthy controls. RNA from both sample types was measured for expression of 730 immune-related genes using the NanoString nCounter platform. Results We identified 64 uniquely expressed transcripts in whole blood that reflected a variety of innate, humoral, and adaptive immune processes, and 13 uniquely expressed transcripts in PBMCs which were representative of T-cell and monocyte-mediated processes. Furthermore, analysis of mild allergic asthmatics versus non-asthmatics revealed 47 differentially expressed transcripts in whole blood compared to 1 differentially expressed transcript in PBMCs (FDR &lt; 0.25). Finally, through simultaneous measurement of PBMC proteins on the nCounter assay, we identified CD28 and OX40 ( TNFRSF4 ), both of which are critical co-stimulatory molecules during T-cell activation, as significantly upregulated in asthmatics. Conclusions Whole blood RNA preserved in PAXgene tubes is excellent for producing gene expression data with minimal variability and good sensitivity, suggesting its utility in multi-centre studies requiring measurement of blood gene expression.",

Although several studies have reported the importance of adherence to medication and compliance with the treatment, none to date have reported the importance of regular follow-up visits. We investigated the effects of regular clinical visits on asthma exacerbation.We used claims data in the national medical insurance review system provided by the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service of Korea. We included subjects aged ≥ 15 years with a diagnosis of asthma, and who were prescribed asthma-related medication, from July 2013 to June 2014. Regular visitors (frequent visitors) were defined as subjects who visited the hospital for follow-up of asthma three or more times per year.Among 729,343 subjects, 496,560 (68.1%) were classified as regular visitors. Old age, male sex, lack of medical aid insurance, attendance of a tertiary hospital, a high Charlson comorbidity index, and a history of admission for exacerbated asthma in the previous year were significant determining factors for regular visitor status. When we adjusted for all these factors, frequent visitors showed a lower risk of asthma exacerbation requiring general ward admission (odds ratio [OR] 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47-0.50; P < 0.001), emergency room admission (OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.79-0.86; P < 0.001), and intensive care unit admission (OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.44-0.54; P < 0.001) than infrequent visitors.Regular clinical visits are significantly associated with a reduced risk of asthma exacerbation requiring hospital admission in Korean adults with asthma.",

The patient was diagnosed with immediate hypersensitivity IgE-mediated to PEGs and its derivatives.Standardization of the terminology used to describe the presence of PEGs in products would help patients to identify them clearly and unequivocally and thus avoid the development of hypersensitivity reactions.

Subjects were screened for allergic rhinitis using the Score For Allergic Rhinitis questionnaire. Current prevalence (last 12 months) was estimated. Disease severity and control were assessed using the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma classification and Rhinitis Control Assessment Test respectively. Quality of sleep, impact on daily activities and quality of life were measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Sheehan Disability Scale and EuroQol Five-Dimension questionnaire respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to investigate risk factors and co-morbidities.1808 of 33,486 subjects enrolled in the SNAPSHOT program fulfilled the case definition for allergic rhinitis. Prevalence was 3.6% [95% CI 3.2-4.0%] in Egypt, 6.4% [95% CI 5.9-6.9%] in Turkey and 6.4% [95% CI 6.0-6.9%] in the Gulf cluster. Risk factors identified were country, co-morbid asthma and income. Subjects with allergic rhinitis reported a significantly lower quality of life compared to the general population (p < 0.0001). Overall, 55% of allergic rhinitis subjects were moderate/severe and 33% were uncontrolled.

The correlation between forced expiratory flow at 50% (FEF50%) and FEF25-75% in the CVA population was first evaluated. FEF50% was determined to be an easy and feasible parameter for identifying small airway disease. CVA with small airway disease is defined as FEF50% < 70%, whereas CVA with normal small airways is identified as FEF50% > 70%. Demographic features, clinical characteristics, lung function and induced sputum test results were determined at the initial visit and at the final visit 1 year later.FEF50% is a good marker for small airway disease. The cutoff value of 70% is more sensitive than the previously published 60% for identifying more patients with small airway problems early. Nearly half of the CVA population (45.4%) in our cohort had small airway disease. In both group, symptoms improved greatly after anti-asthmatic treatment. Interestingly, the changes in symptom scores [Asthma Control Test (ACT) and ACQ] were even greater in the CVA with small airway disease group than in the control group because of the higher medication usage in this subpopulation in real life. However anti-asthmatic therapy can not reverse small airway dysfunction. At last visit, FEF50% of CVA with small airway diseases was 57.2% ± 10.5%, still much lower than the control group (FEF50% = 92.6% ± 16.5%).In our cohort, nearly half of the CVA population had small airway disease. Their demographic features, clinical characteristics, airway eosinophils and drug responsiveness were quite similar between two groups, which means these indices can not be used as markers to identify small airway obstruction. We found FEF50% is an easy and feasible marker for early identification. Regular anti-asthmatic medication helped to improve clinical scores in patients with small airway disease, but the obstruction could not be reversed over 1-year period.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a severe hypersensitivity reaction to aspergillus species colonizing the airways of patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis. Biologics including anti-IgE and anti-IL5 antibodies have strongly changed the treatment of severe asthmatics and have partly been reported to be effective in the treatment of ABPA. Recently, dupilumab, an anti-IL4-Rα antibody which inhibits signaling by the Th2-cytokines IL4 and IL13, has been approved for the treatment of severe asthma. Case presentation Here, we report the case of a 49-year-old woman with severe asthma and ABPA, who was uncontrolled despite maximum inhalative therapy, anti-IL5-Rα antibody and continuous oral steroid therapy. Moreover, trials of itraconazole as well as omalizumab showed insufficient efficacy. Lung function revealed peripheral obstruction. FeNO and IgE were increased, eosinophils were suppressed under treatment while marked increases had been documented previously. Switching to dupilumab led to a complete resolution of pulmonary symptoms, resolution of exacerbations and complete withdrawal of oral steroids. A drastic improvement in lung function was noted, with an increase in FEV1 of almost 1 l. FeNO was normalized and IgE strongly reduced. Conclusion Our case highlights that a patient may exhibit differential treatment responses to the currently available asthma biologics and suggests switching treatment if outcome is insufficient. A potential role for dupilumab in the treatment of ABPA warrants future studies.",

    "abstract": "Melkersson–Rosenthal syndrome (MRS) is a rare, neuro-mucocutaneous disease which presents as orofacial swelling, facial palsy and fissured tongue. These symptoms may occur simultaneously or, more frequently, with a oligosymptomatic or monosymptomatic pattern. Swelling, that is the most common initial finding, may mimic hereditary or acquired angioedema, a disorder caused by histamine or bradykinin-mediated plasma-leakage affecting subcutaneous and/or submucosal tissue. The differential diagnosis of MRS includes also chronic inflammatory and infective diseases characterized by granulomatous infiltration, as well as rosacea, contact dermatitis, allergic reactions and Bell’s palsy. A 71-year old, non-allergic female patient with no familial and personal history of angioedema presented, a few days after a possible herpes simplex or varicella-zoster virus infection, with monolateral facial paraesthesia and lower lip edema. After temporary remission of symptoms on oral steroids and antihistamines, she showed swelling recurrence refractory to valaciclovir therapy and a subsequent course of antihistamines. The clinical picture and a previous history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma prompted us to rule out an acquired form of paraneoplastic, C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency: C1q and both antigen and functional C1-INH tested normal, whilst we found low plasma levels of C3 and C4 possibly related to the parallel detection of antiphospholipid antibodies. Thus, we hypothesized a non-histaminergic, idiopathic form of angioedema and planned further therapy with tranexamic acid and the leukotriene receptor antagonist montelukast. Treatment failure with both drugs finally suggested a Melkersson–Rosenthal syndrome, which was confirmed by histologic findings of non caseating granulomas on lip biopsy. Melkersson–Rosenthal syndrome may occur with rather non-specific symptoms and overlap with alternative conditions, including recurrent angioedema. No specific biomarkers for MRS exist and clinical diagnosis is often of exclusion. The finding of complement or immune alterations, as in our patient, may be further confounding and justify the need for skin or mucosal biopsy to establish a correct diagnosis and prescribe targeted therapy.",

    "abstract": "Limited information is available on the clinical course of patients with severe asthma following discontinuation of biologic treatment. Therefore, a post hoc analysis was conducted in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma who participated in the COSMOS trial, where patients received mepolizumab for more than 1 year of continuous therapy. The objective of this post hoc analysis was to evaluate changes in the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5) and blood eosinophil counts 12 weeks after the last administration of mepolizumab. Cessation of mepolizumab was associated with a rise in the blood eosinophil count and loss of asthma control after stopping therapy. These data suggest that patients with severe disease require extended and continuous treatment. Further studies evaluating longer duration of continuous treatment with mepolizumab could help understanding of whether changes in the presentation of the disease (disease modification) are possible with the use of biologics, such as mepolizumab.",

    "abstract": "The differentiation of CD4+ lymphocytes Th17/regulatory T cells (Treg) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is associated with the pathogenesis of allergic asthma. Basic research has shown that IDO is likely a \"switch\" of the transition from Th17 cells to Tregs under certain conditions. However, no relevant clinical studies have been reported on the association between IDO activity and Th17/Treg imbalance in children with allergic asthma. The goal of this study was to test whether indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) participates in the pathogenesis of pediatric allergic asthma by influencing Th17/regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation and related cytokines.Thirty-three children with allergic asthma and 33 healthy children were selected. The subjects were evaluated via a pulmonary function test, a skin prick test, and an eosinophil count. Peripheral blood was collected to measure Th17/Treg percentages and related cytokine levels. Blood and induced sputum were obtained to measure the IDO level.Compared with the control group, the patient group had an obvious Th17/Treg imbalance; their IDO levels were significantly lower, their IL-17 and IL-6 levels were markedly higher, and their IL-10 and TGF-β levels were markedly lower than those of the control group. The IDO levels in both blood and induced sputum were negatively correlated with the Th17/Treg ratio.A significant correlation was observed between IDO activity and Th17/Treg imbalance in children with allergic asthma. IDO may upregulate Treg numbers by stimulating IL-10 production and inhibiting IL-6 expression. Therefore, IDO may be a molecular switch that leads to the conversion of Th17 cells to Tregs, thus playing a potentially protective role in the pathogenesis of asthma.Trial registration This study was approved by the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry with registration number ChiCTR-COC-15006080 and was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Southwest Hospital.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Atopic diseases, such as atopic dermatitis (AD) and food allergy (FA), have increased in prevalence in industrialized countries during the past few decades and pose a significant health burden. They appear to have a common underlying mechanism and a natural disease progression. AD is generally the first atopic disease to manifest followed by other atopic diseases, such as FA, allergic rhinitis, or allergic asthma suggesting that they are likely different manifestations of the same disease. Body Evidence suggests that allergic sensitization occurs through an impaired skin barrier, while consumption of these foods at an early age may actually result in tolerance. This has been termed the Dual-Allergen-Exposure hypothesis. Loss of barrier integrity has been hypothesized to enable penetration of allergens, pollutants, and microbes and initiation of an inflammatory immune cascade of events leading to sensitization. The immune dysfunction is thought to further exacerbate the impaired skin barrier to form a vicious cycle. There is much interest in preventing or protecting the skin barrier from developing a proinflammatory atopic state, which may potentially lead to the development of AD and subsequently, FA. Conclusion Research on preventing or treating skin barrier dysfunction is ongoing. A number of studies have evaluated the efficacy of emollients in preventing AD and FA with mixed results. Studies have differed in the study design, population characteristics, emollients type, and frequency, duration, and area of application. Emollient type has varied widely from oils, creams, petrolatum-based lotions, and trilipid creams. Current research is directed towards the use of trilipid emollients that are similar to the skin’s natural lipid composition with a 3:1:1 ratio of ceramides, cholesterol and free fatty acids and a pH that is similar to that of skin to determine their effectiveness for skin barrier repair and prevention of AD and FA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Common variable immunodeficiency is the most prevalent symptomatic primary immunodeficiency in adults. Affected patients fail to mount an appropriate humoral response against community acquired infectious diseases and recent reports have provided data supporting the increased susceptibility of these patients to severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. In this context, the infusion of COVID-19 convalescent plasma could represent an effective therapeutic strategy. Case presentation 25-year old woman diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency in 2013, developed severe COVID-19 that rapidly progressed to pneumonia presenting with multiple bilateral lung opacities that were both central and peripheral and presented as ground-glass and consolidation types involving all lobes, bilaterally. As blood oxygen saturation decayed and lung abnormalities were not responsive to large spectrum antibiotics and corticosteroids, patient was placed on mechanical ventilation and compassionate-use of approved COVID-19 convalescent donor plasma was introduced. The patient presented a rapid response to the approach and mechanical ventilation could be interrupted 24 h after first dose of COVID-19 convalescent donor plasma. As a whole, the patient received four doses of 200 mL convalescent plasma during a period of 6 days. There was rapid improvement of clinical status, with interruption of supplemental oxygen therapy after 6 days and reduction of lung abnormalities as evidence by sequential computed tomography scans. Conclusions This is a single patient report that adds to other few reports on common variable immunodeficiency and agammaglobulinemia, suggesting that COVID-19 convalescent donor plasma could be a valuable therapeutic approach to treat patients affected by dysgammaglobulinemias and presenting severe COVID-19.",

Data source A literature search was conducted on Embase and Medline. Study selection Clinical studies published in English and published between 1999 and 2020 were selected. Results Although the exact pathogenesis of urticaria is not fully understood, multiple pathways of mast cell activation are discussed to explain the existence of phenotypically different clinical manifestations of urticaria. An overview of the worldwide prevalence of chronic urticaria, including disease burden and patient’s quality of life is provided. The impact of urticaria on patient’s life differs on the basis of whether its form is acute or chronic, but pharmacological approaches are most often needed to control the disabling symptoms. A summary of the current management of urticaria recommended by different guidelines across countries (Global; European; American; Australian; Asian; Japanese) is presented. Non-sedating, second-generation H 1 -antihistamines are the preferred choice of treatment across several guidelines worldwide. Herein, the efficacy and safety of fexofenadine HCl, a representative second-generation H 1 -antihistamine approved for the treatment of urticaria, is discussed. The occurrence of urticaria manifestations in COVID-19 patients is also briefly presented. Conclusion The burden of acute and chronic urticaria is high for patients. Second generation anti-histamines such as fexofenadine HCl can help managing the symptoms.",

Plumbagin (PL) is an herbal extract with diverse pharmacological effects that have been recently used to treat various types of cancer. This study aims to explore the anti-fibrotic effect of PL and possible underlying mechanisms in IPF.We used a bleomycin-induced experimental mouse model of lung fibrosis to assess the potential anti-fibrotic effect of PL. Histological analysis of lung tissue samples by H&E and Masson's trichrome staining and hydroxyproline assay was performed to evaluate the fibrotic alterations. ELISA and real-time quantitative PCR were conducted to determine the amount of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), tumor growth factor-beta (TGF-β), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and endothelin-1 (ET-1).Bleomycin exposure induced lung fibrosis, which was indicated by inflammation, collagen deposition, and structural damage. PL remarkably prevented bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Furthermore, PL significantly inhibited TNF-α and TGF-β production. PL also diminished the upregulated expression of CTGF and ET-1 induced by bleomycin.Overall, our findings suggest PL as an anti-fibrotic agent acting via down-regulation of TGF-β/CTGF or ET-1 axis, as well as TNF-α, to improve lung fibrosis.",

Estimating the economic impact of self-administered SCIg versus clinic-administered IVIg therapy may guide treatment recommendations.A retrospective population-based cohort study using administrative data from Alberta was performed; those treated with IgG between April 1, 2012 and March 31, 2019 were included. Costs for medical laboratory staff and nursing time, as well as ambulatory care visits were considered. Univariate generalized linear model regression with gamma distribution and log link was used to compare cost ($CDN 2020) between SCIg and IVIg administration. Stratified analysis by age (≥ 18-years; < 18-years) was performed.Among 7,890 (6,148 adults; 1,742 children) individuals who received IgG, the average administration cost per patient-year of self-administered SCIg was $5,386 (95% confidence interval [CI] $5,039, $5,734) lower than clinic-administered IVIg; per patient-year cost of self-administered SCIg was $817 (95% CI $723, $912) versus $6,204 (95% CI $6,100, $6,308) for clinic-administered IVIg. The per patient-year cost of self-administered SCIg was $5,931 (95% CI $5,543, $6,319) lower among adults and $3,177 (95% CI $2,473, $3,882) lower among children compared with clinic-administered IVIg. An estimated $31.0 million (95% CI $29.0, $33.0) in cost savings to the health system would be realised if 80% of individuals switched from clinic-administered IVIg to self-administered SCIg.Self-administered SCIg is substantially less costly from a health care payer perspective in Canada. Within this type of health system, switching to self-administered SCIg has the potential to reduce overall health care costs, lessen nursing burden, and may increase clinic-based capacity for others.",

Recent data suggest IVIG might be more effective in a subgroup of women with an aberrant immunological profile. Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on the effectiveness of IVIG treatment on pregnancy outcome among women with RPL and underlying immunological conditions (e.g., elevated NK cell percentage, elevated Th1/Th2 ratio, diagnosis with autoimmune disorders) was conducted. Eight non-randomized controlled trials, including 478 women (intervention: 284; control: 194), met eligibility criteria. Meta-analysis showed that treatment with IVIG was associated with a two-fold increase in live birth rate (RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.44-2.73, P < 0.0001). The effect of IVIG was particularly marked in the subgroup of studies including patients based on presence of elevated (> 12%) NK-cell percentage (RR 2.32, 95% CI 1.77-3.02, P < 0.0001) and when starting intervention prior to or during cycle of conception (RR 4.47, 95% CI 1.53-13.05, P = 0.006). In conclusion, treatment with IVIG may improve live birth rate in women with RPL and underlying immune conditions. However, these results should be interpreted with caution as studies are limited by low number of participants and the non-randomized design, which represent seriously biases. Future randomized controlled trials in women with RPL and underlying immune conditions are needed before using IVIG in a clinical setting.",

This study aimed to describe the natural history of 30 Italian patients with AD-HIES recorded in the Italian network for primary immunodeficiency (IPINet) registry. This study shows the incidence of manifestations present at the time of diagnosis versus those that arose during follow up at a referral center for IEI. The mean time of diagnostic delay was 13.7 years, while the age of disease onset was < 12 months in 66.7% of patients. Respiratory complications, namely bronchiectasis and pneumatoceles, were present at diagnosis in 46.7% and 43.3% of patients, respectively. Antimicrobial prophylaxis resulted in a decrease in the incidence of pneumonia from 76.7% to 46.7%. At the time of diagnosis, skin involvement was present in 93.3% of the patients, including eczema (80.8%) and abscesses (66.7%). At the time of follow-up, under therapy, the prevalence of complications decreased: eczema and skin abscesses reduced to 63.3% and 56.7%, respectively.

We theorized that while individuals with respiratory disease or autoimmune disorders would perceive greater threat from COVID-19 and be more supportive of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), those with autoimmune disorders would be less likely to support vaccination-based interventions.We conducted a two-wave online survey conducted in February and November 2021 asking respondents their beliefs about COVID-19 risk perception, adoption and support of interventions, willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19, and reasons for vaccination. Regression analysis was conducted to assess the relationship of respondents reporting a chronic disease and COVID-19 behaviors and attitudes, compared to healthy respondents adjusting for demographic and political factors.In the initial survey, individuals reporting a chronic disease had both stronger feelings of risk from COVID-19 as well as preferences for NPIs than healthy controls. The only NPI that was still practiced significantly more compared to healthy controls in the resample was limiting trips outside of the home. Support for community-level NPIs was higher among individuals reporting a chronic disease than healthy controls and remained high among those with respiratory diseases in sample 2. Vaccine acceptance produced more divergent results: those reporting chronic respiratory diseases were 6% more willing to be vaccinated than healthy controls, while we found no significant difference between individuals with autoimmune diseases and healthy controls. Respondents with chronic respiratory disease and those with autoimmune diseases were more likely to want to be vaccinated to protect themselves from COVID-19, and those with an autoimmune disease were more likely to report fear of a bad vaccine reaction as the reason for vaccine hesitancy. In the resample, neither those with respiratory diseases nor autoimmune diseases reported being more willing to receive a booster vaccine than healthy controls.It is not enough to recognize the importance of health in determining attitudes: nuanced differences between conditions must also be recognized.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Current management of food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) involves strict avoidance of the offending food for 12–18 months, followed by oral food challenge (OFC) under physician supervision. OFCs are resource-intensive and there is a lack of a universal standardized protocol for FPIES. Prolonged avoidance may increase the risk of IgE-mediated allergy, particularly in atopic patients. Food ladders have shown success in promoting accelerated tolerance in patients with IgE-mediated allergy. Our case series evaluated the safety of use of the Canadian Egg Ladder in patients with mild-to-moderate FPIES to egg. Methods From May 2020 to November 2021, patients with mild-to-moderate FPIES to egg, defined as no history of lethargy or intravenous fluid administration, were started on the Canadian Egg Ladder. Instructions for advancing up the ladder were identical to using the Canadian Egg Ladder in patients with IgE-mediated allergy. Patients were followed every 3–6 months, at which time information was collected regarding progression up the ladder, symptoms while on treatment and interventions required. Treating allergists completed a survey to capture baseline demographic characteristics and prior tolerance to egg. Descriptive statistics were analyzed using MS Excel. Results Twenty-one patients with mild-to-moderate FPIES were started on the Canadian Egg Ladder. Median age at initiation of the ladder was 10 months (IQR, 9–11). Nineteen (90.5%) patients completed the ladder, tolerating a serving size amount of cooked egg, over a median duration of 7 month (IQR, 4–9 months). Four patients (19.0%) had mild symptoms including vomiting (9.5%), pallor (9.5%), belching (4.8%), irritability (4.8%) and small spit up (4.8%). In three of the four patients, symptoms were the result of accidental exposure to a higher step of the ladder. There were no reports of lethargy. No patients required health care presentation or intravenous fluid administration. No patients discontinued the ladder. Conclusions The Canadian Egg Ladder can safely guide the dietary advancement of egg-containing foods in patients with mild-to-moderate FPIES to egg, without the need for prolonged avoidance and resource-intensive OFCs.",

    "abstract": "With ongoing COVID-19 vaccination schedules and the popularity of cosmetic fillers, it is important to examine and record associated adverse reactions to a more general audience of health care professionals. Case reports exist in subspecialty journals outlining reactions after SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. This is one of the first cases published in Canada, and it highlights priorities and challenges faced by physicians in assessing and managing patients presenting with adverse reactions post vaccination.We present a case of a 43 -year-old women with delayed type 4 hypersensitivity reaction to hyaluronic acid cosmetic filler triggered by COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. We outline the clinical presentation, diagnosis, complications, and treatment of a late inflammatory reaction to hyaluronic acid filler and highlight the treatment priorities for clinicians faced with similar presentations.The differential diagnosis of delayed onset nodules formation post filler injection is broad and includes redistribution of fillers, inflammatory reaction to biofilm, and delayed hypersensitivity reaction. As result, in order to make the right diagnosis, administer the appropriate treatment and achieve great cosmetic results, we highly recommend seeking expert opinion from dermatologist, plastic surgeon and allergist immunologist in a timely manner.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives Immunoglobulin A deficiency (IgAD) is a common disease with an unknown genetic defect, characterized by the decreased or absent IgA with other isotypes normal, normal subclasses, and specific antibodies. Patients with this disorder represent a spectrum of clinical manifestations including infections, autoimmune disorders, malignancy, and allergic diseases. The current study aimed to evaluate their prevalence and categorized them. Methods We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases to find eligible studies from the earliest available date to January 2022 with standard keywords. Pooled estimates of clinical manifestations prevalence and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated using random-effects models. Results The most prevalent clinical manifestations belonged to infection (64.8%) followed by allergic diseases (26.16%) and autoimmunity (22.0%), respectively. In selective IgA deficiency patients as the largest group of IgAD in current study, celiac disease (6.57%), Inflammatory bowel disease (4.01%), and rheumatoid arthritis (3.80%) were the most prevalent autoimmunity. Meanwhile, the most frequent infection was respiratory tract infection, fungal infection, and gastrointestinal infection at 50.74%, 18.48%, and 15.79%, respectively. In addition, the pooled prevalence of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and allergic conjunctivitis were 19.06%, 15.46%, and 11.68%, respectively which were reported as the most widespread allergic diseases. Conclusions Our results showed that apart from undiagnosed IgAD patients, IgAD patients represent a wide range of clinical manifestations. Infection, allergy, and autoimmunity are the most common clinical manifestations. The concurrent presence of IgA and IgG subtypes deficiency could be associated with increased susceptibility to infection. Considering the probability of developing new clinical complications during follow-up, periodic assessments of IgAD patients should be inspected.",

A willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 50,000 Canadian dollars (CAD) per QALY was used to determine cost-effectiveness. Dupilumab, omalizumab, and mepolizumab were each compared to each other.Omalizumab was the most cost-effective biologic using current estimates of cost and efficacy in CRSwNP. Using omalizumab as a baseline, dupilumab had an ICER of $235,305/QALY. Mepolizumab was dominated by omalizumab and dupilumab at the current drug prices and estimates of efficacy. Sensitivity analyses determined that when increasing the WTP threshold to $150,000/QALY, dupilumab became cost-effective compared to omalizumab in 22.5% of simulation scenarios. Additionally, altering dosing frequency had a significant effect on cost-effectiveness.When comparing the relative cost-effectiveness of biologics in recalcitrant CRSwNP, omalizumab currently appears to be the most cost-effective option. Future reductions in drug prices, adjustments to currently approved dosing regimens, better patient selection, and improvements in sinus surgery outcomes will challenge the current cost-effectiveness models and necessitate reassessment as treatments for CRSwNP continue to evolve.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background While a connection has been established between serum interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) levels and the IL-6 gene (− 174G/C) polymorphism in allergic diseases such as asthma, its specific association with severe asthma remains unexplored. This study examined the relationship between the IL-6 (− 174G/C) gene polymorphism and mild and severe asthma, focusing on its influence on type 2 inflammation. Methods Our study comprised 98 patients with mild asthma and 116 with severe asthma. Additionally, we recruited 121 healthy participants to serve as controls for comparative analyses. The IL-6 gene (− 174G/C) polymorphism was assessed utilizing the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR–RFLP) method. Results In our study, the risk of mild asthma exhibited a significant fourfold increase in individuals with the GG genotype pattern compared to healthy controls, yielding an odds ratio (OR) of 4.4 ( p &lt; 0.001). Conversely, we found no significant correlation between the IL-6 − 174G/C gene polymorphism and severe asthma when compared to the healthy control group. However, a noteworthy pattern emerged when we compared subgroups of mild and severe asthma. The risk of severe asthma increased fivefold in individuals with the GC polymorphism pattern, with an OR of 4.99 ( p &lt; 0.001), while the likelihood of mild asthma showed a similar fourfold increase with the GG polymorphism pattern, OR = 4.4 ( p &lt; 0.001). Consequently, we observed a significantly higher frequency of the C allele in patients with severe asthma, whereas the G allele was more prevalent in individuals with mild asthma ( p = 0.05). Additionally, the correlation between markers of type 2 inflammation and the dominant model of the IL-6 gene -174G/C polymorphism (CC + CG vs GG) revealed a significant increase in total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE), Blood Eosinophil Counts (BEC), and Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) levels in asthmatic patients with the CC + CG gene pattern compared to those with GG, with p-values of 0.04, 0.03, and 0.04, respectively. Furthermore, after adjusting for other risk factors, the likelihood of developing severe asthma increased from fourfold to eightfold, with an OR of 8.12 ( p = 0.01) with (CC + CG) gene pattern. Other predictors for severe asthma included older age and childhood-onset disease (OR = 1.13 and 19.19, p &lt; 0.001). Allergic rhinitis (AR) and nasal polyps (NP) also demonstrated a substantial association with an increased risk of severe asthma, with odds ratios of 5 and 32.29 ( p = 0.01 and &lt; 0.001), respectively. Additionally, elevated Body Mass Index (BMI), BEC, and FeNO were linked to severe asthma, with ORs of 1.11, 1.00, and 1.04, respectively ( p = 0.04, 0.05, and 0.001). Conclusion This study illuminated the intricate relationship between the IL-6 gene polymorphism, type 2 inflammation markers, and diverse risk factors in shaping asthma severity. As a significant association between the GG polymorphism of the IL-6 gene (− 174G/C) and mild asthma was found, while possessing at least one C allele, whether in a homozygous (CC) or heterozygous (CG) combination, independently predicts the likelihood of severe asthma.",

    "abstract": "Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a prevalent disease in Canada that affects both children and adults. Several guidelines for the management of AR have been published by professional allergy societies worldwide. However, there are regional differences in the clinical management of AR, and regulatory approval of some AR pharmacotherapies varies among countries. Thus, six research questions specific to the treatment of AR in Canada were identified for this focused practice parameter. Reviews of the literature published since 2016 were conducted to obtain evidence-based support for the responses of the Work Group to each research question. In response to research question 1 \"In patients with symptoms indicative of AR, is serum-specific IgE sufficient to identify candidates for immunotherapy or is a skin prick test mandatory?\" the Work Group concluded that either sIgE testing or skin prick test are acceptable for diagnosing AR and guiding immunotherapy. In response to research question 2 \"When taking into account the preferences of the patient and the prescriber (stakeholder engagement) should second-generation oral antihistamine (OAH) or intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) be first line?\" the Work Group concluded that existing guidelines generally agree on the use of INCS as a first-line therapy used for AR, however, patient and provider preferences and considerations can easily shift the first choice to a second-generation OAH. In response to research question 3 \"Is a combination intranasal antihistamine (INAH)/INCS formulation superior to INCS plus OAH? Do they become equivalent after prolonged use?\" the Work Group concluded that that the combination INAH/INCS is superior to an INCS plus OAH. However, there was insufficient evidence to answer the second question. In response to research question 4 \"Do leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) have a greater benefit than OAH in AR for some symptoms to justify a therapeutic trial in those who cannot tolerate INCS?\" the Work Group concluded that LTRAs have inferior, or at best equivalent, daytime or overall symptom control compared with OAH, but LTRAs may improve nighttime symptom control and provide benefits in patients with AR and concomitant asthma. In response to research question 5 \"Should sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) tablets be considered first-line immunotherapeutic options over subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) based on the evidence of efficacy?\" the Work Group concluded that the choice of SLIT or SCIT cannot be made on efficacy alone, and differences in other factors outweigh any differences in efficacy. In response to research question 6 \"Based on efficacy data, should ALL patients seen by an allergist be offered SLIT or SCIT as a treatment option?\" the Work Group concluded that the efficacy data suggests that SLIT or SCIT should be used broadly in patients with AR, but other clinical concerns also need to be taken into consideration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IgRT) is the current standard of care for primary antibody deficiency patients (majority of all primary immunodeficiency (PID) diseases), with growing real-world evidence supporting use for secondary immunodeficiency (SID) patients. Infusion methods and practices can affect patients’ satisfaction with their treatment and perception of their health-related quality of life. Methods An online survey of US patients with PID and SID was conducted. This research investigates primarily the impact of two IgRT infusion methods, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG) and subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG), on the patient reported outcome (PRO) Life Quality Index (LQI) tool. Patient reported infusion time efficiency, physical and mental health (PROMIS GPH-2 and PROMIS GMH-2 respectively), patient acceptability of their symptom state (PASS), upper extremity disability (Quick DASH) and general health perception (via the GHP) are also investigated. Results Responses of 990 patients (391 IVIG and 598 SCIG) were analyzed. The median total LQI score amongst SCIG patients (84.7) was higher than IVIG patients (81.9) ( p &lt; 0.001), and was significantly higher on 3 out of 4 sub-domains of the LQI. SCIG patients scored higher on items that are related to convenience and reported less interference with everyday life: “Are convenient”, “Are scheduled according to my convenience”, “Do not interfere with my work/school” and “Require very little time and cost”. However, there was no significant difference between the two patient cohorts on other, non-IG specific PROs (PASS, PROMIS GPH-2 and GMH-2 and Quick DASH). Patient reported time per infusion was lower for SCIG infusions than IVIG infusions (pre-infusion time; 22 min vs. 63 min, p &lt; 0.001, infusion time; 120 min vs. 240 min, p &lt; 0.001, post-infusion time; 9 min vs. 31 min, p &lt; 0.001). IVIG patients also reported more interference with everyday life than SCIG patients (82 vs. 86, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions The significantly higher LQI scores for patients receiving SCIG than those receiving IVIG confirms existing evidence that substitution of SCIG for IVIG may favorably impact immunoglobulin specific perceptions of quality of life and treatment satisfaction for appropriately selected patients. Our evidence on infusion times indicates similar improvement may be possible on infusion time efficiency.",

We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of delayed ED transfer after EAI use in non-medical settings (watchful waiting) compared to immediate ED transfer among pediatric patients with food allergies in Canada. Methods We developed a probabilistic Markov model of individuals starting at age of one year who are at risk of severe food-related allergic reactions requiring epinephrine. We evaluated medical costs (in 2022 Canadian dollars) and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) of each strategy over a 20-year horizon. In the base case, we assumed a tenfold increase in food allergy fatality for patients under watchful waiting, which we increased to 100- to 1,000-fold in sensitivity analysis. The analysis was conducted from the Canadian healthcare system perspective with a 1.5% annual discount rate and a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000 per QALY. Results Immediate ED transfer following EAI use resulted in a decreased risk of food allergy fatality of 9.2 × 10 − 5 over 20 years, which is equivalent to &lt; 1 fatality per 200,000 patient-years. Watchful waiting resulted in cost savings of $1,157 per patient and a QALY loss of 7.28 × 10 − 4 ; an incremental cost per QALY saved of $1,589,854. The incremental cost per death prevented with immediate ED transfer was $12,586,613. Watchful waiting remained cost-effective in all sensitivity and scenario analyses, except under extreme increases in fatality risk of 500-fold and 1,000-fold. Conclusions Watchful waiting for symptom re-occurrence following EAI administration in non-medical settings is cost-effective.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background When a member of a family has been diagnosed with hereditary angioedema (HAE) before a child is born, the question of early diagnosis arises. Indeed, the first attacks may occur at birth. Early diagnosis is complicated by biological issues. Due to the immaturity of the complement system, C1 Inhibitor (C1 INH) and C4 levels can be low at birth, generally in the range of 60 to 100% of adult reference values. Like most complement proteins, their levels generally normalize after one year of life. However, this is not always the case, and we report two counter-examples here. Case presentation A woman with well-documented HAE due to type II C1 INH deficiency gave birth to two children 4 years apart. Functional C1 INH assays performed at 8 and 7 months of age returned normal C1 INH inhibitory activity. However, a genetic exploration revealed the presence of the mother’s pathogenic gene variant in both children. Subsequent monitoring of C1 INH activity at 3 and 4 years of age confirmed a pathological reduction in C1 INH inhibitory activity. Conclusion For the early detection of HAE in children, these cases lead us to recommend genetic testing for the index parent’s pathological variant rather than reliance on results of C1 INH assays.",

    "abstract": "Cat allergen is the second most common cause of perennial allergic rhinitis. Despite its prevalence (~ 20% of the population), many patients continue to suffer from persistent symptoms due to constant exposure to cat allergens that reduce treatment efficacy. Modelling of the disease can improve our understanding of its onset and progression. The Specialized Particulate Control Environmental Exposure Unit (SPaC-EEU) is a controlled allergen challenge facility that has recently undergone a successful technical validation for cat dander exposure, measuring Felis domesticus 1 (Fel d 1). We then sought to perform a clinical validation with cat-allergic and non-allergic participants. This study consisted of 3 visits. Recruited participants attended a Screening visit where eligibility was assessed, and a skin prick test (SPT) was completed. Successfully screened cat-allergic and non-allergic participants were invited back for the Allergen Exposure visit. They attended one of two 3-hour cat dander exposure Sessions in the SPaC-EEU, due to space limitations, with a target Fel d 1 concentration of 70 ng/m3. Fel d 1 concentrations were collected using air sampling cassettes and processed using a Fel d 1-specific ELISA. Real-time particle counts were monitored using a laser particle counter (LPC). Participants recorded symptom scores at time points from baseline up to 24 h post-onset of allergen exposure. Participants returned to the research site for a 24-hour Follow-up visit. Allergic participants completed a cat exposure and Quality of Life questionnaire. Forty-six (31 cat-allergic and 15 non-allergic) participants completed this study. Allergic participants had significantly larger (p < 0.0001) SPT wheals to cat hair than non-allergic controls. Twenty-five participants attended the first Session (mean Fel d 1 = 35.7 ng/m3), and 21 participants attended the second Session (mean Fel d 1 = 102.3 ng/m3). No significant differences in symptom and safety scores were observed between Sessions, hence participants' data were pooled. Allergic participants experienced significantly elevated (p < 0.05) Total Nasal Symptom Scores and Total Rhinoconjunctivitis Symptom Scores from 15 min to 24-h post-onset of allergen exposure and significantly decreased (p < 0.05) percent change in Peak Nasal Inspiratory Flow from 1 to 3 hours, compared to non-allergic controls. Mean Quality of Life scores were different between phenotypes, unimpacted by whether or not one lived with a cat. The SPaC-EEU can safely produce clinically relevant nasal symptoms in only cat-allergic participants, highlighting its use for modelling cat allergen-induced allergic rhinitis.",

Case presentation We present a case of DRESS syndrome in a 73-year-old woman with high-grade serous ovarian cancer treated with niraparib.

Despite discontinuation of niraparib and treatment with corticosteroids, she exhibited pruritus, facial edema, lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia, and impaired liver and renal function. A RegiSCAR score of 6 confirmed the diagnosis of DRESS. Patch testing to niraparib 1% in DMSO was positive when performed nine weeks after DRESS resolution. Conclusions This is the first reported case of DRESS by hypersensitivity due to niraparib. This case highlights the importance of recognizing DRESS as a potential adverse reaction to niraparib and the efficacy of early corticosteroid intervention. Further research is needed to understand and mitigate the risk.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Although there is much circumstantial evidence implicating eosinophils as major orchestrators in the pathophysiology of asthma, recent studies have cast doubt on their importance. Not only does anti-interleukin-5 treatment not alter the course of the disease, but some patients with asthma do not have eosinophils in their airways, whereas patients with eosinophilic bronchitis exhibit a florid tissue eosinophilia but do not have asthma. In contrast, mast cells are found in all airways and localize specifically to key tissue structures such as the submucosal glands and airway smooth muscle within asthmatic bronchi, irrespective of disease severity or phenotype. Here they are activated and interact exclusively with these structural cells via adhesive pathways and through the release of soluble mediators acting across the distance of only a few microns. The location of mast cells within the airway smooth muscle bundles seems particularly important for the development and propagation of asthma, perhaps occurring in response to, and then serving to aggravate, an underlying abnormality in asthmatic airway smooth muscle function. Targeting this mast cell-airway smooth muscle interaction in asthma offers exciting prospects for the treatment of this common disease.",

We aimed to compare the prevalence of asthma, allergies and medical treatment in different groups of German top athletes to the general population.Prior to the 2008 Summer Olympic Games, 291 German candidates for participation (65%) completed a questionnaire on respiratory and allergic symptoms. Results were compared to those of a general population study in Germany (n = 2425, response 68%). Furthermore, associations between types of sports and the self-reported outcomes were calculated. All models were adjusted for age, sex, level of education and smoking.Athletes reported significantly more doctors' diagnosed asthma (17% vs. 7%), more current use of asthma medication (10% vs. 4%) and allergic rhinitis (25% vs. 17%) compared to the general population. After adjustment, top athletes only had an increased Odds Ratio for doctor's diagnosed asthma (OR: 1.6; 95% CI 1.1-2.5). Compared to the general population, athletes in endurance sports had an increased OR for doctor's diagnosed asthma (2.4; 1.5-3.8) and current use of asthma medication (1.8; 1.0-3.4). In this group, current wheeze was increased when use of asthma medication was taken into account (1.8; 1.1-2.8). For other groups of athletes, no significantly increased ORs were observed.Compared to the general population, an increased risk of asthma diagnosis and treatment was shown for athletes involved in endurance sports. This might be due to a better medical surveillance and treatment of these athletes.",

The patient further developed severe acute interstitial nephritis, eosinophilic pneumonitis, central nervous system (CNS) involvement and worsening hematological abnormalities despite immediate discontinuation of vancomycin and parenteral corticosteroids. High-dose corticosteroids for a prolonged period were necessary and tapering of steroids a challenge due to rebound-eosinophilia and skin involvement. Conclusion Patients with DRESS who are relatively resistant to corticosteroids with delayed onset of certain organ involvement should be treated with a more prolonged corticosteroid tapering schedule.

However, it is not known whether BAT gives similar results as SPT or FEIA for aeroallergens.In this study, we compared the results of SPT, BAT and FEIA for different aeroallergens.We performed BAT, SPT and FEIA in 41 atopic subjects (symptomatic and with positive SPT for at least 1 of 9 common aeroallergens) and 31 non-atopic subjects (asymptomatic and with negative SPT).Correlations between SPT and BAT, SPT and FEIA, and BAT and FEIA results were statistically significant but imperfect. Using SPT as the \"gold standard\", BAT and FEIA were similar in sensitivity. However, BAT had lower specificity than FEIA. False positive (BATposSPTneg) results were frequent in those atopic subjects who were allergic by SPT to a different allergen and rare in non-atopic subjects. The false positivity in atopic subjects was due in part to high levels of serum Total-IgE (T-IgE) levels in atopic individuals that lead to basophil activation upon staining with fluorochrome-labeled anti-IgE.As an alternative to SPT in persons allergic to aeroallergens, BAT in its present form is useful for distinguishing atopic from non-atopic persons. However, BAT in its present form is less specific than FEIA when determining the allergen which a patient is allergic to. This is due to IgE staining-induced activation of atopic person's basophils and/or nonspecific hyperreactivity of atopic person's basophils.",

The purpose of the study was to better understand the experiences of caregivers of children with a first allergic reaction to food, and to identify any deficiencies in the information received at diagnosis. A mixed-methods study consisting of an online survey administered to the Anaphylaxis Canada online registry (a patient support group database of approximately 10,000 members), and a follow-up qualitative interview with a subset of survey participants. Analysis consisted of frequency analysis (quantitative and qualitative data) and descriptive statistics to calculate proportions and means with standard deviations. Qualitative analyses were guided by the constant comparative method of grounded theory methodology. Of 293 survey respondents, 208 were eligible to complete the survey (first allergic reaction to food within 12 months of the study), and 184 respondents consented. Identified gaps included education about food allergy, anaphylaxis management, for example, how to use epinephrine auto- injectors, and coping strategies for fear and anxiety. The qualitative follow-up study supported these findings, yielding 3 major themes: 1) lack of provision of information following the episode on the recognition and management of food allergy related allergic reactions, 2) prolonged wait times for an allergist, and 3) significant family anxiety. The online survey highlighted multiple deficiencies at diagnosis, findings which were supported by the follow up qualitative study. Results will inform the development of educational strategies for patients newly diagnosed with food allergy.",

The objective of this double-blind, four-way crossover study was to evaluate the onset of action of azelastine nasal spray, versus the oral antihistamines loratadine 10 mg and cetirizine 10 mg in the relief of the symptoms of SAR. 70 participants, aged 18-65, were randomized to receive azelastine nasal spray, cetirizine, loratadine, or placebo after controlled ragweed pollen exposure in the EEU. Symptoms were evaluated using the total nasal symptom score (TNSS). The primary efficacy parameter was the onset of action as measured by the change from baseline in TNSS. Azelastine displayed a statistically significant improvement in TNSS compared with placebo at all time points from 15 minutes through 6 hours post dose. Azelastine, cetirizine, and loratadine reduced TNSS compared to placebo with an onset of action of 15 (p < 0.001), 60 (p = 0.015), and 75 (p = 0.034) minutes, respectively. The overall assessment of efficacy was rated as good or very good by 46% of the participants for azelastine, 51% of the participants for cetirizine, and 30% of the participants for loratadine compared to 18% of the participants for placebo. Azelastine's onset of action for symptom relief was faster than that of cetirizine and loratadine. The overall participant satisfaction in treatment with azelastine is comparable to cetirizine and statistically superior to loratadine. These results suggest that azelastine may be preferential to oral antihistamines for the rapid relief of SAR symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Many types of shellfish including oysters are sometime cooked before ingestion and it has been demonstrated that cooking may affect the allergenicity of food. Therefore, the aim of our present study is to identify major and minor allergens of tropical oyster (Crassostrea belcheri) and to investigate the effect of different cooking processing on the allergenicity of this oyster.Raw, boiled, fried and roasted extracts of oyster were prepared. Protein profiles were analysed using sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Major and minor allergens and allergenicity patterns of all extracts were then determined by immunoblotting with sera from patients with positive skin prick tests (SPT) to the raw oyster extract. Mass-spectrometry was used to identify the major allergenic proteins of this oyster.SDS-PAGE of the raw extract showed 15 protein bands (20-180 kDa). In contrast, smaller numbers of protein bands were demonstrated in the boiled extract, those ranging between 40-42 and 55-150 kDa were denatured, whereas the protein profiles were altered to a similar degree by frying or roasting. The 37 kDa proteins had the highest frequency of IgE-binding (95 %), thus identified as the major allergen of this tropical oyster. Other minor IgE-binding proteins were observed at various molecular weights. Immunoblot of raw extract yielded 11 IgE-binding proteins. The cooked extracts showed only a single IgE-binding protein at 37 kDa. Mass spectrometry analysis of the 37 kDa major allergen identified this spot as tropomyosin.Cooked extracts produce lower IgE-binding than raw extract, which suggest that thermal treatment can be used as a tool in attempting to reduce oyster allergenicity by reducing the number of IgE-reactive bands. The degree of allergenicity of this oyster was demonstrated in the order raw > boiled > fried ≈ roasted. A heat-resistent 37 kDa protein, corresponding to tropomyosin, was identified as the major allergen of this tropical oyster.",

    "abstract": "A previous study has shown that the aggravation of Asian sand dust (ASD) on ovalbumin (OVA)-induced lung eosinphilia was more severe in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-rich ASD than in SiO2-rich ASD. Therefore, the effects of different LPS contamination levels in ASD on the aggravation of OVA-induced lung eosinophilia were investigated in the present study. Before beginning the in vivo experiment, we investigated whether the ultra-pure LPS would act only on TLR4 or not using bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) of wild–type, TLR2-/-, TLR4-/- and MyD88-/- BALB/c mice. ASD collected from the desert was heated to remove toxic organic substances (H-ASD). BALB/c mice were instilled intratracheally with 12 different testing samples prepared with LPS (1 ng and 10 ng), H-ASD, and OVA in a normal saline solution. The lung pathology, cytological profiles in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), the levels of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in BALF and OVA-specific immunoglobulin in serum were investigated. The LPS exhibited no response to the production of TNF-α and IL-6 in BMDMs from TLR4-/-, but did from TLR2-/-. H-ASD aggravated the LPS-induced neutrophilic lung inflammation. In the presence of OVA, LPS increased the level of eosinophils slightly and induced trace levels of Th2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-13 at the levels of 1 ng and 10 ng. In the presence of OVA and H-ASD, LPS induced severe eosinophil infiltration and proliferation of goblet cells in the airways as well as remarkable increases in Th2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-13 in BALF. The mixture containing LPS (1 ng) showed adjuvant activity on OVA-specific IgE and IgG1 production. The results suggest that H-ASD with naturally-occurring levels of LPS enhances OVA-induced lung eosinophilia via increases in Th2-mediated cytokines and antigen-specific immunoglobulin. These results indicate that LPS is a strong candidate for being a major aggravating substance in ASD.",

To investigate whether vitamin C administration influences common cold-induced asthma. Systematic review and statistical analysis of the identified trials. Medline, Scopus and Cochrane Central were searched for studies that give information on the effects of vitamin C on common cold-induced asthma. All clinically relevant outcomes related to asthma were included in this review. The estimates of vitamin C effect and their confidence intervals [CI] were calculated for the included studies. Three studies that were relevant for examining the role of vitamin C on common cold-induced asthma were identified. The three studies had a total of 79 participants. Two studies were randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials. A study in Nigeria on asthmatics whose asthma attacks were precipitated by respiratory infections found that 1 g/day vitamin C decreased the occurrence of asthma attacks by 78% (95% CI: 19% to 94%). A cross-over study in former East-Germany on patients who had infection-related asthma found that 5 g/day vitamin C decreased the proportion of participants who had bronchial hypersensitivity to histamine by 52 percentage points (95% CI: 25 to 71). The third study did not use a placebo. Administration of a single dose of 1 gram of vitamin C to Italian non-asthmatic common cold patients increased the provocative concentration of histamine (PC20) 3.2-fold (95% CI: 2.0 to 5.1), but the vitamin C effect was significantly less when the same participants did not suffer from the common cold. The three reviewed studies differed substantially in their methods, settings and outcomes. Each of them found benefits from the administration of vitamin C; either against asthma attacks or against bronchial hypersensitivity, the latter of which is a characteristic of asthma. Given the evidence suggesting that vitamin C alleviates common cold symptoms and the findings of this systematic review, it may be reasonable for asthmatic patients to test vitamin C on an individual basis, if they have exacerbations of asthma caused by respiratory infections. More research on the role of vitamin C on common cold-induced asthma is needed.",

Using a high pressure EAI (HPEAI), Epipen Jr® and Auvi-Q®/Allerject® 0.15 mg, 11/102 (11 %) children in group 1 and 38/102 (38 %) using another HPEAI, Jext®, had a STMDmax that showed a risk of intraosseous injection. There was a 1 % risk of subcutaneous injection with these devices. There was no risk of intraosseous injection using a low pressure EAI (LPEAI), Emerade®. In group 2, the risk of intraosseous injection using a HPEAI was 3 % and no risk using a LPEAI. However, the risk of subcutaneous injection using HPEAI was 9 % and using LPEAI was 2 %. There is a risk of intraosseous injection using HPEAI (Epipen®/Epipen Jr®, Auvi-Q®/Allerject® and especially Jext®) in children at risk of anaphylaxis. There was also a risk of subcutaneous injection using the currently available HPEAI in children and adolescents.",

    "abstract": "Over the years it has been widely stated that approximately one-third of asthmatic women experience worsening of the disease during pregnancy. However, the literature has not been reviewed systematically and the meta-analytic reviews include old studies. This study aimed to examine whether the prevalence of worsening asthma during pregnancy is still consistent with prior estimate or it has been reduced.A detailed Clinical Questionnaire on respiratory symptoms, medical history, medication, use of services, occupation, social status, home environment and lifestyle was administered to random samples of the Italian population in the frame of the Gene Environment Interactions in Respiratory Diseases (GEIRD) study. Only clinical data belong to 2.606 subjects that completed the clinical stage of the GEIRD study, were used for the present study.Out of 1.351 women, 284 self-reported asthma and 92 of them had at least one pregnancy. When we considered the asthma course during pregnancy, we found that 16 women worsened, 31 remained unchanged, 25 improved. Seven women had not the same course in the different pregnancies and 13 did not know. The starting age of ICS use almost overlaps with that of asthma onset in women with worsening asthma during pregnancy (19 years ± 1.4), unlike the other women who started to use ICS much later (30.3 years ± 12). In addition, the worsening of asthma was more frequent in women with an older age of onset of asthma (18 years ± 9 vs 13 years ± 10). Among women who completed the ACT during the clinical interview, the 50% of women who experienced worsening asthma during pregnancy (6/12) had an ACT score below 20.Asthma was observed to worsen during pregnancy in a percentage much lower to that generally reported in all the previous studies. There is still room in clinical practice to further reduce worsening of asthma during pregnancy by improving asthma control, with a more structured approach to asthma education and management prepregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Thiazolidinediones are oral diabetes medications that selectively activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and have potent anti-inflammatory properties. While a few studies have found improvements in pulmonary function with exposure to thiazolidinediones, there are no studies of their impact on asthma exacerbations. Our objective was to assess whether exposure to thiazolidinediones was associated with a decreased risk of asthma exacerbation. We performed a cohort study of diabetic Veterans who had a diagnosis of asthma and were taking oral diabetes medications during the period of 10/1/2005 – 9/30/2006. The risk of asthma exacerbations and oral steroid use during 10/1/2006 – 9/30/2007 was compared between patients who were prescribed thiazolidinediones and patients who were on alternative oral diabetes medications. Multivariable logistic regression and negative binomial regression analyses were used to characterize this risk. A sensitivity analysis was performed, restricting our evaluation to patients who were adherent to diabetes therapy. We identified 2,178 patients who were on thiazolidinediones and 10,700 who were not. Exposure to thiazolidinediones was associated with significant reductions in the risk of asthma exacerbation (OR = 0.79, 95% CI, 0.62 – 0.99) and oral steroid prescription (OR = 0.73, 95% CI 0.63 – 0.84). Among patients who were adherent to diabetes medications, there were more substantial reductions in the risks for asthma exacerbation (OR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.47 – 0.85) and oral steroid prescription (OR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.57 – 0.81). Thiazolidinediones may provide a novel anti-inflammatory approach to asthma management by preventing exacerbations and decreasing the use of oral steroids.",

    "abstract": "Physical activity increases oxidative stress and therefore the antioxidant effects of vitamin C administration might become evident in people undertaking vigorous exercise. Vitamin C is involved in the metabolism of histamine, prostaglandins, and cysteinyl leukotrienes, all of which appear to be mediators in the pathogenesis of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). Three studies assessing the effect of vitamin C on patients with EIB were subjected to a meta-analysis and revealed that vitamin C reduced postexercise FEV1 decline by 48% (95% CI: 33% to 64%). The correlation between postexercise FEV1 decline and respiratory symptoms associated with exercise is poor, yet symptoms are the most relevant to patients. Five other studies examined subjects who were under short-term, heavy physical stress and revealed that vitamin C reduced the incidence of respiratory symptoms by 52% (95% CI: 36% to 65%). Another trial reported that vitamin C halved the duration of the respiratory symptoms in male adolescent competitive swimmers. Although FEV1 is the standard outcome for assessing EIB, other outcomes may provide additional information. In particular, the mean postexercise decline of FEF50 is twice the decline of FEV1. Schachter and Schlesinger (1982) reported the effect of vitamin C on exercise-induced FEF60 levels in 12 patients suffering from EIB and their data are analyzed in this paper. The postexercise FEF60 decline was greater than 60% for five participants and such a dramatic decline indicates that the absolute postexercise FEF60 level becomes an important outcome in its own right. Vitamin C increased postexercise FEF60 levels by 50% to 150% in those five participants, but had no significant effect in the other seven participants. Thus, future research on the effects of vitamin C on EIB should not be restricted to measuring only FEV1. Vitamin C is inexpensive and safe, and further study on those people who have EIB or respiratory symptoms associated with exercise is warranted.",

Health Canada released a Canadian food allergen labeling regulation (2008) and subsequent update (2012) suggesting that research is needed to guide further iterations of the regulation to improve food allergen labeling and reduce risk of exposure. The primary objective of this study was to examine consumer preferences in food labeling for allergy avoidance and anaphylaxis prevention. A secondary objective was to identify whether different subgroups within the consumer population emerged. A discrete choice experiment using a fractional factorial design divided into ten different versions with 18 choice-sets per version was developed to examine consumer preferences for different attributes of food labeling. Three distinct subgroups of Canadian consumers with different allergen considerations and food allergen labeling needs were identified. Overall, preferences for standardized precautionary and safety symbols at little or no increased cost emerged. While three distinct groups with different preferences were identified, in general the results revealed that the current Canadian food allergen labeling regulation can be improved by enforcing the use of standardized precautionary and safety symbols and educating the public on the use of these symbols.",

    "abstract": "An allergy to mango is extremely rare. The antigenic composition of the fruit is not fully known. Profilin from mango has a structure similar to birch tree profiling: it is responsible for cross-reactions between mango and pear, apple, and peach. A panallergen with a structure similar to mugwort defensin (Art v 1) which cross-reacts with celery, carrot, peanuts, pepper, aniseed, and caraway has been previously described.A female patient, 30 years old, was admitted in February 2017 because of recurrent allergic reactions following consumption of various foods. The most severe allergic reaction in the patient's life occurred after eating a mango fruit. Within several minutes the patient developed a generalised urticaria, followed by facial oedema, strong stomach pain and watery diarrhoea. The diagnostics involved skin tests with a set of inhalatory and food allergens, including native skin tests. The patient also experienced symptoms of recurrent, generalized urticaria in connection with consumption of various types of food, especially complex dishes containing many different ingredients. Additionally, an interview revealed that the patient was experiencing symptoms of the oral allergy syndrome after ingesting various fruit and vegetables, especially during late summer and fall. Diagnostics was extended by determining the levels of IgE specific for allergen components, using the ImmunoCap ISAC method. In order to confirm the occurence of a cross-reaction between mugwort and mango allergens, we performed the inhibition test of IgE specific for mugwort using a mango allergen extract and ImmunoCap matrix.Skin prick tests (SPT) were positive for allergens of grass 7 mm; weeds 8 mm; cat's fur 5 mm; mugwort 6 mm. SPT were also positive for mango. The level of specific IgE was increased for allergens of mugwort, grass, celery, pepper, carrot, mango, banana, peach, and apple. The ImmunoCap ISAC test demonstrated a high level of specific IgE rPhl p 1 (timothy grass) and Art v 1 (mugwort). We also performed the IgE inhibition test using both mango extract and ImmunoCap matrix and confirmed a cross-reaction with Art v 1 in the pathogenesis of symptoms observed in the patient.An anaphylactic reaction to consumed mango, resulting from cross-allergy with mugwort Art v 1 was diagnosed in the patient. Acute urticarial in this case is a manifestation of IgE-mediated food allergy. During in vitro diagnostic procedures we found an elevated concentration of IgE specific to several food allergens (including celery, peppers, carrot, banana, peach, apple, shrimp). The elimination diet removing allergens the patient was allergic to was recommended. Considering the anaphylactic reaction the patient was instructed to carry a rescue set composed of an adrenaline autosyringe, steroids, and antihistamines.",

However, the significance of this impact is unclear-particularly in perennial allergy sufferers. This study investigates the impact of perennial allergy on sleep, daily activities and productivity.Adults with self-reported or physician-diagnosed perennial AR aged ≥ 18 years were recruited in Denmark, France, Germany and Sweden. Allergy sufferers were identified using online panels closely matching national population characteristics for each country. Impact on sleep, work, productivity and activity (by the Work, Productivity and Activity Index) were analysed. Descriptive analyses were conducted.In total, 511 subjects with perennial AR (47.4% also with seasonal allergy) completed the survey. Most subjects (77.5%) had a physician-diagnosis of AR; 46.4% were diagnosed with both AA and AR. Most subjects (65.2%) reported sensitisation to house dust mites. Of all subjects, 66.0% reported sleep problems. Subjects with sleep problems woke, on average, 3.8 times per night, with 92.0% taking 15+ min to fall asleep (22.2% took 60+ min). Upon waking at night, 40.8% struggled to get back to sleep, and 69.2% had difficulties waking in the morning due to tiredness. Disturbances in daily functioning due to sleep issues were reported in 85.5-95.0% of subjects with sleep problems across all aspects investigated. Overall work and activity impairment were 53.3% and 47.1%, respectively. Sleep issues were more frequent (78.1% vs 54.7%) in those diagnosed with both AR and AA compared to AR alone, and more burdensome, with a greater impact on daily functioning (47.0% vs 33.3%) and impairment in work and activity (62.0% and 54.9% vs 39.3% and 35.2%, respectively). Of all subjects, 20.5% were receiving AIT at the time of the survey; of these, 36.4% reported moderate or great improvement in sleep due to allergy treatment.In perennial AR sufferers, sleep problems are common and impact on daily functioning, with results indicating a greater burden in those with both AR and AA compared to AR alone.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Activated PI3K delta syndrome (APDS) belongs to the heterogeneous group of primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDs). Progress in next-generation sequencing (NGS) enabled identification of gain-of-function mutations in phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) genes. Depending on the type of causative mutation, APDS is classified into two types: APDS 1 and APDS 2. To date, less than 100 cases of APDS have been reported. Clinical symptoms of APDS result from impaired immune regulation and are clinically manifested by recurrent infections, allergies, lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity. They show similarity to other PIDs. Therefore, many patients were diagnosed incorrectly. The availability of genetic testing has allowed establishing the correct diagnosis in increasing number of patients suffering from APDS. Case presentations The first male patient presented in infancy with recurrent infections. Subsequently he was found to suffer from hepatosplenomegaly, early portal hypertension, massive lymphoproliferation and hypogammaglobulinemia. The common E1021K mutation in the PI3KCD gene was identified. The patient underwent successful hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with resolution of most symptoms. The second patient suffered from persistent growth retardation since early life, facial dysmorphism and recurrent respiratory infections from early childhood. He was found to have systemic lympho-proliferation, panhypoglobulinemia and impaired antibody responses to vaccines. The introduction of NGS in Poland enabled rapid identification of a mutation in the PI3KR1 gene. Growth hormone administration seemed to have worsened the lymphoproliferation. Conclusions Patients with suspected common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and additional symptoms, such as allergy, facial dysmorphia, short stature, enhanced lymphoproliferation and lack of adequate response to human immunoglobulin replacement therapy, should be considered for NGS-based genetic testing. It may substantially shorten the time needed to establish the correct diagnosis, direct appropriate treatment and avoid potentially harmful therapies. To date, few cases of APDS have been described. It is important to report each of them to establish clinical indices and laboratory biomarkers of APDS 1 and APDS 2, to develop the standards of care in these conditions.",

Recentely, links to diseases other than allergic disease have also been actively studied. Among them, the results of studies regarding AD comorbidities, especially cardiovascular disease (CVD), have varied from country to country. Objective To analyze whether the risk of CVD is different between AD patients and healthy controls using Korean National Health Insurance Data. Methods We obtained data from 2005 to 2016 from the Korean National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients with one AD code and two AD-related tests codes were selected as AD patients, and age-and sex-matched controls to the AD patients were selected from among those without AD (1:5). Each group was investigated for accompanying metabolic syndrome (which contains hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia) and CVD (angina, myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, and stroke) using ICD 10 codes. Results The incidence of metabolic diseases and CVD were significantly different between the AD and control groups. Using multivariable Cox regression, differences were adjusted for sex, age, and other CVD and metabolic diseases. As a result, not only metabolic disease, but also the CVD risk of AD patients was significantly higher than that of the control group. Patients with AD had as significantly higher risk of hyperlipidemia (hazard ratio [HR] = 33.02, p &lt; 0.001), hypertension (HR = 4.86, p &lt; 0.001), and type 2 diabetes (HR = 2.96, p &lt; 0.001). AD patients also had a higher risk of stroke (HR = 10.61, p &lt; 0.001), myocardial infarction (HR = 9.43, p &lt; 0.001), angina (HR = 5.99, p &lt; 0.001), and peripheral vascular disease (HR = 2.46, p &lt; 0.001). Besides hyperlipidemia, there was no difference in risk according to AD severity. Conclusion Patients with AD have a greater risk of CVD than those without AD.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Mepolizumab and benralizumab are biologics approved for severe eosinophilic asthma. Mepolizumab is an anti-interlukin-5 (IL-5) antibody while benralizumab is an anti-interleukin-5 receptor alpha (IL-5Rα) antibody targeting the IL-5 receptor on eosinophils. Both therapies reduce oral corticosteroid requirements and asthma exacerbations. However, no head-to-head studies have been published. The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy of peripheral eosinophil reduction of mepolizumab and benralizumab. Methods A retrospective chart review was conducted on patients with severe eosinophilic asthma who were approved for either IL-5 agent. Patients with noted non-adherence or those who were on fluctuating doses of corticosteroids for non-asthma related illnesses were excluded. The last detectable eosinophil count for each patient prior to start of therapy was compared to the highest eosinophil count noted after therapy start with at least 30 days of adherence. Results Thirty-six patients taking mepolizumab and 19 patients taking benralizumab met the inclusion criteria and had both pre-treatment and post-treatment eosinophil counts. Baseline characteristics were not statistically different between those on mepolizumab and benralizumab therapy. The mean pre-therapy serum eosinophil count did not statistically differ between patients on mepolizumab (597.2 cells/µL) compared to benralizumab (521.6 cells/µL), p = 0.3769. While both therapies resulted in a significant decrease in eosinophil count ( p &lt; 0.0001); the mean decrease did not statistically differ between patients taking mepolizumab compared to those on benralizumab, p = 0.9079. Nonetheless, 100% of patients receiving benralizumab had undetectable eosinophil counts post-therapy compared to 31% of patients receiving mepolizumab ( p &lt; 0.0001). Conclusion Both mepolizumab and benralizumab are potent targets of the IL-5 pathway with the ability to significantly reduce peripheral eosinophil counts. While there is there is no statistical difference in the magnitude of eosinophil reduction offered by each agent, benralizumab is able to decrease peripheral eosinophil counts to 0 cells/µL in more patients than mepolizumab.",

LTRAs were inferior to SAHs in terms of the daytime nasal symptoms score (mean difference [MD]: 0.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.02 to 0.08, p = 0.003, I 2 = 89%) and daytime eye symptoms score (MD: 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.08, p = 0.009, I 2 = 89%), but were superior in terms of the nighttime symptoms score (MD: − 0.04, 95% CI − 0.06 to − 0.02, p &lt; 0.001, I 2 = 85%). The effects of the two treatments on the composite symptom score (MD: 0.02, 95% CI − 0.02 to 0.05, p = 0.30, I 2 = 91%) and rhinoconjunctivitis quality-of-life questionnaire (RQLQ) (MD: 0.01, 95% CI − 0.05 to 0.07, p = 0.71, I 2 = 99%) were similar. Incidences of adverse events were comparable (odds ratio [OR]: 0.97, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.25, p = 0.98, I 2 = 0%). These results were mainly obtained from studies on seasonal AR. No significant publication bias was detected. Conclusions Although both treatments are safe and effective in improving the quality of life (QoL) in AR patients, LTRAs are more effective in improving nighttime symptoms but less effective in improving daytime nasal symptoms compared to SAHs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The relation between depression and mortality in patients with asthma is not well known. This study aimed to assess the impact of depression on mortality in asthmatic patients in US adults. Methods This observational study used data from the 2005 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). We used survey-weight adjusted Cox proportional hazard models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between depression and all-cause mortality. Results A total of 1865 participants with asthma were included in this study. Among them, 264 (14.16%) had depressive symptoms. During 9970 person-years of follow-up, there were 24 (9.1%) deaths in 264 patients with depression compared with 100 (6.3%) deaths in 1601 patients without depression. For unadjusted analyses, depression was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 2.22 [95% CI 1.32–3.73]). This association was persistent after adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and body mass index (HR, 2.71 [95% CI 1.58–4.66]). However, we did not observe a significant association between depression and mortality after controlling for extensive co-morbidities (HR, 1.92 [95% CI 0.82–4.45]). Subgroup analyses further revealed that depression was an independent risk factor for mortality only in the females (HR, 3.78 [95% CI 1.17, 12.26]) but not all asthmatic patients. Conclusions The present study suggested that depressive disorder was common in asthmatic patients and depression in asthmatic patients was associated with a higher mortality rate. Depression was an independent risk factor for mortality in female patients.",

    "abstract": "Allergic rhinitis (AR) is an upper respiratory tract inflammation disease caused by IgE-mediated reactions against inhaled allergens. The incidence of AR is significantly increasing throughout the world. Hence, more specific, and sensitive gene biomarkers and understanding the underlying pathways are necessary to further explore the AR pathogenesis. To identify gene biomarkers in nasal mucosa and in blood from AR patients which could be used in AR diagnosis. The gene expression profiles of GSE43523 from nasal epithelial cells and GSE75011 from Th2-enriched CD4+ T cells in blood were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis were conducted to investigate the functional changes of genes. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the diagnostic values of the hub genes. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed to validate the hub genes. Significant differentially enriched gene signatures in AR patients were identified in nasal epithelial cells (n-DEGs) and in blood (t-DEGs). Signatures associated with axoneme, extracellular matrix, collagen fibril organization, cell motility, calcium ion binding, and so on were more enriched in n-DEGs, whereas signatures associated with TNF signaling pathway, detoxification of inorganic compound, and cellular response to corticotropin-releasing hormone stimulus were enriched in t-DEGs. In addition, we identified 8 hub genes and 14 hub genes from n-DEGs and t-DEGs, respectively. The combination of POSTN in nasal mucosa and PENK and CDC25A in blood was constructed with a good AR predicting performance. The area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC curve of 3 hub genes' combination was 0.98 for AR diagnosis. This study utilized gene expression profiles and RT-qPCR validation on nasal mucosa and blood from AR patients to investigate the potential biomarkers for AR diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Patients with primary immunodeficiency (PID) are at increased risk for infections such as SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), due to the nature of their diseases and being immunocompromised. At this time, four vaccines against COVID-19 (Pfizer-BioNtech's Comirnaty®, Moderna's Spikevax®, AstraZeneca's Vaxzevria®, Johnson & Johnson's Janssen®) have been approved for use by Health Canada. Due to the novelty of these vaccines, clinical studies in patients with PID are ongoing. Despite limited evidence, Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommend that patients with PID without any contraindications should be vaccinated with any of the approved vaccines as the potential benefits of being immunized against the virus likely outweigh the risks of contracting a severe infection. The aim of this study was to understand the perceptions regarding COVID-19 vaccination among patients with PID and to identify specific factors related to vaccine hesitancy.The Canadian Immunodeficiencies Patient Organization (CIPO) conducted an online survey of its members to evaluate uptake of the COVID-19 vaccines by patients with PID. Data was collected using a self-administered online questionnaire. The survey was conducted between March and April 2021.At the time of survey, among 370 respondents who had not received the COVID-19 vaccine, 302 respondents (81.6%) indicated they were very or somewhat likely to get vaccinated against COVID-19; and 68 respondents (18.4%) indicated they were somewhat or very unlikely, undecided, or not planning to get vaccinated. A large majority of respondents indicated they had a diagnosis of PID (67.8%) and/or specified their type of PID (27.7%). The most common reason for vaccine hesitancy was primarily due to uncertainty about immune response given an underlying immunodeficiency. Other concerns included unknown long-term side effects of COVID-19 vaccination, pre-existing history of allergic reactions, limited amount of data, lack of investigation of safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in those with medical conditions, and skepticism of the underlying science and/or the medical system.The results point to the importance of ongoing patient outreach, education, and up-to-date information on the rapidly evolving scientific knowledge and evidence on COVID-19 relevant to the PID community, from clinical trials to real-world evidence and observational studies.",

    "abstract": "The effects of nicotine and cigarette smoke in many diseases, notably COVID-19 infection, are being debated more frequently. The current basic data for COVID-19 is increasing and indicating the higher risk of COVID-19 infections in smokers due to the overexpression of corresponding host receptors to viral entry. However, current multi-national epidemiological reports indicate a lower incidence of COVID-19 disease in smokers. Current data indicates that smokers are more susceptible to some diseases and more protective of some other. Interestingly, nicotine is also reported to play a dual role, being both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory. In the present study, we tried to investigate the effect of pure nicotine on various cells involved in COVID-19 infection. We followed an organ-based systematic approach to decipher the effect of nicotine in damaged organs corresponding to COVID-19 pathogenesis (12 related diseases). Considering that the effects of nicotine and cigarette smoke are different from each other, it is necessary to be careful in generalizing the effects of nicotine and cigarette to each other in the conducted researches. The generalization and the undifferentiation of nicotine from smoke is a significant bias. Moreover, different doses of nicotine stimulate different effects (dose-dependent response). In addition to further assessing the role of nicotine in COVID-19 infection and any other cases, a clever assessment of underlying diseases should also be considered to achieve a guideline for health providers and a personalized approach to treatment.",

However, the effects of prenatal environmental exposures on adult offspring have not been well-studied. We hypothesized that combined prenatal exposure to Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) allergen and diesel exhaust particles will be associated with altered IgE production, airway inflammation, airway hyperreactivity (AHR), and airway remodeling of adult offspring.Following sensitization via the airway route to A. fumigatus and mating, pregnant BALB/c mice were exposed to additional A. fumigatus and/or diesel exhaust particles. At age 9-10 weeks, their offspring were sensitized and challenged with A. fumigatus.We found that adult offspring from mice that were exposed to A. fumigatus or diesel exhaust particles during pregnancy experienced decreases in IgE production. Adult offspring of mice that were exposed to both A. fumigatus and diesel exhaust particles during pregnancy experienced decreases in airway eosinophilia.These results suggest that, in this model, allergen and/or diesel administration during pregnancy may be associated with protection from developing systemic and airway allergic immune responses in the adult offspring.",

In 2005-2006, 560 households of children born in 1995 in the province of Manitoba, Canada, were surveyed. The index children (8-to 10-year-olds) were assessed by a pediatric allergist and had skin-prick testing and/or capRAST for peanut allergy. Surveys were completed by parents for siblings to determine the presence of peanut allergy. Of 560 surveys, 514 (92%) were completed. Twenty-nine (5.6%) index children were peanut allergic. Fifteen of 900 (1.7%) siblings had peanut allergy. Four of 47 (8.5%) were siblings of peanut-allergic children and 11 of 853 (1.3%) were siblings of non-peanut-allergic children. The risk of peanut allergy was markedly increased in siblings of a peanut-allergic child (odds ratio 6.72, 95% confidence interval 2.04-22.12). Siblings of peanut-allergic children are much more likely to be allergic to peanut. An allergy assessment by a qualified allergist should be routinely recommended before feeding peanut to these children.",

    "abstract": ": The use of chitosan nanoparticles as carriers for expression plasmids represents a major improvement in gene expression technology. We demonstrated previously that treatment with chitosan interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) nanoparticles (chitosan interferon-gamma nanogene [CIN]) led to in situ production of IFN-gamma and a reduction in inflammation and airway reactivity in mice, but the mechanism underlying the immunomodulatory effects of CIN remains unclear. In this report, the effect of CIN treatment on the immune responses of CD8+ T cells and dendritic cells was examined in a BALB/c mouse model of ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic asthma. OT1 mice (OVA-T cell receptor [TCR] transgenic) were also used to test the effects of CIN on OVA-specific CD8+ T cells. CIN treatment caused a reduction in IFN-gamma production in a subpopulation of OVA-specific CD8+ T cells cultured in vitro in the presence of OVA. CIN also reduced apoptosis of the CD8+ T cells. Examination of dendritic cells from lung and lymph nodes indicated that CIN treatment decreased their antigen-presenting activity, as evident from the reduction in CD80 and CD86 expression. Furthermore, CIN treatment significantly decreased the number of CD11c+b+ dendritic cells in lymph nodes, suggesting that endogenous IFN-gamma expression may immunomodulate dendritic cell migration and activation. CIN therapy results in a reduction in proinflammatory CD8+ T cells and decreases the number and antigen-presenting activity of dendritic cells.",

Systemic immune indicators like eotaxin and fibroblast growth factor were evaluated for possible synergistic pathological effects. Moreover, blood cells, local tissue, and plasma from EoE and control subjects were studied to determine if the localized disease was associated with a systemic effect that correlated with presence of EoE disease.Real-time polymerase chain reaction from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), immunohistochemistry from local esophageal biopsies, fluid assays on plasma, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting on peripheral blood cells from subjects were used to study the systemic immune indicators in newly diagnosed EoE (n = 35), treated EoE (n = 9), Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (n = 8), ulcerative colitis (n = 5), Crohn's disease (n = 5), and healthy controls (n = 8).Of the transcripts tested for possible immune indicators, we found extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Bcl-2, bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor), and eotaxin levels were highly upregulated in PBMC and associated with disease presence of EoE. Increased FGF detected by immunohistochemistry in esophageal tissues and in PBMC was correlated with low levels of pro-apoptotic factors (Fas, Caspase 8) in PBMC from EoE subjects. Plasma-derived bFGF was shown to be the most elevated and most specific in EoE subjects in comparison to healthy controls and disease control subjects.We describe for the first time a possible mechanism by which increased FGF is associated with inhibiting apoptosis in local esophageal tissues of EoE subjects as compared to controls. Eotaxin and FGF signaling pathways share activation through the ERK pathway; together, they could act to increase eosinophil activation and prolong the half-life of eosinophils in local tissues of the esophagus in EoE subjects.",

    "abstract": "Anaphylaxis is an acute, potentially fatal systemic reaction with varied mechanisms and clinical presentations. Although prompt recognition and treatment of anaphylaxis are imperative, both patients and healthcare professionals often fail to recognize and diagnose early signs and symptoms of the condition. Clinical manifestations vary widely, however, the most common signs are cutaneous symptoms, including angioedema, urticaria, erythema and pruritus. Immediate intramuscular administration of epinephrine into the lateral thigh is first-line therapy, even if the diagnosis is uncertain. The mainstays of long-term management include specialist assessment, avoidance measures, and the provision of an epinephrine auto-injector and an individualized anaphylaxis action plan. This article provides an overview of the causes, clinical features, diagnosis and acute and long-term management of this serious allergic reaction.",

    "abstract": "The role of breast milk on the risk of childhood asthma is in dispute. The aim of this prospective study is to determine the relationship of immune markers in maternal serum during gestation and breast milk to asthma-like symptoms (AS) in infancy.Pregnant women were recruited in Columbia and Charleston, South Carolina. Blood (median: three weeks before delivery) and breast milk (three weeks after delivery) samples were collected. Concentrations of interferon (IFN)-γ, IFN gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10 or CXCL10), CCL11, interleukin (IL) 1β, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, CXCL8, IL-10, IL-12(p70), IL-13, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and immunoglobulin (Ig) A in both maternal serum and milk whey were determined via immunoassays. Asthma-like symptoms (AS) of the infant were ascertained at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Generalized estimating equations assessed relative risks (RRs) of immune markers for repeated measurements of AS, considering intra-individual correlations and adjusting for confounders. To provide comparable risk estimates, quartiles of the immune markers were used, except for IL-5 in whey and IgA in serum, which were dichotomized.Of 178 women, 161 provided blood and 115 breast milk samples. IL-12(p70), IL-4, IL-10, IL-1β, and CCL11 in serum and in whey were not further considered for the statistical analyses since the proportion of non-detectable values was high. Most immune markers in serum and milk whey were moderately or highly correlated; however, IgA was negatively correlated. Infants in the highest quartile of IL-13 in both serum and whey were at a higher risk of AS (RR = 3.02 and 4.18; respectively) compared to infants in the first quartile. High levels of IL-5 in serum and whey was also identified as a risk. In addition, increased secretory IgA and TGF-β1 in breast milk reduced the risks of AS.Maternal serum and whey levels of IL-5 and IL-13 are risk markers for AS; whey IgA and TGF-β1 seem to be protective. Only focusing on breast milk portend that milk cytokines IL-5 and IL-13 have adverse effects. However, similar immune exposures during late gestation and via milk suggest that both may enhance AS among infants.",

    "abstract": "Several different criteria for the positivity of the flow-assisted Basophil Activation Test (BAT) for the diagnosis of Neuromuscular Blocking Agents (NMBA) hypersensitivity reactions have been used in past studies. Our aims were to determine the threshold for BAT positivity expressed as the stimulation index (SI, calculated as the percentage of activated basophils after stimulation with NMBA divided by the number of basophils with no NMBA stimulation) and as the percentage of activated basophils, and to determine the sensitivity and specificity of BAT for NMBAs. 22 consenting adult patients with previous intraanaesthetic NMBAs-related hypersensitivity reactions were tested for the culprit drug. 34 controls who tolerated NMBAs were similarly tested. BAT was performed using Flow2Cast technique and the up-regulation of the CD63 marker on the basophils was measured using Cell Quest programme (FACSCalibur Becton Dickinson, USA). Receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC) analysis was performed. ROC curve analysis for BAT results versus history yields a stimulation index of 1.76 as the optimal threshold, with an AUC of 0.81 (CI 95% 0.69-0.93, p < 0.01) and a percentage of activated basophils > 5.01%, with an AUC of 0.84 (CI 95% 0.72-0.95, p < 0.01). Considering both thresholds (the SI ≥ 1.76 together with the percentage of activated basophils > 5%) as diagnostic criteria, 15 patients had positive BAT, the overall BAT sensitivity being 68.18% (CI 95% 45.11-82.26%). None of the controls fulfilled both criteria and the specificity of the test was 100% (CI 95% 87.35-100%). With a stimulation index ≥ 1.76 and a percentage of activated basophils > 5.01% as threshold, the performance of BAT for NMBAs yields 68.18% sensitivity and 100% specificity.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is the most common respiratory disorder in Canada. Despite significant improvement in the diagnosis and management of this disorder, the majority of Canadians with asthma remain poorly controlled. In most patients, however, control can be achieved through the use of avoidance measures and appropriate pharmacological interventions. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) represent the standard of care for the majority of patients. Combination ICS/long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) inhalers are preferred for most adults who fail to achieve control with ICS therapy. Allergen-specific immunotherapy represents a potentially disease-modifying therapy for many patients with asthma, but should only be prescribed by physicians with appropriate training in allergy. Regular monitoring of asthma control, adherence to therapy and inhaler technique are also essential components of asthma management. This article provides a review of current literature and guidelines for the appropriate diagnosis and management of asthma.",

    "abstract": "Rush oral immunotherapy (OIT) combined with omalizumab (OMB) has been reported to be an effective and safe treatment for severe milk allergies. However, no report has described long-term follow-up observations after OMB discontinuation. The purpose of this case report was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rush OIT in combination with OMB during a long period of treatment.A 5-year-old boy presented with a past history of two severe episodes of anaphylaxis (at the age of 2 and 3 years) after consuming small amounts of cow's milk (CM). Before the OIT, the total immunoglobulin E (IgE) level was 654 IU/mL, and specific-IgE (sIgE) levels for CM, casein, and β-lactoglobulin were 77.0 kUA/L, 86.2 kUA/L and 12.0 kUA/L, respectively. The skin prick test (SPT) for CM showed a wheal (diameter, 20 mm) and erythema (diameter, 50 mm). In the open food challenge, he reacted to a 0.2 mL ingestion of CM and presented with dyspnea and laryngospasms, and he was then administrated 150 mg OMB every 2 weeks for 8 weeks. In the 9th week, he was admitted to hospital for the rush phase of the OIT. Once he was able ingest a dose of 200 mL CM without having an adverse reaction, he was discharged and allowed to continue a daily dose of 200 mL CM at home. During this phase, the sIgE levels were elevated, but the end-point titration values from the SPT gradually decreased, and the SPT was negative after 1 year of OMB treatment. Five months after discontinuation of OMB, the daily CM ingestion was ceased for a 2-week period, followed by an oral food challenge (OFC) that was negative. The patient experienced only five mild adverse events during the course of rush OIT, even after the discontinuation of OMB and his quality of life improved dramatically afterwards.The combination therapy of rush OIT and OMB successfully maintained desensitization to CM in a boy with severe allergies. We propose that a negative SPT may be useful to guide discontinuation of OMB in such patients.",

A nurse shortage in Canada provides an important context to estimate the net economic benefit, the number of patients needed to switch to SCIg to recoup one full-time equivalent (FTE), and potential population-wide savings of reduced nurse time to a payer.The net economic benefit was estimated by multiplying the hourly compensation for nurses in Canada by the hours required for each administration route. The number needed to switch to SCIg to gain one nurse FTE was estimated by dividing the work hours in a year by the average annual savings in nursing time in a PID population in Canada. The prevalence of treated PID/SID in Canada was calculated using provincial IgG audit data to extrapolate the potential population-wide savings of switching patients to SCIg therapy.The net economic gain from switching one patient to home-based SCIg care would be C$2,603 (Canadian Dollars) in year 1 and C$2,948 each year thereafter. Switching 37 IVIg patients to SCIg would gain one nurse FTE. Switching 50% of the estimated 5,486 PID and SID patients in Canada receiving IVIg therapy to SCIg has the potential to save 223.3 nurse FTEs (C$23.2 million in labor costs).A shift from IVIg to less labor-intensive SCIg has the potential to help alleviate nurse shortages and reduce overall health care costs in Canada. Health care professionals might consider advocating for home-based SCIg therapy for PID/SID patients when clinically appropriate.",

Arming ourselves with appropriate and safe treatment modalities to provide relief for this chronic and relapsing inflammatory condition is of utmost importance to our patients and their families. Utilizing topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) for the treatment of AD not responsive to high-potency corticosteroids, or low-potency corticosteroids and localized to the face, eyelids, and skin folds of patients >2 years, is reasonable to include in common practice. Despite the FDA's Black Box warning, to date no evidence has been published linking the TCIs to an increased incidence of malignancy in either children or adults that establishes causation. The Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (CSACI) therefore recognizes that the benefits of TCIs should be carefully weighed with the theoretical risks in advising patients, and acknowledges that long-term studies remain in progress. The safety and efficacy of topical tacrolimus and pimecrolimus should therefore be considered when treating children and adults with AD in Canadian allergy and immunology practices.",

    "abstract": "Long pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a novel candidate marker for inflammation in many chronic diseases. As a soluble pattern recognition receptor, PTX3 is involved in amplification of inflammatory reactions and regulation of innate immunity. Previously, we demonstrate that human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMC) express constitutively PTX3 and upon TNF stimulation. However, very little is known about the mechanism governing its expression in HASMC. We sought to investigate the mechanism governing TNF induced PTX3 expression in primary HASMC. HASMC were stimulated with TNF in the presence of transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D (ActD) or MAPKs pharmacological inhibitors. PTX3 mRNA and protein expression were analyzed by Real-time RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively. PTX3 promoter activity was determined using luciferase assay. PTX3 mRNA and protein are expressed constitutively by HASMC and significantly up-regulated by TNF. TNF-induced PTX3 mRNA and protein release in HASMC were inhibited by transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D. TNF induced significantly PTX3 promoter activation in HASMC. MAPK JNK and ERK1/2 specific inhibitors (SP600125 and UO126), but not p38, significantly down regulates TNF induced PTX3 promoter activity and protein release in HASMC. Finally, TNF mediated PTX3 promoter activity in HASMC was abolished upon mutation of NF-κβ and AP1 binding sites. Our data suggest that TNF induced PTX3 in HASMC at least via a transcriptional mechanism that involved MAPK (JNK and ERK1/2), NF-κβ and AP1 pathways. These results rise the possibility that HASMC derived PTX3 may participate in immune regulation in the airways.",

We present findings on the efficacy and safety/tolerability of a CRTH2 antagonist (setipiprant) in participants with seasonal allergic rhinitis (AR) in a real-life setting over 2 weeks. Methods A Phase 2 trial and a Phase 3 trial were conducted at seven centers in Texas, USA during the Mountain Cedar pollen season. Both were prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-referenced (cetirizine) studies. The Phase 2 trial assessed setipiprant 100–1000 mg b.i.d. and 1000 mg o.d. versus placebo in adult and elderly participants. The Phase 3 trial assessed setipiprant 1000 mg b.i.d. in adolescent, adult, and elderly participants. Efficacy was assessed using daytime nasal symptom scores (DNSS), night-time nasal symptom scores (NNSS) and daytime eye symptom scores (DESS). Results 579 participants were randomized in the Phase 2 trial (mean age 41.6–43.4 years); 630 were randomized in the Phase 3 trial (mean age 37.5–40.7 years). A statistically significant, dose-related improvement in mean change from baseline DNSS was observed over 2 weeks with setipiprant 1000 mg b.i.d. versus placebo in the Phase 2 trial (−0.15 [95% CI −0.29, −0.01]; p = 0.030). Setipiprant 1000 mg b.i.d. had no significant effect on this endpoint in the Phase 3 trial (−0.02 [95% CI −0.12, 0.07]; p = 0.652). Total and individual NNSS and DESS symptom scores were significantly improved with setipiprant 1000 mg b.i.d. versus placebo in the Phase 2 but not the Phase 3 trial. Setipiprant showed a favorable safety/tolerability profile. Conclusions The Phase 2 trial was the first large clinical study to assess a CRTH2 antagonist in seasonal AR in a real-life setting. Setipiprant dose-related efficacy in the Phase 2 trial was not confirmed during Phase 3. Setipiprant was well tolerated in both studies. Trial registration NCT01241214 and NCT01484119",

    "abstract": "Success in asthma management hinges on patients' competency to detect and respond to ever-changing symptom severity. Thus, it is crucial to have reliable, simple, and sustainable methods of symptom monitoring that can be readily incorporated into daily life. Although visual analogue scale (VAS) has been considered as a simple symptom assessment method, its utility as a daily symptom monitoring tool in adolescents is unknown. This study was to determine the concurrent validity of VAS in capturing diurnal changes in symptoms and to examine the relationships between VAS and asthma control and pulmonary function. Forty-two adolescents (12–17 years old) with asthma completed daily assessment of symptoms twice per day, morning and bedtime, for a week using VAS and 6-item symptom diary concurrently. Asthma control was measured at enrollment and 6 month later, and spirometry was conducted at enrollment. Pearson correlations, multilevel modeling and regression were conducted to assess the relationships between VAS and symptom diary, asthma control and FEV1. Morning and evening VAS was positively associated with symptom diary items of each corresponding time frame of the day (r = 0.41–0.58, p < 0.0001). Morning VAS was significantly predicted by morning diary data reflecting nocturnal wakening (β = 2.13, p = 0.033) and morning symptoms (β = 4.09, p = 0.002), accounting for 57% of the total variance of morning VAS. Similarly, changes in four evening diary items, particularly shortness of breath (β = 2.60, p = 0.028), significantly predicted changes in evening VAS, accounting for 55% of the total variance. Average VAS scores correlated with asthma control (r = 0.65, p < 0.001) and FEV1 (r = −0.38, p = 0.029), and were predictive of asthma control 6 months later (β = 0.085, p = 0.006). VAS is a valid tool capturing diurnal changes in symptoms reflected in a multi-item symptom diary. Moreover, VAS is a valid measure predicting concurrent and future asthma control. The findings suggest VAS can be a simple alternative to daily dairies for daily symptom monitoring, which can provide invaluable information about current and future asthma control without substantially increasing self-monitoring burdens for adolescent patients.

    "abstract": "Anaphylactic reactions involving IgE mediated hypersensitivity have been frequently reported for a number of uncommon foods. However, cases of anaphylaxis to over the counter vitamins and oral supplements have been rarely published. Lactose intolerance affects approximately 20% of Canadians and roughly 70% of the world's population of any age. Lactose intolerance develops primarily due to the absence of the enzyme lactase and treatment involves avoidance of lactose-containing foods or ingestion of commercially available lactase enzyme preparations prior to their consumption. This case report represents the first documented evidence of anaphylaxis after exposure to supplemental lactase enzyme preparation.A 38 years old Caucasian female presented with a history of self-diagnosed adult-onset lactose intolerance and a suspected allergy to lactase containing tablets. She reported an episode of bilateral orbital swelling, shortness of breath, and throat constriction after oral ingestion of a supplemental lactase enzyme tablet. Her symptoms slowly resolved with the administration of inhaled salbutamol and oral diphenhydramine. She handled lactase tablets for years to her children who were lactose intolerant, but had never ingested the tablets herself prior to the reported episode. In clinic, physical examination was benign, and skin prick testing to a slurry of the lactase tablet revealed a strongly positive reaction wheal size of 10 mm and flare of 60 mm with normal controls. The patient reported throat tightness and constriction after skin prick testing and required cetirizine treatment and observation in clinic. Subsequent skin testing was performed with individual ingredients of the lactase tablet provided by the manufacturer and Aspergillus niger, a common bacteria used in lactase preparations. Only concentrated lactase enzyme elicited a positive response. The patient was diagnosed with lactase tablet induced anaphylaxis due to synthetic lactase enzyme IgE mediated allergy, and was advised to avoid all products containing lactase enzymes as an ingredient and to carry an epinephrine auto-injector.This is the first documented case report of an anaphylactic reaction to supplemental lactase enzyme. This case report reinforces the importance of thorough allergy assessment, education on avoidance of triggers, in particular with uncommon allergens.",

While other medications, including H1-antihistamines, H2-antihistamines, corticosteroids, and inhaled beta-2 agonists are often used to treat anaphylaxis in the emergency setting, none of these medications has been shown to reverse anaphylaxis. Fatal anaphylaxis is related to the delayed use of epinephrine. In community settings, epinephrine is available as an auto-injector in two doses, 0.15 mg and 0.3 mg. The recommended dose for children is 0.01 mg per kilogram. For infants at risk of anaphylaxis in the community, there are few options with regard to providing an optimal epinephrine dose for first-aid treatment. The Canadian Society of Allergy and Immunology (CSACI) therefore recommends, for the child weighing less than 15 kg, given the lack of a suitable alternative, prescribing the 0.15 mg epinephrine autoinjector. Adverse effects of an epinephrine dose of 0.15 mg given intramuscularly in infants or children weighing less than 15 kg are expected to be mild and transient at the plasma epinephrine concentrations achieved; therefore, these effects need to be measured against the consequences of not receiving epinephrine at all, which can include fatality.",

    "abstract": "It is hypothesized that because of higher mast cell numbers and mediator release, mastocytosis predisposes patients for systemic immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions to certain drugs including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID).To clarify whether patients with NSAID hypersensitivity show increased basal serum tryptase levels as sign for underlying mast cell disease.As part of our allergy work-up, basal serum tryptase levels were determined in all patients with a diagnosis of NSAID hypersensitivity and the severity of the reaction was graded. Patients with confirmed IgE-mediated hymenoptera venom allergy served as a comparison group.Out of 284 patients with NSAID hypersensitivity, 26 were identified with basal serum tryptase > 10.0 ng/mL (9.2%). In contrast, significantly (P = .004) more hymenoptera venom allergic patients had elevated tryptase > 10.0 ng/mL (83 out of 484; 17.1%). Basal tryptase > 20.0 ng/mL was indicative for severe anaphylaxis only in venom allergic subjects (29 patients; 4x grade 2 and 25x grade 3 anaphylaxis), but not in NSAID hypersensitive patients (6 patients; 4x grade 1, 2x grade 2).In contrast to hymenoptera venom allergy, NSAID hypersensitivity do not seem to be associated with elevated basal serum tryptase levels and levels > 20 ng/mL were not related to increased severity of the clinical reaction. This suggests that mastocytosis patients may be treated with NSAID without special precautions.",

    "abstract": "Allergy immunotherapy (AIT) is acknowledged to produce beneficial mid- and long-term clinical and immunologic effects and increased quality of life in patients with allergic respiratory diseases (such as allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and allergic asthma). However, poor adherence to AIT (due to intentional and/or non-intentional factors) is still a barrier to achieving these benefits. There is an urgent need for patient support programs (PSPs) that encompass communication, educational and motivational components. In the field of AIT, a PSP should be capable of (1) improving adherence, (2) boosting patient engagement, (3) explaining how AIT differs from pharmacological allergy treatments; (4) increasing health literacy about chronic, progressive, immunoglobulin-E-mediated immune diseases, (5) helping the patient to understand and manage local or systemic adverse events, and (6) providing and/or predicting local data on aeroallergen levels. We reviewed the literature in this field and have identified a number of practical issues to be addressed when implementing a PSP for AIT: the measurement of adherence, the choice of technologies, reminders, communication channels and content, the use of \"push\" messaging and social networks, interactivity, and the involvement of caregivers and patient leaders. A key issue is \"hi-tech\" (i.e. approaches based mainly on information technology) vs. \"hi-touch\" (based mainly on interaction with humans, i.e. family members, patient mentors and healthcare professionals). We conclude that multistakeholder PSPs (combining patient-, provider and society-based actions) must now be developed and tested with a view to increasing adherence, efficacy and safety in the field of AIT.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Periostin has been shown to be a marker of Type 2 airway inflammation, associated with airway eosinophilia. It has a potential role in identifying asthmatics who may be responsive to treatment with monoclonal antibody therapy directed against Type 2 cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-13, IL-4 receptor subunit-α and immunoglobulin E. The clinical utility of periostin measurements depends on better understanding of factors that may affect serum periostin levels, such as race. We aimed to identify the ranges of serum periostin in Chinese adults both with and without asthma, and compare them with those previously identified in Caucasian adults. Methods A two-centred cross-sectional study, recruiting 188 Chinese adults, aged 18 to 75 years. 120 participants had no history of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 68 participants had a doctor’s diagnosis of asthma and were on current treatment. Univariate comparisons of periostin by dichotomous variables were made using t-tests with logarithmic transformation as the distribution of periostin was skewed. Results In the Chinese non-asthma group, periostin levels were sex-, but not age-dependent, with females having higher periostin levels. The individual predicted (90% CI) reference range for periostin in females was 61.1 ng/ml (41.6 to 89.8) ng/ml and in males was 53.2 ng/ml (36.1 to 78.3) ng/ml. There was no difference in median serum periostin levels between Chinese non-asthmatics and Chinese asthmatics, 57.0 versus 56.8 ng/ml, difference (95% CI) 0.1 (− 4.2 to 4.2) ng/ml, P = 0.94. The median serum periostin levels were higher in Chinese non-asthmatics than Caucasian non-asthmatics, 57.0 versus 49.7 ng/ml, difference (95% CI) 8.2 (5.8–10.6) ng/ml, P &lt; 0.001. Conclusions Serum periostin does not discriminate between asthmatics and non-asthmatics and is therefore not a good biomarker to diagnose asthma. Serum periostin levels were higher in the Chinese compared to the Caucasian non-asthma group, and also sex dependent in the Chinese participants. There was no difference in serum periostin levels between Chinese non-asthma and asthma groups. This suggests that ethnicity should be considered in the interpretation of periostin levels in asthma patients and sex is an additional consideration in Chinese patients.

Some individuals do not develop anaphylaxis with the offending agent unless ingestion is related temporally to physical exertion, namely food dependent exercise induced anaphylaxis (FDEIA). The foods implicated are wheat, soya, peanut, milk and sea food. A retrospective study on patients with FDEIA from two Allergy clinics in Sri Lanka from 2011 to 2015 is reported. Patients were selected who fulfilled the following criteria: clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis according to the World Allergy Organization (WAO) criteria, where the onset of symptoms was during exertion, within 4 h of ingesting a food, the ability to eat the implicated food independent of exercise, or exercise safely, if the food was not ingested in the preceding 4 h and an in vitro (ImmunoCap serum IgE to the food) or in vivo (skin prick test) test indicating evidence of sensitivity to the food. There were 19 patients (12 males: 7 females). The ages ranged from 9 to 45 (mean 22.9, median 19 years). Eight patients (42.1%) were in the 9-16 age group. Those below 16 years had a male:female ratio of 3:5, while for those above 16 years it was 9:2. Wheat was the only food implicated in FDEIA in all patients and was confirmed by skin prick testing, or by ImmunoCap specific IgE to wheat or ω - 5 gliadin. All patients had urticaria, while 5/19 (26.3%) had angioedema of the lips. Fifteen patients (78.9%) had shortness of breath or wheezing, while 8 (42.1%) had lost consciousness. Nine patients (47. 3%) had hypotension. Fourteen (73.6%) of our patients had severe reactions, with loss of consciousness or hypotension, while 5 (26.3%) had symptoms related to the gastrointestinal tract. One patient developed anaphylaxis on two occasions following inhalation of ganja, a local cannabis derivative along with the ingestion of wheat and exertion. Wheat is the main food implicated in FDEIA in Sri Lanka. A local cannabis derivative, ganja has been implicated as a cofactor for the first time.",

    "abstract": "Bisphenol A (BPA) is useful in many manufacturing processes and is also found in commonly used consumer products. Previous experimental studies have reported that perinatal exposure to BPA promotes the development of allergic lung inflammation in childhood and even into adulthood. In this study, the effects of BPA on allergic lung inflammation in adults were investigated in murine lungs. CD-1 mice were orally administrated with 1 mg of BPA/mouse four times at one-week intervals with or without ovalbumin (OVA). The pathologic changes in the airways, cytological alterations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), levels of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in BALF, and OVA-specific IgE and IgG1 antibodies in serum were measured in the treated CD-1 mice. In vitro study using RAW264.7 cells, which are macrophage-like cells derived from BALB/c male mice, was conducted. The gene expression of cytokines and chemokines were measured. BPA enhanced eosinophil recruitment induced by OVA in the alveoli and in the submucosa of the airway, which has a goblet cell proliferation in the bronchial epithelium. BPA increased Th2 cytokines-interleukin-13 (IL-13), eosinophil-relevant cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-5, and CCL2 induced by OVA, in BALF. BPA induced adjuvant effects on OVA-specific IgG1 production. In the in vitro study using RAW264.7 cells, BPA increased the mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-6, CCL2 and CCL3 compared with the control and OVA groups. These results suggest that (1) the exposure of BPA could synergize with an OVA challenge to aggravate the severity of lung eosinophilia in adult mice, possibly by promoting a Th2-biased immune response and (2) the activation of macrophages and inflammatory cytokines released from these cells by BPA could be participating in this phenomenon.",

Understanding sensitization patterns helps clinicians tailor care more effectively. This study examines patterns of sensitization to aeroallergens in subjects suspected of having an allergic disease in Edmonton and catchment area.Retrospective chart review of skin prick test (SPT) results to 11 environmental aeroallergens performed between January 1st and June 30th 2014 at a University-based clinic, where patients are referred for SPT by allergists, respirologists, otolaryngologists, internists and general practitioners. Potential differences in aeroallergen sensitization patterns were evaluated.A total of 623 patients (36.9% males; 63.1% females), aged 4-84 years (mean age 38.6 years) had SPT done, of which 438 (70.3%) had a positive test for at least one aeroallergen (atopy). There were no significant sex differences in the frequency of atopy (males: 71.3% versus females: 69.7%; p = 0.373). The frequency of sensitivity to particular allergens among atopic subjects was: cat (53.1%), house dust mites (50.3%), grass (39.2%), birch (23.7%), alternaria (23.7%), dog (17.3%), poplar (12.1%), cedar (9.6%), aspergillus (9.6%), hormodendrum (8%), and penicillium (6.2%). Of 438 atopic patients, 110 (25.1%) were mono sensitized, 199 (45.4%) oligosensitized (2-3 allergens), and 129 (29.5%) polysensitized (≥ 4 allergens). There were no significant differences between males and females in the odds of being oligo-sensitized (OR: 0.95; 95% CI 0.58, 1.57). Polysensitization was significantly more frequent in males 37.2% than in females 24.8%; (OR: 0.95; 95% CI 0.58, 1.57).Cat is the most frequent perennial allergen and timothy grass pollen the most frequent seasonal allergen in Edmonton and catchment area.

In addition, the role of miR-21 in pulmonary remodeling related signaling such as transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Notch signaling is discussed.

A systematic literature review was conducted to examine the co-occurrence between HAE and ADs. Methods PubMed/EMBASE were searched for English-language reviews, case reports, observational studies, retrospective studies, and randomized controlled trials up to 04/15/2018 (04/15/2015-04/15/2018 for EMBASE) that mentioned patients with HAE Type I or II and comorbid ADs.

Results Of the 2880 records screened, 76 met the eligibility criteria and 155 individual occurrences of co-occurring HAE and AD were mentioned. The most common ADs were systemic lupus erythematosus (30 mentions), thyroid disease (21 mentions), and glomerulonephritis (16 mentions).

We aimed to further describe the natural history, prognostic factors, humanistic burden and uptake of traditional and alternative therapies in patients with CSU. Methods This was a prospective, cross-sectional analysis at a single centre. We reviewed patient medical records and conducted a survey in patients with CSU. Results 72 patients participated in the study with a median duration of CSU of 48 months. 30% of patients had symptoms that resolved in under 2 years with these patients trending towards an older age of onset of CSU (48 ± 17 years). 16% of patients had symptoms lasting 10 years or longer with these patients trending towards a younger age of onset (22 ± 16 years). Patients with a relapsing/remitting disease course (31%) and those with co-existing angioedema (57%) trended towards a longer median duration of CSU (96 and 50 months respectively) and were observed to have a higher proportion of patients reporting CSU duration of 10 years or longer (33% and 25%, p = 0.033 and p = 0.036 respectively). Patients with co-existing autoimmune/thyroid disease (19%) trended towards a shorter median duration of CSU (37 months). 54 patients (75%) reported sleep disturbance and 29 patients (43%) required emergency room visit(s) for symptomatic control. 84% of patients who trialed second generation antihistamines reported a response to treatment, while 73% of patients who trialed omalizumab reported a response to treatment. Patients using alternative medicine such as acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine and naturopathic medicine had lower reported response rates (20–29%) to treatment. Conclusions The natural history of CSU may be longer than previously reported with our study finding a median duration of symptoms of nearly 4 years with one-third of patients reporting a relapsing/remitting disease course. Younger age of onset, a relapsing/remitting disease course and angioedema may predict a longer duration of CSU, whereas older age of onset and co-existing autoimmune/thyroid disease may predict a shorter duration of CSU. Reported symptomatic benefit was higher from guidelines based pharmacologic therapy versus various alternative medicines.",

Methods Two-hundred-and-seventy eyes of 135 patients diagnosed with AKC or VKC from April 2004 to April 2014 were screened retrospectively. Patient demographics and objective signs were extracted from the electronic medical records. The severity of 10 objective signs, related to the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, limbus, and cornea, and intraocular pressure (IOP) were observed at baseline, at 2 weeks, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after starting treatment, and every 1 year thereafter (average use period: 8.4 ± 2.9 years). Safety was evaluated based on the incidence and severity of adverse events.

The overall response rate (significant improvement + complete response) significantly differed between the treatment (80.8%) and placebo groups (62.5%) (χ 2 = 4.20, p = 0.04). Conclusion Adjunct therapy with Yimingjia ® was safe and effective at 4 weeks in the treatment of chronic urticaria in children. The study was registered under trial number NCT03328897.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Oral immunotherapy (OIT) is now widely recognized as a valid option for the management of IgE-mediated food allergies. However, in real-life practice, OIT can lead to a variety of unique situations where the best course of action is undetermined. In patient-centered care, individual patient preferences, needs and values, should guide all clinical decisions. This can be achieved by using shared-decision making and treatment customization to navigate areas of uncertainty in a way that is responsive to patient’s needs and preferences. However, in the context of OIT, lack of awareness of potential protocol adaptability or alternatives can become a barrier to treatment personalization. The purpose of this article is to review the theoretical bases of patient-centered care and shared decision-making and their practical implication for the patient-centered delivery of OIT. Clinical cases highlighting common challenges in real-life OIT practice are presented along with a discussion of potential personalized management options to be considered. While the practice of OIT is bound to evolve as additional scientific and experiential knowledge is gained, it should always remain rooted in the general principles of patient-centered care.",

    "abstract": "Infants at high risk for developing a food allergy have either an atopic condition (such as eczema) themselves or an immediate family member with such a condition. Breastfeeding should be promoted and supported regardless of issues pertaining to food allergy prevention, but for infants whose mothers cannot or choose not to breastfeed, using a specific formula (i.e., hydrolyzed formula) is not recommended to prevent food allergies. When cow's milk protein formula has been introduced in an infant's diet, make sure that regular ingestion (as little as 10 mL daily) is maintained to prevent loss of tolerance. For high-risk infants, there is compelling evidence that introducing allergenic foods early—at around 6 months, but not before 4 months of age—can prevent common food allergies, and allergies to peanut and egg in particular. Once an allergenic food has been introduced, regular ingestion (e.g., a few times a week) is important to maintain tolerance. Common allergenic foods can be introduced without pausing for days between new foods, and the risk for a severe reaction at first exposure in infancy is extremely low. Pre-emptive in-office screening before introducing allergenic foods is not recommended. No recommendations can be made at this time about the role of maternal dietary modification during pregnancy or lactation, or about supplementing with vitamin D, omega 3, or pre- or probiotics as means to prevent food allergy.",

The impact of mepolizumab in a real-world, publicly funded healthcare setting is unknown. The objective of this study was to describe the demographics and clinical characteristics of real-world patients receiving mepolizumab, and to compare asthma-related outcomes and associated asthma-related costs before and during mepolizumab use. Methods This retrospective, observational study in Ontario, Canada, included patients initiating mepolizumab between February 2016 and March 2019. Patients were identified using the mepolizumab patient support program and linked to the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences database of publicly accessed healthcare. Patient outcomes were obtained for 12 months pre- and post-mepolizumab initiation and compared. Results A total of 275 patients were enrolled in the overall patient support program cohort (mean [standard deviation] age 57.6 [13.5] years, mean [standard deviation] of the median per-patient eosinophil count 540.4 [491.9] cells/μL). Mepolizumab was associated with reductions in asthma exacerbations (46.1%, P &lt; 0.001) and in the number of asthma-related visits to general practitioners (40.2%, P &lt; 0.001), specialists (27.2%, P &lt; 0.001), and emergency departments (52.1%, P &lt; 0.001). Associated costs were significantly lower post- versus pre-mepolizumab for asthma-related general practitioner and specialist visits, and for all-cause emergency department visits and hospital admissions. Conclusions In a real-world population of Canadian patients with severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype, the use of mepolizumab within a patient support program reduced asthma exacerbations and decreased asthma-related healthcare resource utilization and associated costs.",

This study focuses on the genetic basis of HAE, particularly focusing on unresolved cases and those with normal C1-inhibitor levels (nC1-INH HAE). This study reveals that conventional testing identified pathogenic variants in only 10 patients ( n = 32), emphasizing the necessity for an integrative approach using genome, exome, and transcriptome sequencing. Despite extensive genetic analyses, the diagnostic yield for nC1-INH HAE remains low in our study, the pathogenic variant for nC1-INH HAE was identified in only 1 patient ( n = 21). Investigation into candidate genes yielded no pathogenic variants, prompting a re-evaluation of patients’ diagnoses. This study advocates for a nuanced approach to genetic testing, recognizing its limitations and emphasizing the need for continuous clinical assessment. The complex genetic landscape of nC1-INH HAE necessitates further research for a more comprehensive understanding. In conclusion, this study contributes valuable insights into the genetic intricacies of HAE, highlighting the challenges in diagnosis and the evolving nature of the disease. The findings underscore the importance of advanced sequencing techniques and an integrated diagnostic strategy in unravelling the complexities of HAE, particularly in nС1-INH HAE cases.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article summarizes and provides commentary regarding guidelines on the administration of immunotherapy (IT) for allergic airway disease. Recent investigations have provided important insights into the immunologic mechanism of IT and the prominent role of interleukin-10-producing regulatory T lymphocytes. The most important aspect of successful IT is the administration of an appropriate dose of an extract containing a sufficient concentration of the relevant allergen. This is largely possible now only with standardized extracts. When the major allergen content of successful IT extracts was quantified, efficacy was demonstrated across a surprisingly narrow concentration range (approximately 5-24 μg per injection), irrespective of the extract. This presumably reflects the concentration of an antigen that drives an immune response toward tolerance. It may be predicted that as major allergen content is quantified in currently nonstandardized extracts, effective IT will also be achieved by administering a dose in this range, in contrast to current practices involving fairly arbitrary dosing decisions. With the availability of nonsedating antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids, and the leukotriene modifiers, inadequate pharmacologic response or intolerable side effects are less commonly the major indications for starting IT for allergic rhinitis (AR). However, with the recognition that a relatively short course (3-5 years) of IT can provide long-term immunomodulation and clinical benefit, a desire to avoid long-term pharmacotherapy and the associated high costs may be the primary indication for IT in AR cases. While evidence overwhelmingly supports the beneficial influences of IT in asthma cases, the positioning of IT for this disorder is not established. The observed prevention of asthma in children who have AR is intriguing, but further studies are required to assess the extent to which the prevalence and severity of chronic asthma will be reduced when these children reach adulthood. Similarly, safety issues overwhelmingly suggest that uncontrolled asthma is the greatest risk factor for mortality associated with IT and that IT therefore may be contraindicated for most patients who have inadequate pharmacologic responses or are unable to tolerate useful pharmacologic agents. Paradoxically, these are the patients for whom a response to IT may be most desirable.",

    "abstract": "Recently, many studies have suggested a potential role for early hematopoietic progenitor cell and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) recruitment and differentiation in the development of allergy and inflammation. This is based largely on evidence that stem cells or CD34+ progenitor cells are recruited to the site of inflammation in allergic diseases, likely through many of the same adhesion and chemokine receptors used for stem cell homing to the bone marrow (PSGL-1, CXCL12, alpha4-beta1 integrin, CD44, etc). Once at the site of inflammation, it has been suggested that stem cells could participate in the perpetuation of inflammation by maturing, locally, into inflammatory cells in response to the growth factors released in situ. Here we provide a brief review of the evidence to suggest that hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (versus mature hematopoietic lineages) are, indeed, recruited to the site of allergic inflammation. We also discuss the molecules that likely play a role in this process, and highlight a number of our novel observations on a specific role for the stem cell antigen CD34 in this process.",

This study explores the roles of macrophages and neutrophils and their cross-talk with extra-cellular matrix components in the light of the role essayed by T cells. Materials and Methods and Treatment: To clarify the role of NADPH oxidase in the pathophysiology of T cell-initiatedmacrophage-associated allergic asthma, we induced allergen dependent inflammation in a gp91 phox −/− SKO (single knockout) and a gp91 phox −/− MMP-12−/− DKO (double knockout) mouse and analysed trafficking and functionality of various cell types, the T cell function and T cell-macrophage interaction being given special emphasis. Composite asthma symptoms expressed in a more aggravated manner in both the KO (SKO and DKO) mice compared to WT indicating that some redundancy may exist in the response pathways of gp91phox and MMP-12. On the one hand, upregulation in macrophage functions such as proliferation, mixed lymphocyte reaction, and MCP-1 directed chemotaxis, may indicate that a regulatory cross-talk is switched on between T cell and macrophage and on the other, downregulation of respiratory burst response hints at a dichotomy in their signaling pathways. Increased B7.1 but reduced B7.2 and MHC class II expression on KO alveolar macrophages may suggest that a switching on-off mechanism is operative where alteration of co-stimulatory molecule expression selectively activating T cell is a critical step. T cell mediated functions such as Th2 cytokine secretion, and T cell proliferation in response to OVA were upregulated synchronous with the overall robustness of the asthma phenotype. As far as cell-cell interaction is concerned, the data is indicative of the existence of a plethora of networks where molecular switches may exist that selectively induce activation and deactivation of regulatory pathways that ultimately manifest in the overall response. gp91 phox and MMP-12 either redundantly or synergistically but not additively, provide a regulatory checkpoint for restricting T cell cross-talk with macrophages and keep excessive tissue damage and ECM degradation during acute allergic inflammation under control.",

A cohort analysis of all first born children aged 2-5 and 6-9 years was performed. An age-matched sibling-pair analysis was also performed to account for shared genetic and environmental risk factors. Analyses of first-borns demonstrated that elective caesarean section was associated with an increased risk of dispensed ICS in both 2-5 (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-1.29) and 6-9 (aOR=1.21, 1.09-1.34) age groups.

Emergency caesarean section and vacuum extraction had some association with dispensed ICS in the analyses of first-borns but these associations were not confirmed in the sibling-pair analyses. Confounding by familial factors affects the association between mode of delivery and dispensed ICS.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The eliciting dose (ED) for a peanut allergic reaction in 5% of the peanut allergic population, the ED05, is 1.5 mg of peanut protein. This ED05 was derived from oral food challenges (OFC) that use graded, incremental doses administered at fixed time intervals. Individual patients’ threshold doses were used to generate population dose-distribution curves using probability distributions from which the ED05 was then determined. It is important to clinically validate that this dose is predictive of the allergenic response in a further unselected group of peanut-allergic individuals. Methods/Aims This is a multi-centre study involving three national level referral and teaching centres. (Cork University Hospital, Ireland, Royal Children’s Hospital Melbourne, Australia and Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, U.S.A.) The study is now in process and will continue to run until all centres have recruited 125 participates in each respective centre. A total of 375 participants, aged 1–18 years will be recruited during routine Allergy appointments in the centres. The aim is to assess the precision of the predicted ED05 using a single dose (6 mg peanut = 1.5 mg of peanut protein) in the form of a cookie. Validated Food Allergy related Quality of Life Questionnaires-(FAQLQ) will be self-administered prior to OFC and 1 month after challenge to assess the impact of a single dose OFC on FAQL. Serological and cell based in vitro studies will be performed. Conclusion The validation of the ED05 threshold for allergic reactions in peanut allergic subjects has potential value for public health measures. The single dose OFC, based upon the statistical dose-distribution analysis of past challenge trials, promises an efficient approach to identify the most highly sensitive patients within any given food-allergic population.",

    "abstract": "The aetiology of childhood asthma is complex. An early dysfunction in the immunological development of the innate immune system in combination with environmental factors possibly triggers asthma. CD14 and toll-like receptors are important components of the innate immune system. The aim of this systematic review was to obtain a better insight into the relation between CD14 and toll-like receptors and childhood asthma in Caucasians. We searched PubMed and EMBASE for relevant articles. In total, 44 articles were included. The quality of the selected studies was independently assessed by the first two authors using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale. Toll-like receptor 2, toll-like receptor 6, toll-like receptor 9, and toll-like receptor 10 appear to have some association with childhood asthma in Caucasians. The evidence for a relation of CD14 with childhood asthma is limited. In conclusion, there is no convincing evidence yet for a role of CD14 and toll-like receptors in relation to childhood asthma. Future studies should include haplotype analysis and take environmental factors into account to further clarify the role of CD14 and toll-like receptors on childhood asthma.",

    "abstract": "Presenting processed antigens to CD4+ lymphocytes during the immune response involves major histocompatibility complex class II molecules. MHC class II genes transcription is regulated by four transcription factors: CIITA, RFXANK, RFX5 and RFXAP. Defects in these factors result in major histocompatibility complex class II expression deficiency, a primary combined immunodeficiency frequent in North Africa. Autosomal recessive mutations in the RFXANK gene have been reported as being the principal defect found in North African patients with this disorder. In this paper, we describe clinical, immunological and genetic features of 11 unrelated Algerian patients whose monocytes display a total absence of MHC class II molecules. They shared mainly the same clinical picture which included protracted diarrhoea and respiratory tract recurrent infections. Genetic analysis revealed that 9 of the 11 patients had the same RFXANK founder mutation, a 26 bp deletion (named I5E6-25_I5E6+1, also known as 752delG26). Immunological and genetic findings in our series may facilitate genetic counselling implementation for Algerian consanguineous families. Further studies need to be conducted to determine 752delG26 heterozygous mutation frequency in Algerian population.",

We aimed to evaluate whether maternal immunization can induce a regulatory B (B10) cell population in offspring in concert with allergy inhibition. C57BL/6 females were or were not immunized with OVA and were mated with normal WT males. Their offspring were evaluated at 3 days of age or 20 days after neonatal immunization. Human peripheral B cells from atopic and non-atopic individuals were also evaluated. Preconception OVA immunization induced B10 cells in offspring, and IL-10 production appeared to be critical for FcγRIIB upregulation in offspring B cells. Murine and human IL-10-producing B cells responded in vitro to IgG according to the atopic repertoire of the cells. Our results reveal that maternal immunization induces allergen-specific B10 cells in offspring and a pivotal role for the IgG repertoire in IL-10 production by murine and human B cells.",

Volumes of propellant gas per actuation have never been measured. In-vitro studies measured gas volumes produced by pMDIs on air oxygen (O2) levels in valved holding chambers (VHC) and the falls in O2% following actuation into lung ventilator delivery devices. Volumes of propellant gas hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) 134a and 227ea and redundant chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) varied from 7 ml per actuation from a small salbutamol HFA inhaler to 16 ml from the larger. Similar-sized CFC pMDI volumes were 15.6 and 20.4 ml. Each HFA salbutamol inhaler has 220 full volume discharges; total volume of gas from a small 134a pMDI was 1640 ml, and large 3885 ml. Sensing the presence of liquid propellant by shaking was felt at the 220th discharge in both large and small inhalers. Because of a partial pressure effect, VHC O2% in air was reduced to 11% in the smallest 127 ml volume VHC following 10 actuations of a large 134a salbutamol inhaler. The four ventilator delivery devices studied lowered 100% oxygen levels to a range of 93 to 81% after five actuations, depending on the device and type of pMDI used. Pressurised inhaler propellants require further study to assess smooth muscle relaxing properties.",

    "abstract": "Asthma in the elderly is poorly understood and vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are very common in older individuals. We studied the role of vitamin D in elderly asthmatics. Asthmatics subjects, age 65 and older, were followed every 4 weeks for 12 weeks in the late fall and winter. During the study period they took 2,000 I.U. vitamin D3 daily. Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D and calcium were measured at baseline and study end. Twenty nine percent of subjects were deficient and 50% insufficient in serum vitamin D at baseline. Serum vitamin D increased from 24.3±9.2 ng/ml (60.7±23 nmol/L) to 34±7.1 ng/ml (84.9±17.7 nmol/L) at the end of the study (p<0.001), whereas calcium was unchanged. We found no significant association between vitamin D and subjects' demographics. Vitamin D was similar in men and women. There was no association between serum vitamin D and inhaled steroid dose. Vitamin D was significantly lower in subjects with uncontrolled asthma (Asthma Control Test, ACT≤19) compared to the ones with well controlled symptoms (p<0.05). In subjects with uncontrolled asthma at baseline, ACT scores increased significantly at the end of the study (p<0.04), but not at 4 and 8 weeks. Spirometric values remained unchanged throughout the study. Elderly asthmatics very commonly have vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. Serum vitamin D levels were lower in subjects with uncontrolled asthma. In these subjects, vitamin D supplementation for 12 weeks led to improved ACT scores. Larger, randomized, placebo controlled studies are required to further evaluate whether vitamin D supplementation may improve asthma symptoms in this population. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01730976 .",

The burden of disease and the societal costs of proper diagnosis and management are considerable, making the primary prevention of allergic conditions a desirable health care objective. This position statement reviews current evidence on dietary exposures and allergy prevention in infants at high risk of developing allergic conditions. It revisits previous dietary recommendations for pregnancy, breastfeeding and formula-feeding, and provides an approach for introducing solid foods to high-risk infants. While there is no evidence that delaying the introduction of any specific food beyond six months of age helps to prevent allergy, the protective effect of early introduction of potentially allergenic foods (at four to six months) remains under investigation. Recent research appears to suggest that regularly ingesting a new, potentially allergenic food may be as important as when that food is first introduced.

ITLN-1 mRNA expression in freshly isolated BECs, primary cultured BECs with or without IL-13 and inhibition effects of mometasone furoate (MF) were investigated by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Correlations between ITLN-1 mRNA and Type-2 related parameters (e.g. FeNO, IgE, iNOS, CCL26, periostin and DPP4 mRNA) were analyzed. ITLN-1 protein distribution in asthmatic airway tissue was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) and serum ITLN-1 protein were measured by ELISA. The effect of recombinant human (rh) ITLN-1 on stimulated production of CXCL10 and phospho(p)-STAT1 expression examined in lung fibroblasts.ITLN-1 mRNA was expressed in freshly isolated BECs and was correlated with Type-2 related parameters. ITLN-1 protein was increased in goblet cells in SN-Asthmatics and increased in SN-Asthmatic BAL fluid. There were no any differences in serum ITLN-1 concentration between ST and SN-Asthma. IL-13 enhanced ITLN-1 expression and inhibited by MF from BECs in vitro, while rhITLN-1 inhibited CXCL10 production and p-STAT1 expression in HFL-1 cells.ITLN-1 is induced by IL-13 and expressed mainly in goblet cells in untreated asthma where its levels correlate with known Type-2 related parameters. Further, ITLN-1 inhibits Type-1 chemokine expression.",

In the rush phase, after the administration of the initial dose which was set in open food challenge test, the subsequent doses were increased by approximately 1.2 times of the previous dose and were administered every 2 hours, 4 times a day. The target doses of hen's egg, wheat (udon noodle), and cow's milk in the rush phase were 50 g, 200 g, and 200 ml, respectively. The ingestion of the target dose was continued at home every day for at least a year in the maintained phase.Four participants experienced intractable abdominal pain during the rush phase; therefore, the loading dose was not increased in these children. However, the administration of LTRAs prevented their symptoms, resulting in the completion of the rush phase. One participant also experienced intractable abdominal pain during the maintenance phase. After receiving LTRAs, the target dose was able to tolerated.The findings from this retrospective study suggest that the administration of LTRAs is useful for the prevention of adverse allergic reactions such as abdominal pain during OIT.",

    "abstract": "Successful treatment of anaphylaxis in the community relies on early and correct use of epinephrine autoinjectors. Community pharmacists supply these devices and have a crucial role teaching patients how to use them. Supply of epinephrine autoinjectors in Australia increased 70-fold in the past decade. New EpiPen and Anapen autoinjectors were launched in Australia in 2011 and 2012, with the potential to cause confusion. However there is no information about how pharmacists demonstrate epinephrine autoinjectors to patients. Therefore the aim of this study was to assess real-world community pharmacist demonstrations of EpiPen and Anapen. We also sought to identify consultation-based predictors of accurate demonstration. Demonstration accuracy was assessed in simulated patient visits to 300 randomly selected pharmacies. Pharmacists were asked by the simulated patient how to use original EpiPen, new-look EpiPen or Anapen, and assessed against the relevant Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) Action Plan for Anaphylaxis. Other anaphylaxis advice provided by the pharmacist was also recorded. Accuracy was analysed descriptively. Binary logistic regression was used to identify predictors of accurate demonstration. All 300 pharmacies were visited. Of 250 pharmacist demonstrations, 46 (18.4%) accurately demonstrated all four steps on ASCIA Action Plan. Failure to state 'do not touch the needle' (74.8%) or 'massage injection site' (68.8%) reduced accuracy. However 163 (65.2%) accurately demonstrated the three steps required to inject epinephrine (no difference by device, p = 0.15). Associations with accurate demonstration were: checking if the patient had an anaphylaxis action plan (odds ratio, OR = 16.1; 95% CI: 3.86-67.3); stating to call an ambulance after use (OR = 4.0; 95% CI: 1.44-11.1); or explaining side effects of epinephrine (OR = 4.5; 95% CI: 1.48-13.4). It is critical that anaphylaxis patients know how to use their prescribed epinephrine autoinjector correctly. Pharmacists have acceptable rates of EpiPen and Anapen demonstration accuracy, although more is needed to improve this. Those who pay attention to the need for action plans, emergency care after epinephrine use, and informing patients about the side effects of epinephrine may have better knowledge about anaphylaxis, and in turn significantly improve demonstration accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Home based oral immunotherapy (OIT) for food allergy has often been used for young children in Japan, the majority of whom are believed to outgrow the allergy by the school age, therefore the true efficacy of the therapy has been controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a newly developed slow- type home-based oral immunotherapy (OIT) regimen in children with hen's egg (HE) allergy, who had low likelihood of outgrowing the allergy, with treatment involving only elimination diet.We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 43 children with egg allergy (30 males; median age 6) who fulfilled Burks et al.'s criteria of being unlikely to outgrow the allergy. Thirty children who agreed to start OIT were assigned to the treatment group, and 13 who did not want to participate immediately were assigned to the untreated group; the patients underwent an elimination diet for 1 year, during which they were monitored. The OIT regimen involved the intake of the maximum tolerated dose 2 to 3 times a week at home, with initial dose introduction followed by dose build-ups with medical supervision. We statistically evaluated the rate of children who changed their threshold up to 32 g of egg - defined as, oral tolerance induction- in both the groups for 1 year and in the OIT group for 2 years, as well as the rate of children who fulfilled Savage et al.'s criteria of clinical tolerance after reaching the abovementioned remission stage.The rate of children who achieved oral tolerance induction to 32 g of egg after 1 year in the OIT group (9/30) was significantly higher than that in the untreated group (0/13). The total rate within the OIT group was significantly increased from 9/30 at 1 year to 17/30 at two years without any severe adverse reaction; of the above 17 children, we followed 14 children, and noted that 11 of these were able to obtain clinical tolerance.The home-based OIT with an intermittent loading protocol was very safe and effective in children with a low likelihood of outgrowing egg allergy.",

This may be due to homology of tropomyosin or other potentially shared proteins. The aim of our study was to assess the frequency of house dust mite sensitization in a shrimp allergic Canadian population.We undertook a retrospective chart review of shrimp allergic patients at an outpatient allergy clinic in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada. Our primary endpoint was to assess for presence of HDM sensitization in this population. Patients were categorized into approximate quartiles. We assessed the severity of the shrimp reactions, correlated shrimp skin test size to HDM skin test size, and measured the proportion of patients with atopic symptoms.We identified 95 shrimp allergic patients who were tested for house dust mite. 86 (90.5%) of these patients had a positive skin test to HDM. Patients with a shrimp skin test ≥5 mm were 5.31 times (95% CI, 1.55-18.14; p = 0.008) more likely to exhibit a dust mite skin test ≥5 mm than patients with a shrimp skin test <5 mm. The odds of a patient with a shrimp skin test between 10 and 18 mm having a larger HDM skin test were 3.93 times (95% CI 1.03-14.98, p = 0.045) the odds for a patient with a shrimp skin test size between 3 and 4 mm. We did not find a correlation between shrimp skin test size and shrimp reaction symptom grade (p = 0.301).In our Canadian patients, we found a large majority of shrimp allergic patients to be sensitized to HDM. We found that patients with a large skin test to shrimp were more likely to have a large skin test to HDM compared to those patients with a small skin test to shrimp.

    "abstract": "It is well-known that lymphocytes play an important role in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory domains (TIGIT) is one of immunosuppressive costimulatory molecules that mediates an inhibitory effect. However, its roles in SLE are poorly understood. This study was designed to investigate the correlation between the frequencies of TIGIT-expressing CD3+CD4+ T lymphocytes and SLE.Patients with SLE were recruited from the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University. Medical history, clinical manifestations, physical examination and laboratory measurements were recorded. The expression of TIGIT on CD3+ T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, CD3+CD4+ T lymphocytes and CD3+CD8+ T lymphocytes were determined by flow cytometry. The frequencies of TIGIT-expressing CD3+CD4+ T lymphocytes in patients with SLE were further analyzed for correlations with markers of autoimmune response, inflammation, urine proteins and disease activity in SLE.The frequency of TIGIT-expressing CD3+CD4+ T lymphocytes was significantly elevated in SLE patients compared with healthy controls (P < 0.0001). The frequency of TIGIT-expressing CD3+CD4+ T lymphocytes in patients with SLE was increased significantly in subjects with high anti-dsDNA titer (P = 0.026), high anti-Sm titer (P = 0.026), and high levels of urine microalbumin (P = 0.046). Furthermore, The frequency of TIGIT-expressing CD3+CD4+ T lymphocytes was found to be positively correlated with the Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score in SLE (r2 = 0.082; P = 0.044).In SLE, the frequency of TIGIT-expressing CD3+CD4+ T lymphocytes was elevated and associated with the disease activity.",

    "abstract": "Asthma exacerbations are associated with the recruitment of neutrophils to the lungs. These cells release proteases and mediators, many of which act at G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that couple via Gq to promote bronchoconstriction and inflammation. Common asthma therapeutics up-regulate expression of the regulator of G protein signalling (RGS), RGS2. As RGS2 reduces signaling from Gq-coupled GPCRs, we have defined role(s) for this GTPase-activating protein in an acute neutrophilic model of lung inflammation. Wild type and Rgs2 -/- C57Bl6 mice were exposed to nebulized lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Lung function (respiratory system resistance and compliance) was measured using a SCIREQ flexivent small animal ventilator. Lung inflammation was assessed by histochemistry, cell counting and by cytokine and chemokine expression in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Lipopolysaccharide inhalation induced transient airways hyperreactivity (AHR) and neutrophilic lung inflammation. While AHR and inflammation was greatest 3 h post-LPS exposure, BAL neutrophils persisted for 24 h. At 3 h post-LPS inhalation, multiple inflammatory cytokines (CSF2, CSF3, IL6, TNF) and chemokines (CCL3, CCL4, CXCL1, CXCL2) were highly expressed in the BAL fluid, prior to declining by 24 h. Compared to wild type counterparts, Rgs2 -/- mice developed significantly greater airflow resistance in response to inhaled methacholine (MCh) at 3 h post-LPS exposure. At 24 h post-LPS exposure, when lung function was recovering in the wild type animals, MCh-induced resistance was increased, and compliance decreased, in Rgs2 -/- mice. Thus, Rgs2 -/- mice show AHR and stiffer lungs 24 h post-LPS exposure. Histological markers of inflammation, total and differential cell counts, and major cytokine and chemokine expression in BAL fluid were similar between wild type and Rgs2 -/- mice. However, 3 and 24 h post-LPS exposure, IL12B expression was significantly elevated in BAL fluid from Rgs2 -/- mice compared to wild type animals. While Rgs2 is bronchoprotective in acute neutrophilic inflammation, no clear anti-inflammatory effect was apparent. Nevertheless, elevated IL12B expression in Rgs2 -/- animals raises the possibility that RGS2 could dampen Th1 responses. These findings indicate that up-regulation of RGS2, as occurs in response to inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonists, may be beneficial in acute neutrophilic exacerbations of airway disease, including asthma.",

Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate whether serum TNC can serve as a novel biomarker for asthma. We evaluated 126 adult patients with mild to severe asthma. Serum TNC, periostin, and total IgE concentrations were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Serum TNC levels were significantly higher in patients with severe asthma and high serum total IgE levels. Patients with both high serum TNC (> 37.16 ng/mL) and high serum periostin (> 95 ng/mL) levels (n = 20) or patients with both high serum TNC and high serum total IgE (> 100 IU/mL) levels (n = 36) presented higher disease severity and more severe airflow limitation than patients in other subpopulations. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that serum TNC levels in asthmatic patients are associated with clinical features of asthma and that the combination of serum TNC and periostin levels or combination of serum TNC and total IgE levels were more useful for asthma than each single marker, suggesting that serum TNC can serve as a novel biomarker for asthma.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this paper, we review methodological approaches used in studies that evaluated the association between occupational exposure to quaternary ammonium compounds (quats) and occupational asthma. This association is of interest because quats are a common active ingredient of disinfectants and have been linked to work-related asthma in some circumstances. However, any evidence-based assessment of an exposure-outcome association needs to consider both strengths and limitations of the literature. We focus on publications cited by various US and international organizations. Eighteen investigations included in the review fall into two broad categories: case reports and challenge studies of individual patients and population studies that examined the association between quats and asthma occurrence in groups of subjects. We evaluated these studies guided by questions that address whether: exposure data on specific quat(s) and other agents that may cause asthma were included, new asthma cases were differentiated from asthma exacerbation, and information on respiratory sensitivity versus irritation was given. We also assessed consistency across studies. Studies of individual patients, particularly those that provided detailed information on challenge test results, document cases of asthma induced by exposure to quats. By contrast, studies of occupational groups with the highest potential for quats exposure (e.g., cleaners and farmers) do not consistently report increased incidence of asthma due specifically to quats. The unresolved methodological issues include: poor understanding of exposure pathways considering that quats are non-volatile, lack of quantitative data allowing for identification of an asthmagenicity threshold, insufficient information on whether quats are sensitizers or act via dose-dependent irritation or some other mechanism, and inability to quantify risk of new-onset asthma attributable to quats. Another important area of uncertainty is the lack of information on the specific quats being used. There is also a lack of data capable of distinguishing the effects of quats from those of other chemical and biological workplace exposures. The current state-of-the-science does not allow a proper assessment of the potential link between quats and occupational asthma.",

Combinations with oral sympathomimetics, such as pseudoephedrine, relieve congestion but produce side effects. Previous animal and human studies with histamine receptor-3 antagonists, such as PF-03654764, demonstrate promise. Herein we employ the Environmental Exposure Unit (EEU) to conduct the first randomized controlled trial of PF-03654764 in allergic rhinitis. 64 participants were randomized in a double-blind, placebo-controlled 4-period crossover study. Participants were exposed to ragweed pollen for 6 hours post-dose in the EEU. The primary objective was to compare the effect of PF-03654764 + fexofenadine to pseudoephedrine + fexofenadine on the subjective measures of congestion and Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS). The objectives of our post-hoc analyses were to compare all treatments to placebo and determine the onset of action (OA). This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01033396). PF-03654764 + fexofenadine was not superior to pseudoephedrine + fexofenadine. In post-hoc analyses, PF-03654764 + fexofenadine significantly reduced TNSS, relative to placebo, and OA was 60 minutes. Pseudoephedrine + fexofenadine significantly reduced congestion and TNSS, relative to placebo, with OA of 60 and 30 minutes, respectively. Although this study was not powered for a statistical analysis of safety, it was noted that all PF-03654764-treated groups experienced an elevated incidence of adverse events. PF-03654764 + fexofenadine failed to provide superior relief of allergic rhinitis-associated nasal symptoms upon exposure to ragweed pollen compared to fexofenadine + pseudoephedrine. However, in post-hoc analyses, PF-03654764 + fexofenadine improved TNSS compared to placebo. Side effects in the PF-03654764-treated groups were clinically significant compared to the controls.",

    "abstract": "Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), also known as Samter’s triad, is a clinical syndrome which consists of aspirin (ASA) intolerance, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, and intrinsic bronchial asthma (Press Med 119:48-51, 1922). ASA challenge is the gold standard for diagnosing AERD (Curr Allergy Asthma 9:155-163, 2009). The practice of ASA challenge and desensitization in Canada is infrequently utilized, which may explain its omission as a viable therapeutic option in the latest Canadian clinical practice guidelines for acute and chronic rhinosinusitis (AACI 7:1-38, 2011). This retrospective study assessed 111 patients who underwent ASA desensitization in the Allergy and Immunology clinic at St. Joseph’s Healthcare (SJHC) in London, Ontario. The mean age was 50.7 years, and 52.5% (n = 58) were male. Sixty-one percent (n = 68) claimed prior, significant reactions to ASA, and all patients had features of AERD. Seventy-three percent (n = 81) claimed symptom improvement after achieving maintenance dosing on the desensitization protocol. Of this population, 21.6% (n = 24) improved in all 3 areas of interest (sense of taste or smell, upper respiratory symptoms and lower respiratory symptoms). Twenty-six percent (n = 29) had adverse effects, mostly in the way of gastrointestinal upset, but no severe adverse events were seen. ASA desensitization helps improve symptoms in patients with AERD. Further, it allows patients to tolerate additional ASA and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) when needed for supplemental analgesia or for cardio-protection. This is of particular benefit in those who require these medications for improved quality of life, and for reduced morbidity and mortality, such as those with cardiovascular disease or chronic pain. There should be further studies conducted in Canada as well as consideration for ASA desensitization to be included in the next clinical practice guidelines.",

Interviewers collected information on demographics, family history of allergy, social and lifestyle factors, and the child's health.

We observed a significant association between eczema reported before 18 months and a positive SPT at 18 months [aOR 4.5 (1.9–10.7)]. Ninety-five (14.6 %) children with negative SPTs at 18 months developed positive tests at 36 months.

    "abstract": "Increasing prevalence of childhood allergic diseases including asthma is a global health concern, and we aimed to investigate prenatal risk factors for childhood asthma and to address the potential shared prenatal impacts among childhood asthma, allergic rhinitis (AR) and atopic dermatitis (AD). We used two claim databases, including Taiwan Birth Cohort Study (TBCS) and National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), to identify independent paired mother–child data (mother–child dyads) between 2006 and 2009. The association between prenatal factors and asthma was determined by calculating adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) using conditional logistic regression analysis. A total of 628,878 mother–child dyads were included, and 43,915 (6.98%) of children developed asthma prior to age 6. We found that male gender (aOR 1.50, 95% CI 1.47–1.53), maternal asthma (aOR 1.80, 95% CI 1.71–1.89), maternal AR (aOR 1.33, 95% CI 1.30–1.37), preterm birth (aOR 1.32, 95% CI 1.27–1.37), low birth weight (aOR 1.14, 95% CI 1.10–1.19) and cesarean section (aOR 1.10, 95% CI 1.08–1.13) were independent predictors for childhood asthma. A high urbanization level and a low number of older siblings were associated with asthma in a dose–response manner. Notably, we identified that the association between maternal asthma and childhood asthma (aOR 1.80, 95% CI 1.71–1.89) was stronger compared with those between maternal asthma and childhood AR (aOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.50–1.87) as well as childhood AD (aOR 1.31, 95% CI 1.22–1.40). Similarly, the association between maternal AR and childhood AR (aOR 1.62, 95% CI 1.53–1.72) was higher than those between maternal AR and childhood asthma (aOR 1.33, 95% CI 1.30–1.37) as well as childhood AD (aOR 1.35, 95% CI 1.31–1.40). Furthermore, the number of maternal allergic diseases was associated with the three childhood allergic diseases in a dose–response manner. In conclusion, this population-based study provided evidence of prenatal impacts on childhood asthma and demonstrated the shared maternal impacts among childhood asthma, AR, and AD. These findings highlight the shared prenatal impacts among allergic diseases, and studies are warranted to address the pivotal pathway in allergic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by inflammation, progressive lung disease, and respiratory failure. Although the relationship is not well understood, patients with CF are thought to have a higher prevalence of asthma than the general population. CF Foundation (CFF) annual registry data in 2017 reported a prevalence of asthma in CF of 32%. It is difficult to differentiate asthma from CF given similarities in symptoms and reversible obstructive lung function in both diseases. However, a specific asthma phenotype (type 2 inflammatory signature), is often identified in CF patients and this would suggest potential responsiveness to biologics targeting this asthma phenotype. A type 2 inflammatory condition is defined by the presence of an interleukin (IL)-4 high , IL-5 high , IL-13 high state and is suggested by the presence of an elevated total IgE, specific IgE sensitization, or an elevated absolute eosinophil count (AEC). In this manuscript we report the effects of using mepolizumab in patients with CF and type 2 inflammation. Results We present three patients with CF (63, 34 and 24 year of age) and personal history of asthma, who displayed significant eosinophilic inflammation and high total serum IgE concentrations (type 2 inflammation) who were treated with mepolizumab. All three patients were colonized with multiple organisms including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aspergillus fumigatus and tested positive for specific IgE to multiple allergens. We examined the effect of mepolizumab on patients’ lung function (FEV1), blood markers of type 2 inflammation, systemic corticosteroid use and frequency of CF exacerbations. One patient had a substantial increase in lung function after starting mepolizumab and all three patients had a substantial benefit in regards to reduced oral CCS use. While none of the patients showed significant changes in the exacerbation rates there was markedly reduced requirements for oral CCS with exacerbations. In addition, mepolizumab had a positive effect on type 2 inflammatory markers, reducing markers of allergic inflammation in all 3 patients. Conclusions Mepolizumab appears to have a positive effect on clinical course in patients with CF presenting with a type 2 phenotype characterized by allergic sensitization and hyper-eosinophilia.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Allergen specific IgG4 levels have been monitored as a surrogate marker for the tolerance inducing effect of subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) in many studies. Its accuracy at group level has been well established, but IgG4 has not yet found its place in the daily care of immunotherapy patients. Methods Intralymphatic immunotherapy (ILIT) is a novel route for allergy vaccination against pollen allergy, where an ultrasound-guided injection of 1000 SQ-U Alutard is given directly into a groin lymph node. The suggested standard dosing so far has been one injection with 4 weeks in-between. In total 3000 SQ-U with the treatment completed in 2 months. IgG4 was measured with Immulite technique and rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms were estimated with daily online questionnaires. Mann–Whitney U-test and Wilcoxon Signed Rank test were applied for comparisons between groups and within groups, respectively. Results The present study demonstrates that a single, preseason ILIT booster of 1000 SQ-U Alutard 5-grasses ® , re-increases the allergen specific timothy-IgG4 levels, in patients already treated with ILIT before the previous pollen season. It also shows the feasibility of the ILIT-route for allergy vaccination of rhinitis patients, with or without concomitant asthma, with low degree of side effects and reconfirms high and sustained patient satisfaction. Conclusions It is tempting to suggest that the allergen specific IgG4 levels can be used to build an intuitive algorithm for future clinical guidance of ILIT patients.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, non-specific inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with unknown etiology. The lack of specific clinical manifestations, standard diagnostic criteria, objective and accurate indicators to the severity of the disease and the efficacy of the treatment, often results in difficulties in diagnosis and timely treatment of UC. Therefore, there is a need to develop a clinically suitable serum biomarker assay with high specificity and sensitivity. Objective and methods To explore the significance of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and anti-saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) in the diagnosis, differential diagnosis and treatment assessment in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Serum levels of ANCA-IgG, ASCA-IgA and ASCA-IgG were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 105 UC patients, 52 non-UC patients and 100 healthy controls. Results (1) Both the ANCA-IgG level and its positive rate in UC patients were significantly higher than those in non-UC controls and healthy controls ( p &lt; 0.01). However, the levels of ASCA-IgA, ASCA-IgG and the positive rates in UC patients had no statistical differences when compared with those in non-UC controls or healthy controls ( p &gt; 0.05). (2) The sensitivity of ANCA + and ANCA + /ASCA − in detecting UC patients was 61.90% and 55.24%, respectively, whereas the specificity was 91.45% and 94.08%, respectively. The sensitivity of ASCA + and ASCA + /ANCA − in non-UC disease controls was 5.33% and 3.85%, respectively, and specificity was 83.9% and 88.78%, respectively. (3) When UC patients were grouped into mild, moderate or severe subtypes, the ANCA-IgG levels were correlated with the severity of UC, and the differences of the ANCA-IgG levels were statistically different among the three subtypes ( p &lt; 0.05). There was no correlation between the levels of ANCA-IgG and the disease locations of UC. Conclusions (1) Serum levels of ANCA may be useful in the diagnosis of UC. (2) Dynamic quantitation of ANCA-IgG levels may be helpful in determining the severity of UC and therefore, may guide treatment of UC.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Chronic urticaria (CU) is defined as recurrent urticaria lasting for more than 6 weeks. Objectives We aimed to characterize the phenotypes of patients with CU refractory to standard dose anti-H1 antihistamine treatment and search for clinical predictors of poor disease control. Methods Retrospective collection of data regarding clinical characteristics, comorbidities, treatment, and disease control of all adult refractory CU patients presenting to the Allergy and Immunology Department during 1 year. Results Sixty-one adult patients were included, 74% females, average age 44.5 years (18 to 84 years old). Most patients (78.7%) had initiated CU less than 1 year before enrolment. Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) accounted for 55.7% of the patients, CSU associated with chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU) as a comorbidity for 44.3%, and angioedema was present in 55.7%. Medically-confirmed psychiatric disorders were present in 78.7%. Complementary diagnostic tests were performed in cases with more severe presentation (UAS7 ≥ 28 and/or UCT &lt; 12) or with longer evolution (&gt; 1 year), corresponding to 42 tested patient. Evidence for autoimmunity (positive anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies, anti-nuclear antibodies or autologous serum test) was found in 45.2% (n = 19/42), and high C-reactive protein was present in 14.3% (n = 6/42), half of these also had positive antinuclear antibodies. Forty-six patients (75.4%) had at least one significant exacerbation, requiring medical appointment, emergency room, hospitalization or job absenteeism. The number of exacerbations correlated with the presence of angioedema (p = 0.022), with a recent diagnosis (&lt; 1 year), and with higher UAS7 severity (p = 0.006). Although ClndU was associated with poor symptom control (p = 0.022), it was also associated with less exacerbations requiring medical observation or hospitalization (p = 0.015). All patients were using antihistamines and 21.3% (n = 13) of them were also under treatment with omalizumab, ciclosporine or montelukast for disease control. Conclusions Autoimmunity can affect about half of the patients with severe or long-term CU. UAS7 and angioedema are associated with disease exacerbations. UAS7 and UCT presented unequal accuracy, with UAS7 better associating with the occurrence of exacerbations and treatment doses. Patients with refractory CU frequently present psychiatric disorders. Accurate diagnostic tests, namely autoimmune parameters and inflammatory markers, should be recommended in some individual cases.",

    "abstract": "Food protein-induced enterocolitis (FPIES), an entity previously thought to only affect children, has been increasingly described in adults. In this study, we report a Canadian cohort of 19 adolescents and adults with recurrent non-immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated gastrointestinal symptoms after crustacean ingestion, consistent with FPIES.We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients in an outpatient allergy clinic from January 2005 to May 2020. Electronic records were searched using keywords for crustaceans and for symptoms consistent with FPIES. We included patients with gastrointestinal symptoms specifically to crustaceans on more than one occasion, who were 14 years or older at the time of index reaction. Exclusion criteria included symptoms suggestive of an IgE-mediated anaphylactic reaction or a likely alternative diagnosis. We identified 19 patients for our cohort who met the criteria.Our cohort was 68.4% female (13) and 32.6% (6) male. The average age at first reaction to crustaceans was 34 years old with a range of 14-68 years (median = 28 years; IQR = 32 years). Time from ingestion to beginning of symptoms ranged from 3 min to 6.5 h, with an average of 2.8 h (median = 2 h; IQR = 3.25 h). Duration of reaction ranged from less than a minute to over 48 h, with a mean of 9.4 h (median = 4 h; IQR = 7.75 h). Patients had 4.8 reactions on average; however, number of reactions ranged from 2 to 12.5 (median = 3, IQR = 3). All patients identified a \"trigger\" food in the crustacean group, and 12 subjects identified additional reactions to other seafood.This case series will better characterize and advance our understanding of this disease entity in adults. There are key differences in the presentation of FPIES in adults compared to children, namely female predominance, difference in solid food trigger, and unpredictable time course. Future studies are needed to examine the pathophysiology and natural history of adult FPIES. Specific guidelines should be developed for the diagnosis and management in adults.retrospectively registered.",

    "abstract": "Beta-lactam allergy is reported in 5-10% of children in North America, but up to 94-97% of patients are deemed not allergic after allergist assessment. The utility of standardized skin testing for penicillin allergy in the pediatric population has been recently questioned. Oral drug challenges when appropriate, are preferred over skin testing, and can definitively rule out immediate, IgE-mediated drug allergy. To our knowledge, this is the only pediatric study to assess the reliability of a penicillin allergy stratification tool using a paper and electronic clinical algorithm. By using an electronic algorithm, we identified 61 patients (of 95 deemed not allergic by gold standard allergist decision) as low risk for penicillin allergy, with no false negatives and without the need for allergist assessment or skin testing. In this study, we demonstrate that an electronic algorithm can be used by various pediatric clinicians when evaluating possible penicillin allergy to reliably identify low risk patients. We identified the electronic algorithm was superior to the paper version, capturing an even higher percentage of low risk patients than the paper version. By developing an electronic algorithm to accurately assess penicillin allergy risk based on appropriate history, without the need for diagnostic testing or allergist assessment, we can empower non-allergist health care professionals to safely de-label low risk pediatric patients and assist in alleviating subspecialty wait times for penicillin allergy assessment.",

    "abstract": "The Environmental Exposure Unit (EEU) in Kingston, Ontario, Canada is a controlled allergen challenge facility (CACF) that has been previously clinically validated for the use of ragweed and grass pollen in clinical studies. In this study we aim to validate the use of birch pollen to challenge allergic participants. A total of 59 volunteers were screened and 38 birch allergic participants and ten non-allergics completed the study, outside of tree pollen season. Participants had to have a minimum of 2-year history of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis during the typical tree pollen season and have a positive skin prick test to birch allergen ≥5 mm from the control. Qualified participants were exposed to birch (Betula pendula) pollen for 4 h in the EEU and recorded their symptoms of sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itch which comprised the total nasal symptom score (TNSS), as well as itchy/watery eyes, red/burning eyes and itching of ears/palate/throat which along with the TNSS comprised the total rhinoconjunctival symptom score (TRSS) along with Peak Nasal Inspiratory Flow (PNIF) at baseline and at 30 min intervals for the duration of exposure, then hourly for up to 12 h from the start of exposure. Allergic participants reported a gradual rise in TNSS and TRSS, reaching a mean and standard error of the mean of 7.08 ± 0.45 and 11.58 ± 0.93 respectively by 180 min from the start of exposure. Symptoms gradually declined to near baseline values following departing from the unit, reaching 1.9 and 2.7 by 450 min. Allergic participants reported significantly higher TNSS than non-allergics starting from 30 min (p < 0.01, two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni corrections), maintaining maximum significance from 60 to 300 min (p < 0.0001) and losing significance by 420 min. TRSS and PNIF followed similar trends as those seen with TNSS. Participants were phenotyped using previously published definitions using the TNSS into Early Phase Responders (EPR, 57.8 %), protracted EPR (pEPR, 39.5 %), and Dual Phase Responders (DPR, 2.7 %). The EEU can competently challenge birch allergic participants and achieve statistically significant changes in symptoms and nasal airflow, while such changes are not reported in non-allergic controls.

    "abstract": "Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is the treatment target of omalizumab, a monoclonal antibody indicated in the treatment of severe allergic asthma. Long-term variability of serum total IgE (sIgEtot) in asthmatics remains poorly documented. In this prospective study, sIgEtot levels were measured over 1 year at 7 time points in 41 severe asthmatics treated with high-dose of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β2 agonists. 33 patients were atopic based on at least one positive RAST to common aeroallergens. Patients were divided into three groups according to their baseline sIgEtot level: low (< 76 IU/mL; n = 10), intermediate (76–700 IU/mL; n = 20) or high (> 700 IU/mL; n = 11). Patients also completed the six-item Juniper Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ6). The sIgEtot variability and factors predictive for this variability were studied, as well as ACQ6 outcomes. The variation in sIgEtot level was mostly the consequence of between patient-variability, which represented 96%, 71% and 96% of the total variability in the low, intermediate and high sIgEtot subgroups, respectively. The residual within-patient variability was therefore limited. In 10/41 patients, sIgEtot levels increased or decreased, for at least one visit, beyond the predefined range of the subgroups to which they were assigned (< 76 IU/mL; 76–700 IU/mL; > 700 IU/mL). There was a significant but weak correlation between sIgEtot and ACQ6 score over all time points (r = 0.15, p = 0.02), but sIgEtot failed to associate with severe exacerbation. sIgEtot decreased by 3% with any additional year of age for the whole group (p = 0.01) and increased by 5% per one unit of allergen exposure score in atopic patients (p = 0.002). In severe asthmatics, limited within-patient variability of sIgEtot levels was observed over 1 year as opposed to marked between-subject variability. sIgEtot decreases with age. Variation in sIgEtot weakly associates with asthma control but not with exacerbation.",

However, WRA is significantly underreported and the median time to diagnosis is 4 years. The objective of this review is to identify the gaps in awareness and reporting of WRA and identify gaps in current knowledge translation strategies for chronic disease in general, and asthma specifically. This will identify reasons for delays in WRA diagnosis, as well inform suggestions to improve knowledge translation strategies for dissemination and implementation of WRA prevention and management guidelines.Non-systematic literature reviews were conducted on PubMed with a focus on work-related asthma screening and diagnosis, and knowledge translation or translational medicine research in asthma and chronic disease. In total, 3571 titles and abstracts were reviewed with no restriction on date published. Of those, 207 were relevant and fully read. Another 37 articles were included and reviewed after citation reviews of articles from the initial search and from suggestions from editors. In total, 63 articles were included in the final review.Patients, employers, and healthcare professionals lack awareness and under-report WRA which contribute to the delayed diagnosis of WRA, primarily through lack of education, stigma associated with WRA, and lack of awareness and screening in primary care. Knowledge translation strategies for asthma research typically involve the creation of guidelines for diagnosis of the disease, asthma care plans and tools for education and management. While there are some prevention programs in place for certain industries, gaps in knowledge translation strategies including lack of screening tools currently available for WRA, poor education of employers and physicians in identifying WRA, and education of patients is often done post-diagnosis and focuses on management rather than prevention or screening.Future knowledge translation strategies should focus on educating employees and employers well before potential exposure to agents associated with WRA and screening for WRA in primary care to enable health care providers to recognize and diagnose WRA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Polyvalent Mechanical Bacterial Lysate (PMBL®) contains antigens of bacteria responsible for respiratory infections. PMBL® has been proven to reduce the number of respiratory infections, and in its use, immunological benefits have been seen in allergic patients. PMBL® activates both innate and specific immune responses. The lysate induces dendritic cells, T and B lymphocytes and IgA secretion, as well as the production of antibodies directed against administered bacterial antigens. Moreover, it increases the response against other bacteria and viruses. The immunologic mechanism of lysate’s action is not yet clearly determined. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of PMBL® on T cells in children with allergic asthma. Methods This study was a part of the EOLIA study. Herein, 49 children with allergic asthma and house dust mites allergy were included: 21 in PMBL® and 28 in the Placebo group, both, drug and placebo were administered sublingually. The tests were done at baseline and 12 weeks after the last tablet intake. The lymphocytes CD45+, lymphocytes T CD3+, CD3+CD25+, CD3+CD69+, Th CD3+CD4+, CD4+CD25+, CD4+CD25+ high, CD4+CD69+, Treg CD4+CD25+FOXP3, Tc CD3+CD8+, CD8+CD25+, CD8+CD69+, NK-like T CD3+CD16+CD56+ and NK cells CD3−CD16+CD56+ were described. Results At baseline, no significant differences between groups relative to blood count cells were observed, except for eosinophils. After 12 weeks, we observed an increase of T lymphocytes count. In addition, CD4+CD25+FOXP3+, CD8+ and CD3−CD16+CD56+ and (insignificantly) Th count increased. However, CD69+ and CD25+ subset of CD3+ significantly decreased.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare but serious disorder associated with a multifaceted burden of illness including a high prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Despite recent efforts to clarify the psychosocial implications of HAE, important gaps still remain. The aim of this study was to characterize the psychosocial burden associated with HAE types 1 and 2. Methods Type 1 or 2 HAE patients (n = 17), aged 19 years or older, completed the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the DSM-5 cross cutting measures to identify psychiatric symptomatology, Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire (AE-QoL) and the Short-Form 36-Item Health Survey version 2 (SF-36v2) to assess disease-related and generic HRQoL respectively, and the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI) to measure impact on work productivity and daily activities. Data analyses were conducted using SPSS statistical software (Version 25.0; IBM, Armonk, NY). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize continuous demographics and clinical characteristics and outcomes of interest while frequency distributions were used for categorical variables. T tests were used to compare SF-36v2 domain scores to Canadian norms and sex differences in scale scores. Results Depression [DASS-21 score = 6.8 ± 10.2; n = 12 (71%)] anxiety [DASS-21 score = 6.2 ± 8.2; n = 13 (76%)] and stress [DASS-21 score = 10 ± 10.2; n = 13 (76%)] were prevalent. Other psychiatric symptoms warranting inquiry included mania (n = 14, 82.4%), anger (n = 14, 82.4%), sleep disturbances (n = 13, 76.5%), somatic symptoms (n = 11, 64.7%) and impaired personality functioning (n = 9, 52.9%). Mean AE-QoL score was 39 ± 18.2. Mean SF-36v2 domain scores were significantly lower than Canadian normative data for the entire sample (p &lt; 0.05). Impairment in work productivity was minimal; mean activity impairment was 20.6% ± 21.1% [n = 11 (64.7%)]. Female participants reported significantly greater HAE-related stress [DASS; t(15) = − 2.2, p = 0.04], greater HAE-related fears [AEQoL; t(5.6) = − 2.7, p = 0.04), and lower SF-36v2 domain scores than male patients. Conclusions Study findings offer specific, valuable insight into the psychosocial burden of HAE with the potential to improve clinical management of HAE. Best practices for effective management of HAE should include providing holistic care to address the psychosocial and mental health of HAE patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background While many studies of effective hereditary angioedema (HAE) therapy have demonstrated improved health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using validated instruments, specific reasons behind the improved scores have never been investigated using qualitative methods. A non-interventional, qualitative research study was designed to investigate the reasons for improvements in HRQoL while using effective prophylaxis, in this case subcutaneous C1INH (C1INH[SC]) replacement therapy. Methods Adult patients with HAE-C1INH type 1 or 2 who had been using C1INH(SC) for ≥ 3 consecutive months were recruited through four HAE specialty practices in the US to participate in a 60-min phone interview performed by a trained qualitative research specialist (ICON plc) using a semi-structured interview guide with open-ended questions developed with the Angioedema Quality of Life (AE-QoL) items in mind. Interview transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis methods to identify concepts (specific symptoms/impacts) and themes (higher-level categories grouping related concepts). A cross-mapping exercise was performed between interview-identified concepts and items included in the AE-QoL. Results Fourteen patients were interviewed and included in the analysis (age range, 28–82 years [mean 47.5 years]; 64% female; 93% white). In 10 interviews, patients mentioned having no or nearly no HAE attacks, no longer feeling limited by HAE, less HAE-related anxiety/worry and depression, an improved ability to travel, fewer emergency room/hospital visits, and ease of administration of C1INH(SC), including not requiring assistance from others. Other commonly expressed concepts included: increased feelings of confidence, independence, optimism, and normalcy; less absence from work/school; better productivity; improved sleep and energy; healthier family relationships; and improved cognition. While all AE-QoL items emerged from patient interviews, a number of identified concepts were not addressed by the AE-QoL, including sensitivity to various potential attack-triggers (e.g., stress/anxiety, sports), attack frequency, not having to cancel social plans, improvements in ability to perform day-to-day tasks, and a lower burden from medical visits. Conclusions From these interviews, a large number of common themes and concepts emerged: a greater sense of freedom and normalcy, increased productivity, and improved interpersonal relationships while using convenient and effective prophylaxis. These findings provide insights into real-world experiences and the many facets of HRQoL that are important to patients with HAE-C1INH.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Increased intestinal permeability, either due to the exposure to antigens in asthmatic patients or due to a barrier defect, plays a critical role in susceptibility to environmental allergens. House dust mite allergy occurs more commonly than any other type of allergy among Egyptian asthmatic patients. Aim To assess the relation between serum zonulin level as a marker of increased intestinal permeability and the severity of house dust mite allergic asthma. Methods A case–control study which included 48 patients with house dust mite allergic asthma and 48 healthy control subjects attending the Allergy and Immunology Unit, Microbiology and Immunology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University. Results A statistically significant difference was detected between the two studied groups with respect to serum IgE and serum zonulin levels (p ˂ 0.001 and ˂ 0.001, respectively). The mean serum zonulin was equal to 258.3 ± 153.01 ng/ml in the asthmatic group and 80 ± 13 ng/ml in the control group. Serum zonulin level significantly increased with the increase of asthma severity (p ˂ 0.001). The cut off value of serum zonulin was ≥ 198 ng/ml, and the area under the curve was 0.76. It displayed sensitivity equal to 80% and specificity equal to 71.4%. Its negative predictive value was equal to 83.3%. Conclusion Intestinal barrier dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of allergic asthma. Serum zonulin level reflects an increase in intestinal permeability. Zonulin acts as prognostic factor of severity in asthma. Correction of the gut barrier defect may have a potential positive prognostic effect in asthma.",

She also had cardiac involvement (myocarditis, pericardial effusion, and diastolic dysfunction), gastrointestinal symptoms, and peripheral neuropathy. The condition was refractory to treatment with systemic corticosteroids, intravenous cyclophosphamide, and mepolizumab, but the thrombosis and associated acute cardiac failure, as well as the cardiac and gastrointestinal symptoms and multiple polyneuropathy, improved after a switch to rituximab. However, the heart failure did not improve sufficiently and the patient continued to need inhaled oxygen at 1 L/min and asthma exacerbations occurred. We then swapped the patient's mepolizumab treatment for dupilumab. Not only did she have no further asthma attacks after switching to dupilumab, but also her vasculitis symptoms improved. Oxygen therapy was discontinued as the heart failure improved 5 months after starting the dupilumab.This may be the first case report of the successful treatment by rituximab of pulmonary thromboembolism associated with EGPA. In addition, in this patient, treatment with dupilumab was effective not only for the asthma symptoms but also for the symptoms of vasculitis and heart failure.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Immunoglobulin replacement therapy is the standard-of-care treatment for patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases who have impaired antibody production and function. Clinicians and patients may consider intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) options, and each route may offer different benefits for the individual. IVIG requires fewer infusion sites and less frequent infusions than some formulations of SCIG. However, SCIG does not require venous access, is associated with fewer systemic adverse infusion reactions than IVIG, and can independently be self-administered at home. Importantly, tailoring treatment experiences to the needs of the individual may improve treatment adherence and quality of life for patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases who often rely on long-term or lifelong treatment. This review aims to educate United States (US) healthcare providers on the administration process of SCIG, with a focus on more concentrated formulations of SCIG and facilitated SCIG. It provides practical guidance on initiating, optimizing, and monitoring SCIG therapy. The advantages and disadvantages of the different treatment options are also presented for discussion between the patient and clinician.",

Here, the perspective of patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiency diseases (PID and SID, respectively) receiving IVIg and SCIg was evaluated, in terms of treatment satisfaction, accounting for treatment history, using Association des Patients Immunodéficients du Québec (APIQ) survey data. Methods The online APIQ survey (shared October 2020–March 2021) of patients with immunodeficiencies in Canada contained 101 questions on: Ig use, history, and detailed infusion characteristics; as well as structured patient-reported outcomes such as treatment satisfaction (via TSQM-9), symptom state (via PASS), general health perception (via GHP), and physical and mental function (via PROMIS). Adult respondents (≥ 18 years old) currently using Ig were compared by their current Ig infusion method (IVIg or SCIg cohort) overall, and in a sub-analysis, the IVIg cohort was compared with the SCIg cohort after stratification by respondents who started SCIg when naïve to Ig (‘SCIg naïve’) or with previous IVIg experience (‘SCIg switch’). Results In total, 54 respondents currently used IVIg and 242 used SCIg. The average duration per infusion of a weekly SCIg infusion was significantly shorter compared with the average duration of a 3–4 weekly IVIg infusion (p &lt; 0.001). The SCIg cohort was associated with significantly higher scores for the TSQM-9 effectiveness domain compared with the IVIg cohort. The scores for TSQM-9 convenience and global satisfaction domains were similar in the two cohorts. The SCIg cohort was also associated with a significantly higher proportion of respondents who were in an acceptable symptom state and a lower proportion who reported very poor or poor perception of health compared with the IVIg cohort. Further, the SCIg naïve subgroup was associated with significantly higher TSQM-9 effectiveness and convenience domain scores compared with the IVIg cohort, while there was no significant difference between the SCIg switch subgroup and the IVIg cohort in terms of convenience . Conclusions A better understanding of how different IgRT administration methods impact treatment experience and satisfaction may assist with informed treatment decision making and ultimately further improvements in patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Asthma is a common multifactorial disease affecting millions worldwide. The Barker hypothesis postulates an association between later onset disease risk and energy exposure in utero. Birth weight corrected for gestational age is better for measuring the infant size, which reflects energy exposure in utero. Findings on asthma and birth weight corrected for gestational age have been inconclusive. We conducted a meta-analysis to further clarify the relationship between birth weight corrected for gestational age and later onset asthma. Methods A systematic literature search of the PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, and Scopus databases up to January 2021 was conducted. The subject terms were used as follows: “asthma”, “allerg*”, “respiratory”, “birth weight”, “gestational age”, “birth outcomes”, “intrauterine growth retardation”, and “fetal growth restriction”. Results We included 12 articles with data from a total of 6,713,596 people. Compared with non-SGA infants, infants small for gestation age (SGA) were not associated with an increased risk of asthma (OR = 1.07; 95% CI 0.94–1.21). However, in the subgroup analysis, we found an increased risk of later onset asthma among SGA in studies conducted in Asia, with a large sample size, and defined asthma through medical records rather than questionnaires. Large for gestational age (LGA) was not associated with an increased risk of asthma when non-LGA or appropriated for gestational age (AGA) infants were used as the reference (OR = 1.02; 95% CI 0.90–1.16; OR = 1.01; 95% CI 0.88–1.15). Conclusion These results indicated that neither SGA nor LGA was associated with an increased risk of asthma. However, considering the limitations of the research, these results should be interpreted with caution.",

In this study, we further explored the underlying mechanism by constructing an AD mouse model.Female BALB/c mice were randomly divided into four groups (n = 10/group). The AD mouse model was established by 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene induction with repeated ovalbumin challenge. AS1517499 and corn oil were used as treatment interventions. The features of airway inflammation, remodeling, and hyperactivity were analyzed.Active use of AS1517499 in AD mice effectively reduced Th2-related cytokine levels, alleviated airway eosinophil and lymphocyte infiltration, and regulated GATA3/Foxp3 levels and subepithelial collagen deposition. These changes might be due to specific blockade of the STAT6 signaling pathway.AS1517499 could partially block the association between AD and asthma by specifically inhibiting the STAT6 signaling pathway.",

Moreover, mechanisms of BT efficacy are still largely unknown. We sought to determine BT efficacy and to identify potential mechanisms of response.This retrospective cohort study evaluated clinical outcomes in 27 patients with severe asthma: 13 with T2-high and 14 with T2-low endotype. Expression levels of 20 genes were compared by real-time PCR in bronchial biopsies performed at the third BT session versus baseline. Clinical response was measured based on Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) score < 1.5, asthma exacerbations < 2, oral corticosteroids reduction of at least 50% at 12 months post-BT. Patients were classified as responders when they had at least 2 of 3 outcome measures.81% of patients were defined as responders. BT induced a reduction in alpha smooth muscle actin (ACTA2) and an increase in CD68, fibroblast activation protein-alpha (FAP), alpha-1 and alpha-2 type I collagen (COL1A1, COL1A2) gene expression in the majority of patients. A higher reduction in ubiquitin carboxy-terminal-hydrolase L1 (PGP9.5) mRNA correlated with a better response based on Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ). Lower changes in CD68 and FAP mRNAs correlated with a better response based on ACQ. Lower levels of occludin (OCLN), CD68, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), higher levels of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) and lower changes in CD68 and CTGF mRNAs were observed in patients who had less than 2 exacerbations post-BT. Lower levels of COL1A2 at baseline were observed in patients who had ACQ < 1.5 at 12 months post-BT.BT is effective irrespective of the asthma endotypes and seems associated with airway remodelling. Quantification of OCLN, CD68, CTGF, SLPI, COL1A2 mRNAs could be useful to identify patients with better results.The study protocol was approved by the Local Ethics Committee (Azienda USL-IRCCS of Reggio Emilia-Comitato Etico Area Vasta Nord of Emilia Romagna; protocol number: 2019/0014076) and all the patients provided written informed consent before participating in the study.",

    "abstract": "The Rosaceae family includes fruits, such as peach, apple, Japanese apricot, cherry (Prunoideae subfamily), and strawberry (Rosoideae subfamily). The allergens responsible for Rosaceae fruit allergies have been reported to include Bet v 1 and profilin, which mainly cause oral symptoms, and lipid transfer protein (LTP). Recently, gibberellin-regulated protein (GRP) has been identified as an allergen that induces generalized symptoms in peach-, orange-, and plum-related allergies. Most patients with food allergies induced by GRP show allergic symptoms accompanied by cofactors, such as exercise or drugs. To date, there are very few reports of generalized symptoms induced by strawberry. We evaluated the reactivity of strawberry GRP in a 15-year-old boy who was confirmed to have generalized symptoms induced by strawberry with exercise using an oral food challenge test (OFCT). The patient's serum exhibited a strong positive reaction to strawberry GRP but not to peach GRP or peach LTP. The patient's basophils reacted to strawberry and peach GRP but not to peach LTP. Strawberry GRP may be a causative component for strawberry with exercise-induced generalized symptoms in this patient. This is the first study to investigate the role of GRP in strawberry with cofactor-induced allergic symptoms. Further epidemiological and clinical researches are necessary to improve diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for patients with strawberry allergy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are important treatment options in obese patients with type 2 diabetes. To date, few immediate allergic reactions due to GLP-1 receptor agonists were reported. One report revealed that a patient with a level 1 anaphylaxis according to Brighton Criteria due to an exendin based GLP-1 receptor agonist was able to tolerate liraglutide (Human GLP-1 analogue), the alternative GLP-1 receptor agonist. Since exenatide is the only available GLP-1 receptor agonist covered by insurance in Turkey, a drug desensitization protocol, the only therapeutic method in hypersensitivity reactions used in case of absence of an alternative drug, was considered. Here, we report a successful desensitization protocol for the first time in two obese diabetic patients with an immediate hypersensitivity to exenatide. Case presentation The first patient was a 47 year-old female. She was referred to our outpatient allergy clinic because of a generalized urticaria developed within minutes after the last dose, following a week of an exenatide BID 5 mcg/20 mcl treatment. Although the reaction was sudden onset, it did not meet the Brighton Criteria of anaphylaxis. The second patient was a 46 year-old female. She had a large local immediate injection site reaction that appeared 15 min following an exenatide BID 5 mcg/20 mcl injection. The injection site reaction was not accompanied by a systemic allergic reaction. We performed desensitization with exenatide to two patients who need GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment. Protocol was completed in 7 steps in approximately 3 h, with the aim of reaching the daily dosage of exenatide. Throughout this process, we observed that both cases tolerated the protocol without any complaints or complications. Following the protocol, the patients safely tolerated the treatment for 3 months. Conclusions We present the first successful desensitization protocol to exenatide in both local and/or systemic immediate hypersensitivity reactions and indicate the importance of desensitization in patients who do not have alternative therapies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Viable knowledge translation (KT) strategies are increasingly sought to improve asthma diagnosis, particularly in primary care. Despite this understanding, practical KT tools to support primary care practitioners are not widely available. Electronic medical records (EMRs) offer an opportunity to optimize the diagnosis and surveillance of chronic diseases such as asthma, and support quality improvement initiatives that increase adherence to guideline-recommended care. This review aims to describe the current state of electronic KT electronic tools (eTools) and surveillance systems for asthma and identify opportunities to increase adherence to asthma diagnostic guidelines by implementing digital KT eTools. Methods Systematic literature searches were conducted on Ovid MEDLINE that included the search terms: asthma, asthma diagnosis, asthma surveillance, electronic health records, translational medical research, quality improvement, professional practice gaps, and primary health care published in the previous 10 years. In total, the searches returned 971 articles, 163 of which were considered relevant and read in full. An additional 28 articles were considered after reviewing the references from selected articles. 75 articles were included in this narrative review. Results Established KT eTools for asthma such as electronic questionnaires, computerized clinical decision support systems (CDSS), chronic disease surveillance networks, and asthma registries have been effective in improving the quality of asthma diagnosis and care. As well, chronic disease surveillance systems, severe asthma registries, and workplace asthma surveillance systems have demonstrated success in monitoring asthma outcomes. However, lack of use and/or documentation of objective measures of lung function, challenges in identifying asthma cases in EMRs, and limitations of data sources have created barriers in the development of KT eTools. Existing digital KT eTools that overcome these data quality limitations could provide an opportunity to improve adherence to best-practice guidelines for asthma diagnosis and management. Conclusion Future initiatives in the development of KT eTools for asthma care should focus on strategies that assist healthcare providers in accurately diagnosing and documenting cases of asthma. A digital asthma surveillance system could support adherence to best-practice guidelines of asthma diagnosis and surveillance by prompting use of objective methods of confirmation to confirm an asthma diagnosis within the EMR.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Scientific evidence on patients with multimorbid type 2 asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) from a united airways disease (UAD) perspective remains scarce, despite the frequent coexistence of these entities. We aimed to generate expert consensus-based recommendations for the management of UAD patients. Methods Using a two-round Delphi method, Spanish expert allergists, pulmonologists and otolaryngologists expressed their agreement on 32 statements (52 items) on a 9-point Likert scale, classified as appropriate (median 7–9), uncertain (4–6) or inappropriate (1–3). Consensus was considered when at least two-thirds of the panel scored within the range containing the median. Results A panel of 30 experts reached consensus on the appropriateness of 43 out of the 52 (82.7%) items. The usefulness of certain biomarkers (tissue and peripheral blood eosinophil count, serum total IgE, and fraction of exhaled nitric oxide [FeNO]) in the identification and follow-up of type 2 inflammation, and assessment of the response to biologics, were agreed. Some of these biomarkers were also associated with disease severity and/or recurrence after endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). Consensus was achieved on treatment strategies related to the prescription of anti-IL-4/IL-13 or anti-IgE agents, concomitant treatment with systemic corticosteroids, and combining or switching to biologics with a different mechanism of action, considering a number of UAD clinical scenarios. Conclusion We provide expert-based recommendations to assist in clinical decision-making for the management of patients with multimorbid type 2 asthma and CRSwNP. Specific clinical trials and real-world studies focusing on the single-entity UAD are required to address controversial items.",

    "abstract": "Abstract H. pylori is a gram-negative bacterium that is usually acquired in childhood and can persistently colonize the gastric mucosa of humans, affecting approximately half of the world’s population. In recent years, the prevalence of H. pylori infection has steadily reduced while the risk of allergic diseases has steadily climbed. As a result, epidemiological research indicates a strong negative association between the two. Moreover, numerous experimental studies have demonstrated that eradicating H. pylori increases the risk of allergic diseases. Hence, it is hypothesized that H. pylori infection may act as a safeguard against allergic diseases. The hygiene hypothesis, alterations in gut microbiota, the development of tolerogenic dendritic cells, and helper T cells could all be involved in H. pylori’s ability to protect against asthma. Furthermore, Studies on mice models have indicated that H. pylori and its extracts are crucial in the management of asthma. We reviewed the in-depth studies on the most recent developments in the relationship between H. pylori infection and allergic diseases, and we discussed potential mechanisms of the infection’s protective effect on asthma in terms of microbiota and immunity. We also investigated the prospect of the application of H. pylori and its related components in asthma, so as to provide a new perspective for the prevention or treatment of allergic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a paranasal sinus inflammatory disease and is divided into two subgroups defined as CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP). CRSwNP displays a T helper (Th)2 biased phenotype, and based on sensitivity or tolerance to aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), is further subdivided into Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) and non-AERD groups. Considering the challenge of diagnosis and treatment in patients with CRSwNP, particularly the AERD subtype, and the significance of endotyping in these patients, we examined the immune profile and endotyping based on gene expression analysis in the AERD and the non-AERD groups of patients with CRSwNP. Material and method In this study, 21 patients were enrolled and were categorized into AERD ( N = 10) and non-AERD ( N = 11) groups based on their sensitivity to aspirin. After the special washing period, nasal polyps were biopsied in both groups, and the infiltration of eosinophils, neutrophils, plasma cells, and lymphocytes was compared between the AERD and the non-AERD groups. Also, gene expression levels of transcription factors including Tbet, GATA3, RoRγt, and FoxP3 and inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)1β, IL1RAP (IL1 receptor accessory protein), IL2, IL4, IL5, IL10, IL13, IL17, TNFα, and IFNγ were investigated by quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Statistical analyses were performed using analytical tests including Kolmogorov–Smirnov, Mann-Whitney, and T-test. A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The mean ± SD age of the studied groups was 37 ± 8.7 years old (21–50) for the AERD, and 40.4 ± 7.7 years old (31–52) for the non-AERD. LMS/EPOS/SNOT scores and pulmonary function tests showed no difference between the two groups. Serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels were found to be higher in patients with AERD ( p = 0.04), however, the peripheral blood counts of eosinophils were comparable in the two groups. In the histopathologic analysis, the AERD group showed higher percentages of eosinophils ( p = 0.04), neutrophils ( p = 0.04), and plasma cells ( p = 0.04) than the non-AERD group. Additionally, the gene expression levels of GATA3 ( p = 0.001), IL4 ( p = 0.04), IL5 ( p = 0.007), and IL17 ( p = 0.03) were significantly higher in the AERD than the non-AERD groups. Conclusion Higher gene expression levels of GATA3, IL4, IL5, and IL17 were observed in the AERD group compared with the non-AERD group. These findings point to distinct patterns of inflammation in patients with AERD, with a predominance of Th2 inflammation.",

Objectives This study aims to elucidate the genetic relationship between atopy, allergies, and alopecia areata (AA) using Mendelian randomization. We hypothesize that atopic and allergic conditions contribute to the genetic predisposition of AA. Methods We analyzed extensive genetic data from Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) involving over one million individuals. This analysis focused on assessing the genetic correlation between AA and various allergic conditions, including hay fever, eczema, asthma, and allergies to pollen, dust, and cats. The inverse variance weighted method served as our primary analytical tool, complemented by sensitivity analyses to verify the robustness of our results. Results Our findings reveal a significant genetic correlation between atopy/allergies and an increased risk of AA. Notably, strong associations were observed for hay fever, eczema, asthma, and specific allergies (pollen, dust, and cats). The sensitivity analyses corroborated these associations, reinforcing the reliability of our primary results. Conclusions This study provides compelling genetic evidence of an association between atopic and allergic conditions and the development of AA. These findings suggest that individuals with such conditions may benefit from enhanced surveillance for early signs of AA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common, chronic skin disorder that can significantly impact the quality of life (QoL) of affected individuals as well as their families. Although the pathogenesis of the disorder is not yet completely understood, it appears to result from the complex interplay between defects in skin barrier function, environmental and infectious agents, and immune dysregulation. There are no diagnostic tests for AD; therefore, the diagnosis is based on specific clinical criteria that take into account the patient’s history and clinical manifestations. Successful management of the disorder requires a multifaceted approach that involves education, optimal skin care practices, anti-inflammatory treatment with topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) and/or phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitors, the management of pruritus, and the treatment of skin infections. Systemic immunosuppressive agents may also be used, but are generally reserved for severe flare-ups or more difficult-to-control disease. Newer systemic agents, such as Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors and biologics, have a more favourable safety and efficacy profile than the older, traditional systemic immunosuppressives. Topical corticosteroids are the first-line pharmacologic treatments for AD, and evidence suggests that these agents may also be beneficial for the prophylaxis of disease flare-ups. Although the prognosis for patients with AD is generally favourable, those patients with severe, widespread disease and concomitant atopic conditions, such as asthma and allergic rhinitis, are likely to experience poorer outcomes. Newer systemic agents have been approved which are greatly improving the QoL of these patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The body has a collection of physical barriers to prevent infection, but once these are overcome, we rely on our immune systems to protect us against a wide variety of infections. The complex mechanisms through which this is achieved are grouped into two lines of defense called the “innate” and “adaptive” immune systems. The innate immune system provides a rapid and tailored response to infection or injury often associated with inflammation. Innate immunity also promotes the development of acquired immunity. Specific, long-lasting responses against a particular infection are dependent on acquired immunity, and these provide immune memory, such that if we encounter the same pathogen again, we are better protected. Many diseases are related to defects in immune function which can lead to either a weakened or overactive immune response. Autoimmune diseases (where the immune system attacks tissues or organs) and allergies (where the immune system responds inappropriately to substances in our environment) are just two examples of conditions resulting from immune function defects. Improved understanding of immune processes provides tremendous opportunities for enhanced immunization strategies and immune-based therapies. This article provides an overview of the main components and functions of the immune system, and also serves as a primer to help readers understand the immunopathological disorders discussed in the remainder of this supplement.",

Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions to foods are associated with a broad range of signs and symptoms that may involve any of the following body systems: the skin, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, and cardiovascular system. IgE-mediated food allergy is a leading cause of anaphylaxis. Therefore, timely and appropriate diagnosis and treatment are imperative. A diagnosis of food allergy entails a careful history and diagnostic tests, which may include skin prick tests, serum-specific IgE, and oral food challenge.

This can be achieved in different ways for different patients and across different life stages.

    "abstract": ": The long-term effects of behaviour and environmental exposures, particularly during childhood, on health outcomes are well documented. Particularly thought provoking is the notion that exposures to different social environments have a long-lasting impact on human physical health. However, the mechanisms mediating the effects of the environment are still unclear. In the last decade, the main focus of attention was the genome, and interindividual genetic polymorphisms were sought after as the principal basis for susceptibility to disease. However, it is becoming clear that recent dramatic increases in the incidence of certain human pathologies, such as asthma and type 2 diabetes, cannot be explained just on the basis of a genetic drift. It is therefore extremely important to unravel the molecular links between the \"environmental\" exposure, which is believed to be behind this emerging incidence in certain human pathologies, and the disease's molecular mechanisms. Although it is clear that most human pathologies involve long-term changes in gene function, these might be caused by mechanisms other than changes in the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence. The genome is programmed by the epigenome, which is composed of chromatin and a covalent modification of DNA by methylation. It is postulated here that \"epigenetic\" mechanisms mediate the effects of behavioural and environmental exposures early in life, as well as lifelong environmental exposures and the susceptibility to disease later in life. In contrast to genetic sequence differences, epigenetic aberrations are potentially reversible, raising the hope for interventions that will be able to reverse deleterious epigenetic programming.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This review focuses on aspirin-exacerbated asthma (AEA). The review includes historical perspective of aspirin, prevalence, pathogenesis, clinical features and treatment of AEA. The pathogenesis of AEA involves the cyclooxygenase and lipooxygenase pathway. Aspirin affects both of these pathways by inhibiting the enzyme cycooxygenase-1 (COX-1). Inhibition of COX-1 leads to a decrease in prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The decrease in PGE2 results in an increase in cysteinyl leukotrienes by the lipooxygenase pathway involving the enzyme 5-lipooxygenase (5-LO). Leukotriene C4 (LTC 4 ) synthase is the enzyme responsible for the production of leukotriene C4, the chief cysteinyl leukotriene responsible for AEA. There have been familial occurences of AEA. An allele of the LTC 4 synthase gene in AEA is known as allele C. Allele C has a higher frequency in AEA. Clinical presentation includes a history of asthma after ingestion of aspirin, nasal congestion, watery rhinorrhea and nasal polyposis. Treatment includes leukotriene receptor antagonists, leukotriene inhibitors, aspirin desinsitaztion and surgery. AEA is the most well-defined phenotype of asthma. Although AEA affects adults and children with physician-diagnosed asthma, in some cases there is no history of asthma and AEA often goes unrecognized and underdiagnosed.",

Pediatricians, prescribing antipyretics for children, rarely encounter significant problems, but the few epidemiologic studies performed show conflicting results. Although it is clear that some patients with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)-sensitive asthma have their clinical onset of disease in childhood and bronchoconstriction after ASA challenge is seen in 0 to 22% of asthmatic children so challenged, ibuprofen at antipyretic doses may cause acute respiratory problems only in a very small number of mild to moderate asthmatics. The recently elucidated mechanism of action of acetaminophen may explain some occurrences of adverse reactions in patients with cross-reactive NSAID hypersensitivity on the basis of its inhibitory activity on the newly described enzyme, cyclooxygenase (COX)-3. This nonspecific sensitivity to inhibition of COX is most likely genetically determined and shows a remarkable association with atopic disease even in the very young age group and possibly an increased predilection in specific ethnic groups. This review summarizes state-of-the-art published data on NSAID hypersensitivity in preschool children.",

    "abstract": "A number of biological agents are available or being investigated for the treatment of asthma and rhinitis. The safety profiles of these biologic agents, which may modify allergic and immunological diseases, are still being elucidated. Subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy, the oldest biologic agent in current use, has the highest of frequency of the most serious and life-threatening reaction, anaphylaxis. It is also one of the only disease modifying interventions for allergic rhinitis and asthma. Efforts to seek safer and more effective allergen immunotherapy treatment have led to investigations of alternate routes of delivery and modified immunotherapy formulations. Sublingual immunotherapy appears to be associated with a lower, but not zero, risk of anaphylaxis. No fatalities have been reported to date with sublingual immunotherapy. Immunotherapy with modified formulations containing Th1 adjuvants, DNA sequences containing a CpG motif (CpG) and 3-deacylated monophospholipid A, appears to provide the benefits of subcutaneous immunotherapy with a single course of 4 to 6 preseasonal injections. There were no serious treatment-related adverse events or anaphylaxis in the clinical trials of these two immunotherapy adjuvants. Omalizumab, a monoclonal antibody against IgE, has been associated with a small risk of anaphylaxis, affecting 0.09% to 0.2% of patients. It may also be associated with a higher risk of geohelminth infection in patients at high risk for parasitic infections but it does not appear to affect the response to treatment or severity of the infection. Clinical trials with other biologic agents that have targeted IL-4/IL-13, or IL-5, have not demonstrated any definite serious treatment-related adverse events. However, these clinical trials were generally done in small populations of asthma patients, which may be too small for uncommon side effects to be identified. There is conflicting information about the safety TNF-alpha blocking agents, which have been primarily used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, with serious infections, cardiovascular disease and malignancies being the most frequent serious adverse events. An unfavorable risk-benefit profile led to early discontinuation of a TNF-blocking agent in a double-blind placebo controlled of severe asthmatics. In summary, the risk of anaphylaxis and other treatment-related serious events with of all of the biological agents in this review were relatively small. However, most of the clinical trials were done in relatively small patient populations and were of relatively short duration. Long term studies in large patient populations may help clarify the risk-benefit profile of these biologic agents in the treatment of asthma.",

This was a randomized double-blind trial. Subjects with allergic rhinitis with or without mild/moderate asthma sensitized to A alternata and who also had a positive skin prick test to Alt a1 were randomized to treatment with placebo (n = 18) or purified natural Alt a1 (n = 22) subcutaneously for 12 months.

Changes in the active treatment group were significantly higher than in the placebo group both at 6 months (P < 0.001) and at 12 months of treatment (P < 0.0001). However, changes in AMP and methacholine responsiveness, ENO and EBC pH levels were not significantly different between treatment groups. The overall incidence of adverse events was comparable between the treatment groups. Although allergen-specific immunotherapy with purified natural Alt a1 is well tolerated and induces an allergen-specific IgG4 response, treatment is not associated with changes in AMP or methacholine responsiveness or with significant improvements in markers of inflammation in exhaled air. These findings suggest dissociation between the immunotherapy-induced increase in IgG4 levels and its effect on airway responsiveness and inflammation.",

Here, we report a 25-year-old male patient with asthma, Reynaud phenomenon, eosinophilic panniculitis, bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy and peripheral blood eosinophilia. He responded initially to oral prednisolone with the subsidence of peripheral blood eosinophilia, asthma and the Reynaud phenomenon. But with tapering of prednisolone symptoms reappeared and hereby he was treated with cyclosporine. He has been symptom free for 6 months of follow up while taking cyclosporine 25 mg orally per day. Eosinophilia has resolved. This case shows that in addition to previously reported associations, Kimura disease may be associated with eosinophilic panniculitis and that cyclosporine could be effective in its treatment.",

This noninferiority trial compared the effects of MF/F and fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FP/S) combination therapies on pulmonary function and onset of action in subjects with persistent asthma. Following a 2- to 4-week run-in period with MF administered via a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) 200 μg (delivered as 2 inhalations of MF-MDI 100 μg) twice daily (BID), subjects (aged ≥12 y) were randomized to MF/F-MDI 200/10 μg BID (delivered as 2 inhalations of MF/F-MDI 100/5 μg) or FP/S administered via a dry powder inhaler (DPI) 250/50 μg (delivered as 1 inhalation) BID for 12 weeks. The primary assessment was change from baseline to week 12 in area under the curve for forced expiratory volume in 1 second measured serially for 0-12 hours postdose (FEV1 AUC0-12 h). Secondary assessments included onset of action (change from baseline in FEV1 at 5 minutes postdose on day 1) and patient-reported outcomes. 722 subjects were randomized to MF/F-MDI (n = 371) or FP/S-DPI (n = 351). Mean FEV1 AUC0-12 h change from baseline at week 12 for MF/F-MDI and FP/S-DPI was 3.43 and 3.24 L × h, respectively (95% CI, -0.40 to 0.76). MF/F-MDI was associated with a 200-mL mean increase from baseline in FEV1 at 5 minutes postdose on day 1, which was significantly larger than the 90-mL increase for FP/S-DPI (P < 0.001). The overall incidence of adverse events during the 12-week treatment period that were considered related to study therapy was similar in both groups (MF/F-MDI, 7.8% [n = 29]; FP/S-DPI, 8.3% [n = 29]). The results of this 12-week study indicated that MF/F improves pulmonary function and asthma control similar to FP/S with a superior onset of action compared with FP/S. Both drugs were safe, improved asthma control, and demonstrated similar results for other secondary study endpoints. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00424008",

Lung histology showed patchy, multicentric damage with inflammatory infiltrates at the airways in both groups. Lungs from mice from the short term group showed increased IL-4, CCL11, CXCL1 and CCL2 protein levels.

    "abstract": "The World Allergy Organization estimates that 40 % of the world's population is affected by allergic diseases. The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood has completed Phase III and it has now become clear that these diseases have increased in developing countries, especially Africa, where prevalence rates were formerly low. Despite an increase in studies in Africa, few sub-Saharan West African countries are represented; the focus has remained on urban populations and little attention has been paid to rural sub-Saharan Africa.We performed an allergy survey in a birth cohort of children aged less than 15 years in rural Senegal and implemented an ISAAC questionnaire. We carried out a complete blood count and serological analyses for IgE levels against common allergens and mosquito saliva.The prevalence rates of asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis (RC) and atopic dermatitis (AD) were 12.8, 12.5 and 12.2 % respectively. Specific IgE (sIgE) levels against mosquito spp. salivary gland antigens were significantly associated with AD; sIgE levels against selected true grasses (Poaceae) were significantly associated with RC. sIgE levels against house dust mite spp. were not associated with asthma, but were significantly correlated with mosquito IgE levels. Such cross-reactivity may blur the association between HDM sIgE and asthma. Consumption of seafood, storing whey cream, using plant fibre bedding and presence of carpet were significantly associated with increased risk of RC. The association of seafood may be the result of histamine intoxication from molluscs prepared by putrefaction. Cat presence and dog contact were associated with increased risk of asthma. Cow contact was associated with increased risk of AD.Our allergy study in rural West Africa revealed lower prevalence rates than the majority of African urban settings. Although several associated known risk factors were identified, there were associations specific to the region. The identification of probable artefactual dietary phenomena is a challenge for robust diagnosis of allergic disease. The association AD with mosquito saliva, a common allergen in rural settings, warrants specific attention. Further studies in rural Africa are needed to address the aetiology of allergy in a non-urban environment.",

A positive correlation was found between PAF-AH activity and apoB concentration (r2 = 0.59, P < 0.0001).

Whereas the development of TH2 responses and allergic disorders in pediatric populations has been examined in affluent countries, no or little data exist from low income regions of the world. The aim of this study is to examine factors influencing the development of TH2 responses of children born in areas endemic for helminth infections and to relate these factors to atopic sensitization at 4 years of age.Data were collected from pregnant mothers on helminth infections, education and socioeconomic status (SES). Total IgE, IL-5 in response to mitogen, and helminth antigens were measured in children at 2, 5, 12, 24 and 48 months of age. Skin prick testing (SPT) and allergen-specific IgE were determined at 4 years of age.Strong TH2 responses were seen at 5 months of age and increased with time. Although maternal filarial infection was associated with helminth-antigen specific TH2 responses, it was low maternal education or SES but not helminth infection, which was associated with the development of high total IgE and PHA-induced IL-5. At 4 years of age when allergen reactivity was assessed by SPT, the high general TH2 responses did not translate into higher prevalence of SPT. The risk factor for SPT reactivity was low maternal education which decreased the risk of SPT positivity to allergens (adjusted OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.12 - 0.87) independently of maternal filarial infection which tended to reduce the child's risk for being SPT positive (adjusted OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.07 - 1.70).In areas endemic for helminths, potent TH2 responses were seen early in life, but did not translate into a higher SPT reactivity to allergens. Therefore, in many parts of the world TH2 responses in general and IgE in particular cannot be used for diagnosis of allergic diseases.",

However, there are safety concerns regarding the frequency and severity of adverse events during food OIT.To evaluate the effect of Ketotifen premedication on adverse reactions during peanut OIT.A randomized single blind placebo controlled pilot study was performed. Peanut OIT was performed using a previously published protocol. Ketotifen was up-titrated to 2 mg twice daily over two weeks (week -2 to 0), followed by a peanut OIT initial escalation day (day 1). Ketotifen was administered from week 0-4 of peanut OIT; reactions to peanut OIT doses were recorded by clinic staff and subject diary.Six subjects (median age 10 years, peanut IgE >100kUA/L) were enrolled, 4 randomized to Ketotifen, 2 to placebo. The most common side effect of Ketotifen was fatigue (9% during up-titration). The rate of reaction per peanut OIT dose was lower for subjects on ketotifen (K) compared to placebo (P) during initial escalation on day 1 (K: 22% (8/36) vs. P: 67% (12/18)); week 0-4 build-up doses (K: 75% (3/4) vs. P: 100% (2/2)); and week 0-4 home doses (K: 50% (54/108) vs. P: 82% (27/33)). The rate of gastrointestinal symptoms per peanut OIT dose was also lower for subjects on ketotifen during initial escalation on day 1 (K: 17% (6/36) vs. P: 61% (11/18)); week 0-4 build-up doses (K: 75% (3/4) vs P: 100% (2/2)); and week 0-4 home doses (K: 46% (50/108) vs. P: 82% (27/33)).Ketotifen premedication is well tolerated and reduces the rate of gastrointestinal symptoms during peanut OIT.

MucilAir-Nasal, a three-dimensional organotypic (with different cell types) airway tissue model, was treated with the medical device Rhinosectan® (30 µL) or with controls (Rhinocort—budesonide—or saline solution). The protective barrier effects of Rhinosectan® were evaluated by: TEER (trans-epithelial electrical resistance) (preservation of tight junctions), Lucifer Yellow assay (preservation of paracellular flux) and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (localization of tight junction proteins). Exposure of MucilAir with Rhinosectan® protected cell tight junctions (increases in TEER of 13.1% vs −6.3% with saline solution after 1 h of exposure), and preserved the paracellular flux, even after exposure with pro-inflammatory compounds (TNF-α and LPS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa 10). Results of confocal immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that, after treatment with the pro-inflammatory mixture, Rhinosectan® produced a slight relocation of zona occludens-1 in the cytosol compartment (while Rhinocort induced expression of zona-occludens-1), maintaining the localization of occludin (similarly to negative control). Results of our study indicates that Rhinosectan® creates a protective physical barrier on nasal epithelial cells in vitro, allowing the avoidance of allergens and triggering factors, thus confirming the utility of this medical device in the management of nasal respiratory diseases, as rhinitis or rhinosinusitis.",

    "abstract": "Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a persistent inflammatory disease affecting paranasal sinuses. CRS is categorized into two distinct subgroups defined as CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP). Although several immune cells are involved in the CRS pathogenesis, the role of T cells is not fully understood. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the frequency of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and macrophages in the sinonasal mucosa of CRS patients, as well as to investigate the specific transcription factors for Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg cells.In this study, 15 healthy controls, 12 CRSsNP, and 23 CRSwNP patients participated. CD4+, CD8+, and CD68+ cells were investigated in the sinonasal tissues using immunohistochemistry. The expression of transcription factors related to Th subsets (T-bet, GATA3, Ror-γt, and FoxP3) was evaluated using real-time PCR. Furthermore, CRSwNP patients were defined as eosinophilic when eosinophils consisted of more than 10% of total inflammatory cells. The Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney, and Spearman tests were used in statistical analyses.The median (range) age of the studied groups was: 32 (14-67) for CRSwNP, 28 (10-43) for CRSsNP, and 27 (17-44) for controls. The number of eosinophils in CRSwNP patients was higher than two other groups, whereas neutrophils were elevated in both CRSwNP and CRSsNP groups in comparison to controls. The frequency of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, macrophages, and total inflammatory cells were significantly increased in CRSwNP and CRSsNP patients compared with controls. The mRNA expression of GATA3 was increased in CRSwNP patients while mRNA expression of Ror-γt was elevated in CRSsNP patients. No significant difference was observed in T-bet mRNA expression among three groups. Both CRSwNP and CRSsNP patients showed decreased FoxP3 mRNA expression in comparison to controls.The frequency of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was elevated in CRS patients. In addition, we demonstrated Th2 dominance in CRSwNP patients and Th17 dominance in CRSsNP patients, implicating different mechanisms may underlie the disease. Better CRS classification and targeted therapeutic strategies may be achievable by determining the pattern of infiltrating inflammatory cells. Therefore, further experimental investigations on T cells are needed.",

    "abstract": "A patient’s knowledge of his/her allergic condition and treatment is a key factor in adherence and effectiveness. To assess patients’ understanding of allergy and acceptance of allergen immunotherapy on the basis of (i) information given by their physician at the time of prescription and (ii) a new communication template viewed some months later, we performed an Internet-based survey of patient panels in France, Germany, Spain, the USA and Russia. The survey participants were either recent “early abandoners” (having discontinued allergen immunotherapy before the end of the prescribed course) or “non-starters” (having decided not to initiate a course of allergen immunotherapy recommended by their physician). All participants completed an on-line questionnaire immediately before and immediately after viewing the new communication template. The study’s main objectives were to validate the new communication template and to assess its impact on anticipated willingness to initiate or resume allergen immunotherapy. We surveyed a total of 261 patients (France: 57; Germany: 51; Spain: 52; USA: 51; Russia: 50), comprising 127 “early abandoners” and 134 “non-starters”. The mean time since symptom onset and selection for the study was 14.5 years. Subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy had been prescribed in 60 % of cases. Twenty-eight percent of the participants did not know for which allergy they were being treated. Early abandoners reported a perception of low effectiveness (39 %) and complained about expense (39 %) and practical constraints (32 %). Twenty-two percent of the non-starters feared side effects. The communication template was considered to be clear (by 92 % of the patients), convincing (by 75 %) and reassuring (by 89 %); 80 % of the participants felt better informed afterwards, and 67 % stated that viewing the communication template would have made them more likely to continue or initiate allergen immunotherapy (overall willingness score: 5.65 out of 10 before viewing and 7.1 out of 10 afterwards). After viewing a new communication template on allergy and allergen immunotherapy, patients participating in the survey felt better informed and more likely to initiate or complete this therapy. It now remains to investigate the communication template’s effect on actual acceptance of and adherence to allergen immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Asthma is an increasingly common chronic disease among children, and data point toward a complex mechanism involving genetic, environmental and epigenetic factors. Epigenetic modifications such as DNA hypo- or hyper-methylation have been shown to occur in response to environmental exposures including dietary nutrients. Methods Within the context of the asthma randomized trial of indoor wood smoke (ARTIS) study, we investigated relationships between diet, asthma health measures, and DNA methylation. Asthma health measures included a quality of life instrument, diurnal peak flow variability (dPFV) and forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV 1 ). Dietary intake was assessed with a food frequency questionnaire. Methylation levels of LINE-1 repetitive element and two promoter CpG sites for interferon gamma (IFNγ, -186 and -54) from buccal cell DNA were measured using pyrosequencing assays. Results Data were collected on 32 children with asthma living in western Montana who were recruited to the ARTIS study. Selenium and several methyl donor dietary nutrients were positively associated with the asthma quality of life measure. Intake of methyl donating nutrients including folate was positively associated LINE-1 methylation and negatively associated with IFNγ CpG-186. Higher levels of LINE-1 methylation were associated with greater dPFV. Conclusion We identified several nutrients that were associated with improved quality of life measures among children with asthma. The IFNγ promoter CpG site -186 but not -54 was associated with the intake of selected dietary nutrients. However, in this small population of children with asthma, the IFNγ promoter CpG sites were not associated with respiratory health measures so it remains unclear through which epigenetic mechanism these nutrients are impacting the quality of life measure. These findings add to the evidence that dietary nutrients, particularly foods containing methyl donors, may be important for epigenetic regulation as it pertains to the control of asthma.

    "abstract": "Prednisone dependence in asthma is usually described based on clinical and spirometric characteristics. It is generally believed that these patients have frequent exacerbations and lose lung function rapidly because of uncontrolled airway eosinophilia.The objectives of this study are to report the effect on asthma exacerbations and the change in lung function over time in prednisone-dependent asthma when severe asthma is managed using a protocol that aims to maintain normal sputum cell counts.A retrospective survey of patients prospectively assessed in a university tertiary care asthma clinic.52 patients (30 males, mean age 51 years, 64% non-atopic) were followed for a median period of 5.4 years (min-max: 0.2-35.2). Monitoring with the aim of keeping sputum eosinophils below 3% resulted in higher doses of corticosteroids (median daily dose of prednisone was 10 mg and for inhaled corticosteroids was 1500 μg of fluticasone equivalent) than at baseline and this was associated with predictable adverse effects. Despite the disease severity, 10 patients (19%) did not require LABA for symptom control. Most importantly, over the period of follow-up, there were only 0.3 eosinophilic exacerbations/patient/year. Overall, there was an increase in FEV1 over the period of follow-up (mean +84.6 ml/year) rather than an expected decline.Monitoring of eosinophils in sputum enables to maintain symptom control and preserve FEV1 in patients with severe prednisone-dependent asthma.",

We aimed to assess the incidence of anaphylactic side effects during rush VIT in a cohort of pediatric patients and adult controls.72 consecutive cycles of VIT-buildup in 71 children/adolescents aged 7-17 years were retrospectively evaluated and compared to an adult control group (n = 981) with regard to baseline parameters (sex, causative venom, severity of index sting reaction, results of allergy testing, comorbidities) and the incidence of anaphylactic adverse reactions.Compared to adults, severe index sting-induced anaphylaxis was significantly less common in children (P = .001). Children were more likely to suffer from bee venom allergy (P < .001) and showed higher levels of bee venom-specific IgE (P = .013), but lower serum tryptase concentrations (P = .014). The overall rate of VIT-induced anaphylactic reactions was higher in children than in adults (6.9% vs 2.5%, P = .046 by univariate analysis). In the final binary logistic regression model, however, only bee VIT (P = .039; odds ratio 2.25; confidence interval 1.04-4.87) and 5-day compared to 3-day buildup protocols (P = .011; odds ratio 2.64; confidence interval 1.25-5.57) were associated with an increased risk of treatment-induced anaphylaxis. All pediatric patients finally reached and tolerated the target maintenance dose of 100 µg.The higher anaphylactic reaction rate observed in pediatric patients may be attributed to a greater prevalence of bee venom allergy. VIT-induced anaphylaxis in children is usually mild and does not affect further updosing and maintenance of VIT.",

Steroid-sparing effect of omalizumab has not been demonstrated in asthmatics with persistent airway eosinophilia in a randomised controlled trial till date. From this double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centred, randomized parallel group design, we report that omalizumab is possibly inadequate to control sputum eosinophilia, and therefore may not have a steroid-sparing effect, especially in those maintained on oral corticosteroids daily.

Haemopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) has been recognized as an option for such patients. We analysed the evidence on efficacy and safety of HSCT in patients with SLE. A database search was done for articles on HSCT in SLE up to July 2017 in PUBMED, Cochrane library, LILACS and clinical trial registration databases to select prospective or retrospective studies with 8 or more patients. Of the 732 search results from the PUBMED, Cochrane and LILACS database search, following duplicate removal, 15 studies were eligible for detailed assessment. Findings of an additional trial were obtained from the clinical trial registration database. Data were extracted on study design, patient characteristics, nature of intervention, outcomes, complications and study quality. Case reports and small case series were summarised without detailed qualitative analysis. Most of the studies showed remission in the majority of patients. Relapse of the original disease increased with longer follow-up. Common adverse effects included: infections and secondary autoimmune disorders. Short follow up period and lack of randomised controlled trials were the main limitations restricting the generalizability of study results. A meta-analysis was not performed due to heterogeneity of studies. Although HSCT is a viable option in SLE, its exact clinical utility needs to be further evaluated in well-designed studies.",

    "abstract": "A history of penicillin allergy in patients is common, but only 10-15 % are truly allergic. While the gold standard for diagnosing penicillin allergy is challenge, it is not recommended that this be done without first carrying out diagnostic skin testing. This is carried out with the major determinant benzylpenicilloyl (PPL) and the minor determinant mixture (MDM), consisting of penilloate, penicilloate and Penicillin G. However, since availability of the MDM is limited, Penicillin G alone has been used.A retrospective chart review was carried out on patients tested for penicillin allergy in the Clinical Immunology and Allergy Clinic at the Health Sciences Centre, Winnipeg, Canada between 2005 and 2013. A total of 521 patients charts were reviewed, of whom 240 had skin testing, ImmunoCap(®) for IgE to Penicillin G and V and had oral challenges with penicillin, amoxicillin or cloxacillin.17/240 (7.5 %) were skin test positive, 8 to PPL, 4 to MDM and 5 to Penicillin G. One was also positive on ImmunoCap(®) testing. Three patients had negative skin tests but weakly positive ImmunoCap(®). 222 patients with negative skin tests and serological tests were challenged. Of these, 12 patients reacted to challenge. Three of the challenges were equivocal. Of the nine patients with definite positive challenges, three were tested with Penicillin G and six with MDM. Therefore the false negative rates for testing were 2.3 % with PPL and Penicillin G and 6.97 % for PPL and MDM. The difference was not significant (p = 0.0856).In this group of patients with a history of penicillin allergy tested with the major determinant of benzyl penicillin and either MDM or Penicillin G, there was no difference in the rate of false negative testing, based on oral penicillin challenges. Therefore, Penicillin G can be safely used as an alternative to MDM in diagnosing penicillin allergy.",

    "abstract": "Cat allergy is of great importance, and its prevalence is increasing worldwide. Cat allergens and house dust mite allergens represent the major indoor allergens; however, they are ubiquitous. Cat sensitization and allergy are known risk factors for rhinitis, bronchial hyperreactivity and asthma. Thus, the diagnosis of sensitization to cats is important for any allergist.70 patients with positive skin prick tests for cats were retrospectively compared regarding their skin prick test results, as well as their specific immunoglobulin E antibody profiles with regard to their responses to the native cat extract, rFel d 1, nFel d 2 and rFel d 4. 35 patients were allergic to cats, as determined by positive anamnesis and/or nasal provocation with cat allergens, and 35 patients exhibited clinically non-relevant sensitization, as indicated by negative anamnesis and/or a negative nasal allergen challenge.Native cat extract serology testing detected 100% of patients who were allergic to cats but missed eight patients who showed sensitization in the skin prick test and did not have allergic symptoms. The median values of the skin prick test, as well as those of the specific immunoglobulin E antibodies against the native cat extract, were significantly higher for allergic patients than for patients with clinically non-relevant sensitization. Component based diagnostic testing to rFel d 1 was not as reliable. Sensitization to nFel d 2 and rFel d 4 was seen only in individual patients.Extract based diagnostic methods for identifying cat allergy and sensitization, such as the skin prick test and native cat extract serology, remain crucial in routine clinical practice. In our study, component based diagnostic testing could not replace these methods with regard to the detection of sensitization to cats and differentiation between allergy and sensitization without clinical relevance. However, component resolved allergy diagnostic tools have individual implications, and future studies may facilitate a better understanding of its use and subsequently may improve the clinical management of allergic patients.",

In the absence of a head-to-head comparative study of the two treatment modalities, an indirect comparison of data from 2 independent but similar clinical trials was undertaken. Two similar randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover studies were identified which evaluated either C1-INH(SC) (COMPACT; NCT01912456; 16 weeks) or C1-INH(IV) (CHANGE; NCT01005888; 14 weeks) vs. placebo (on-demand treatment only) for routine prevention of HAE attacks. Individual patient data from each trial were used to conduct an indirect comparison of treatment effects. Attack reductions (absolute and percent of mean/median number of monthly HAE attacks reduction over placebo) were compared between the two C1-INH formulations at approved/recommended doses: C1-INH(SC) 60 IU/kg twice weekly (n = 45) and 1000 U of C1-INH(IV) twice weekly (n = 22). Point estimates were adjusted using mixed and quantile regression models that controlled for study design. The absolute mean monthly numbers of HAE attack reductions were 3.6 (95% CI 2.9, 4.2) for C1-INH(SC) 60 IU/kg vs. placebo and 2.3 (1.4, 3.3) for C1-INH(IV) vs. placebo; between-product difference, 1.3 (0.1, 2.4; P = 0.034). The mean percent reduction in monthly attack rate was significantly greater with C1-INH(SC) as compared with C1-INH(IV) (84% vs. 51%; P < 0.001). The percentages of subjects experiencing ≥ 50%, ≥ 70%, and ≥ 90% reductions in monthly HAE attack rates versus placebo were significantly higher with C1-INH(SC) 60 IU/kg as compared to C1-INH(IV) 1000 U (≥ 50% reduction: 91% vs. 50%, odds ratio [OR] = 10.33, P = 0.003; ≥ 70% reduction: 84% vs. 46%, OR = 6.19, P = 0.005; ≥ 90% reduction: 57% vs. 18%, OR = 6.04, P = 0.007). Within the limitations of an indirect study comparison, this analysis suggests greater attack reduction with twice-weekly C1-INH(SC) 60 IU/kg as compared to twice-weekly C1-INH(IV) 1000 U for the routine prevention of HAE attacks.",

    "abstract": "Natural rubber latex and chlorhexidine have previously been identified as causative substances in perioperative anaphylaxis. A pelvic examinations is generally considered noninvasive, however, this procedure is rarely associated with severe allergic reactions. We reported a rare case of dual latex and chlorhexidine allergies which caused anaphylaxis after pelvic examination in a woman with a history of latex-related fruits allergy.A 54-year-old woman had severe anaphylaxis after a pelvic examination due to dual latex and chlorhexidine (CHX) allergies. The gynecologist used CHX for the vaginal preparation and wore latex-containing gloves with lubricating gel during the examination. In vivo and in vitro tests revealed CHX sensitization by a positive skin prick test to chlorhexidine at a very low concentration (0.002 mg/mL), and a positive basophil activation test to CHX. Latex allergy was confirmed by a positive specific IgE to latex and a positive glove-use test at 20 min. An analysis of specific IgE to latex component revealed positive results for Hev b 1, 5, 6.02, and 11. As she also had a past history of fruit allergy, prick-to-prick testing with latex-related fruits was performed. The results were positive for avocado, banana, jackfruit, kiwi, and longan.Concomitant mucosal exposure of both natural rubber latex and CHX in highly sensitized patients during pelvic examinations can lead to severe anaphylaxis. Pre-procedural screening for an allergy to latex or CHX, or to any other allergen, should be performed in patients where there is suspicion of a specific allergy due to a previous allergic reaction. Increased awareness of these two allergens in all healthcare settings may improve patient safety.",

    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders, and cognitive dysfunction. Current thinking links chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) with oxidative stress and systemic inflammation. However, the sequence of events leading to the morbidities associated with OSA is poorly understood in children. Monocytes are known to be altered by chronic hypoxia. Thus in this prospective study, we investigated inflammatory cytokine profiles from cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from children with severe OSA and sleep-related CIH. Ten children with OSA (cases) and 5 age-matched children without OSA (controls) were recruited for study. Samples of plasma and PBMC were obtained before and after adenotonsillectomy. The levels of the inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), were measured in both plasma and ex vivo culture supernatants of PBMC incubated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) using the cytometric bead assay. Upon activation of PBMC by LPS, the levels of IL-8 in the culture supernatants from cases were threefold higher than in controls. The levels of the other cytokines including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα, in culture supernatant of PBMC from cases showed no difference from controls; nor were there significant differences in plasma cytokine levels. We speculate that in young children with sleep-related CIH, an enhanced production capacity of IL-8 precedes the development of systemic inflammatory markers. Future work should evaluate IL-8 production capacity as a potential biomarker for OSA severity.",

The total of 676 adult asthmatics with moderate-severe AEs were included and divided into atopic (85.65%) and non-atopic group. Atopy was defined by positive skin prick test (SPT) to at least one inhalant allergen. Data regarding atopy and asthma severity were collected from patient's records. Patients with symptoms and signs of acute respiratory infection and patient sensitized to indoor allergens only were excluded. Daily count of local pollens (Salsola kali, Bermuda grass) and molds (Aspergillus, Alternaria and Cladosporium) were obtained from the Aerobiology department. Daily metrological parameters (atmospheric pressure-AP, temperature-T and relative humidity-RH) were provided by Kuwait Environment Public Authority. Count of spores/m3 and weather variable are shown on weekly basis. The year circle was divided into 4 Seasons (1, 2, 3, 4) accordingly to typical desert climate. Sensitization to molds was relatively high but significantly less (25.0%) if compared to the pollens sensitization. The highest number of AEs was in season 4 for both molds and pollens sensitized patients. Seasonal patterns for both allergens were significant and positively correlated with RH and AP. In season 1 only, mold sensitized patients showed higher rate of AEs. Non-atopic patients have been less sensitive to increased RH than atopic. Negative correlation with T was similar in both atopic and non-atopic patients. Despite of high rate of sensitization to molds, their significant role in triggering AE was not found in desert environment. Typical desert climate and high allergencity of local weeds outweigh the influence of the molds.",

Asian sand dust (ASD) is observed most frequently during the spring. This study aimed to clarify the role of TLRs in murine lung eosinophilia exacerbated by ASD and LPS.The effects of LPS and ASD co-treatment on ovalbumin (OVA)-induced lung eosinophilia were investigated using wild-type (WT), TLR2-/-, TLR4-/-, and adaptor protein myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-/- BALB/c mice. ASD was heated (H-ASD) to remove the toxic organic substances. WT, TLR2-/-, TLR4-/- and MyD88-/- BALB/c mice were intratracheally instilled with four different combinations of LPS, H-ASD and OVA treatment. Subsequently, the pathological changes in lungs, immune cell profiles in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), inflammatory cytokines/chemokines levels in BALF and OVA-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) in serum were analyzed.In WT mice, H-ASD + LPS exacerbated OVA-induced lung eosinophilia. This combination of treatments increased the proportion of eosinophils and the levels of IL-5, IL-13, eotaxin in BALF, as well as the production of OVA-specific IgE and IgG1 in serum compared to OVA treatment alone. Although these effects were stronger in TLR2-/- mice than in TLR4-/- mice, the expression levels of IL-5, IL-13, eotaxin were somewhat increased in TLR4-/- mice treated with OVA + H-ASD + LPS. In MyD88-/- mice, this pro-inflammatory mediator-induced airway inflammation was considerably weak and the pathological changes in lungs were negligible.These results suggest that LPS and H-ASD activate OVA-induced Th2 response in mice, and exacerbate lung eosinophilia via TLR4/MyD88, TLR4/TRIF and other TLR4-independent pathways.",

The use of this product in the food industry is prohibited due to its potential carcinogenic effect, but no respiratory involvement has been reported to date. Case presentation We present the case of a 46-year-old female patient who had been working in a cosmetics packaging company for 20 years. The patient developed occupational asthma to a red azo dye known as Sudan red. The diagnosis was confirmed by specific bronchial provocation test. Induced sputum samples were obtained previously and in the 24 h following the procedure, with a rise in the percentage of eosinophils from 10 to 65%. Conclusions This report describes the case of a patient who developed OA caused by exposure to an azoic dye called Sudan red. The clinical and analytical features suggest a type 2-related asthma; however, we are not yet able to confirm the specific pathophysiological mechanism. The extensive use of azo dyes in industry means that it is particularly important to describe their implications for health, which are probably underestimated at present.",

    "abstract": "Only one previous study, via telephone call, on the prevalence of self-reported food allergies has been performed in Portugal, in a small sample of adults. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of self-reported and probable food allergy, analyze the clinical features and involved foods in Portuguese adults. Population-based, cross-sectional study performed in various healthcare centres from central Portugal. All 1436 randomly selected individuals (median age: 45 years, 50.6 % female) replied to a validated food allergy questionnaire by phone. Those who reported an adverse food reaction were invited to come to the hospital, where clinical history was taken, skin prick (SPT) and prick-prick skin (SPPT) tests were performed and food allergen-specific IgE levels (sIgE) were determined. An open oral challenge was performed in selected cases. Cases of positive clinical history of immediate (up to 2 h after ingestion) reaction in association with positive food sIgE levels and/or skin prick tests were classified as IgE-associated probable food allergy. Cases of positive clinical history of delayed (more than 2 h after ingestion) and negative food sIgE levels independently of positive SPT or SPPT results were classified as non-IgE associated probable food allergy. The prevalence of probable food allergy in our sample was 1 %, with shellfish and fish as the most frequently implicated foods. IgE-mediated probable food allergy occurred in 0.71 % of cases, with shellfish, peanut and nuts mainly involved. Cutaneous symptoms were most frequently reported. Prevalence values and food types were discrepant between self-reported and probable food allergies. The prevalence of probable food allergies in Portuguese adults is low, is mostly related to shellfish, peanut and nuts and most frequently involves cutaneous symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Identification of molecular markers, such as miRNAs is promising for the diagnosis of asthma and its clinical phenotypes. The aim of this study was to examine the changes in the expression of selected microRNAs in plasma exosomal fractions of severe asthma patients. The expression of miRNAs was determined in relation to the changes in inflammatory markers. Method Severe asthma patients (n = 30) and healthy subjects (n = 30) were selected among the individuals referred to asthma and allergy clinic. Blood was collected from each participant to determine the serum high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and total IgE. The exosomal fraction of plasma was isolated and processed for quantitation of miR-124, miR-125b, miR-133b, miR-130a and miR-125b-1-3p expression using quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR). Results Serum hs-CRP and total IgE were significantly higher in asthma patients compared to controls. Expression of miR-124, miR-133b, and miR-130a was down-regulated in asthma patients as compared to controls (p &lt; 0.0001). However, the expression of miR-125b was substantially higher in patients compared to controls (p &lt; 0.0001). There was no significant difference in the expression of miR-125b-1-3p in the patients and controls. Data analysis revealed that among the miRNAs, changes in miR-125b in severe asthma patients were highly correlated with the serum levels of hs-CRP and IgE. Conclusion Overexpression of miR-125b in severe asthma which was associated with serum IgE and hs-CRP may suggest that this molecule is linked to inflammatory reactions. Up-regulation of miR-125b together with decreased expression of miR-124, miR-133b, and miR-130a may suggest that this miRNA profile is useful for diagnosis and discrimination of clinical phenotypes of asthma.",

In recent years, the role of eosinophil and immunoglobulin E autoantibodies have been further elucidated in BP, and have been considered potential therapeutic targets. Case presentations A 67-year-old male presented with erythematous bullous eruption. The skin eruption was located on whole body, and suggested BP. Peripheral blood eosinophil count and total immunoglobulin E markedly elevated in initial laboratory findings. Topical and systemic steroid (methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/day) treatment was started, and his skin symptoms worsened repeatedly, whenever systemic steroid were reduced. On admission day 29, reslizumab (anti-interleukin-5) 3.5 mg/kg was administered intravenously to the patients. The bullous skin lesion began to improve rapidly, and methylprednisolone (8 mg/day) was reduced without any worsening of symptoms during two doses of reslizumab. Conclusions We report a case of successful treatment response to reslizumab administration in a patient with BP. Further studies are needed to confirm the role of anti-interleukin-5 as a treatment for BP in the future.",

However, it remains unclear if intangible costs of pediatric food allergy influence parental career choices. Using data from 63 parents whose children had been diagnosed by a pediatric allergist with food allergy, we sought to (a) establish perceived life status of families with a food allergic child, and (b) to describe any career limitations viewed as attributable to food allergy. Compared to responding parents whose children had one to two food allergies, those with three or more food allergies had significantly poorer perceived life status (ß − 0.74; 95%CI − 1.41; − 0.07; p &lt; 0.05). Overall, 14.3% of parents (all mothers) reported career limitations due to food allergy. Two of the 7 mothers (28.6%) who reported career limitations due to their child's food allergy fell below Statistics Canada cut-off for low-income, after tax dollars (LIM-AT). One of the three mothers who had changed jobs because of their child's food allergy was below the LIM-AT. No fathers reported food allergy-related career limitations. In conclusion, mothers of children with multiple food allergies reported worse perceived life status that may be partly explained by food allergy-related career limitations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Rationale On Wright-stained sputum cytospins, eosinophil differential of ≥ 1.2% is considered abnormal, and ≥ 2.3% identifies an eosinophilic endotype. We hypothesized that failure to consider free eosinophil granules (FEG), and the re-emergence (unmasking) of eosinophilia due to various reasons underestimate the prevalence of the eosinophilic endotype. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of our Institutional Review Board-approved clinical sputum database. Of the 24,176 examinations of sputa from patients with various airway diseases, 17,693 were viable cell counts from 9570 patients (6604 on a single occasion, 2967 from multiple occasions). The prevalence of intact eosinophil % at 1.2 and 2.3% thresholds was first examined. Then, additional evidence of eosinophilia was assessed by semi-quantitative enumeration of FEGs. In those patients whose sputa were examined on multiple occasions (at the time of an exacerbation or after corticosteroid dose was reduced), re-emergence (unmasking) of eosinophilia was assessed . Results Using the threshold of eosinophilia ≥ 1.2%, 6289/17693 (35.6%) of sputa were classified as eosinophilic. This increased to 7850/17693 (44.4%) when the presence of FEGs was considered. Using the threshold of eosinophilia ≥ 2.3%, 4647/17693 (26.3%) of sputa were classified as eosinophilic. This increased to 5435/17693 (30.7%) when the presence of FEG were considered. Extrapolating from the prevalence of re-emergence observed in the 2967 patients who had sputa examined on multiple occasions to the whole sample, we estimated that eosinophilia at 1.2% threshold would be observed in at least 60% of the samples, and a clinically relevant eosinophilia at 2.3% threshold would be observed in at least 48.5% of the samples. Conclusions Using a large sputum cytometry clinical database (17,693 viable cell counts), we demonstrate that a single time point intact cell count underestimates the prevalence of eosinophilia in a variety of airway diseases. The prevalence of eosinophilia increases from 35.6 to 60% (40% underestimation) at the 1.2% threshold, and from 26.3 to 48.5% (45% underestimation) at the 2.3% clinically relevant threshold, when free granules and a second examination are considered. This has important implications to identify the eosinophilic and Th2 high endotype both for clinical trials of anti-eosinophil therapies, and to select patients who may respond well to glucocorticosteroids and anti-IL5 therapies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background There is a need to identify the asthma inflammatory phenotypes of patients to facilitate personalized asthma treatment. Sputum induction is time-consuming and requires expert clinical technique. This study aimed to assess the distribution and characteristics of asthma inflammatory phenotypes in Jilin Province, China; it also aimed to identify an easier method for characterization of an asthma phenotype, rather than sputum cellular analysis. Methods In this study, 232 asthma patients underwent sputum induction following clinical assessment and blood collection. Inflammatory cell counts in sputum were used to classify asthma inflammatory phenotypes. Receiver operating characteristic curve and Spearman correlation coefficient analyses were used to identify correlations between clinical parameters. Results Among the included patients, there had 52.1% paucigranulocytic, 38.4% eosinophilic, 4.3% neutrophilic, and 5.2% mixed granulocytic asthma phenotypes, respectively. In total, 129 (55.6%) patients had asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap (ACO); these patients had higher proportion of smokers, higher sputum neutrophil count, worse lung function, and worse asthma control, compared with patients who had asthma alone (p &lt; 0.05). Sputum eosinophil/neutrophil counts were positively correlated with blood eosinophil/neutrophil counts (p &lt; 0.01). To identify the presence of sputum eosinophil proportion ≥ 3%, optimal cut-off values for blood eosinophil count and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) were 0.2 × 10 9 /L and 30.25 ppd (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.744; AUC = 0.653, p &lt; 0.001). AUCs did not significantly differ between FeNO and blood eosinophil count (p = 0.162), but both exhibited poor specificity (57% and 49%, respectively). To identify the presence of sputum neutrophil proportion ≥ 61%, the optimal cut-off value for blood neutrophil proportion was 69.3% (AUC = 0.691, p = 0.0003); however, this exhibited poor sensitivity (50%). Conclusions Paucigranulocytic asthma was the most common phenotype, followed by eosinophilic asthma. Higher proportion of smokers, poor patient compliance, insufficient treatment, and poor asthma control may have been the main causes of high ACO proportion among patients in this study. Blood eosinophil/neutrophil counts exhibited poor specificity and sensitivity for prediction of airway eosinophilic/neutrophilic inflammation.",

In this first report from Australia, we observed a significant decrease in asthma hospital presentations during lockdown periods including April (68.85%), May (69.46%), December (49.00%) of 2020 and August (66.59%) of 2021 compared to pre-pandemic predictions. The decrease in asthma hospital presentations coincided with the lockdown periods during first, second and third waves of the COVID-19 pandemic and was potentially due to reduced transmission of other common respiratory viruses from restricted movement.",

Therefore, the aims of this study were to evaluate the effect of pollen SCIT on HRQoL and to assess the association between HRQoL and symptoms among children and adolescents with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in a 3-year follow-up.A prospective cohort study was conducted at a paediatric clinic in Sweden, including 158 children (5-16 years) on SCIT (birch and/or grass). Health-related quality of life, measured with DISABKIDS, symptom scores and allergen-specific IgE and IgG4 antibodies (blood test), were assessed at start, and after 1, 2 and 3 years of treatment. ANOVA and t-test were used to analyse differences over time, between groups and linear mixed model for the association between HRQoL and influencing factors.After 1 year of pollen SCIT, HRQoL improved from 79.5 to 85.1 (p < 0.001), and the improvements were maintained (mean 1 years, 84.8, 3 years 87.2). Symptom scores decreased after 1 year, mean 19.9 to 11.5 (p < 0.001) and were maintained for year two (11.9) and year three (10.3). The proportion of children with severe or very severe symptoms decreased from 35.6% to 4.5% after 1 year of SCIT. Health-related quality of life was associated with symptoms at all measured timepoints (p = 0.001-0.031); higher symptom scores were associated with lower perceived HRQoL. Allergen-specific IgE antibodies decreased, birch from 151.0 to 76.8 kU/L (p < 0.001), and IgG4 antibodies increased, birch from 2.2 to 17.6 g/L (p < 0.001), grass from 0.5 to 14.3 g/L (p < 0.001), during the study period.After 1 year of pollen SCIT, HRQoL improved, and symptoms decreased; these changes were maintained during the study period.

Long-term post-treatment comparisons in children and adults treated with SCIT have rarely been published. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term efficacy of HDM-SCIT administered under a cluster schedule in children compared to adults.This was an open-design, observational, long-term clinical follow-up study on children and adults with perennial AR treated with HDM-SCIT. The follow-up consisted of a three-year treatment duration plus a post-treatment follow-up of over three years.Patients in the pediatric (n = 58) and adult (n = 103) groups completed a post-SCIT follow-up of over three years. The total nasal symptom score (TNSS), combined symptom medication score (CSMS), and rhinoconjunctivitis quality-of-life questionnaire (RQLQ) score decreased significantly at T1 (three-year SCIT completed) and T2 (follow-up completed) in the pediatric and adult groups. In both groups, the improvement rate of TNSS (T0-T1) was moderately correlated with the baseline TNSS (r = 0.681, p < 0.001 and r = 0.477, p < 0.001 for children and adults, respectively). Only in the pediatric group, TNSS was significantly lower at T2 compared with that right after SCIT cessation (T1) (p = 0.030).Children and adults with HDM-induced perennial AR could achieve a sustainable post-treatment efficacy for over three years (up to 13 years) following a three-year SCIT. Patients with relatively severe nasal symptoms at baseline may benefit more from SCIT. Children who have completed an adequate course of SCIT may gain further improvement in nasal symptoms after SCIT cessation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare and life-threatening inborn error of immunity. HAE is mostly caused by pathogenic variations in the serine protease inhibitor gene 1 ( SERPING1 ), leading to deficient or dysfunctional C1-inhibitor (C1-INH), overproduction of bradykinin, and development of recurrent subcutaneous and/or submucosal oedema. The prevalence of HAE is 1 in 50,000 − 100000 people worldwide. We aimed to describe the clinical features and genetic spectrum of hereditary angioedema with C1-INH deficiency (C1-INH-HAE) in Latvia. Methods All patients from Latvia diagnosed with HAE (types I/II) from 2006 to March 2022 were included in the study. Laboratory tests and clinical data were analysed, and genetic tests with Sanger sequencing and whole genome sequencing were performed. Results The study identified 10 C1-INH-HAE patients (nine females, one male) from eight families. The point prevalence of HAE in Latvia is 0.53 per 100 000 inhabitants. Of all patients, seven (70%) had HAE type I and three (30%) had HAE type II. The median age of patients was 54 years and the median age at onset of symptoms was 15 years. A significant delay (median 20.5 years) until diagnosis was observed, and 60% of patients had a positive family history of angioedema. All HAE patients have been hospitalised a median two times during their lifetime. Skin (100%), abdominal (80%), and airway (80%) oedema were the most frequent symptoms. Triggering factors (60%) and prodromal symptoms (90%) were referred. Attacks were severe in 50% of patients, moderate in 10%, and mild in 40%. Pathogenic variations of SERPING1 were identified in eight patients (six families), confirming the diagnosis molecularly. In two patients (two families), no pathogenic variations in the genes were found even after whole genome sequencing. Conclusions Current data shows a significant delay and clear underdiagnosis of HAE in Latvia. Higher awareness and better information and communication between doctors would improve the diagnosis and management of HAE; as would screening of family members, patients with recurrent angioedema unresponsive to antihistamines and glucocorticoids, and patients with recurrent episodes of severe, unexplained abdominal pain.",

    "abstract": "Primary antibody deficiencies (PAD) are characterized by a heterogeneous clinical presentation and low prevalence, contributing to a median diagnostic delay of 3-10 years. This increases the risk of morbidity and mortality from undiagnosed PAD, which may be prevented with adequate therapy. To reduce the diagnostic delay of PAD, we developed a screening algorithm using primary care electronic health record (EHR) data to identify patients at risk of PAD. This screening algorithm can be used as an aid to notify general practitioners when further laboratory evaluation of immunoglobulins should be considered, thereby facilitating a timely diagnosis of PAD.Candidate components for the algorithm were based on a broad range of presenting signs and symptoms of PAD that are available in primary care EHRs. The decision on inclusion and weight of the components in the algorithm was based on the prevalence of these components among PAD patients and control groups, as well as clinical rationale.We analyzed the primary care EHRs of 30 PAD patients, 26 primary care immunodeficiency patients and 58,223 control patients. The median diagnostic delay of PAD patients was 9.5 years. Several candidate components showed a clear difference in prevalence between PAD patients and controls, most notably the mean number of antibiotic prescriptions in the 4 years prior to diagnosis (5.14 vs. 0.48). The final algorithm included antibiotic prescriptions, diagnostic codes for respiratory tract and other infections, gastro-intestinal complaints, auto-immune symptoms, malignancies and lymphoproliferative symptoms, as well as laboratory values and visits to the general practitioner.In this study, we developed a screening algorithm based on a broad range of presenting signs and symptoms of PAD, which is suitable to implement in primary care. It has the potential to considerably reduce diagnostic delay in PAD, and will be validated in a prospective study.

Several studies have now documented safety and efficacy of food ladders.

Our study adds to the growing body of evidence supporting food ladder use and provides safety and effectiveness data for our Canadian adaptation of the milk and egg ladders.Surveys were distributed to families of children using the Canadian Milk Ladder and/or the Canadian Egg Ladder at baseline, with follow up surveys at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. Data were analyzed using REDCap and descriptive and inferential statistics are presented.One hundred and nine participants were started on milk/egg ladders between September 2020 and June 2022. 53 participants responded to follow up surveys. Only 2 of 53 (3.8%) participants reported receiving epinephrine during the study. Severe grade 4 reactions (defined according to the modified World Allergy Organization grading system) were not reported by any participants. Minor cutaneous adverse reactions were common, with about 71% (n = 10/14) of respondents reporting cutaneous adverse reactions by 1 year of food ladder use. An increasing proportion of participants could tolerate most foods from steps 2-4 foods after 3, 6, and 12 months of the food ladder compared to baseline.The Canadian food ladders are safe tools for children with cow's milk and/or egg allergies, and participants tolerated a larger range of foods with food ladder use compared to baseline.",

Many novel approaches are being designed to reduce the allergenicity of immunotherapy preparations whilst maintaining immunogenicity. One approach is the use of short synthetic peptides which representing dominant T cell epitopes of the allergen. Short peptides exhibit markedly reduced capacity to cross link IgE and activate mast cells and basophils, due to lack of tertiary structure. Murine pre-clinical studies have established the feasibility of this approach and clinical studies are currently in progress in both allergic and autoimmune diseases.",

Among the safety concerns with the use of INCs are the potential for growth suppression both short and long term, the potential for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression, ocular safety, and the use of INCs concomitantly with inhaled corticosteroids in asthma patients. As all clinicians are aware, each patient can have individual responses to both efficacy and safety; however, the data reviewed suggest that the benefits outweigh the potential risks.

    "abstract": "Specific immunotherapy is the only treatment able to act on the causes and not only on the symptoms of respiratory allergy. Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) was introduced as an option to subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT), the clinical effectiveness of which is partly counterbalanced by the issue of adverse systemic reactions, which occur at a frequency of about 0.2% of injections and 2-5% of the patients and may also be life-threatening. A large number of trials, globally evaluated by several meta-analyses, demonstrated that SLIT is an effective and safe treatment for allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma, severe reactions being extremely rare. The application of SLIT is favored by a good compliance, higher than that reported for SCIT, in which the injections are a major factor for noncompliance because of inconvenience, and by its cost-effectiveness. In fact, a number of studies showed that SLIT may be very beneficial to the healthcare system, especially when its effectiveness persists after treatment withdrawal because of the induced immunologic changes.",

Lack of knowledge of underlying molecular mechanisms together with incomplete data on long term outcome have made it difficult to assess prognosis and give the most effective treatment. Rapid progress in defining molecular defects, improved supportive care and much improved results from hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) now mean that curative treatment is possible for many patients. However, this depends on prompt recognition, accurate diagnosis and careful treatment planning. This review will discuss recent progress in our clinical and molecular understanding of a variety of disorders including: severe combined immunodeficiency, specific T cell immunodeficiencies, signaling defects, DNA repair defects, immune-osseous dysplasias, thymic disorders and abnormalities of apoptosis. There is still much to discover in this area and some conditions which are as yet very poorly understood. However, with increased knowledge about how these disorders can present and the particular problems each group may face it is hoped that these patients can be recognized early and managed appropriately, so providing them with the best possible outcome.",

Few studies have directly measured pollen exposures at different points during pregnancy and in early life, and assessed their effects on risk of respiratory disease outcomes.

Hospital admission data for respiratory conditions in the first year of life was also collected. Out of 110,381 children, 940 had been hospitalised for asthma by 12-months of age. Pollen levels showed both marked seasonal variations and between year differences. Exposure to high levels of pollen in the last 12 weeks of pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of asthma hospitalisation (aOR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.07-1.71 for highest quartile versus remaining infants). Exposure to high levels of pollen in the first three months of life was associated with a reduced risk (aOR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.59-0.98) but only in children of heavy smoking mothers. High levels of pollen exposure during late pregnancy were somewhat unexpectedly associated with an elevated risk of hospitalisation for asthma within the first year of life.",

Intervention patients slept on pillows and mattresses or futons encased in microfine-fiber covers and were counseled in allergen avoidance through bedroom cleaning. Control patients received neither special covers nor counseling. In the period August to October in 2009 (pre-intervention) and 2010 (post-intervention), dust samples were collected in open Petri dishes placed in bedrooms for 2 weeks and by rapid lifting of dust from bedding and skin using adhesive tape on the morning of 1 day of Petri dish placement. We examined the associations between changes in Der 1 level (as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and clinical symptom score, minimum % peak expiratory flow, and fraction of exhaled nitric oxide.Der 1 allergen levels on the mattress/futon covers and near the floor of the bedrooms of intervention patients, but not controls, were lower in 2010 than in 2009. From 2009 to 2010, asthma symptom scores decreased significantly, and minimum % peak expiratory flow increased significantly, in intervention patients. The fall in Der p 1 concentration was correlated with a reduction in the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide.Minimization of Der 1 allergen exposure by encasing pillows and mattresses or futons and receiving counseling on avoiding exposure to indoor allergens improved asthma control in adult patients.",

These food allergens have been implicated in OAS and have structural antigenic similarity to that of birch and/or grass. Both patients' allergies were confirmed by fresh skin prick tests. In both cases, strenuous exercise was antecedent to the systemic anaphylaxis reaction and subsequent ingestion without exercise produced only local symptoms of perioral pruritus. We review the current proposed mechanisms for food and exercise induced anaphylaxis to oral allergens and propose a novel and more biologically plausible mechanism. We hypothesize that the inhibitory effects of exercise on gastric acid secretion decreases the digestion of oral allergens and preserves structural integrity, thereby allowing continued systemic absorption of the allergen whether it be profilins, lipid transfer proteins, or other antigenic determinants.",

The relationship between subjective asthma symptoms and airway inflammation is an important issue. We expected that the subjective asthma symptoms in women might be different from those in men. Therefore, we investigated the gender differences of asthma symptoms and FENO in a survey of asthma prevalence in university students.The information about asthma symptoms was obtained from answers to the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) questionnaire, and FENO was measured by an offline method in 640 students who were informed of this study and consented to participate.The prevalence of asthma symptoms on the basis of data obtained from 584 students (266 men and 318 women), ranging in age from 18 to 24 years, was analyzed. Wheeze, chest tightness, an attack of shortness of breath, or an attack of cough within the last year was observed in 13.2% of 584 students. When 38.0 ppb was used as the cut-off value of FENO to make the diagnosis of asthma, the sensitivity was 86.8% and the specificity was 74.0%. FENO was ≥ 38.0 ppb in 32.7% of students. FENO was higher in men than in women. The prevalence of asthma symptoms estimated by considering FENO was 7.2%; the prevalence was greater in men (9.4%) than women (5.3%). A FENO ≥ 38.0 ppb was common in students who reported wheeze, but not in students, especially women, who reported cough attacks.The prevalence of asthma symptoms in university students age 18 to 24 years in Japan was estimated to be 7.2% on the basis of FENO levels as well as subjective symptoms. Gender differences were observed in both FENO levels and asthma symptoms reflecting the presence of eosinophilic airway inflammation.UMIN000003244.",

We used the International Study of Allergy and Asthma in Children questionnaire with added questions relevant to the population. In addition, skin prick tests were conducted to test for sensitization to common food and environmental allergens.The prevalence of current asthma was 15.9% (> 2:1 males) with the highest prevalence among those with any non-Inuit heritage at 38.5%. The prevalence of current and past allergic rhinitis was 6.8%, also predominant among males, with the lowest prevalence among the mixed ethnicity. Home crowdedness was inversely related to past asthma. Being ever outside Nunavut was associated with higher prevalence of current and past asthma. No statistically significant relationship was found with passive smoking or exclusive breast feeding during the first 4 months of life. The current eczema prevalence was 20.5%, with the highest prevalence recorded among the Inuit at 25% compared to 15.4% among the mixed ethnicity and 14.3% among the non-Inuit. We noted a high rate of sensitization to cat at 26.7% while absent sensitization to other common inhalant allergens.Variations in the prevalence and risk factors of asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema among different ethnicities living at the same subarctic environment may be related to genetic, gene-environment interaction and/or lifestyle factors that require further investigation.",

Studies of the interaction of helminth and malaria co-infection in humans have been few and are mainly epidemiological, with little information on cellular immune responses. This study aimed to determine Cytokine profiles among patients co-infected with Plasmodium falciparum malaria and soil borne helminth attending Kampala International University Teaching Hospital (KIU). A case control study of 240 patients were recruited at KIU teaching hospital. Patients with Plasmodium falciparum malaria were 55 (22.9%) and those with soil-borne helminths were 63 (26.3%). The controls were 89 (37.1%), while those co-infected with Plasmodium falciparum malaria and soil-borne helminths were 33 (13.8%). Cases were defined as having a positive blood smear for P. falciparum malaria, those with helminths or co-infections of the two. Negative controls were those with a negative blood smear for P. falciparum malaria and those with no stool parasitic infections. Patients presenting with signs and symptoms of malaria or those suspected of having helminths were recruited for the study. A panel of five cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, TGF-β and IL-10) were assayed from plasma samples in patients with and without Plasmodium falciparum malaria, patients with and without helminth, and then those co-infected with the two diseases diagnosis was done using thick blood smears stained with 10% Giemsa and stool examination was done following the Kato Katz technique following standard procedures. The prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum malaria by sex was 28 (11.7%) and 27 (11.3%) in male and female respectively. The overall prevalence of soil borne helminth was 26.3%, and among those harbouring helminths, 13.8% were co-infected with Plasmodium falciparum. Cytokine levels significantly differed across Plasmodium falciparum malaria, soil borne helminth infected patients and health controls for IFN-γ (P = 0.023), IL-10 (P = 0.008) and TGF-β (P = 0.0001). Cytokine levels significantly differed across Plasmodium falciparum malaria, soil borne helminth infected patients and patients co-infected with Plasmodium falciparum malaria and soil borne helminth for IL-10 (P = 0.004), IL-6 (P = 0.011) and TGF-β (P = 0.003). An up-regulation of IFN-γ during Plasmodium falciparum malaria and an up-regulation of IL-10 and TGF-β in soil borne helminth infections was demonstrated. We demonstrate that co-infections of Plasmodium falciparum and soil borne helminth lead to an up-regulation of IL-10 and IL-6 and a down-regulation of TGF-β. Trial registration No17/10-16",

    "abstract": "Stratification of patients with severe asthma by blood eosinophil counts predicts responders to anti-interleukin (IL)-5 (mepolizumab and reslizumab) and anti-IL-5 receptor α (benralizumab) therapies. This study characterized patients with severe asthma who could qualify for these biologics in a primary care setting. We retrospectively selected patients from July 1, 2010, to June 30, 2014, using a linked electronic medical records (EMR) database (IMS Evidence 360 EMR Canada) for > 950,000 patients in primary care in Ontario, Canada. Patients aged ≥ 12 years with ≥ 2 documented asthma diagnoses were identified as having severe asthma based on prescriptions for high-dosage inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus either a leukotriene receptor antagonist, long-acting β2-agonist (LABA), or theophylline filled on the same day. Patients' asthma was considered severe also if they received a prescription for ICS with oral corticosteroids (OCS) or an additional prescription for omalizumab. Patient characteristics, asthma-related medications, and blood eosinophil counts were captured using observed care patterns for the year prior to ICS/LABA and/or OCS prescription. Health care resource use (HCRU) and costs were captured throughout the 1-year follow-up period. We identified 212 patients who met the criteria for severe asthma. These patients required an average of 6.5 physician visits during the 1-year follow-up period (95% confidence interval 5.7-7.3), and 20 (9%) were referred to respiratory specialists. Overall, 56 patients (26%) with severe asthma had complete blood counts, of whom 23 (41%) had blood eosinophil counts ≥ 300 cells/μL and might be considered for anti-eosinophil therapies. Patients with severe asthma and blood eosinophil counts ≥ 300 cells/μL had more respiratory specialist referrals (17% vs. 12%) than patients with blood eosinophils < 300 cells/μL. Our data suggest that during 2010-2014, Ontario primary care patients with severe asthma and high blood eosinophil counts had greater HRCU than those with lower counts. Approximately 41% of patients with severe asthma could qualify for anti-eosinophil drugs based on blood eosinophil counts. However, the eosinophilic status of most patients was unknown. It is appropriate to increase awareness of the use of blood eosinophil counts to identify patients who could be considered for anti-eosinophil therapies.",

Treatment of chronic AD usually focuses on topical regimen of emolients and immunosuppressants, although systemic immunosuppressive therapy is sometimes required in more severe cases. Omalizumab is a humanized monoclonal anti- IgE antibody that binds at the high-affinity receptor (FceRI) binding site that has revealed some potential in the treatment of severe and recalcitrant AD [2]. Case Here, we present the case of a 11-years-old girl who has been under treatment with Omalizumab for the past five years. The patient first presented at 2 months of age with a global and severe AD involving. She was severely atopic with total IgE levels of 121,000, mild asthma, and multiple food allergies. Treatment with oral prednisone, cyclosporin, azathioprine and intravenous immunoglobulins did not improve her skin symptoms significantly. She was hospitalised multiple times for skin infections attributed to the disease and immunosuppressive medication. Treatment with Omalizumab was initiated at 6 years of age. Four months later, SCORAD index improved significantly. Since, her follow-up has been almost free of any remarkable event and treatment with Omalizumab has been well tolerated.",

Clinical parameters, sputum cell counts, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cytokine production and activation marker expression were determined. All of the CA had methacholine airway hyperresponsiveness compared with only half of the RA subjects. The CA showed elevated numbers of eosinophils and increased ECP and IL-5 in sputum, which were not observed in the RA. PBMC cytokine studies revealed increased production of the type 1 cytokines IL-12, IFN-γ and TNF-α in the CA group compared with the RA group, under a range of activation conditions, however, the production of IL-4 and IL-5 were unchanged.

The treatment of atopic diseases with steroid and immunosuppressive agents induces opportunistic infection.

We report an unusual case of an atopic shield ulcer with Kocuria keratitis.A 51-year-old Japanese man presented with a 14-day history of eye pain and visual loss in his left eye. At the initial examination, a shield ulcer was observed in the upper-central cornea of the left eye, and the conjunctiva in both eyes had a velvety appearance due to papillary formation, as well as hyperemia and swelling in the palpebral area. The shield ulcer showed white stromal opacification in the marginal zone with a coral-like appearance. Samples were obtained by corneal scraping, and Kocuria sp. was identified by microbiological examination including culture and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis was performed using isolated Kocuria strain from the patient. The obtained DNA sequence showed 99% homology with Kocuria koreensis. The combination of corneal scraping and instillation of cefmenoxime antibiotic ophthalmic solution was considered useful for the treatment of Kocuria keratitis.Clinicians should be aware of Kocuria keratitis as a corneal complication of AKC, and that rapid diagnosis of Kocuria keratitis may improve visual prognosis.",

However, despite the use of long-term prophylaxis (LTP), breakthrough attacks are known to occur. We used data from the Icatibant Outcome Survey (IOS) to evaluate the characteristics of breakthrough attacks and the effectiveness of icatibant as a treatment option. METHODS: Data on LTP use, attacks, and treatments were recorded. Attack characteristics, treatment characteristics, and outcomes (time to treatment, time to resolution, and duration of attack) were compared for attacks that occurred with versus without LTP. RESULTS: Data on 3228 icatibant-treated attacks from 448 patients with C1-INH-HAE were analyzed; 30.1% of attacks occurred while patients were using LTP. Attack rate, attack severity, and the distribution of attack sites were similar across all types of LTP used, and were comparable to the results found in patients who did not receive LTP. Attacks were successfully treated with icatibant; 82.5% of all breakthrough attacks were treated with a single icatibant injection without C1-INH rescue medication. Treatment outcomes were comparable for breakthrough attacks across all LTP types, and for attacks without LTP. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who use LTP should be aware that breakthrough attacks can occur, and such attacks can be severe. Thus, patients with C1-INH-HAE using LTP should have emergency treatment readily available. Data from IOS show that icatibant is effective for the treatment of breakthrough attacks.

We previously demonstrated the feasibility of desensitization for up to 5 food allergens simultaneously through OIT. In this observational study, we report the findings of long-term follow-up (LTFU) of the participants treated through a single site OIT phase 1 trial. Methods The participants (n = 46) were followed up to 72 months since the time they reached 2 g maintenance dose per food in the initial phase 1 trial. During the long-term maintenance dosing, participants continued or reduced the initial maintenance dose of food allergen protein to high (median 2 g protein) vs. low (median 300 mg protein). Participant follow-up included clinical monitoring, standardized OFCs, and in some cases, skin prick tests and measurement of allergen-specific IgE and IgG 4 . Results Irrespective of the high vs. low long-term maintenance dose during LTFU, all participants were able to ingest 2 g protein of each food allergen protein during OFCs performed at the end of our LTFU. Conclusion Our LTFU cohort of food OIT participants from a single site, phase 1 OIT study, supports the feasibility of sustained desensitization through long-term maintenance dosing.

    "abstract": "T cells play a central role in chronic inflammation in asthma. However, the roles of individual subsets of T cells in the pathology of asthma in patients remain to be better understood. We investigated the potential signatures of T cell subset phenotypes in asthma using fresh whole blood from adult atopic asthma patients (n = 43) and non-asthmatic control subjects (n = 22). We further assessed their potential clinical implications by correlating asthma severity. We report four major features of CD4+ T cells in the blood of atopic asthma patients. First, patients had a profound increase of CCR7+ memory CD4+ T cells, but not CCR7− memory CD4+ T cells. Second, an increase in CCR4+ CD4+ T cells in patients was mainly attributed to the increase of CCR7+ memory CD4+ T cells. Accordingly, the frequency of CCR4+CCR7+ memory CD4+ T cells correlated with asthma severity. Current common asthma therapeutics (including corticosteroids) were not able to affect the frequency of CCR4+CCR7+ memory CD4+ T cell subsets. Third, patients had an increase of Tregs, as assessed by measuring CD25, Foxp3, IL-10 and CTLA-4 expression. However, asthma severity was inversely correlated only with the frequency of CTLA-4+ CD4+ T cells. Lastly, patients and control subjects have similar frequencies of CD4+ T cells that express CCR5, CCR6, CXCR3, CXCR5, CD11a, or α4 integrin. However, the frequency of α4+ CD4+ T cells in patients correlated with asthma severity. CCR4+CCR7+ memory, but not CCR4+CCR7− memory, α4+, and CTLA4+ CD4+ T cells in patients show significant clinical implications in atopic asthma. Current common therapeutics cannot alter the frequency of such CD4+ T cell subsets in adult atopic asthma patients.",

    "abstract": "Urban adolescents suffer a disproportionate burden of asthma morbidity, often in association with allergies. Literature is limited on comparing various types of allergies regarding prevalence and associations with asthma morbidity in urban dwelling adolescents. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of common allergies reported by urban adolescents and to assess their relationships to healthcare utilization and asthma control. Study participants included 313 urban adolescents (12-20 years of age) with persistent asthma who were recruited from three states in the United States. Self-report data were collected on nine indoor and outdoor allergies, healthcare utilization, and asthma exacerbation. Logistic regressions and zero-inflated Poisson regressions were conducted to examine the relationships between allergies and asthma morbidity. The mean age of participants was 14.58 (± 1.97) and 52% were female, and 79% were black. Seventy-three percent (n = 229) reported one or more allergies. Dust mite and grass allergies were most common, each reported by 50%. The prevalence of pest allergies (cockroach and mouse) was 27.5% and 19%, respectively. Those with pest allergies were more likely to report ED visits (cockroach- Odds Ratio (OR) = 2.16, 95% CI 1.18-3.94, p = .01; mouse- OR = 2.13, 95% CI 1.09-4.07, p = .02), specialist visits (cockroach-OR = 2.69, 95% CI 1.60-4.54, p < .001; mouse- OR = 2.06, 95% CI 1.15-3.68, p = .01) and asthma exacerbation (cockroach-OR = 2.17, 95% CI 1.26-3.74, p < .001; mouse- OR = 2.30, 95% CI 1.26-4.18, p = .01). Cockroach allergies were associated with 2.2 times as many nights in the hospital (95% CI 1.053-3.398, p = 0.036) and 2.2 times as many specialist visits (95% CI 1.489-3.110, p < 0.001), and mouse allergy was associated with 1.6 times as many ED visits (95% CI 1.092-2.257, p = 0.015) compared to those without pest allergies. Concomitant occurrence of allergies is ubiquitous among urban adolescents with asthma. Only pest allergies, of those examined, appear to have implications for poorly controlled asthma, exacerbation and acute healthcare utilization. To reduce asthma burden in urban adolescents, identification and management of high-risk adolescents with pest allergen sensitization and exposure are warranted.",

Furthermore, reports of prevalence of NAR in Chinese subjects are scarce. Thus, we aimed to explore the prevalence and risk factors of AR and NAR in a Chinese, based on both clinical manifestation and allergic status. We conducted a population-based cross-sectional survey, involving 1084 local residents from a rural area of Beijing, China. Participants were enrolled using a stratified two-stage cluster sampling method. All adult participants or the guardians of children completed standardized questionnaires to provide relevant demographic and clinical information. Skin prick tests were also performed to determine sensitization to specific aeroallergens. AR/NAR was classified according to Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma criteria. Prevalence of self-reported AR was 46.80%. Based on SPT results, the confirmed standardized prevalence of AR and NAR were 16.78% and 24.60%, respectively. Severity scores for nasal itching, sneezing, rhinorrhea and congestion were significantly higher in subjects with AR, than subjects with NAR (P < 0.05 for all). The three most common aeroallergens in self-reported AR group were Blattella germanica (16.6%), Dermatophagoides farinae (14.6%), and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (13.9%). Family history of AR and atopic dermatitis were significantly associated with AR (adjusted OR: 4.97 and 2.69, respectively), whereas family history of AR and asthma were significantly associated with NAR (adjusted OR: 3.53 and 2.45, respectively). Similarly, comorbid asthma, CRS, and atopic dermatitis were significant risk factors for both AR and NAR. Combination of standardized questionnaires and specific allergen tests may provide more accurate estimates of prevalence of AR and NAR and associated risk factors.",

A self-reported questionnaire was mailed to the parents of children aged 1-2 years who had participated in the RCT. Data were analyzed using a Chi square test, by intention to treat analysis, and by multiple logistic regression.Of 155 infants, 22 (14.2%) and 28 (18.1%) had food allergies and AD/eczema until 2 years of age, respectively. No significant difference was seen in food allergies or AD between the group that received moisturizer skincare intervention and the control group. On the contrary, food allergies until 2 years of age were significantly associated with short-term (4-7 days) and long-term (more than 7 days) body skin problems occurring in the first 3 months of life, a family history of AD, and the time of starting complementary food. High value of face transepidermal water loss at 3 months of age was also associated with food allergies. Moreover, a short duration of severe diaper dermatitis during the first 3 months, a family history of AD, and being male were significantly associated with AD/eczema until the age of 2 years.After adjusting for family history of AD, a short-term skin problem in the first 3 months of life was significantly associated with the development of food allergies or AD/eczema until the age of 2 years. Prevention or prompt treatment of skin problems in newborns is essential for preventing future allergic diseases.Trial registration This was a follow-up study conducted 2 years after the completed RCT of a moisturizer skincare intervention for early infants, which was registered in the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN000013260).",

    "abstract": "Food allergy is an important public health problem because it affects children and adults, can be severe and even life-threatening, and may be increasing in prevalence. Beginning in 2008, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, working with other organizations and advocacy groups, led the development of the first clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and management of food allergy. A recent landmark clinical trial and other emerging data suggest that peanut allergy can be prevented through introduction of peanut-containing foods beginning in infancy. Prompted by these findings, along with 25 professional organizations, federal agencies, and patient advocacy groups, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases facilitated development of addendum guidelines to specifically address the prevention of peanut allergy. The addendum provides 3 separate guidelines for infants at various risk levels for the development of peanut allergy and is intended for use by a wide variety of health care providers. Topics addressed include the definition of risk categories, appropriate use of testing (specific IgE measurement, skin prick tests, and oral food challenges), and the timing and approaches for introduction of peanut-containing foods in the health care provider’s office or at home. The addendum guidelines provide the background, rationale, and strength of evidence for each recommendation. Guidelines have been developed for early introduction of peanut-containing foods into the diets of infants at various risk levels for peanut allergy.",

Patients requiring subcutaneous (SC) Ig (SCIG) typically start with intravenous dosing before transitioning to SCIG weekly maintenance. In this retrospective review, we investigated an alternate strategy with higher initial SC doses among an older patient population with antibody deficiency syndromes.Records of 13 patients (mean age, 70 years) with antibody deficiencies who were naive to treatment with Ig were assessed. SCIG (Vivaglobin® [Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human), 16% Liquid] or Hizentra® [Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human), 20% Liquid]) was given twice weekly (100 mg/kg) for 2 weeks, followed by weekly (100 mg/kg) administration The mean pretreatment IgG level was 460 mg/dL; at 1, 3, and 6 months after SCIG initiation, mean IgG serum levels were 852, 907, and 943 mg/dL, respectively. Maintenance doses were unchanged during 6 months of follow-up. All patients remain on SCIG (median, 44 months). One patient developed sepsis/cholangitis unrelated to treatment 3 months after starting SCIG; no other serious bacterial infections were reported.Initiation of SCIG by doubling the maintenance dose over 2 weeks may be a well-tolerated and effective option for patients with antibody deficiencies requiring Ig replacement, especially among older patients.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence indicates a strong correlation between allergic disease and cardiovascular risks. In spite of this, the data concerning the association between allergic rhinitis (AR) and cardiovascular risks is sparse and conflicting. This study aimed to investigate the association between AR prevalence and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in a large-scale, population-based survey, while considering the relevant risk factors. A nationwide cross-sectional study was conducted based on data from 30,590 subjects aged 19 years and older, from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Survey 2007–2013. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) of AR prevalence, based on MetS status and the presence of any MetS component, were calculated using multiple logistic regression analyses. Regarding the characteristics of patients with AR and/or MetS, some variables had significant associations with disease in inverse directions for AR and MetS. Multivariate logistic analysis, with adjustments for demographic variables and health habits, indicated that AR prevalence was significantly lower in subjects with MetS (OR 0.84; 95 % CI 0.76–0.93), high blood pressure (OR 0.85; 95 % CI 0.77–0.94), or impaired fasting glucose (OR 0.81; 95 % CI 0.73–0.89). Furthermore, high blood pressure and impaired fasting glucose were significant predictors for reduced AR prevalence, independently of other MetS components. In this population, AR was diagnosed less frequently in subjects with metabolic conditions. Well-designed prospective studies allowing for medical service utilization and collaborative basic research are warranted to elucidate the mechanism responsible for this inverse relationship.",

Current guidelines provide insufficient support for therapeutic management strategy of these patients. Allergists however have long-term experience with AIT. This study aims to describe the characteristics of the patients seen in clinical practice with HDM allergy and the process used to determine whether AIT should be initiated. This was an observational, multicenter, prospective and cross-sectional study, conducted in France from 2013 to 2014 with a representative sample of allergy specialists. Any patient over 5 years of age with confirmed HDM allergy untreated with AIT within the last 12 months was eligible. Data were prospectively collected using physician and patient questionnaires. A total of 1589 patients (60 % adults, 40 % children) were included by 195 randomly selected allergists. A subgroup of 1212 patients (median age: 22 years; 52 % women) were selected for AIT treatment with a median time of AR diagnosis of 3 years. Amongst these, 59 % had a moderate to severe persistent AR according to AR and its Impact on Asthma guidelines, 57.5 % were polysensitized, and 56.5 % also suffered from conjunctivitis (median rhinitis total symptom score: 11). Asthma was present in 42 % of patients, and was controlled according to Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines in 62 % of patients. The asthma control questionnaire score was 1–1.5 in 20 % and ≥1.5 in 37 % of patients. A total of 57 % patients received a prescription of ≥2 medications (mainly antihistamines). Usual daily activities and sleep quality were slightly-to-moderately impaired as the mean rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire score was 2.7 ± 1.5. The major driver of AIT prescription is AR uncontrolled by previous medications leading to patient dissatisfaction. HDM-AR associated conjunctivitis was present in 60 % and asthma in 40 % of cases. In >40 % of these cases, asthma was inadequately controlled at the start of AIT.",

    "abstract": "Cow's milk allergy is one of the most common food allergies affecting young children. A subset of milk-allergic individuals can eat baked milk without allergic symptoms which is beneficial in terms of prognostication and liberalization of the diet. A retrospective study suggested that skin prick testing (SPT) with a baked milk (muffin) slurry may provide a sensitive means of predicting the outcome of a medically supervised baked milk oral food challenge. We evaluated the predictive value of SPT with baked milk to identify unheated milk-allergic children who are able to safely eat baked milk.Children aged 2-16 years with a prior history of reaction to milk and a milk extract SPT of 8-14 mm were recruited. Investigator-blinded SPT to muffin slurry and powdered milk in triplicate and specific IgE (sIgE) to casein and milk were performed. Graded oral challenge to egg-free baked milk muffins (total 2.6 gm milk protein) was performed in the hospital. Reliability of tests was analyzed for intraclass correlation. Statistical significance for clinical characteristics of population and muffin testing versus baked milk reactivity was calculated with Fisher exact test for dichotomous and t-test for continuous variables. Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare immunological characteristics between individuals who tolerated or reacted to baked milk. Fitted predicted probability curves and ROC curves were generated.Thirty-eight children were consented and 30 met study criteria. The muffin SPT and casein sIgE were significantly different in those who passed versus failed baked milk challenge. Negative (<3 mm) baked milk tests were found in 8/30 children (27 %) and were associated with non-reactivity to baked milk (p = 0.01) with a sensitivity of 1 (0.70-1.00). All children with negative SPT for baked milk passed the oral challenge. Specificity was 0.41 (0.19-0.67). The optimal decision point for the muffin SPT was 4 mm and the casein sIgE was 6 kU/L. The powdered milk test was not helpful.Skin prick testing with a baked milk (muffin) slurry may have a role in clinical practice to identify baked milk tolerance in milk-allergic patients.",

In immunodeficient patients, there has been controversy whether initial loading doses of intravenous (IVIG) should be based on actual body weight or a calculated parameter such as adjusted body weight in obese patients.I describe a patient with Common Variable Immunodeficiency disorder (CVID) who underwent bariatric surgery for morbid obesity. Her weight decreased by 50% to below her calculated ideal body weight (IBW) while her immunoglobulin requirement fell by approximately 20%. Her steady state serum IgG increased from approximately 7 g/l to 11.7 g/l concomitant with weight loss.I present this observation as support for the recommendation that initial loading doses of SCIG/IVIG in immunodeficiency should be based on adjusted body weight (AjBW) and not actual body weight in obese patients. This has important fiscal implications for treating obese patients with immunodeficiency disorders.",

This study aimed to explore the effects of artemisinin alone or combined with neurectomy of pterygoid canal in ovalbumin-induced AR mouse model and illustrate the underlying mechanisms. Allergic symptoms were evaluated to verify inhibitory effect of artemisinin alone or combined with neurectomy of pterygoid canal on AR. Serum levels of histamine, immunoglobulin E (IgE) and inflammatory factors TNF, INF-γ, IL-1β IL-10, IL-4 and IL-5 were measured by ELISA. The mRNA levels of TNF, INF-γ, IL-1β and IL-10 in local lymph nodes were measured by RT-qPCR. The total and phosphorylated levels of ERK and JNK were assessed by Western blot. CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T (Treg) cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Artemisinin significantly relieved the behavior symptoms of AR mice. The administration of artemisinin strikingly suppressed the expression of histamine, IgE and inflammatory factors. An increased Treg cell proportion and inhibited ERK phosphorylation were observed in artemisinin-treated groups as compared to those in the AR group. Moreover, artemisinin plus neurectomy of pterygoid almost abolished the behavioral score increase in AR mice. These results indicated that artemisinin exhibited anti-allergic effect by inhibiting ERK activation and increasing Treg cell proportion, which subsequently decreased the expressions of allergic mediators. In addition, artemisinin combined with neurectomy of pterygoid showed better efficacy than artemisinin alone.",

Although the aetiology of anaphylaxis in Western countries are well known, the causes in South Asian countries have not been reported. We sought to determine the causes of anaphylaxis in patients referred to an immunology clinic in Colombo, Sri Lanka.238 episodes of anaphylaxis were reviewed in 188 patients who were referred and skin prick tests and in vitro tests (ImmunoCap) were carried out to assess the presence of allergen specific IgE. Clinical features and severity of anaphylaxis was also recorded along with treatment received.Anaphylaxis to food either following direct exposure 90/238 (37.5%) or after exercise in the form of food dependent exercise induced anaphylaxis 29/238 (12.2%) was the predominant cause of anaphylaxis. Allergy to cow's milk and red meat, after immediate exposure, accounted for 66/238 (27.7%) of instances of all episodes of anaphylaxis and 66/90 (73.33%) of anaphylaxis due to food. Vaccines accounted for 28/238 (11.8%) of instances of anaphylaxis, especially among children. Of those who developed anaphylaxis to the MMR (n = 14), 71.4% of them had specific IgE to cow's milk and 35.7% of them had specific IgE to beef. Of those who developed anaphylaxis to insect stings, 27/42 of these episodes occurred following stings of ants (family Formicidae). The predominant cause of anaphylaxis changed with the age, with food allergy being the most frequent trigger of anaphylaxis in childhood, while drug allergy and idiopathic anaphylaxis being more frequent after 30 years of age.In this cohort, anaphylaxis to red meat appears to be the predominant cause of food induced anaphylaxis and presence of beef specific IgE and cow's milk, appears to be a predisposing factor for vaccine induced anaphylaxis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Women with hereditary angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency (HAE-C1INH) experience more frequent and severe angioedema attacks compared with men. Fluctuations in female sex hormones can influence HAE attack frequency and severity. Subcutaneous C1-INH (C1-INH [SC]) is indicated as routine prophylaxis to prevent HAE attacks. In this post hoc subgroup analysis, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of C1-INH (SC) in female subjects with HAE-C1INH enrolled in an open-label extension of the pivotal phase III COMPACT trial. Methods In this multicenter, randomized, parallel-arm trial, eligible subjects (age ≥ 6 years with ≥ 4 attacks over 2 consecutive months) received C1-INH (SC) 40 IU/kg or 60 IU/kg twice weekly for 52 to 140 weeks. Analyses of efficacy endpoints were performed for all female subjects and those of childbearing age (age ≥ 15 to ≤ 45 years), including subjects who became pregnant during the evaluation period. Results Overall, 91% (69/76) of female subjects were classified as responders (≥ 50% reduction in HAE attacks relative to the pre-study period); 82% experienced &lt; 1 attack/4 weeks. The median number of attacks/month was 0.10, with 96% median reduction in attacks relative to the pre-study period. Results were similar in the subgroup of subjects of childbearing age. Four women who became pregnant during the trial and were exposed to C1-INH (SC) during the first trimester delivered healthy babies with no congenital abnormalities. Conclusions C1-INH (SC) prophylaxis was safe and effective in women with HAE-C1INH, including those of childbearing age. Four women exposed to C1-INH (SC) during the first trimester had uneventful pregnancies and delivered healthy babies.

The aim of this study therefore was to investigate the role of EGF in regulation of mucin MUC5AC expression and define the involvement of transmembrane protein 16A (TMEM16A) in mediating the EGF-induced mucus overexpression.Human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) derived from tissue of patients with CRSwNP and control subjects were established as air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures. Differentiated cultures were treated with different concentrations of EGF for 4-24 h, and assessed for the expression of TMEM16A and MUC5AC by real-time RT-PCR, Western blotting, ELISA and immunofluorescence. Cultures pretreated for 30 min with T16Ainh-A01 (a specific TMEM16A inhibitor) or LY294002 (a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor) were also assessed similarly following EGF treatment.EGF treatment (10-100 ng/ml for 4-24 h) significantly increased the expression of both TMEM16A and MUC5AC mRNA and protein, as well as the percentage of TMEM16A-positive cells, MUC5AC-positive cells and cells coexpressing TMEM16A and MUC5AC in HNECs compared to control non-EGF-treated HNECs. Pretreatment of the HNECs with T16Ainh-A01 and LY294002 attenuated these EGF-induced effects.This study demonstrated that EGF upregulates the expression of MUC5AC in HNECs from CRSwNP patients. Furthermore, the EGF-mediated regulation of MUC5AC expression is likely to involve a PI3K-TMEM16A signalling pathway in CRSwNP.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency, has been associated with atopy and lack of asthma control. Our objective was to investigate associations between variants in genes of vitamin D pathway with serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), atopy, asthma and asthma severity in teenagers from Northeast Brazil. This is a cross sectional study nested in a cohort population of asthma. 25(OH)D was quantified from 968 of 11-17 years old individuals by ELISA. Asthma diagnosis was obtained by using the ISAAC Phase III questionnaire. Specific IgE was determined by ImmunoCAP; genotyping was performed using the 2.5 HumanOmni Biochip from Illumina. Statistical analyses were performed in PLINK 1.07 and SPSS 22.1. After quality control, 104 Single Nucleotides Variants (SNVs) in vitamin D pathway genes, typed in 792 individuals, were included in the analysis. The allele A of rs10875694 on VDR was positively associated with atopy (OR = 1.35; 95% CI 1.01-1.81). The allele C of rs9279 on VDR, was negatively associated with asthma risk (OR = 0.66; 95% CI 0.45-0.97), vitamin D insufficiency (OR = 0.78; 95% CI 0.70-0.96) and higher VDR expression. Two variants in VDR were associated with asthma severity, the allele A of rs2189480 (OR = 0.34; 95% CI 0.13-0.89) and the allele G of rs4328262 (OR = 3.18; 95% CI 1.09-9.28). The combination of variants in CYP2R1 and CYP24A1 (GAC, to rs10500804, rs12794714 and rs3886163, respectively) was negatively associated with vitamin D production (β = - 1.24; 95% CI - 2.42 to - 0.06). Genetic variants in the vitamin D pathway affect vitamin D serum levels and, thus, atopy and asthma.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a disease characterised by hyper responsiveness and bronchoconstriction of airways, and is a major health burden globally. A dysfunction of the oxidant-antioxidant balance, termed oxidative stress, has been implicated in the pathophysiology of asthma. The present study aims to assess the changes in oxidative stress markers, namely nitric oxide metabolites and antioxidant capacity, in children with poorly controlled and well controlled asthma, in comparison to healthy controls.The present study enrolled 72 children (ages 5-15 years) classified into three groups: (1) poorly controlled asthma (n = 20), (2) well controlled asthma (n = 24) and (3) healthy controls (n = 27). An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to record socio-demographic data of the participants. The serum concentrations of the oxidant markers (nitrite, nitrate and total nitric oxide metabolites [NOx]) were determined using the Griess test, and the total antioxidant capacity (TAOC) was determined using the ABTS decolorisation method. The concentrations of these markers were compared across the three groups.The three study groups were similar in terms of socio-demographic data. The differences across the three groups were statistically significant for serum concentrations of nitrate and NOx (but not nitrite) and serum TAOC. Further analyses showed that the disparity for nitrate and NOx concentrations was greatest between poorly controlled asthma and healthy controls (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001) compared to the well-controlled asthmatics and healthy controls (p = 0.036 and p = 0.049). A significant difference in serum nitrate and NOx concentrations was not observed between the two asthma groups (p = 0.311 and 0.203). The TAOC were significantly lower in poorly controlled asthmatics as compared to well-controlled asthmatics (p = 0.003) and healthy controls (p < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in the serum TAOC between healthy controls and well-controlled asthmatics (p = 0.496). These findings may indicate that it is perhaps the higher TAOC that contributes to the well controlled state of asthma.The present study indicated that an imbalance of oxidants and antioxidants in the serum may have an underlying role in asthma pathophysiology, and how these markers may be effective in asthma management.",

The objective of this research was to explore caregiver burden in terms of psychosocial and productivity impact of caring for a child with peanut allergy, the influence of caregiver and child gender on caregiver burden, and factors predicting caregiver burden in peanut allergy. A cross-sectional survey of caregivers of children with peanut allergy was conducted in the United Kingdom, and included sociodemographic and clinical questions, EQ-5D, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Food Allergy Quality of Life-Parental Burden, Food Allergy Independent Measure, and productivity questions. One hundred caregivers (55% female) of children with peanut allergy (aged 4-15 years) completed the survey. Male and female caregivers reported mean levels of anxiety significantly higher than United Kingdom population norms. Caregivers of children with severe peanut allergy reported significant impacts on their careers and health-related quality of life. Neither caregiver nor child gender impacted burden, indicating that male and female caregivers are equally anxious and suffer the same level of negative career, productivity, and health-related quality-of-life impact due to their child's peanut allergy. Caregivers' perceived risk of outcomes related to their child's peanut allergy (e.g., death or severe reaction) as measured by the Food Allergy Independent Measure independently predicted burden. Caregivers of children with peanut allergy in the United Kingdom experience health-related quality-of-life, psychosocial, and productivity burden; this study demonstrates the high levels of anxiety reported by both male and female caregivers.",

Since peanut sensitization may differ between different geographical regions, we wanted to investigate the sensitization pattern to the individual peanut allergens in a Norwegian population.Cases reported to the Norwegian Food Allergy Register with sera positive to peanut extract were analyzed for specific IgE (sIgE) to the recombinant peanut allergens Ara h 1, Ara h 2, Ara h 3, Ara h 8 and Ara h 9 and to birch pollen extract. Serum samples negative to the above allergens were analyzed for sIgE to Ara h 6, and sIgE to Pru p 3 in peach were analyzed in sera positive to the cross-reactive allergen Ara h 9.Highest frequency of sIgE to Ara h 2, often co-sensitized to Ara h 1 and 3, were found in the small children up to 6 years of age. From the age of 6 years, sensitization to Ara h 8 was predominant. The sIgE levels to the storage proteins Ara h 1, 2 and 3 were strongly correlated, as was the sIgE levels to Ara h 8 and birch pollen extract. A low sensitization rate of sIgE to Ara h 9 in young adults was observed, which sIgE levels were very strongly correlated to Pru p 3.The sensitization to peanut allergens in a Norwegian population shows a clear age dependent pattern. The results add to the previously published research on the sensitization patterns of peanut sensitized patients in different geographical areas.",

The relationship with asthma is less clear and may be due to the influence of atopy in patients with associated asthma.Four hundred individuals were included, 300 patients diagnosed with asthma divided into two groups according to their phenotype (allergic and non-allergic asthma) and 100 strictly characterized controls. The coding region and flanking regions of the FLG gene were amplified by PCR. We proceeded to the characterization of potential gene variants in that region by RFLP and sequencing and analysed their association with lung function parameters, asthma control and severity, and quality of life.We identified two null-mutations (R501X and 2282del4), seven SNPs previously described in databases and three SNPs that had not been previously described. One of the SNP identified in this study (1741A > T) was more frequently detected in patients with non-allergic asthma, worse FVC, FEV1 and PEF values and a higher treatment step. In addition, lowered spirometric values were observed in the non-allergic group carrying any of the nonsynonymous SNPs.In the association study of genetic variants of the FLG gene in our population the 1741A > T polymorphism seems to be associated with non-allergic asthma.",

We retrospectively analyzed the age, common clinical symptoms, immunologic and molecular manifestations in 11 patients with LOF STAT3 mutations and 1 patient with a GOF STAT3 mutation.Twelve patients were enrolled in our study. Serum immunoglobulin measurements, lymphocyte subset detection and whole-exome sequencing were performed.The median age at diagnosis of STAT3-HIES patients was 4.74 years. Eczema, recurrent respiratory infections, fevers, abscesses and Staphylococcus aureus infections were the classic manifestations. Elevated serum IgE levels are not always observed in conjunction with high eosinophil counts. A moderate viral DNA load was also measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We noticed that c. 1144C>T was the most common mutation site, followed by c.1311C>A. Additionally, c.1311C>A and c. 1826G>C are two novel mutations. Eight patients achieved notable improvement after receiving intravenous immunoglobulin.We updated the current knowledge of this topic. We found an earlier median age at diagnosis, a higher survival rate, and a general lack of nonimmunological abnormalities; we also described the treatment details and novel mutations involve in STAT3-HIES and compared STAT3 LOF and GOF mutations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Allergic rhinitis (AR) is one of the most widespread immune conditions worldwide. However, common treatments often present with significant side effects or are cost-prohibitive for much of the population. A plethora of treatments have been used for the treatment of AR including antihistamines, steroids, and immune modulators. Among the treatments which have shown potential for efficacy in treating AR with a minimum of side effects but remains understudied is the conditionally essential amino acid taurine. Taurine has been previously shown to reduce AR symptoms. Here, we examine the role of taurine in modulating T regulatory cells, modulating the cytokine response in AR, and restoring healthy nasal mucosa. Methods Blood samples from 20 healthy donors and 20 AR patients were compared for CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + T regulatory (Treg) cell population percentage, cytokine release, and STAT1 signaling with and without taurine treatment or IL-35 neutralization. An OVA-induced AR mouse model was administered vehicle, taurine, or taurine plus an IL-35 neutralizing antibody and assayed for sneezing frequency, inflammatory cytokine response, nasal mucosa goblet cell density, and T regulatory cell percentage. CD4 + cells were further examined for cytokine release, STAT1 phosphorylation, and response to an anti-IL-35 antibody with and without a STAT1 inhibitor. Results Comparison of blood from normal donors and AR patients showed a reduction in CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + Treg cells in AR patients and a strong correlation between Treg percentage and IL-35 release. A similar pattern of Treg suppression was found in untreated AR mice when compared to normal control mice wherein there was a reduction in Treg percentage and a corresponding decrease in IL-35 release. AR mice also demonstrated increased sneezing frequency, an infiltration of goblet cell in nasal mucosa, and a reduction in IL-35 release from CD4 + cells. Conversely, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 secretion from CD4 + cells were increased in AR model mice, as was STAT1 phosphorylation. When AR mice were treated with taurine, sneezing frequency and nasal mucosa goblet cell content were reduced while Treg abundance was increased to that of normal mice. Accordingly, IL-35 release was restored, while IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 secretion from CD4 + cells were suppressed. Likewise, STAT1 phosphorylation was inhibited with taurine treatment. Taurine-treated mice also given an IL-35 neutralizing antibody exhibited AR pathology including frequent sneezing and high nasal goblet cell content while retaining a restoration of Tregs. Furthermore, murine AR model CD4 + cells exposed to recombinant IL-35 responded with a reduction in inflammatory cytokine release and a decrease in STAT1 phosphorylation, mimicking the effect of taurine treatment. Conclusions Taurine induces release of IL-35 in AR; IL-35 promotes the production of CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + Treg cells via a STAT1-dependent pathway. The restoration of Treg populations by taurine normalizes the inflammatory response, reduces AR symptomology, and reduces histopathologic signs of AR.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica syndrome disease (NMOSD) are inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system. The pathogenesis and treatments for these two conditions are very different. Natural killer (NK) and natural killer T (NKT) cells are immune cells with an important role in shaping the immune response. B cells are involved in antigen presentation as well as antibody and cytokine production. There is conflicting evidence of the roles of NK, NKT, and B cells in the two conditions. We aimed to compare the frequency of CD3-CD16+CD56+NK, CD3+ CD56+ NKT, and CD5+CD19+ B cells in the peripheral blood and serum Interleukin-10 (IL-10) in patients with MS and NMOSD.CD19+CD5+ B, CD3- CD16+CD56+ NK, and CD3+CD56+ NKT cells were quantitated by flow cytometry in 15 individuals with Interferon-Beta (IFN-β) treated relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), 15 untreated RRMS, and 15 NMOSD patients as well as 30 healthy controls (HC). Serum IL-10 was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).The percentage of CD3-CD56+CD16+ NK cells in the peripheral blood of IFN-treated MS (1.81 ± 0.87) was significantly lower than for untreated RRMS (4.74 ± 1.80), NMOSD (4.64 ± 1.26) and HC (5.83 ± 2.19) (p < 0.0001). There were also differences for the percentage of CD3-CD16+ and CD3-CD56+ cells (p < 0.001 and p < 0.0007; respectively). IFN-treated RRMS (2.89 ± 1.51) had the lowest proportion of CD3+CD56+ among the study groups (p < 0.002). Untreated RRMS (5.56 ± 3.04) and NMOSD (5.47 ± 1.24) had higher levels of CD3+CD56+ than the HC (3.16 ± 1.98). The mean percentage of CD19+CD5+ B cells in the peripheral blood of untreated RRMS patients (1.32 ± 0.67) was higher compared to the patients with NMOSD (0.30 ± 0.20), HC (0.5 ± 0.22) and IFN-treated RRMS (0.81 ± 0.17) (p < 0.0001). Serum interleukin-10 was significantly higher in the IFN-treated RRMS (8.06 ± 5.39) and in HC (8.38 ± 2.84) compared to untreated RRMS (5.07 ± 1.44) and the patients with NMOSD (5.33 ± 2.56) (p < 0.003).The lower proportion of CD3-CD56+ CD16+ NK and CD3+CD56+ cells in peripheral blood of IFN-treated RRMS compared to other groups suggests the importance of immunomodulation in patients with RRMS disorder. Based on the differences in CD19+CD5+ B cells and serum IL-10 between patients and HC, supplementary assessments could be of value in clarifying their roles in autoimmunity.",

Objectives The purpose of the present study was to estimate the relationship between sleep disorders and allergy-related outcomes in adults. Methods We built logistic regression models to examine the associations between sleep disorders and allergy-related outcomes in adult participants using the 2005–2006 NHANES database. Allergy-related outcomes included sIgE levels, asthma, hay fever, sneezing, wheezing, and eczema. Sleep disorders included sleep latency, sleep length, sleep problems, OSA symptoms, and daytime sleepiness. A t-test was used for between-group comparisons. Results Participants with OSA symptoms had 2.72 × higher odds of experiencing hay fever and 1.54 × higher odds of having eczema compared to Non-OSA symptoms participants. Participants with insufficient sleep (≤ 6 h/night) had 1.27 × higher odds of developing allergic sensitisation compared to participants with adequate sleep (7–8 h/night). Sneezing was positively associated with sleep problems (OR: 1.706; 95% CI 1.386, 2.099), OSA symptoms (OR: 1.297; 95% CI 1.049, 1.605), and daytime sleepiness (OR: 1.569; 95% CI 1.205, 2.04). Conclusion Our findings suggest a positive association between allergy-related outcomes and sleep disorders. In particular, OSA symptoms, daytime sleepiness, and sleep problems are strongly associated with allergic conditions. Graphical Abstract",

These studies revealed that clinical assessment and bloodwork were preformed every 6 to 12 months in asymptomatic patients. Some centers performed computerized tomography scan of the chest every 2-5 years to identify chronic lung disease, although the majority did chest imaging in accordance with clinical indications. Pulmonary function tests were done annually at most centers. Most studies did not address the role of abdominal imaging to screen for liver diseases or endoscopy to screen for gastric cancer in asymptomatic patients with uncomplicated CVID.There is paucity of evidence-based information to guide the routine monitoring of CVID patients without non-infectious complications. Prospective studies are needed to determine the best monitoring practices in this group of patients.",

    "abstract": "Bullous pemphigoid is the most common autoimmune subepidermal blistering disorder with a low incidence in childhood. Combined immunodeficiencies (CIDs) are a group of monogenic inborn errors of immunity (IEIs) characterized by T- and B-cell dysfunction leading to recurrent infections, lymphoproliferation, predisposition to malignancy, and autoimmunity. Here, we report two Afghan siblings with a diagnosis of CID and extremely rare manifestation of diffuse bullous pemphigoid skin lesions.The older sibling (patient 1) was a 32-month-old male with facial dysmorphism, protracted diarrhea, failure to thrive, recurrent oral candidiasis, recurrent otitis media with tympanic membrane perforation, who had been previously diagnosed with CID. While he was under treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), he developed extensive blistering lesions, which were diagnosed as childhood bullous pemphigoid. Methylprednisolone and azathioprine were added to the regimen, which resulted in a remarkable improvement of the skin lesions and also the feeding condition. However,2 weeks later, he was re-admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and eventually died due to fulminant sepsis. Later, his 12-month-old sister (patient 2) with similar facial dysmorphism and a history of developmental delay, food allergy, recurrent oral candidiasis, and respiratory tract infections also developed blistering skin lesions. She was under treatment for occasional eczematous lesions, and had been receiving IVIg for 3 months due to low levels of immunoglobulins. Further immunologic workup showed an underlying CID and thus treatment with IVIg continued, gradually improving her clinical condition. The genetic study of both siblings revealed a novel homozygous mutation in exon 7 of the PGM3 gene, c.845 T > C (p.Val282Ala).Dermatologic disorders may be the presenting sign in patients with CID and mutated PGM3. This case report further extends the spectrum of skin manifestations that could be observed in PGM3 deficiency and emphasizes the importance of considering CIDs during the assessment of skin disorders, particularly if they are extensive, recurrent, refractory to treatment, and/or associated with other signs of IEIs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background High-fidelity simulations based on real-life clinical scenarios have frequently been used to improve patient care, knowledge and teamwork in the acute care setting. Still, they are seldom included in the allergy-immunology curriculum or continuous medical education. Our main goal was to assess if critical care simulations in allergy improved performance in the clinical setting. Methods Advanced anaphylaxis scenarios were designed by a panel of emergency, intensive care unit, anesthesiology and allergy-immunology specialists and then adapted for the adult allergy clinic setting. This simulation activity included a first part in the high-fidelity simulation-training laboratory and a second at the adult allergy clinic involving actors and a high-fidelity mannequin. Participants filled out a questionnaire, and qualitative interviews were performed with staff after they had managed cases of refractory anaphylaxis. Results Four nurses, seven allergy-immunology fellows and six allergy/immunologists underwent the simulation. Questionnaires showed a perceived improvement in aspects of crisis and anaphylaxis management. The in-situ simulation revealed gaps in the process, which were subsequently resolved. Qualitative interviews with participants revealed a more rapid and orderly response and improved confidence in their abilities and that of their colleagues to manage anaphylaxis. Conclusion High-fidelity simulations can improve the management of anaphylaxis in the allergy clinic and team confidence. This activity was instrumental in reducing staff reluctance to perform high-risk challenges in the ambulatory setting, thus lifting a critical barrier for implementing oral immunotherapy at our adult center.",

    "abstract": "In Canada, severe asthma affects an estimated 5-10% of people with asthma and is associated with frequent exacerbations, poor symptom control and significant morbidity from the disease itself, as well as the high dose inhaled, and systemic steroids used to treat it. Significant heterogeneity exists in service structure and patient access to severe asthma care, including access to biologic treatments. There appears to be over-reliance on short-acting beta agonists and frequent oral corticosteroid use, two indicators of uncontrolled asthma which can indicate undiagnosed or suboptimally treated severe asthma. The objective of this modified Delphi consensus project was to define standards of care for severe asthma in Canada, in areas where the evidence is lacking through patient and healthcare professional consensus, to complement forthcoming guidelines.The steering group of asthma experts identified 43 statements formed from eight key themes. An online 4-point Likert scale questionnaire was sent to healthcare professionals working in asthma across Canada to assess agreement (consensus) with these statements. Consensus was defined as high if ≥ 75% and very high if ≥ 90% of respondents agreed with a statement.A total of 150 responses were received from HCPs including certified respiratory educators, respirologists, allergists, general practitioners/family physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and respiratory therapists. Consensus amongst respondents was very high in 37 (86%) statements, high in 4 (9%) statements and was not achieved in 2 (5%) statements. Based on the consensus scores, ten key recommendations were proposed. These focus on referrals from primary and secondary care, accessing specialist asthma services, homecare provision for severe asthma patients and outcome measures.Implementation of these recommendations across the severe asthma care pathway in Canada has the potential to improve outcomes for patients through earlier detection of undiagnosed severe asthma, reduction in time to severe asthma diagnosis, and initiation of advanced phenotype specific therapies.",

Methods Using data collected electronically from families reporting food allergy using a validated food security questionnaire, we estimated food insecurity, including categories of food insecurity (marginal, moderate, secure) in the year prior to the pandemic (2019; Wave 1), and the first (2020; Wave 2) and second years of the pandemic (2022; Wave 3). Results Participants in all waves were commonly in 2 + adult, 2 child households. Less than half of participants (Waves 1–3: 45.7%, 31.0%, and 22.9%, respectively) reported household incomes below the median Canadian. Common allergies were milk, eggs, peanuts and tree nuts.

    "abstract": "Abstract The market share of foods carrying labels suggesting absence of animal ingredients has significantly increased in recent years. The purpose of this study was to document the purchasing behaviour of egg- or milk-allergic consumers vis-à-vis food marketed as “vegan” and “plant-based”, and to evaluate the associated allergenic risk. A survey was conducted among egg- and milk-allergic consumers and revealed that 86% (margin of error 5.4%; confidence level 95%) would buy “vegan” products, indicating this label may be perceived as a substitute for “free from milk and eggs”. To assess the risk posed by these products, 87 prepackaged foods with “vegan” and/or “plant-based” claims purchased in Quebec were tested for milk proteins, and 64 for egg proteins. Overall, 5.7% and 0% occurrence of milk and egg proteins, respectively, were observed, suggesting that the analysed prepackaged foods carrying “vegan” and/or “plant-based” labels pose little risk to egg- or milk-allergic consumers. However, this is likely due to allergen management practices applied by the Canadian manufacturers of the products tested, and should not be attributed to the use of “vegan” or similar labels. Enhanced regulatory requirements for the use of these labels, and an education campaign on their meaning with respect to allergy-related risks, are necessary to better inform and protect egg- and milk-allergic consumers.",

    "abstract": "Anaphylaxis is an acute, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that typically occurs after exposure to a trigger, while idiopathic anaphylaxis (IA) occurs in the absence of a trigger. Acute management of both triggered anaphylaxis and IA relies on the use of epinephrine. In some patients with recurrent IA, glucocorticoid prophylaxis with prednisone can be effective. While there is currently no high quality evidence for the use of other prophylactic options to prevent recurrent IA, evolving data exists to support the consideration of biologics that target IgE or the Th2 pathway.We present the case of a 28 year old female with no atopic or autoimmune history with recurrent episodes of IA since childhood occurring up to twice weekly. There was improvement in acute symptoms with administration of first or second generation antihistamines and/or intramuscular epinephrine. Without an identifiable trigger, she was diagnosed with IA and frequent idiopathic urticaria and omalizumab was added to her treatment regimen with improvement in symptom frequency. After being lost to follow up, she had recurrence of symptom frequency and severity without omalizumab therapy and subsequently presented to our institution. Her workup at this point was negative for food allergy, alpha gal syndrome, systemic mastocytosis, hereditary alpha tryptasemia, carcinoid syndrome, and pheochromocytoma, and she was trialed on dupilumab with near resolution of her symptom frequency over a six month time period.Recurrent IA is a diagnosis of exclusion that is associated with high morbidity. Prophylaxis remains an area of uncertainty, although prednisone has been effective in some cases. When prednisone is contraindicated or ineffective for the prevention of IA, biologic therapies that target IgE or the Th2 pathway may present a reasonable consideration. This case adds support to the suggestion that dupilumab may be a logical off-label consideration for prophylaxis of recurrent IA. The data for dupilumab in this clinical scenario is still very limited, and further research is required before any recommendation can be made.",

    "abstract": "There is increased emphasis on the role of indoor allergens in asthma.To examine the spectrum of skin test reactivity (sensitization) to indoor allergens and its correlation with asthma severity in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.Asthmatic patients referred to the allergy clinic at King Abdulaziz University Hospital (KAUH) in Jeddah were studied. Measures of clinical severity were adopted from national and international asthma guidelines. The degree of sensitization was assessed by the wheal size (positive >/= 3 mm) from standard skin-prick tests for the following common indoor inhalant allergens: house dust mites (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus [Dp] and Dermatophagoides farinae [Df]), cat, and cockroach.Skin test results from 113 of 151 (74.8%) asthmatic patients were positive for one or more allergens. The patients' ages ranged between 9 and 63 years (mean, 30 +/- 13 years), and females constituted 65.5%. The predominant asthma severity level was moderate persistent (55.8%), followed by mild persistent (33.6%). The prevalences of sensitization to indoor allergens were as follows: Dp, 87% (3-25 mm [mean, 7 mm]); Df, 84% (3-20 mm [mean, 7 mm]); cat, 44% (3-15 mm [mean, 6 mm]); and cockroach, 33% (3-12 mm [mean, 4 mm]). Higher asthma severity levels were significantly correlated with the number of allergens with positive sensitization (R = 0.3, p < .001) and with the degree of sensitization to house dust mites (Dp [degrees of freedom {df} = 16, p < .001] and Df [df = 17, p < .01]) but not to cat (df = 10, p < .24) or cockroach (df = 8, p < .36).Immunoglobulin E-mediated skin test reactivity to indoor allergens, particularly to house dust mites, was common in asthmatic patients from Jeddah at KAUH. Increased sensitization was associated with higher levels of asthma severity, which is compatible with the literature. This emphasizes the importance of identifying sensitization to relevant indoor allergens in the clinical evaluation of asthmatic persons.",

However, in comparison, there has been significantly less research into non-IgE-mediated food reactions. Non-IgE-mediated reactions can cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, and cutaneous symptoms. The most recent evidence suggests that these reactions are probably T-cell mediated as evidenced in lymphocyte proliferation assays.

Presently, there are 21 randomized controlled trials being conducted with the most common allergens, consistently showing the clinical efficacy of local nasal immunotherapy for rhinitis. Other advantages are that it has an optimal safety profile and can be self-administered at home by the patient. Moreover, there are several data from animal models and from humans that confirm the immunomodulatory effect of intranasally administered antigens. On the other hand, local nasal immunotherapy seems to be effective only on rhinitis symptoms and requires a particular technique of administration. For these reasons, its clinical use is progressively declining in favour of the sublingual route although nasal immunotherapy is validated in official documents and remains a viable alternative to injection.",

Several observations are supportive of a possible causative role of these pathogens in asthma; however, more evidence is required before this becomes meaningful in clinical practice. Atypical bacteria can enhance airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation, both of which have been associated with exacerbations in patients with preexisting asthma. It is less clear whether the above mechanisms might also be responsible for the development of asthma. Difficulties in accurately diagnosing these infections contribute to such uncertainty. In the present report, evidence of the involvement of Chlamydophila and Mycoplasma infection in the development and the progression of asthma are reviewed.",

However, there are still many questions and controversies regarding immunotherapy, like selection of the appropriate allergen, safety and long term efficacy.Literature review was performed to address the role of basophil activation test (BAT) in diagnosis of venom allergy.In patients with positive skin tests or specific IgE to both honeybee and wasp venom, IgE inhibition test can identify sensitizing allergen only in around 15% and basophil activation test increases the identification rate to around one third of double positive patients. BAT is also diagnostic in majority of patients with systemic reactions after insect stings and no detectable IgE. High basophil sensitivity to allergen is associated with a risk of side effects during VIT. Persistence of high basophil sensitivity also predicts a treatment failure of VIT.BAT is a useful tool for better selection of allergen for immunotherapy, for identification of patients prone to side effects and patients who might be treatment failures. However, long term studies are needed to evaluate the accuracy of the test.",

The major risk factor for persistent BA is an underlying allergic constitution.

Elimination diets and elemental diets based on patch testing and skin prick tests reduced the eosinophil counts to normal levels in all three children. Food items which tested positive were then reintroduced while symptoms and eosinophil counts were monitored. Nutritional management of eosinophilic esophagitis and eosinophilic colitis was found to be effective in reducing symptoms. However, obstacles facing patients who choose this type of therapy include limitations due to the cost of repeated endoscopies, palatability of elimination/elemental diets and the availability of subspecialists trained in management (e.g. Allergy, Gastroenterology, and Pathology). It may be a worthwhile endeavour to overcome these obstacles as nutritional management minimizes the potential long-term effects of chronic steroid therapy.",

We aimed to describe the outcome of selectively applied guidelines, based on risk-stratification, to our high risk, egg-allergic, tertiary-care pediatric population. Egg allergy was confirmed with skin testing. The vaccine administered was an adjuvunated 2009 H1N1 influenza A vaccine with < 0.165 mcg/ml ovalbumin. Patients with mild egg allergy were to receive the vaccination in 1 dose, those with severe egg allergy were to receive 2 split doses, and patients with exquisite egg allergy or significant co-morbidities were to be skin tested with the vaccine (prick full strength, intradermal 1:100 of final concentration without adjuvant) and had 5 step desensitization if the testing was positive, or 1-2 step administration if negative. Patients were observed for 60 minutes after the final dose and anaphylaxis treatment was available. We report the frequency of allergic reactions. Ninety-nine patients were referred and 79 had positive egg testing. Asthma was present in 67% and 30% had prior anaphylaxis to egg. We vaccinated 77 of 79 patients: 71 without performing vaccine skin testing. Two refused vaccination. No patient had a systemic reaction or required treatment. Two patients experienced positive testing to the adjuvanated intradermal vaccine, but were negative without adjuvant. Our results suggest that most egg-allergic tertiary care pediatric patients can be vaccinated with a low ovalbumin content influenza vaccine without prior vaccine testing. Vaccine skin testing, if used at all, can be reserved for special circumstances. The squalene adjuvant may cause an irritant reaction with intradermal testing.",

The aim of the study was to identify the main criteria determining the choice of a second generation H1A by allergy specialists in mainland France. Consecutive patients suffering from allergic rhinitis or rhinoconjunctivitis were included and followed prospectively for 30 days from the prescription of a second generation H1A in monotherapy. Patients were asked to fill in auto-questionnaires at baseline, daily during the first 10 days of the new treatment, and at the end of follow-up. Data on efficacy, tolerance, safety, rate and type of response to treatment, as well as patient satisfaction were recorded and analyzed. 1,080 patients were included between March 2011 and October 2012, mostly suffering from moderate to severe rhinitis (82.0%). The most frequently cited reason for choosing a specific H1A was the expected efficacy (85.3%). The mean time to nasal and ocular recovery was 6 days and 78.2% of patients responded to treatment within this interval. The presence of conjunctivitis was significantly associated with a more rapid response. At the end of follow-up, the satisfaction rate was higher for patients who were switched from a previous treatment (87.5%), compared to those receiving their first treatment (78.8%). The main reason for choosing a specific second generation H1A was its expected efficacy. Concomitant conjunctivitis is associated with a more rapid response to treatment.

    "abstract": "Currently accepted therapies for ragweed allergy in North America consist of pharmacotherapy and subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy injections to treat symptoms. Allergen immunotherapy not only reduces symptoms and the need for pharmacotherapy but has also been shown to have disease-modifying potential. Recently, ragweed immunotherapy administered via sublingual allergen tablet has been approved in North America for treatment of allergic rhinitis with and without conjunctivitis. This was an analysis of pooled data for a prespecified subgroup of Canadian subjects from two multicentre, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trials of ragweed sublingual tablet (SLIT-T; 6 and 12 Amb a 1-U of Ambrosia artemisiifolia) in patients aged ≥18y, with ragweed-induced allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (AR/C) with or without asthma. Randomized subjects used once-daily ragweed SLIT-T or placebo for at least 12 weeks before the ragweed season and for up to 52 weeks post-randomization. The primary efficacy endpoint was the total combined score (TCS) based on the sum of AR/C daily symptom score (DSS) and daily medication score (DMS) averaged over the peak season. Treatment effects on TCS, DSS, and DMS in the entire season were also assessed. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored to assess safety. 337 Canadian subjects were randomized in the two trials. During the peak season, ragweed SLIT-T 6 and 12 Amb a 1-U significantly reduced TCS by 26% (difference, -2.46 score point; p = .0009) and 40% (difference, -3.75 score point; p < .0001), respectively. In the overall population (N = 961), TCS reductions with 6 and 12 Amb a 1-U were 20% and 23%, respectively (both p < .001). Clinically meaningful reductions in entire-season TCS in Canadians were similar to those during peak ragweed season. Dose-dependent reduction of DSS and DMS was also observed for ragweed SLIT-T 6 and 12 Amb a 1-U during the peak season and the entire season. Ragweed SLIT-T was well tolerated in Canadian subjects and the overall population. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate and transient, occurring early in treatment; no systemic allergic reaction/anaphylaxis was noted. Ragweed SLIT-T is an effective form of immunotherapy that provides symptomatic efficacy of AR/C with a favorable risk profile in Canadian and overall populations.

Efficacy variables included scores in the mini-RQLQ questionnaire, number and severity of nasal, ocular and lung signs and symptoms, need for symptomatic medications and patients' satisfaction with treatment. Adverse events were also recorded. Demographic characteristics were homogeneous between groups and mini-RQLQ scores did not differ significantly at baseline (visit 1). From symptoms recorded in the diary cards, the ME group showed statistically significant better scores for nasal congestion (0.72 vs. 1.01; p = 0.017) and mean total nasal symptoms (0.7 vs. 0.9; p = 0.045). At visit 2 (pollen season), lower values were observed in the mini-RQLQ in the ME group, although there were no statistically significant differences between groups in both full analysis set (FAS) and patients completing treatment (PPS) populations. The results obtained in the nasal symptoms domain of the mini-RQLQ at visit 2 showed the highest difference (−0.43; 95% CI: -0.88 to 0.02) for the ME group in the FAS population. The topical microemulsion was safe and well tolerated and no major discomforts were observed. Satisfaction rating with the treatment was similar between the groups. The topical application of the microemulsion is a feasible and safe therapy in the prevention of allergic symptoms, particularly nasal congestion. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01478425",

    "abstract": "Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a societal burden and cause of morbidity in Canada; however, the prevalence of allergic sensitization in Canadian CRS patients has remained poorly characterized.In this study, we used skin prick test (SPT) and specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE) and G (sIgG) titers to regionally relevant allergen sources in order to determine whether allergic sensitization is more prevalent in CRS patients compared to chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) control patients.One hundred and fifty eight subjects (19-70 years of age) were recruited into the study. 101 subjects had a confirmed diagnostic history of CRS and 57 subjects with a clinical diagnosis of CIU were recruited as controls. Enrolled subjects underwent SPT to a panel of perennial and seasonal allergens and sIgE titers were quantified to selected environmental allergen mixes (grass, mold, and tree species) using Phadia ImmunoCAP. sIgG was additionally quantified to Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus versicolor, Cladosporium herbarum, and Stachybotrys atra. Differences between CRS and control CIU patient SPT and serological data were examined by chi-squared analysis and analysis of variance.Reactivity to at least one SPT extract occurred in 73% of CRS patients. Positive SPT reactivity to A. alternata (odds ratio (OR): 4.34, 95% confidence interval: 1.57, 12.02), cat (OR: 3.23, 95% CI: 1.16, 9.02), and ragweed (OR: 2.31, 95% CI: 1.02, 5.19) extracts were more prevalent in patients with CRS (p < 0.05). Although dust mite and timothy grass sensitization approached statistical significance in the chi-squared analysis of SPT data, other common perennial and seasonal allergens were not associated with CRS. No statistically significant differences were observed between mean sIgE and sIgG titers in CRS and control patients.This study supports previous data that suggests A. alternata sensitization is associated with CRS; however, these findings additionally highlight the contribution of other regionally important allergens including cat and ragweed.",

Skin prick testing (SPT) with commercial extracts followed by an oral food challenge (OFC) are routinely performed in the diagnostic investigation of these children. Recent evidence suggests that milk-allergic and/or egg-allergic individuals can often tolerate extensively heated (EH) forms of these foods. This study evaluated the predictive value of a negative SPT with EH milk or egg in determining whether a child would tolerate an OFC to the EH food product.Charts from a single allergy clinic were reviewed for any patient with a negative SPT to EH milk or egg, prepared in the form of a muffin. Data collected included age, sex, symptoms of food allergy, co-morbidities and the success of the OFC to the muffin.Fifty-eight patients had negative SPTs to the EH milk or egg in a muffin and underwent OFC to the appropriate EH food in the outpatient clinic. Fifty-five of these patients tolerated the OFC. The negative predictive value for the SPT with the EH food product was 94.8%.SPT with EH milk or egg products was predictive of a successful OFC to the same food. Larger prospective studies are required to substantiate these findings.",

    "abstract": "Interleukin-31 (IL-31) is a recently identified cytokine produced by Th2 cells that is involved in the development of atopic dermatitis-induced skin inflammation and pruritus. Its receptor, IL-31RA, is expressed by a number of cell types, including epithelial cells, eosinophils, and activated monocytes and macrophages. To date, however, the regulation of Th2 responses by distinct cell types and tissues expressing IL-31RA has not been well studied. In this study, Cry j 2, one of the major allergens of Japanese cedar pollen, was administered to IL-31RA-deficient or wild-type (WT) mice via nasal or intraperitoneal injection for induction of specific Th2 responses. After nasal administration of Cry j 2, IL-31RA-deficient mice showed lower Cry j 2-specific CD4+ T cell proliferation, Th2 cytokine (IL-5 and IL-13) production, and Th2-mediated (IgE, IgG1, and IgG2b) antibody responses than WT mice. In contrast, IL-31RA-deficient mice administered Cry j 2 intraperitoneally showed stronger Th2 immune responses than WT mice. These results indicate that IL-31R signaling positively regulates Th2 responses induced by nasal administration of Cry j 2, but negatively regulates these responses when Cry j 2 is administered intraperitoneally. Collectively, these data indicate that the induction of antigen-specific Th2 immune responses might depend on tissue-specific cell types expressing IL-31RA.",

However, the role of the TNF-α system and Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) in the apoptosis-inducing pathways in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), remain unclear.To determine circulating concentrations of TNF-α, soluble TNF-α receptor type 1 and type 2 (sTNF-R1 and sTNF-R2, respectively) as well as soluble Fas (sFas) and FasL (sFasL) in CSU subjects.Serum TNF-α, sTNF-R1, sTNF-R2, sFas, sFasL concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in CSU subjects and in the healthy subjects.TNF-α concentrations were significantly higher in CSU subjects and moderate-to-severe CSU than in the controls, while there were no significant differences in TNF-α concentrations between subjects with mild CSU and the controls. sTNF-R1 and sTNF-R2 concentrations were significantly higher in all CSU and moderate-severe CSU subjects vs. the controls. Serum concentrations were also significantly higher in mild CSU vs. the controls, but not in moderate-severe CSU vs. mild CSU. No significant differences were observed in sFas and sFasL concentrations between CSU subjects and the healthy controls. Significant correlations were found between concentrations of TNF-α and its receptors, as well as sTNF-R1 and sTNF-R2, but not with the urticaria activity score (UAS). There was no relationship between TNF-α/sTNF-R1/sTNF-R2 and sFas/sFasL pathways in CSU.CSU is associated with the activation of the TNF-α/receptors signaling pathway, marked by increased circulating concentrations of TNF-α, sTNF-R1 and sTNF-R2, which are related to each other in this disease. In contrast, the circulating sFas/FasL system is not up-regulated in CSU, and sFas/sFasL may not be a useful marker of the activity/severity of urticarial processes. Considering the lack of significant changes in sFas/sFasL (mainly reflecting systemic apoptosis) in CSU patients, it appears that elevated serum TNF-α concentrations are related to its pro-inflammatory function rather than an enhanced systemic apoptotic response in CSU.",

This study aimed to characterize the inflammatory profiles and investigate the effect of atopy on the pathogenesis of pediatric ACPs.Thirty-three ACP patients and ten control subjects were enrolled from January to December 2017. The severity of individual nasal symptoms was scored on a visual analogue scale (VAS). The serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE) and cytokines level was measured by multiplexed luminex assay.There was no significant difference in VAS scores and counts of inflammatory cells between atopic and nonatopic ACP. No difference in IFNγ, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-17A and IL-25 was found between control and whole ACP, nonatopic and atopic ACP. Significantly increased levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were found in ACP compared with control. For neutrophil chemotactic factor, significant increases of IL-8 and GRO were observed in ACP, but for eosinophil chemotactic factor, no difference was found in RANTES and GM-CSF. IL-6 level was positively correlated with IL-8, MCP1, and GRO level, and IL-10 level was positively correlated with IL-4 and IL-13 in ACP subjects.Nasal obstruction was the most common symptom in ACPs in children. Allergic condition may have a poor role in the pathogenesis of ACPs. IL-6 plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of neutrophilic inflammation in patients with ACPs and may provide a new treatment strategy for ACPs in children. Treg cell associated cytokine IL-10 was involved in the inflammatory pathophysiological process of ACPs and played a certain regulatory role.",

Methods A total of 48 CRS patients with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), 28 CRS patients without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) and 21 control subjects were enrolled into the study; and evaluated for serum total IgE level, olfactory score and nasal resistance. Samples were obtained from nasal polyps of CRSwNP patients, ethmoid mucosae of CRSsNP patients and inferior turbinate (IT) mucosa of control subjects during surgery, and used to isolate purified primary human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs). Genomic DNA was extracted from purified primary HNECs of each subject and DNA methylation ratios for a selected region of the TSLP gene were screened the using MassARRAY EpiTYPER. Results A total of 17 CpG units were analyzed; of which two CpG units (CpG3 and 22:23:24) had increased methylation ratios in the CRSwNP patients compared to the CRSsNP and control subjects after correction for false discovery rate (FDR) (Q &lt; 0.1). The methylation ratios at both CpG3 and CpG22:23:24 units were positively correlated with olfactory score (r = 0.41, P = 0.0001; r = 0.25, P = 0.021) and unilateral nasal resistance at 75 Pa (r = 0.24, P = 0.04; r = 0.24, P = 0.036) and 150 Pa (r = 0.34, P = 0.004; r = 0.25, P = 0.031). Total nasal resistance at 75 Pa/150 Pa or serum total IgE levels were not correlated with the methylation ratios at either CpG unit. Conclusions Increased DNA methylation at the TSLP locus is likely to be associated with CRSwNP pathogenesis; however these findings need to be confirmed in larger multicentre group studies.",

The Comorbidities, particularly obesity, and several other factors have been identified as being individually associated with asthma control, and these factors vary among different countries and between sexes. Studies have suggested that the harmful effects of these factors are greatest among women. The aim of the present study was to identify associated factors with uncontrolled asthma in women at the outpatient clinic of a Federal University Hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.Cross-sectional study with asthmatic women, older than 18 years old. All subjects were included according to stringent criteria. The study used a structured questionnaire with data about demographic variables, education level, comorbid conditions, and disease history. Anthropometric and spirometric measurements were obtained. Asthma control was assessed by three different tools: the Asthma Control Test (ACT), the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) and the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) criteria.A total of 124 women were included, and 57%, 38% and 21% were totally controlled according to ACT, ACQ and GINA criteria, respectively. A total of 31.5% were obese. According to the CI (Conicity Index) and WC (waist circumference) respectively, 84% and 68% were centrally obese. There was no association between asthma control and age, education, duration of the disease or BMI (Body Mass Index) in the three models, but there was a significant association between central obesity and asthma control with the ACQ and GINA assessment tools, controlling for explanatory variables such as GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). Pre-bronchodilator percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were significantly associated with age and FVC was also associated with central obesity.Asthma remains uncontrolled in women despite treatment, and central obesity seems to have a negative influence on the control of the disease. We believe that women should be studied as a separate group and suggest prospective studies with assessment of fat distribution and biomarkers, controlling for possible comorbidities associated with asthma control.",

    "abstract": "It is hypothesized that household exposure to allergenic proteins via an impaired skin barrier, such as atopic dermatitis, may contribute to the development of IgE sensitization. Household presence of peanut is a risk factor for the development of peanut allergy in children. Sunflower seed butter is a peanut-free alternative to peanut butter, and sunflower seed allergy is an uncommon but reported entity.A 3 year old boy presented with oral discomfort that developed almost immediately after he ate sunflower seeds for the first time. He was given a dose of diphenhydramine. Subsequently he vomited, and his symptoms gradually resolved. A similar episode occurred to a commercial snack made with sunflower seed butter. Skin prick testing demonstrated a large positive (10 mm wheal) wheal-and-flare response to a slurry of fresh sunflower seed within 3-4 minutes associated with severe pruritus. This child has an older sibling with confirmed peanut allergy (PNA). After the PNA diagnosis was made, the family home became peanut-free. In lieu of peanut butter, sunflower butter was purchased and eaten frequently by family members, but not by the child reported herein. Subsequent to the episodes above, the child ate a bread roll with visible poppy seeds and developed itchy throat, dyspnea, and urticaria. Epicutaneous skin testing elicited a >10 mm wheal size within 3-4 minutes in response to a slurry of whole poppy seeds and 8 mm to fresh pumpkin seed, which had never been consumed.A case of sunflower allergy in the context of household consumption of sunflower butter has not yet been reported. We suggest that homes which are intentionally peanut-safe may provide an environment whereby infants with impaired skin barrier are at increased risk of allergy to alternative \"butter\" products being used, via cutaneous exposure to these products preceding oral introduction to the child.",

The aim of the current study was to assess the effectiveness of montelukast administered as monotherapy or in combination with current inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in pediatric patients with uncontrolled asthma as per the Canadian Asthma Consensus Guidelines. Twelve-week, multicentre, open-label, observational study. Primary effectiveness outcome was the proportion of patients achieving asthma control (Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) score ≤0.75) at weeks 4 and 12. A total of 328 patients with uncontrolled asthma (ACQ > 0.75) were enrolled with mean ± SD age of 6.9 ± 3.4 years. Among these, 76 (23.2%) were treated with montelukast monotherapy and 252 (76.8%) with montelukast combined with ICS. By 4 weeks of treatment 61.3% and 52.9% of the patients in the monotherapy and combination group, respectively, achieved asthma control. These proportions increased to 75.0% and 70.9%, respectively, at 12 weeks. Within the monotherapy group, clinically significant improvements in the ACQ score (mean ± SD of 1.67 ± 0.69, 0.71 ± 0.70 and 0.50 ± 0.52 at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks, respectively; p < 0.001) and the PACQLQ score (mean ± SD of 5.34 ± 1.14, 6.32 ± 0.89 and 6.51 ± 0.85 at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks, respectively; p < 0.001) were observed. In the combination group, the mean ± SD ACQ score significantly improved from 2.02 ± 0.83 at baseline to 0.90 ± 0.86 at 4 weeks and 0.64 ± 0.86 at 12 weeks (p < 0.001), while the PACQLQ score improved from 4.42 ± 1.35 at baseline to 5.76 ± 1.30 at 4 weeks and 6.21 ± 1.03 at 12 weeks (p < 0.001). After a 12-week montelukast add-on therapy, 22.6% of patients reduced their ICS dosage. Similar results were observed among preschool- and school-aged patients.

    "abstract": "Oral corticosteroid prescriptions are often used in clinical studies as an indicator of asthma exacerbations. However, there is rarely the ability to link a prescription to its associated diagnosis. The objective of this study was to characterize patterns of oral corticosteroid prescription orders for asthma patients using an electronic health record database, which links each prescription order to the diagnosis assigned at the time the order was placed.This was a retrospective cohort study of the electronic health records of asthma patients enrolled in the Geisinger Health System from January 1, 2001 to August 23, 2010. Eligible patients were 12-85 years old, had a primary care physician in the Geisinger Health System, and had asthma. Each oral corticosteroid order was classified as being prescribed for an asthma-related or non-asthma-related condition based on the associated diagnosis. Asthma-related oral corticosteroid use was classified as either chronic or acute. In patient-level analyses, we determined the number of asthma patients with asthma-related and non-asthma-related prescription orders and the number of patients with acute versus chronic use. Prescription-level analyses ascertained the percentages of oral corticosteroid prescription orders that were for asthma-related and non-asthma-related conditions.Among the 21,199 asthma patients identified in the electronic health record database, 15,017 (70.8%) had an oral corticosteroid prescription order. Many patients (N = 6,827; 45.5%) had prescription orders for both asthma-related and non-asthma-related conditions, but some had prescription orders exclusively for asthma-related (N = 3,450; 23.0%) or non-asthma-related conditions (N = 4,740; 31.6%). Among the patients receiving a prescription order, most (87.5%) could be classified as acute users. A total of 60,355 oral corticosteroid prescription orders were placed for the asthma patients in this study-31,397 (52.0%) for non-asthma-related conditions, 24,487 (40.6%) for asthma-related conditions, and 4,471 (7.4%) for both asthma-related and non-asthma-related conditions.Oral corticosteroid prescriptions for asthma patients are frequently ordered for conditions unrelated to asthma. A prescription for oral corticosteroids may be an unreliable marker of asthma exacerbations in retrospective studies utilizing administrative claims data. Investigators should consider co-morbid conditions for which oral corticosteroid use may also be indicated and/or different criteria for assessing oral corticosteroid use for asthma.",

There is no international consensus on whether immunotherapy regimens should generally include both venoms in double sensitized patients.We investigated the long-term outcome of single venom-based immunotherapy with regard to potential risk factors for treatment failure and specifically compared the risk of relapse in mono sensitized and double sensitized patients.Re-sting data were obtained from 635 patients who had completed at least 3 years of immunotherapy between 1988 and 2008. The adequate venom for immunotherapy was selected using an algorithm based on clinical details and the results of diagnostic tests.Of 635 patients, 351 (55.3%) were double sensitized to both venoms. The overall re-exposure rate to Hymenoptera stings during and after immunotherapy was 62.4%; the relapse rate was 7.1% (6.0% in mono sensitized, 7.8% in double sensitized patients). Recurring anaphylaxis was statistically less severe than the index sting reaction (P = 0.004). Double sensitization was not significantly related to relapsing anaphylaxis (P = 0.56), but there was a tendency towards an increased risk of relapse in a subgroup of patients with equal reactivity to both venoms in diagnostic tests (P = 0.15).Single venom-based immunotherapy over 3 to 5 years effectively and long-lastingly protects the vast majority of both mono sensitized and double sensitized Hymenoptera venom allergic patients. Double venom immunotherapy is indicated in clinically double allergic patients reporting systemic reactions to stings of both Hymenoptera and in those with equal reactivity to both venoms in diagnostic tests who have not reliably identified the culprit stinging insect.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of allergic diseases is increasing gradually and is a global burden affecting the socio-economic quality of life. Identification of allergens is the first step towards paving the way for therapeutic interventions against atopic diseases. Our previous investigation figured out that total pollen load correlated significantly with the rise of respiratory allergy in a subtropical city in India. The most dominant pollen responsible for IgE sensitivity in most patients emerged to be from Lantana camara (LC) an obnoxious weed growing in and around suburban areas of West Bengal. In this study, we identified allergenic components from this shrub using an immunoproteomic approach. Determination of dominant pollen species was done using aerobiological sampling during two consecutive years and correlated with hospitalization and skin prick test. Serum was collected from LC positive patients and checked for in vitro allergenicity using ELISA and Histamine assay. Total proteome was profiled in SDS–PAGE, 2D PAGE and immunoblotted to detect IgE binding proteins which were further identified using mass spectrometry. Lantana camara pollen emerged as a significant contributor from the correlation study with hospital admission of the respiratory allergy sufferers and its extract demonstrated an elevated IgE response in ELISA and histamine release assay tests. Five IgE reactive bands/zones were observed in 1D blot which resolved to 12 allergo-reactive spots in the 2D blot. Mass spectrometric analysis identified nine spots that grouped into four diverse proteins. Pathogenesis-related Thaumatin-like protein was found to be one of the major allergens in Lantana camara. This is to our knowledge the first attempt to identify allergens from Lantana camara using a proteomic approach. The allergens identified thereof can be used to prepare hypoallergenic vaccine candidates and design immunotherapy trials against LC pollen and other aeroallergen carriers which are cross-reactive and harbor similar proteins.",

    "abstract": "Primary immunodeficiency (PID) is a heterogeneous group of inheritable genetic disorders with increased susceptibility to infections, autoimmunity, uncontrolled inflammation and malignancy. Timely precise diagnosis of these patients is very essential since they may not be able to live with their congenital immunity defects; otherwise, they could survive with appropriate treatment. DNA biobanks of such patients could be used for molecular and genetic testing, facilitating the detection of underlying mutations in known genes as well as the discovery of novel genes and pathways. According to the last update of the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) classification, patients are registered in our biobank during a period of 15 years. All patients' data were collected via questionnaire and their blood samples were taken in order to extract and protect their DNA content. Our study comprised 197 patients diagnosed with PID. Antibody deficiency in 50 patients (25.4%), phagocytic defect in 47 patients (23.8%) and combined immunodeficiency with associated/syndromic feature in 19 patients (9.6%) were the most common PID diagnoses, respectively. The most common variant of PID in our study is common variable immunodeficiency, which accounted for 20 cases (10.1%), followed by chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis in 15 patients (7.9%) and congenital neutropenia in 13 patients (7%). Mean age at onset of disease was 4 years and mean age of diagnosis was 9.6 years. The average diagnostic delay was 5.5 years, with a range of 6 months to 46 years. Parental consanguinity and history of PID in family were observed in 70.2 and 48.9% of the patients, respectively. The majority of PID patients (93.3%) were from families with low socioeconomic status. This prospective study was designed to establish a PID Biobank in order to have a high quality DNA reservoir of these patients, shareable for international diagnostic and therapeutic collaborations. This article emphasizes the need to raise the awareness of society and general practitioners to achieve timely diagnosis of these patients and prevent current mismanagements.",

    "abstract": "Treat-to-target therapy approaches are established for chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and more recently rheumatoid arthritis, resulting in improved patient outcomes. These approaches do not use patient reported outcomes (PRO) as targets of therapy. Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), also called chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), is defined as recurrent urticaria of known and unknown cause, lasting more than 6 weeks. Treatment of CSU can be challenging. However, with the advent of proven therapies and validated instruments for measuring disease activity, the concept of treat-to-target (T2T) can be successfully applied to CSU. Herein, we propose a potential PRO therapeutic target and suggest a T2T approach for the management of patients with CSU.Principles and recommendations for a treat-to-target approach in CSU (T2T/CSU) were developed by a Canadian task force, consisting of dermatologists, immunologists, and allergists. The task force formulated recommendations for therapeutic targets in CSU on the basis of a systematic literature review and expert opinion.The key features of these T2T/CSU recommendations are the use of a PRO as the principal target, with symptom control as measured by Urticaria Activity Score 7 (UAS7 ≤ 6), targeting symptom remission (UAS7 = 0).Treatment targets such as UAS7 ≤ 6 and UAS7 = 0 provide a benchmark for success in the care of patients with CSU, and will permit the evaluation of a PRO-based T2T approach in the care of these patients and the effect of this approach on improved patient care as seen in other chronic diseases.",

A retrospective analysis of electronic medical record and administrative data was performed to determine primary adherence, defined as dispensation of a new EA prescription within 90 days of the date the prescription was written. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to test predictors of filling an EA prescription. Of 1212 EA prescriptions written between 2012 and 2014, only 69.9% (N = 847) were filled. An increased number of prescriptions for non-EA mediations was associated with an increased odds ratio of not filling an EA prescription. This is the first study in Canada to examine adherence for EA prescriptions. The non-adherence rate identified is higher than rates previously reported in the literature, and indicates that many EA prescriptions for adults seen in primary care may never be filled. It also suggests that prescriptions of EAs for all patients at risk of anaphylaxis in community settings should consistently be accompanied by concise information about the importance of having the EA prescription filled and having the EA readily available.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Loratadine is a second-generation, non-sedating antihistamine used for the relief of allergic rhinitis symptoms. Previous studies reported that when loratadine was encapsulated, the onset of action for symptom relief was 180 min. However, unmodified loratadine tablets were not evaluated at that time. Using data from a previously published Environmental Exposure Unit (EEU) study comparing azelastine nasal spray with loratadine tablets, cetirizine tablets, and placebo, this post hoc analysis determines the onset of action of loratadine tablets (i.e. unmodified) by analyzing the total symptom score for the relief of nasal and ocular seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) symptoms. Methods A Phase IV, randomized, single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, double-dummy, four-way crossover study was conducted in the EEU. Seventy participants were randomized sequentially into one of the four treatments during ragweed pollen exposure. Nasal and ocular symptom scores were self-reported by the participants and recorded. The original study analysis was carried out by evaluating the nasal symptom scores only. For this post hoc analysis, both nasal and ocular data from the loratadine and placebo treatment arms were analyzed. The primary endpoint for this analysis was the onset of action of loratadine as measured by the change in total symptom score (TSS) from baseline in comparison to placebo. The onset of ocular symptom relief using the total ocular symptom score (TOSS) was also reported. Results Loratadine tablets demonstrated a significant and durable improvement in both TSS ( P = .005) and TOSS ( P = .013) at 75 min post-treatment administration compared to placebo. The mean proportion of participants reporting none or mild for all component symptoms of TSS and TOSS at 75 min and thereafter was significantly higher in the loratadine (TSS, P = .0005; TOSS, P ≤ .0001) vs. placebo treatment arm. Conclusions The onset of action of loratadine tablets was 75 min for the relief of nasal and ocular symptoms in adults with SAR. These results suggest a faster onset of action for loratadine tablets (75 min) compared to previously reported studies which were conducted with modified (i.e. gelatin-encapsulated) loratadine tablets (180 min).

Patients may qualify for one or more of these targeted treatments, based on clinical characteristics and approved indications. However, the statistics are not well characterized, particularly in the Canadian population.The objective of this observational study was to identify and describe the proportion of patients with severe asthma who were eligible for targeting IgE, IL-5, or both pathways of immunomodulation. We reviewed a cross-sectional cohort of patients in a Canadian Allergy and Immunology referral practice. We also compared demographic and clinical characteristics of each group.Of the 128 patients with severe asthma, 84 (66%) were eligible for omalizumab, 100 (78%) for mepolizumab, 52 (41%) for reslizumab, and 68 (53%) for benralizumab. Overlap in treatment eligibility varied; 68 (53%) patients were eligible for both omalizumab and mepolizumab, 47 (37%) were eligible for omalizumab and benralizumab, and 37 (29%) were eligible for all four medications. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics were similar, and levels of serum biomarkers varied based on locally approved prescribing criteria.In this severe asthma population from a Canadian Allergist's practice, one-third of individuals qualified for all currently available biologics. 41-78% were eligible for at least one mAb. Patients were most likely to be eligible for mepolizumab. Objective assessments to determine asthma phenotype, along with further characterization of safety profiles will lead to further advances in asthma management.",

In this study, we aimed to investigate the risk factors for different wheezing phenotypes in Chinese young children and to explore the prognosis of recurrent wheezing. This cohort study contained the recruitment stage and the follow-up stage conducted by phone questionnaire survey. According to the information collected at the follow-up for wheezing episodes and remission age, our cohort was divided into transient wheezing, persistent wheezing and late-onset wheezing. The wheezing symptoms and potential risk factors were compared between these three wheezing groups. From the initial 109 participants, 78.0% completed the follow-up survey. The frequency of current wheezing at followup was significantly reduced in all three groups compared to the recruitment stage (p < 0.01). We observe a trend that the rhinovirus (RV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection rates were higher in the persistent wheezing group, and the overall infection rates appear to be the lowest in late-onset wheezing group at recruitment. At follow-up stage, the rates of rhinitis ever and current rhinitis were both higher in the persistent wheezing (63.0%, 50.0%) and late-onset wheezing groups (88.2%, 58.8%), compared to the transient wheezing group (14.3%, 14.3%). The incidence of current wheezing episodes increased cumulatively if the participant had concomitant risk factors of rhinitis ever, aeroallergens sensitization at recruitment, either alone or together with previous RV infection at the time of recruitment. While the incidence of wheezing declined overall with age, but in addition to transient wheezers, additional subsets of children manifest persistent wheeze or late onset wheeze, and moreover the risk factors for wheezing display phenotypic variability between these subgroups. Rhinitis ever and aeroallergens sensitization, either alone or together with previous RV infection, were the most significant predictors for persistent wheezing in children in an eastern environment, such as in China.",

Expression of the chemokine receptors, CCR2 and CX3CR1 on monocyte subsets relates to their function and can be used in their characterization. Our objective was to determine whether CD14, CD16, CCR2 and CX3CR1 on monocyte subsets are potential indicators of asthma severity.Blood samples were collected from Saudi Arabian patients with asthma and normal healthy individuals. Six-color flow-cytometry phenotypic analysis was used to identify human blood monocyte subsets, based on their expression of CD14 and CD16 following CD45 gating. Expression of CCR2 and CX3CR1 was analysed on classical (CD14++CD16-), intermediate (CD14++CD16+) and non-classical (CD14+CD16++) subsets and correlated with disease severity.We demonstrated a significant increase in percentage of total CD45-positive monocytes in the blood of patients with severe asthma, but the proportion of the individual monocyte subsets was not significantly changed when patients with mild, moderate and severe asthma were compared with healthy individuals. CD16 expression (mean fluorescence intensity, MFI) was decreased on intermediate and non-classical subsets in patients with severe asthma compared to healthy controls. CX3CR1 expression was also lower, with a lower percentage of cells expressing CX3CR1 in the non-classical CD14+CD16++ subset in all patients with asthma and this was inversely related to the percentage of cells expressing CCR2.CCR2 expression on monocytes indicated a tendency toward more phagocytic monocytes in patients with asthma. The differential expression of CD16, CX3CR1 and CCR2 on monocyte subsets in peripheral blood indicates modulation of the inflammatory response and suggests a role for monocytes in asthma pathogenesis.",

Through binding to it, dupilumab inhibits signaling of both IL-4 and IL-13, the representative Th2 biomarkers. Recently, in addition to the treatment effects for atopic dermatitis (AD), there is an emerging adverse event as facial erythema. Case presentation A twenty-seven-year-old female patient developed erythema and desquamation on the face and neck after dupilumab administration. She had AD on her arms, legs, and trunk before the treatment but there was no atopic clinical feature in her face and neck. With the treatment of dupilumab, her skin lesions of the body have improved from the beginning of the treatment. In the patch test, including dupilumab, there was no specific finding other than the 1+ response to neomycin on day 2. In the intradermal test to dupilumab, a positive result was observed 15 min later, but negative both days 1 and 2. The blood examination showed an elevation of both ANA as 1:80 and anti-phospholipid antibodies (Anti-cardiolipin IgM, IgG, and Anti- beta 2 GPI IgG). She was diagnosed with Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) based on diagnostic criteria by a rheumatologist. Conclusion Dupilumab is an emerging therapeutic agent for AD, and treatment cases are increasing in Korea. However, there are several adverse events during the treatment of dupilumab. Herein, we report the unexpected adverse event during the treatment of dupilumab in SLE patients.",

However, the role of PST is increasingly questioned in the pediatric setting. To resolve the question of PST's diagnostic accuracy, consecutive children with a history of non-life-threatening penicillin allergy referred to a tertiary-care allergy center were recruited to undergo double-blinded PST with PPL and BP prior to drug provocation to amoxicillin. Five of 158 participants (3.2%) presented with an immediate or accelerated reaction upon amoxicillin challenge, none of which were severe. Only one of these had positive PST (20%), compared to 15 of 153 amoxicillin tolerant participants (9.8%).

These results argue against the routine use of PST as a preliminary step to drug provocation with amoxicillin in this population, as it is unlikely to significantly alter pre-test probability of reacting to challenge.",

Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to determine whether asthma increases the risk of IPD. This meta-analysis was performed to validate and strengthen the association between asthma and IPD. Methods PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the reference lists of all relevant articles and books were screened until May 2019. Two authors independently assessed eligibility and study quality and extracted data. A common odds ratio was estimated using a random-effects meta-analysis model of aggregated published data. Results A total of eight studies with 8877 IPD cases and 78,366 controls were included. Our meta-analysis showed that asthma was significantly associated with the increased risk of IPD (OR 2.44 [95% CI, 2.02–2.96]). The children with asthma (0–17 years old) (OR 2.86 [95% CI 1.80–4.55]) had a higher risk of IPD susceptibility compared with the adult patients (≥ 18 years old) (OR 2.45 [95% CI 1.98–3.03]). Conclusions Results of this meta-analysis indicated that the patients with asthma had a higher risk of IPD susceptibility, especially among the children with asthma.",

    "abstract": "Despite strict avoidance, severely food-allergic children experience frequent and potentially severe food-induced anaphylaxis (FSFA). There are no accepted preventive interventions for FSFA. A Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formula prevents anaphylaxis in murine food allergy models, and has immunomodulatory effects in humans. We analyzed the effects of TCM treatment on three pediatric patients with FSFA.Three FSFA patients (P) ages 9-16 years (P1 allergic to milk; P2 and P3 to tree nuts) qualified for case analysis. All experienced numerous reactions requiring administration of rescue medications and emergency room (ER) visits during the 2 years prior to starting TCM. P1 experienced approximately 100 reactions, 50 epinephrine administrations, 40 ER visits, and 3 admissions to intensive care units. P2 experienced 30 reactions, all requiring epinephrine administration, as well as 10 emergency hospitalizations. P3 experienced 400 reactions, five of which required epinephrine administration and ER visits. TCM treatment markedly reduced or eliminated reactions in all. P1 experienced no reactions after 2.5 years of TCM. P2 experienced no reactions after 1 year of TCM treatment, at which time she passed an oral almond food challenge. She continues to be reaction-free 6 months off TCM while consuming nuts. P3 has achieved a 94% reduction in reaction frequency following 7 months of TCM, has discontinued daily antihistamine use, and has required no epinephrine administrations or ER visits.Three children treated with TCM experienced dramatic reductions or elimination of FSFA. This regimen appears to present a potential option for FSFA, and warrants further investigation in controlled clinical studies.",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, our group has demonstrated that murine preconception immunization with allergens has a protective effect on allergy development in offspring. The murine model used in the present study allowed us to compare allergy induction by ovalbumin (OVA) and dust mite extract from Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dp). Female mice were immunized with OVA or Dp. Pups from immunized and non-immune mothers were immunized at 3 days old (do) with the same antigen used for the maternal immunization. The offspring were analyzed at 20 do. Preconceptional immunization with OVA or Dp did not increase maternal IgE serum levels, although the immunizations induced an increase in allergen-specific IgG1 Ab levels. Offspring serum analyses revealed that maternal immunization with OVA suppressed IgE production only in offspring immunized with OVA. Both preconception immunization protocols inhibited cellular influx into the airways of immunized offspring compared with controls. Similar frequencies of offspring IgM + B cells were found in the OVA- and Dp-immunized groups compared with their respective control groups. Moreover, preconception immunization with OVA enhanced FcγRIIb expression on OVA-immunized offspring B cells. In contrast, decreased FcγRIIb expression was detected on Dp-immunized offspring B cells compared with cells from the offspring of non-immune mothers. Together, these results show that preconception OVA immunization and Dp immunization can inhibit allergy development but have opposite effects on FcγRIIb expression on offspring B cells.",

Drug allergies represent an important medical issue for general practitioners (GPs) in Romania, though no national data about incidence, severity and management exist.The aim of our study was to evaluate epidemiological aspects of drug allergies in primary care practice in Bucharest, especially the diagnostic and therapeutic attitudes of family doctors and their need for education and training in this field of pathology.A questionnaire with 21specific questions was addressed to 800 family doctors from Bucharest, either directly or via internet, with a response rate of 31,87%.The answers showed a significant interest of GPs in drug allergies, which are considered an increasing pathology. Almost half of the responders had never attended any form of education in allergology and 96% expressed a clear interest to participate in specialized educational programmes. We have noticed an underestimation of the severity of drug allergy, a surprisingly high percentage of allergy skin tests or blood tests recommended by GPs without specialist advice, and persistant confidence in alternative medicine.We concluded that the attitude towards and the competence regarding drug allergies of GPs in this study, as well as their collaboration with allergists, are not standardized and updated according to current guidelines. Further educational programs for GPs in drug allergies, based on standardized guidelines and national epidemiological studies for evaluation of drug allergy-related morbidity and mortality are needed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Allergic rhinitis (AR) is believed to be a complex genetic disease. The last decade has been marked by the publication of more than 20 genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of AR and associated allergic phenotypes and allergic diseases, which have shown allergic diseases and traits to share a large number of genetic susceptibility loci. The aim of present study was therefore to investigate the highly replicated allergy related genes and variants as candidates for AR in Han Chinese subjects. Methods A total of 762 AR patients and 760 control subjects were recruited, and a total of 58 susceptible variants previously reported to be associated with allergic traits were choose for replication. Results Logistic regression analyses revealed that in the co-dominant-effect model as assessed by the AIC, compared with wild-type carriers, significant AR risk were associated with rs9865818 in LPP ( P = 0.029, OR = 1.469 for GG vs. AA); rs6554809 in DNAH5 ( P = 0.000, OR = 1.597 for TC vs. CC); rs1438673 in WDR36-CAMK4 loci ( P = 0.037, OR = 1.396 for CC vs.TT), rs7775228 in HLA region ( P = 0.000, OR = 1.589 for TC vs.TT), rs7203459 in CLEC16A ( P = 0.025, OR = 0.731 for TC vs. TT). Conclusion We replicated Han Chinese AR-specific susceptibility loci in LPP, DNAH5, HLA, CLEC16A and WDR36-CAMK4. Further understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations may provide new insights into the etiology of allergic disease.",

    "abstract": "The Global Initiative for Asthma recommends the use of as-needed low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-formoterol as a preferred controller therapy for patients with mild asthma. These recommendations were based, in part, on evidence from the SYGMA 1 and 2 studies of as-needed budesonide-formoterol. This analysis aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of as-needed budesonide-formoterol to low-dose maintenance ICS plus as-needed short-acting β2-agonist (SABA) in patients with mild asthma. A Markov cohort model was designed that included three possible health states (non-exacerbation, severe exacerbation, and death) to compare as-needed budesonide-formoterol 200-6 μg to twice-daily budesonide 200 μg maintenance therapy (low-dose ICS) plus as-needed terbutaline 0.5 mg (SABA). The deterministic base-case analysis used severe exacerbation, adverse event (AE), and healthcare resource use data from SYGMA 2, and was conducted from a Canadian public payer perspective with a 50-year time horizon, and a discount rate of 1.5% per annum. Moderate exacerbation was modelled on data from SYGMA 1 in sensitivity analyses. Utility values were derived from SYGMA 2 quality of life data. All-cause- and asthma-related mortality rates and costs (reported in 2019 Canadian dollars) were based on published data, using Canada-specific values where available. One-way deterministic sensitivity, probabilistic sensitivity, and eight scenario analyses were conducted to examine the robustness of the results. As-needed budesonide-formoterol was the dominant treatment option in the base-case analysis, providing incremental cost savings of $9882 per patient and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains of 0.002 versus low-dose maintenance ICS plus as-needed SABA over a 50-year time horizon. Using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY ($100,000/QALY), as-needed budesonide-formoterol had a 94% (95%) probability of being cost-effective compared with maintenance ICS plus as-needed SABA. Cost-saving was mostly driven by lower overall medication and AE-related costs. As-needed budesonide-formoterol remained the dominant treatment in sensitivity and scenario analyses. As-needed budesonide-formoterol is a cost-saving option for the treatment of mild asthma from the perspective of the Canadian public payer compared with low-dose maintenance ICS plus as-needed SABA.",

We aimed to test whether fecal calprotectin can be used to monitor food allergies in infants by comparing the fecal calprotectin levels in infants with a milk protein allergy before and after an intervention treatment.The study was designed as a prospective case-control trial. Stool samples were collected at follow-up, and the concentration of fecal calprotectin was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The infant's weight and length were measured.The allergic group comprised 90 milk-allergic infants (41 boys, 49 girls), and the nonallergic group comprised 90 nonallergic infants (51 boys, 39 girls). Compared with the fecal calprotectin level in the nonallergic group (median: 141 μg/g), that in the allergic group (median: 410 μg/g) was significantly higher (z = - 9.335, p < 0.001). After two dietary interventions and treatments, the fecal calprotectin levels of the infants with a milk protein allergy at the first (median: 253 μg/g) and second follow-up visits (median: 160 μg/g) were significantly lower than those before the intervention (z = - 7.884, p < 0.001 and z = - 8.239, p < 0.001, respectively). The growth index values (LAZ and WAZ) of the infants with a milk protein allergy at the first and second follow-up visits were significantly higher than those before dietary intervention (p < 0.05). Fecal calprotectin was negatively and significantly correlated with the WLZ and WAZ at the second follow-up visit (Spearman's rho = - 0.234, p = 0.01 and Spearman's rho = - 0.193, p = 0.03, respectively).The level of fecal calprotectin in infants with a milk protein allergy decreased after dietary intervention and seems to be a promising biological indicator for monitoring intestinal allergies.",

Studies revealed their health promoting functions, such as anti-oxidant, anti-cancer and anti-bacterial properties. Additionally, studies also revealed their roles in ameliorating the symptoms of allergic disorders, indicating their anti-allergic properties. In the present study, using the differential-interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, we examined the effects of caffeine and catechin on the degranulation from rat peritoneal mast cells. Both caffeine and catechin dose-dependently decreased the numbers of degranulating mast cells. At concentrations equal to or higher than 25 mM, caffeine and catechin markedly suppressed the numbers of degranulating mast cells. In contrast, at relatively lower concentrations, both substances did not significantly affect the numbers of degranulating mast cells. However, surprisingly enough, low concentrations of catechin (1, 2.5 mM) synergistically enhanced the suppressive effect of 10 mM caffeine on mast cell degranulation. These results provided direct evidence for the first time that caffeine and catechin dose-dependently inhibited the process of exocytosis. At relatively lower concentrations, caffeine or catechin alone did not stabilize mast cells. However, low concentrations of catechin synergistically potentiated the mast cell-stabilizing property of caffeine.",

This study aimed to identify the specific IgE related to clinical features of COPD and the diagnosis of asthma-COPD overlap (ACO). Methods We recruited 76 patients with COPD and analyzed 39 IgE using panel IgE test (View Allergy 39 ® ). ACO was diagnosed according to the Japanese Respiratory Society Guidelines. Results As for perennial aeroallergens, the positivity for moth (31.5%), Candida (23.7%), Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (22.4%) and house dust (22.4%), and concerning pollen, Japanese cedar (35.5%) and Japanese cypress (22.2%) exceeded 20%. Only the positivity of IgE for Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and house dust was significantly higher in ACO compared with that in non-ACO COPD. Moreover, it contributed to the diagnosis of ACO in an IgE class-dependent manner. Patients with cockroach IgE exhibited higher residual volume, whereas those with Japanese cedar IgE exhibited better diffusion capacity than negative patients. The contribution for ACO diagnosis by the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was comparable among total IgE (cutoff value: 158 IU/mL), blood eosinophil count (234/μL), and fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (31.0 ppb). Conclusions The prominent role of mite-specific IgE in the diagnosis and pathology of ACO and the potentially detrimental effect of cockroach sensitization on air trapping in COPD were suggested. The finding highlights the future development of a treatment targeting IgE as a treatable trait in COPD.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Allergic asthma is an inflammatory disease resulting from continued or intermittent allergen exposure, and allergic rhinitis can be trigger of asthma. The main mechanism of these disease is allergic reaction and immune response dysregulation. Co-Q10 is an enzyme cofactor in mitochondria can control asthma and allergic rhinitis symptoms. In the present study, we determined that the CoQ10-induced anti-allergic effects were mediated by up-regulation of Nrf2. Methods Animal models of allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma were produced and treated with Co-Q10, Co-Q10 and O-3, Co-Q10 and Mg-S. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected from animal models, and IL-4, 5, 13, INF-y, Eicosanoids, IgE, EPO, and histamine production were measured. Also, COX-2, CCL24, CCL11, Nrf2, Eotaxin, Cytb, COX1 and ND1 genes expressions and histopathology were studied. BALf's cells were collected by tracheostomy and used in slide producing by cytospine. Cytokines, Eicosanoids, IgE, EPO, and histamine were measured by ELISA method. Gene expression was done by Real-time PCR. Results Co-Q10 with two supplementation (Mg-S and O-3) modulate MRC, BALf eosinophils, eosinophilic inflammation related genes (eotaxin, CCL11 and CCL24), peribronchial and perivascular inflammation, EPO, type 2 cytokines (IL-4, 5 and 13), IgE, histamine, Cyc-LT and LTB4 as main allergic bio-factors. Importantly, Co-Q10 treatment increased Nrf2 expression and Nrf2 induced antioxidant genes, glutathione redox and inhibited inflammation, oxidative stress injury, Th2 cytokines production and attenuated allergic inflammatory responses. Conclusion Nrf2 is activated in response to allergen, induces resistance against the rhinitis and asthma development and plays an essential role in broncho-protection. Co-Q10 increases the Nrf2 expression and the Nrf2 over-expression has strong effect in control of type2 cytokines, allergic mediators and inflammatory factors that lead to harnessing of allergy and asthma.

    "abstract": "Body mass index (BMI) is associated with asthma but associations of BMI temporal patterns with asthma incidence are unclear. Previous studies suggest that DNA methylation (DNAm) is associated with asthma status and variation in DNAm is a consequence of BMI changes. This study assessed the direct and indirect (via DNAm) effects of BMI trajectories in childhood on asthma incidence at young adulthood. Data from the Isle of Wight (IoW) birth cohort were included in the analyses. Group-based trajectory modelling was applied to infer latent BMI trajectories from ages 1 to 10 years. An R package, ttscreening, was applied to identify differentially methylated CpGs at age 10 years associated with BMI trajectories, stratified for sex. Logistic regressions were used to further exclude CpGs with DNAm at age 10 years not associated with asthma incidence at 18 years. CpGs discovered via path analyses that mediated the association of BMI trajectories with asthma incidence in the IoW cohort were further tested in an independent cohort, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Children and Parents (ALSPAC). Two BMI trajectories (high vs. normal) were identified. Of the 442,474 CpG sites, DNAm at 159 CpGs in males and 212 in females were potentially associated with BMI trajectories. Assessment of their association with asthma incidence identified 9 CpGs in males and 6 CpGs in females. DNAm at 4 of these 15 CpGs showed statistically significant mediation effects (p-value < 0.05). At two of the 4 CpGs (cg23632109 and cg10817500), DNAm completely mediated the association (i.e., only statistically significant indirect effects were identified). In the ALSPAC cohort, at all four CpGs, the same direction of mediating effects were observed as those found in the IoW cohort, although statistically insignificant. The association of BMI trajectory in childhood with asthma incidence at young adulthood is possibly mediated by DNAm.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Cannabis use is growing domestically due to recent legalization in many jurisdictions. There are two main species of cannabis, Cannabis sativa and Cannabis indica , and thousands of different commercially available cannabis strains. Although there are multiple reports of cannabis allergy in the literature, to our knowledge, there is no prior published report of selective cannabis strain allergy. Case presentation A 31-year-old male was referred for allergy assessment due to several episodes of localized pruritus and erythema after direct contact with various strains of cannabis. He had noted that the severity of his reaction appeared to be strain dependent. He developed a severe local reaction involving bilateral periorbital edema shortly after coming into direct contact with one particular strain of cannabis. He denied any adverse symptoms after inhalation of cannabis. Fresh skin prick testing was performed to various strains of cannabis and had positive testing to the three of the five tested strains. Conclusions We believe this is the first reported case of selective cannabis strain allergy based on patient history and skin prick testing. This case report outlines the variability in different strains of cannabis and stresses the importance of further research into cannabis allergen identification. Multiple cannabis allergens should be included and incorporated into commercial extracts when they become routinely available.",

Mice were rechallenged with 2.5% OVA-PBS on 22 and 28 day. Mice were sacrificed using on day 30 under 35 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium. PBMCs were induced vitro model of asthma using 500 ng of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) for 4 h.The expression of miRNA-221-5p was reduced in in vivo model, compared sham group. The vitro model of asthma treated with miRNA-221-5p mimic resulted in the reduction of IL-6, IL-17, IL-21 and IL-22 levels, and induction of IL-10, IL-35 and TGF-β levels. In addition, down-regulation of miRNA-221-5p induced the protein expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) and receptor-related orphan receptor-gamma-t (RORγt) and suppressed that of FOXP3 in in vitro model of asthma. Over-expression of miRNA-221-5p induced the protein expression of FOXP3, and suppressed that of SOCS1 and RORγt in in vitro model of asthma. The inhibition of SOCS1 or RORγt attenuated the effects of anti-miRNA-221-5p on Th17/Treg ratio in asthma.miRNA-221-5p may play critical roles in driving the differentiation of Th17/Treg ratio via RORγt/Foxp3 by Targeting SOCS1, reduced the function of Th17 cells by directly inhibiting RORγt/SOCS1 and promoted the function of Treg cells via Foxp3/ SOCS1 in asthma.",

Traditionally radiolabelled thymidine (3H-thymidine) has been used but requires the handling and disposal of radioactive materials.To examine safe alternatives to 3H-thymidine, test assay modifications for improved assay sensitivity and evaluate the modified LTT in patients with DRESS and AGEP.Four proliferation detection assays (BRDU, CyQUANT™, MTT and XTT) were screened for LTT sensitivity. XTT the most sensitive and practical was selected for further evaluation Modifications like autologous serum (AS) and regulatory T cell depletion (T-REG) were tested for improved assay sensitivity. Finally, an initial evaluation of the XTT-LTT was performed in 8 patients with DRESS and 2 with AGEP including cytokine testing.Of the non-radioactive alternatives we tested, XTT a colorimetric assay was the most sensitive and practical to move to evaluation. The addition of AS increased background signal. Depletion of T-REGs improved sensitivity but cell sorting time and risk of contamination limited benefit. Of eight patients diagnosed with DRESS and 2 with AGEP tested with XTT-LTT assay results showed our assay matched clinical findings of implicated drugs in 8/10 patients when using a stimulation index (SI) ≥ 2 and 8/10 with analysis by ANOVA. All ten patients were correctly diagnosed by either analysis.XTT appears to be a safe, viable alternative to 3H-thymidine, with high sensitivity and allowing direct cytokine quantification on specific patient cells.",

This study aimed to investigate the clinical diagnostic and prognostic values of lymphocyte subsets and function in symptomatic SIgAD patients.A total of 30 available SIgAD patients from the Iranian registry and 30 age-sex-matched healthy controls were included in the present study. We analyzed B and T cell peripheral subsets and T cell proliferation assay by flow cytometry in SIgAD patients with mild and severe clinical phenotypes.Our results indicated a significant increase in naïve and transitional B cells and a strong decrease in marginal zone-like and switched memory B-cells in SIgAD patients. We found that naïve and central memory CD4+ T cell subsets, as well as Th1, Th2 and regulatory T cells, have significantly decreased. On the other hand, there was a significant reduction in central and effector memory CD8+ T cell subsets, whereas proportions of both (CD4+ and CD8+) terminally differentiated effector memory T cells (TEMRA) were significantly elevated in our patients. Although some T cell subsets in severe SIgAD were similar, a decrease in marginal-zone and switched memory B cells and an increase in CD21low B cell of severe SIgAD patients were slightly prominent. Moreover, the proliferation activity of CD4+ T cells was strongly impaired in SIgAD patients with a severe phenotype.SIgAD patients have varied cellular and humoral deficiencies. Therefore, T cell and B cell assessment might help in better understanding the heterogeneous pathogenesis and prognosis estimation of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) has been revolutionized by the use of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein modulators such as elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) triple therapy. Prior studies support a role for type 2 (T2) inflammation in many people with CF (PwCF) and CF-asthma overlap syndrome (CFAOS) is considered a separate clinical entity. It is unknown whether initiation of ETI therapy impacts T2 inflammation in PwCF. We hypothesized that ETI initiation decreases T2 inflammation in PwCF. A single center retrospective chart review was conducted for adult PwCF. As markers of T2 inflammation, absolute eosinophil count (AEC) and total immunoglobulin E (IgE) data were collected longitudinally 12 months prior to ETI therapy initiation and 12 months following therapy initiation. Multivariable analyses adjusted for the age, gender, CFTR mutation, disease severity, inhaled steroid use, and microbiological colonization. There was a statistically significant reduction (20.10%, p < 0.001) in 12-month mean total IgE following ETI initiation; this change remained statistically significant in the multivariate model. The longitudinal analysis demonstrated no change in AEC following therapy initiation. This study demonstrates that there is a statistically significant percent reduction in mean total IgE but no change in AEC following ETI initiation. ETI may lead to decreased antigen and superantigen load in the airway as a result of improved mucociliary clearance and these changes may drive the decline in total IgE, without influencing the epigenetic drivers of eosinophilic inflammation. Further studies are warranted to determine the underlying mechanism of ETI impact on T2 inflammation and possible role for asthma immunomodulator therapy post ETI initiation in CFAOS.",

Patient characteristics were collated in the IP and treatment pattern data during the IP plus the following year (July 2019-June 2020; observation period [OP]). Data were stratified by sinus surgery and biologic use.Of the 5997 eligible patients identified (58% male, mean age 48.1 years), 10.7% (n = 642) used biologics during the OP. More biologic users had common respiratory conditions than non-users, particularly asthma (89.1% vs 35.0%; P < 0.001). Biologic users had fewer diagnostic services but more drug-related services than non-users. Only 11.6% of patients who had sinus surgery used biologics, with most (56.1%) having their first biologic dose before sinus surgery and 12.5% ≤ 30 days after. Oral corticosteroid (OCS) use was higher in biologic users than non-users (all patients: 68.8% vs 42.5%; P < 0.001) and in those with/without sinus surgery. Comorbidities, prior OCS/doxycycline use, and age (< 65 years) increased the odds of biologic use, with asthma increasing the odds 5.46 times (P < 0.001).Biologic use was more common before first/next sinus surgery and in patients with high unmet need, elucidating predictors of biologic use that could be used in clinical practice.",

Identification of the early signs of comorbidity of AR and asthma can enable prompt treatment and prevent asthma progression. This study investigated the role of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the comorbidity of AR and asthma and lung function in Korean children with perennial AR (PAR). A cohort of 240 subjects (6 to 10 years old) with PAR (PAR alone: 113 children, PAR and asthma: 127 children) was analyzed for various biomarkers, including IL-1β, iNOS, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in serum. The blood levels of eosinophils and immunoglobulin E (IgE) were examined. IL-1β, CCL-24, E-cadherin, and vimentin were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Epithelial iNOS was measured by the NOS kit. Elevated levels of IL-1β, iNOS, and vimentin in the serum were identified as significant indicators of the likelihood of comorbidity of PAR and asthma in children. Furthermore, higher concentrations of IL-1β, iNOS, and vimentin have been linked to reduced lung function in PAR children. Notably, IL-1β expression shows a relationship with the levels of E-cadherin, vimentin, and CCL-24. However, no correlation was found between IL-1β and iNOS expressions. This study suggests that IL-1β and iNOS can be biomarkers in the progression of PAR and asthma and decreased lung function, suggesting potential targets for early intervention and treatment.",

The role of IL-36 in the context of asthma and asthmatic phenotypes is not well characterized. We examined the sputum IL-36 levels in patients with different asthma phenotypes in order to unravel the mechanism of IL-36 in different asthma phenotypes. Our objective was to investigate the induced sputum IL-36α, IL-36β, IL-36γ, and IL-36Ra concentrations in patients with mild asthma, and to analyze the relationship of these markers with lung function and other cytokines in patients with different asthma phenotypes. Induced sputum samples were collected from patients with mild controlled asthma (n = 62, 27 males, age 54.77 ± 15.49) and healthy non-asthmatic controls (n = 16, 10 males, age 54.25 ± 14.60). Inflammatory cell counts in sputum were determined. The concentrations of IL-36 and other cytokines in the sputum supernatant were measured by ELISA and Cytometric Bead Array. This is the first study to report the differential expression of different isoforms of IL-36 in different asthma phenotypes. IL-36α and IL-36β concentrations were significantly higher in the asthma group ( P = 0.003 and 0.031), while IL-36Ra concentrations were significantly lower ( P &lt; 0.001) compared to healthy non-asthmatic controls. Sputum IL-36α and IL-36β concentrations in the neutrophilic asthma group were significantly higher than those in paucigranulocytic asthma (n = 24) and eosinophilic asthma groups (n = 23). IL-36α and IL-36β showed positive correlation with sputum neutrophils and total cell count (R = 0.689, P &lt; 0.01; R = 0.304, P = 0.008; R = 0.689, P &lt; 0.042; R = 0.253, P = 0.026). In conclusion, IL-36α and IL-36β may contribute to asthma airway inflammation by promoting neutrophil recruitment in airways.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) occurs more commonly in asthma patients than in the general population because these conditions share some comorbidities. In Japan, the prevalence of OSA in the general population is reported to be approximately 20%; however, few reports have described the prevalence of OSA in asthma patients. Furthermore, the characteristics of Japanese patients with OSA and asthma are not clear. Methods Adult asthma patients were recruited from the outpatient departments of our institution between August 31, 2017, and March 31, 2019. In all included patients, the presence and severity of OSA were evaluated by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and a home sleep test (HST) using portable polysomnography (PSG). The rate of coexisting OSA in asthma patients and the characteristics of those patients according to the severity of OSA were investigated. Results Fifty-three patients were included. OSA was detected in 36 (67.9%) patients (mild, n = 15; moderate, n = 14; and severe, n = 7). Patients with OSA had significantly higher body mass index, Brinkman index, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), and 3% oxygen desaturation index (ODI) values in comparison to those without OSA, while the percentage of the predicted value of forced vital capacity (%FVC) and lowest SpO 2 levels were significantly lower. As the severity of OSA increased, age, brain natriuretic peptide level, AHI, and 3%ODI increased, and in contrast, FVC, %FVC, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ), percentage of the predicted value of FEV 1 (%FEV 1 ), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), 3%ODI, and lowest SpO 2 levels decreased. In particular, the fact that the ESS value was inversely correlated with the severity of OSA in our patients was different from the general characteristics of OSA. Moreover, the AHI value was negatively correlated with FVC, %FVC, FEV 1 , and %FEV 1 . BMI was the only independent factor for the presence of OSA, and for asthma severity (FEV1, % of predicted), there was a weak correlation with smoking history. Conclusions This is the first report to investigate the prevalence of OSA in Japanese asthma patients, using an HST. This study suggests that an HST should be performed in addition to the sleep interview for asthma patients with refractory disease, a low pulmonary function, advanced age, and high BMI because the more severe the OSA, the lower the ESS value may be.",

When this does occur, patients typically present with gastrointestinal symptoms. To our knowledge, hypoproteinemia has not been reported as the primary manifestation. Anti-IgE therapy, such as omalizumab, lowers eosinophil counts in the blood, lungs, and gut. Its efficiency in treating active EoG remain unknown. Case presentation We report a 33-month-old boy with a history of food allergy and atopic dermatitis who developed recurrent edema, hypoproteinemia, and eosinophilia at the age of 14 months. The diagnoses of EoG and GSE were confirmed based on the clinical presentation and results of gastrointestinal biopsies and serological testing. Although prednisone and dietary intervention were initially effective, the boy developed prednisone-related facial swelling. After stopping prednisone, his symptoms relapsed. Subsequent treatment with omalizumab, combined with dietary intervention, showed good efficacy and safety. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first case of concurrent EoG and GSE that presented primarily with hypoproteinemia. We highlight the rare manifestations of these two diseases to raise clinical suspicion and prevent missed and delayed diagnoses. The pathogenesis of EoG is heterogeneous and complex. Omalizumab showed good efficacy, indicating that IgE-mediated processes may be involved in the pathogenesis of this patient’s diseases.",

The objective of this investigation was to elucidate the functional dynamics of the circ_0070934/miR-199a-5p/Mannoside acetylglucosaminyltransferase 3 (MGAT3) axis in the development of asthma. Methods Circ_0070934, miR-199a-5p and MGAT3 in peripheral venous blood of 38 asthmatic patients and 43 healthy controls were detected by qRT-PCR, and the expression of MGAT3 protein was examined by ELISA. The GSE148000 dataset was analyzed for differences in MGAT3. The BEAS-2B cells were transfected with circ_0070934 plasmid and small interfering RNA, miR-199a-5p mimics and inhibitors. The apoptosis level was detected by flow cytometry and MGAT3 was detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot. The expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Vimentin was examined by Western blot. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13 were used to co-stimulate BEAS-2B cells as an asthmatic airway epithelial cell model. BEAS-2B cells exposed to type 2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) were treated with circ_0070934 plasmid, and the expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and Vimentin was detected by Western blot. The binding relationships were verified using dual-luciferase reporter assay and miRNA pull-down assay. Results The expression of circ_0070934 and MGAT3 in peripheral venous blood of asthmatic patients was down-regulated, and the expression of miR-199a-5p was up-regulated. And the expression of MGAT3 was reduced in sputum of asthma patients. Down-regulating the expression of circ_0070934 could promote apoptosis of BEAS-2B cells and increase epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and this effect can be partially reversed by down-regulating miR-199a-5p. Circ_0070934 could inhibit the process of epithelial mesenchymal transition induced by IL-4 and IL-13 in BEAS-2B cells. In addition, miR-199a-5p could respectively bind to circ_0070934 and MGAT3. Conclusion The findings of this study indicate that circ_0070934 may function as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) of miR-199a-5p, thereby modulating the expression of MGAT3 and impacting the process of EMT in bronchial epithelial cells. These results contribute to the establishment of a theoretical framework for advancing the prevention and treatment strategies for asthma.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Serum-sickness like reactions (SSLRs) to amoxicillin have been documented in the medical literature. Beta-lactams are important and commonly used medications especially in the pediatric population. Often, SSLRs present within days of and during first exposure/ingestion to the offending agent. We described a unique case of a 4-year-old boy who presented with symptoms of amoxicillin SSLR following his second course of amoxicillin with only 2 months and 10 days between his second and first course. Case presentation A 4-year-old boy presented to hospital with a pruritic rash on day 7 of a 10-day course of amoxicillin for otitis media accompanied by fever (38.7 degrees Celsius). On day 7 of his second course of amoxicillin, which was separated from his first course by only 2 months and 10 days, his mother noticed erythematous, raised, pruritic lesions with central clearing on his sternum. He presented to the ED with emesis, progression of the rash to his torso, back, legs, and face, hypotension, angioedema, and joint pain. His bloodwork demonstrated a leukocytosis of 18.6 × 10 9 g/L with neutrophilic predominance and thrombocytosis with a platelet count of 653 × 10 9 g/L. He was treated with 5 mg oral cetirizine daily and 1 mg/kg oral prednisone which improved his rash and angioedema. He was managed with up to 4 times the usual dose of cetirizine. He was assessed in our outpatient clinic as an outpatient and penicillin skin testing was unremarkable. A diagnosis of a probable SSLR to amoxicillin was made. Conclusion We report an unusual presentation of SSLR following re-exposure to amoxicillin. Our case highlights that patients with previous asymptomatic exposure to amoxicillin can develop SSLR with repeat exposure. Although it is not uncommon for children to develop amoxicillin SSLRs after previous exposure to the drug, this case is unique because of its short time course of 2 months and 10 days months between drug courses. Penicillins are commonly used in the pediatric population. Therefore, it is important to correctly characterize adverse drug reactions to broaden our understanding of SSLRs, prevent unnecessary avoidance of the triggering agent, and improve patient management.",

The inflammatory patterns may differ among patients, leading to different subtypes based on the dominant inflammatory cell type. This study aimed to compare the differences in cytokine expression and disease severity between plasma cell-dominant and eosinophil-dominant subtypes in patients with CRSwNP. Methods This study included 53 CRSwNP patients and 19 control subjects who did not have asthma or a history of cigarette smoking. The expression of cytokines and inflammatory cells was assessed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Results Among the cytokines analyzed, only IL-6 was significantly different between the two subtypes. A greater proportion of mast cells and IgE cells was present in plasma cell-dominant CRSwNP patients than in eosinophil-dominant group. For the three disease severity scores (LMK-CT, TPS and SNOT-22), objective scores (LMK-CT and TPS) were greater in the eosinophil-dominant CRSwNP group, while the opposite result was shown for the subjective score (SNOT-22). Additionally, the percentage of plasma cell-dominant cells was significantly positively correlated with disease severity according to the TPS and SNOT-22 scores. Conclusions Our data revealed that plasma cell-dominant inflammation, a subtype of type 2 CRS, was significantly correlated with subjective disease severity. The study also highlights the role of IL-6, IgE and mast cells as distinguishing factors between eosinophil-dominant and plasma cell-dominant CRSwNP. This information could be useful for clinical diagnosis and personalized treatment.",

Although acute heart failure has been rarely described in association with azathioprine hypersensitivity syndrome, myocardial infarction has, to our knowledge, never been associated with this entity. Case Presentation We describe a case of a 59-year-old male with Crohn’s disease who developed severe azathioprine hypersensitivity syndrome that included distributive shock, neutrophilic dermatosis, and acute coronary syndrome with ST-elevation. Clinical improvement was seen after cessation of azathioprine and administration of glucocorticoid therapy. Conclusion Prompt recognition of azathioprine hypersensitivity syndrome, which can manifest as shock and neutrophilic dermatosis, is key to ensure rapid azathioprine cessation.",

Additionally, to determine if prodromal symptoms are sensitive and specific enough to start treatment with C-1 INH and possibly other newly approved therapies. Also, to discuss who is appropriate to self-administer medications at home and to discuss training of such patients.A literature review (PubMed and Google) was performed and articles published in peer-reviewed journals, which addressed HAE prophylaxis, current HAE treatments, prodromal symptoms of HAE and self-administration of injected home medications were selected, reviewed and summarized.Individuals whom have a significant decrease in QOL or have frequent or severe attacks and who fail or are intolerant to androgens should be considered for long-term prophylaxis with C1INH. Prodromal symptoms are sensitive, but non-specific, and precede acute HAE attacks in the majority of patients. Although the treatment of prodromal symptoms could lead to occasional overtreatment, it could be a viable option for those patients able to adequately predict their attacks. Finally, self-administration, has been shown to be feasible, safe and effective for patients who require IV therapy for multiple other diseases to include, but not limited to, hemophilia.Prophylactic therapy, treatment at the time of prodromal symptoms and self-administration at home all should allow a reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with HAE.",

    "abstract": "Mounting evidence supports a key role for VIP as an anti-inflammatory agent and promoter of immune tolerance. It suppresses TNF-α and other inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, upregulates anti-inflammatory IL-10, and promotes immune tolerant cells called T regulatory (Treg) cells. VIP KO mice have recently been demonstrated to have spontaneous airway and pulmonary perivascular inflammatory responses, as part of asthma-like and pulmonary hypertension phenotypes, respectively. Both inflammatory responses are correctable with VIP. Focusing on this model, we have now investigated the influence of VIP not only on inflammatory cells but also on Treg cells.Using flow cytometric analysis, we examined the relative preponderance of CD25+CD4+ cells and anti-inflammatory Treg cells, in extracts of thymus and spleen from VIP KO mice (5 VIP KO; 5 VIP KO+ VIP; 10 wild-type). This method allowed antibody-based flow cytometric identification of Treg cells using surface markers CD25 and CD4, along with the: 1) intracellular activation marker FoxP3; and 2) Helios, which distinguishes cells of thymic versus splenic derivation.Deletion of the VIP gene results in: 1) CD25+CD4- cell accumulation in the thymus, which is corrected by VIP treatment; 2) more Treg in thymus lacking Foxp3 expression, suggesting VIP is necessary for immune tolerance; and, 3) a tendency towards deficiency of Treg cells in the spleen, which is normalized by VIP treatment. Treg lacking Helios are induced by VIP intrasplenically rather than by migration from the thymus. These results confirm the dual role of VIP as an anti-inflammatory and immune tolerance-promoting agent.",

Birth order has been identified as a risk factor for atopy and evidence for some candidate genes has been accumulated; however no study has yet assessed a birth order-gene interaction. To investigate the interaction of IL13 polymorphisms with birth order on allergic sensitization at ages 4, 10 and 18 years. Mother-infant dyads were recruited antenatally and followed prospectively to age 18 years. Questionnaire data (at birth, age 4, 10, 18); skin prick test (SPT) at ages 4, 10, 18; total serum IgE and specific inhalant screen at age 10; and genotyping for IL13 were collected. Three SNPs were selected from IL13: rs20541 (exon 4, nonsynonymous SNP), rs1800925 (promoter region) and rs2066960 (intron 1). Analysis included multivariable log-linear regression analyses using repeated measurements to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs). Of the 1456 participants, birth order information was available for 83.2% (1212/1456); SPT was performed on 67.4% at age 4, 71.2% at age 10 and 58.0% at age 18. The prevalence of atopy (sensitization to one or more food or aeroallergens) increased from 19.7% at age 4, to 26.7% at 10 and 41.1% at age 18. Repeated measurement analysis indicated interaction between rs20541 and birth order on SPT. The stratified analyses demonstrated that the effect of IL13 on SPT was restricted only to first-born children (p = 0.007; adjusted PR = 1.35; 95%CI = 1.09, 1.69). Similar findings were noted for firstborns regarding elevated total serum IgE at age 10 (p = 0.007; PR = 1.73; 1.16, 2.57) and specific inhalant screen (p = 0.034; PR = 1.48; 1.03, 2.13). This is the first study to show an interaction between birth order and IL13 polymorphisms on allergic sensitization. Future functional genetic research need to determine whether or not birth order is related to altered expression and methylation of the IL13 gene.",

Depression is an important co-morbidity in adolescents with asthma that may significantly impact their controller medication adherence and other asthma-related outcomes. The modifying effect of depressive symptoms on an asthma intervention's ability to improve asthma controller medication adherence among urban adolescents with asthma has not yet been reported. To assess self-reported symptoms of depression as an effect modifier of the relationship between randomization group and controller medication adherence at 6-month follow-up. These analyses use data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted in Detroit high schools to evaluate a tailored asthma management program. The intervention included referrals to school or community resources for students reporting symptoms of depression and other issues. \"Elevated depressive symptoms\" was defined as a positive answer to ≥ 5 of 7 questions from a validated tool included on the baseline questionnaire. Self-reported adherence to controller medication was collected at intervention onset (session 1) and at 6-month follow up. Analyses were restricted to students with report of a controller medication at baseline. Logistic regression was used to assess elevated depressive symptoms as an effect modifier of the relationship between randomization group and 6-month adherence. Of the 422 students enrolled in the RCT, a controller medication was reported at intervention onset by n = 123 adolescents (29%). Analyzing this group, we observed an interaction between elevated depressive symptoms and adherence (p = 0.073). Stratified analysis showed better adherence in treatment group adolescents meeting criteria for elevated depressive symptoms at baseline as compared to the control group (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] = 9.50; p = 0.024). For adolescents without elevated depressive symptoms at baseline, differences in adherence by group assignment did not reach statistical significance (aOR 1.40, p = 0.49). In this sample of students reporting controller medications at baseline, report of elevated depressive symptoms at baseline and randomization to the intervention group was associated with significantly better adherence at 6-month follow up when compared to that of a control group. Larger studies are needed to evaluate the impact of depression on the relationship between adherence and asthma intervention effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Contribution of nitric-oxide (NO) pathway to the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma (asthma) is ambiguous as NO may confer both protective and detrimental effects depending on the NO synthase (NOS) isoforms, tissue compartments and underlying pathological conditions (e.g. systemic inflammation). Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an endogenous inhibitor and uncoupler of NOS with distinct selectivity for NOS isoforms. In a cross-sectional study, we assessed whether ADMA is an independent predictor of airway resistance (Raw) in therapy-controlled asthma. 154 therapy-controlled asthma patients were recruited. ADMA, symmetric dimethylarginine and arginine were quantitated by HPLC with fluorescent detection. Pulmonary function test was done using whole-body plethysmography, quality of life via St. George’s Respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ). Multiple linear regression was used to identify independent determinants of Raw. The final model was stratified based on therapy control. Evidence for systemic inflammation indicated by CRP and procalcitonin was lacking in our sample. Log Raw showed significant positive correlation with log ADMA in the whole data set and well-controlled but not in the not well-controlled stratum (Spearman correlation coefficients: 0.27, p < 0.001; 0.30, p < 0.001; 0.12, p = 0.51 respectively). This relationship remained significant after adjusting for confounders by multiple linear regression (β = 0.22, CI 0.054, 0.383 p = 0.01). FEF 25–75% % predicted and SGRQ Total score showed significant negative while SGRQ Activity score showed significant positive correlation with Raw in the final model. Positive correlation between Raw and ADMA in the absence of systemic inflammation implies that higher ADMA has detrimental effect on NO homeostasis and can contribute to a poor outcome in asthma.",

    "abstract": "Atopic allergy is a widespread disease with increasing prevalence in the second half of the twentieth century and is most often associated with clinical symptoms, like rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma or eczema. This study explored the prevalence of atopy and polysensitization in nine cohorts of Swiss medical students during the period of 2007-2015. Furthermore, the self-reported allergic symptoms, such as rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma and eczema, among students with and without atopy were assessed.Each cohort was assessed in the third study year. Students underwent an ImmunoCAP rapid test, a qualitative point-of-care test, and completed an anonymous questionnaire on age, gender and clinical symptoms including rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma and eczema. Statistical analyses assessed the overall prevalence of atopy in each group and estimated the average annual increase using a linear mixed model. We examined the frequency of occurrence of polysensitization and differences of reported symptoms among students with and without atopy.Data of 1513 students (mean age 22.4-23.3 years across cohorts) in nine cohorts (median cohort size 215 interquartile range IQR 193-222) were available for analysis. Test results consistent with atopy were present in 39.9% of students. Average increase of atopy over the 9 years of observation was 2.25% (95% CI 0.18-4.31%; p = 0.037). Main drivers for this increase were the ubiquitously available allergens, house dust mite, timothy grass and birch pollen. Atopy and polysensitization were more pronounced in male students: Polysensitization also increased in the observation period. The clinical symptoms, rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma and eczema were reported by 463 (76.7%) atopic and by 141 (15.5%) non-atopic students.We observed a slight increase of atopy and polysensitization within 9 years of observation in Swiss medical students. The most frequent sensitization occurred with allergens with the highest chance of exposure. Rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma and eczema are a symptom complex associated with atopy but also found in non-atopic students.Trial registration retrospectively registered by the Cantonal Ethics Committee Zurich on 22.01.2016; Nr: 08-2016.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a complex disease with variable course. Efforts to identify biomarkers to predict asthma severity, the course of disease and response to treatment have not been very successful so far. We have previous suggested that PAR-2 and CRTh2 expression on specific peripheral blood cell subtypes may be biomarkers of asthma severity. We reasoned that parameters that remain stable when asthma symptoms are controlled would be the most appropriate to evaluate for their utility to predict loss of asthma control and/or severity of the disease. Nineteen stable asthmatics were recruited from the University of Alberta Asthma clinic and followed in clinic every 3 months for a total of 4 visits. Patients had spirometry and completed the ACQ questionnaire in every visit. Blood was drawn in every visit and analyzed for a number of immune parameters by flow cytometry. These parameters included PAR-2 and CRTh2 expression on monocyte subgroups and T lymphocytes respectively, as well as numbers of eosinophils, innate lymphoid type-2 cells (ILC2) and dendritic cells. Within person stability of immune and physiological parameters was calculated using the intraclass correlation (ICC) using R version 3.4.0. FEV1 (% predicted), FEV1/FVC ratio, ACQ5 and ACQ7 did not differ significantly over the 4 visits, as would be expected for patients with stable asthma. Peripheral blood eosinophil numbers by Kimura stain and by flow cytometry showed ICC scores of 0.44 and 0.52 respectively, indicating moderate stability. The % of ILC2 cells in peripheral blood also showed moderate stability [ICC score of 0.45 (0.14–0.67)]. The stability for all other immune parameters was poor. Among the peripheral blood immune parameters we studied, only numbers of eosinophils and ILC2 in peripheral blood were moderately stable over a year in stable asthmatics. Further studies are required to understand the reasons for the variability of the other cell types.",

    "abstract": "Common variable immunodeficiency disorders (CVID) are a rare group of primary immune defects, where the underlying cause is unknown. Approximately 10-20% of patients with typical CVID have a granulomatous variant, which has closely overlapping features with sarcoidosis.Here we describe a young man who sequentially developed refractory Evans syndrome, cauda equina syndrome and most recently renal impairment. Following immunosuppression, he has made a recovery from all three life-threatening autoimmune disorders. As the patient was hypogammaglobulinemic for most of the time while on immunosuppression, vaccine challenges and other tests were not possible. Histological features were in keeping with sarcoidosis rather than the granulomatous variant of CVID. In the brief period when immunosuppression was lifted between the cauda equina syndrome and renal impairment, he normalised his immunoglobulins, confirming sarcoidosis rather than CVID was the underlying cause.We discuss diagnostic difficulties distinguishing the two conditions, and the value of histological features in our diagnostic criteria for CVID in identifying sarcoidosis, while the patient was hypogammaglobulinemic. The key message from this case report is that the characteristic histological features of CVID can be very helpful in making (or excluding) the diagnosis, particularly when other tests are not possible.",

This study aims to investigate a series of manifestations in allergic airway disease caused by co-exposure to allergens and ASD for 6 weeks and 14 weeks. Methods CD-1 Mice were instilled intratracheally with 0.1 mg of ASD/mouse four times (6 weeks) or eight times (14 weeks) at 2-week intervals (total dose of 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg/mouse) with or without ovalbumin (OVA). The pathologic changes in the airway, cytological alteration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and levels of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in BALF, and OVA-specific IgE and IgG1 antibodies in serum were measured in the treated CD-1 mice. Results Four-time co-exposure to OVA and ASD aggravates allergic airway inflammation along with Th2-cytokine IL-13 and eosinophil-relevant cytokine/chemokines IL-5, Eotaxin and MCP-3 in BALF, and fibrous thickening of the subepithelial layer in the airway. On the other hand, eight-time co-exposure attenuates these changes along with a significant increase of TGF-β1 in BALF. Adjuvant effects of ASD toward IgG1 and IgE production in sera were, however, still seen in the eight-time co-exposure. Conclusions These results indicate that the immune responses in airways are exacerbated by four-time co-exposure to ASD with OVA, but that there is a shift to suppressive responses in eight-time co-exposure, suggesting that the responses are caused by TGF-β1-related immune tolerance.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have implicated Asian sand dust (ASD) in the increased prevalence of respiratory disorders, including asthma. It has been observed that fungal elements such as β-glucan can be adsorbed onto ASD. In the present study, the exacerbating effect of the combined exposure to zymosan A (ZymA) containing yeast β-glucan and heat-inactivated ASD on ovalbumin (OVA)-induced murine lung eosinophilia was investigated.BALB/c mice were repeatedly instilled intratracheally with one of eight immunogenic formulations consisting of various combinations of (1) ZymA, (2) ASD that was briefly heated to remove organic substances (H-ASD), and (3) OVA in normal saline, or each of the above alone. Pathologic changes, cytological alterations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), changes in inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in BALF, and OVA-specific IgE and IgG1 antibodies in serum were investigated.Exposure to ZymA with or without OVA had no effect on most indicators of lung inflammation. Exposure to H-ASD with OVA increased the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the lungs and the serum levels of OVA-specific IgE and IgG1. The combination OVA + ZymA + H-ASD induced a marked recruitment of eosinophils and upregulation of T helper 2 (Th2) cytokines (interleukin [IL]-4 and IL-13), IL-6, eotaxin/CCL11, and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-3/CCL7 in BALF and OVA-specific IgE in serum. This treatment also induced the most severe pathological changes in the lungs of mice. ZymA was found to boost the effects of H-ASD, thereby exacerbating the OVA-induced allergic inflammation, even though ZymA alone did not have such effect.The results suggest that fungal elements such as β-1,3-glucan aggravate the allergic inflammation caused by ASD. Our findings may facilitate prophylaxis of some allergic diseases in Asia.",

Genetic diagnosis is the standard of care for most patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDs).Since 2005, we have offered a comprehensive genetic testing service for PIDs and other immune-related disorders with a published sequence. Here we present results for this program, over the first decade, between 2005 and 2014.We undertook testing in 228 index cases and 32 carriers during this time. The three most common test requests were for X-linked lymphoproliferative (XLP), tumour necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) and haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Of the 32 suspected XLP cases, positive diagnoses were established in only 2 patients. In contrast, genetic defects in 8 of 11 patients with suspected X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) were confirmed. Most XLA patients were initially identified from absence of B cells. Overall, positive diagnoses were made in about 23% of all tests requested. The diagnostic rate was lowest for several conditions with locus heterogeneity.Thorough clinical characterisation of patients can assist in prioritising which genes should be tested. The clinician-driven customised comprehensive genetic service has worked effectively for New Zealand. Next generation sequencing will play an increasing role in disorders with locus heterogeneity.",

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of atopy in symptomatic adults. More importantly we aimed to obtain a regional statistic of sensitization to common allergens given Saskatchewan's dry climate. One thousand consecutive symptomatic adults were screened for atopy via skin prick test over 10 years (2006–2016) in the Division of Respirology. An atopic screen was performed with twenty common aeroallergens by a single investigator, Dr. D. Cockcroft. A positive test was considered to be a wheal ≥3 mm and markedly positive reactions ≥8 mm were also documented. The prevalence of atopy by means of a positive skin test (≥3 mm) was 45.5%. The prevalence of one or more markedly positive reactions (≥8 mm) was 29.5% of the total population. The most frequent sensitization was to cat dander (58.2%), followed by mixed grass (32.1%), and birch (26.8%). Dust mite sensitization was 22.4% and mouse 6.2%. A positive epidemiology screen for cat/grass/mite would have incorporated 82.0% (n = 373) of subjects with positive skin tests. Those who failed the cat/grass/mite screen were mainly sensitized to trees (n = 34), molds (n = 22), weeds (n = 7), and animals (n = 8). There is a high prevalence of cat sensitization in Saskatchewan, much higher than recorded in other centers internationally. This is likely due to a high proportion of cat ownership. The prevalence of mite sensitization is lower than those mentioned at other centres likely due to Saskatchewan's dry climate. The significance of the rate of markedly positive reactions (≥8 mm wheal) when compared to humid areas with higher burden of mite is unknown. There is a low prevalence of roach also likely due to the dry climate and mouse sensitization was low but still identified as a significant indoor allergen. A cat/grass/mite screen may be useful with a 82.0% sensitivity.",

Clinical features including basic characteristics, pulmonary function, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and cell counts of induced sputum, were compared retrospectively. All patients were classified into four inflammatory subtypes based on the counts of induced sputum eosinophils and neutrophils as eosinophilic (E), neutrophilic (N), mixed granulocytic (M), and paucigranulocytic (P) subtypes. Inflammatory subtype distribution was also compared.Compared with CA patients, CVA patients were younger (P = 0.009), had a higher prevalence of female patients (P = 0.001), higher parameter values of baseline pulmonary function (P ≤ 0.01 for all), shorter duration of disease (P = 0.002), lower AHR (P = 0.001) and lower sputum eosinophil% (P = 0.009). There was a difference in the AHR distribution as the percentage of moderate and severe AHR in CVA was significantly lower than in CA (41.72% VS 64.70%, P = 0.001). The inflammatory subtype distribution was different as the proportion of E and M subtypes in CVA was lower than in CA (56.0% vs 67.19%, P = 0.049). The proportion of subtype P was the lowest and subtype M was the highest in both CVA and CA patients. There was a similar negative correlation of sputum eosinophil% with AHR in CVA and CA (r = - 0.337, P < 0.0001 and r = - 0.27, P = 0.026, respectively), and a positive correlation between sputum eosinophil% and improvement rate of FEV1 after inhalation of bronchodilator (ΔFEV1%) (r = 0.33, P = 0.01).CVA patients showed a better pulmonary function and lower airway inflammation in contrast to CA patients, which may participate in the pathogenesis of chronic cough in CVA.",

A CMA was deemed appropriate and was based on the assumption that the SQ HDM SLIT-tablet has comparable efficacy to HDM SCIT. A societal perspective was adopted in the model, including relevant costs of medications, health care services and productivity loss. A 3 year time horizon was used corresponding to a recommended treatment course of allergy immunotherapy. Resource use and costs were based on published sources, where possible, and validated and complemented by a Canadian specialist clinician (allergist) in active practice in Ontario and in Quebec, respectively, where applicable. A discount rate of 1.5% was applied in accordance with the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) guidelines. To assess the robustness of the results, sensitivity analyses were performed by testing alternative assumptions for selected parameters, to understand their impact on the results of the analysis. The direct treatment costs for a 3-year treatment with SQ HDM SLIT-tablets were higher than for HDM SCIT for both provinces, Ontario and Quebec ($4732.12 and $4829.03 vs. $3434.51 and $2987.74). However, when adding the indirect costs to the model, total savings for the treatment with SQ HDM SLIT-tablets of $1833.00 for Ontario and $769.03 for Quebec were observed. Sensitivity analyses with varying HDM SCIT resource use, discount rates, titration and maintenance injections, nurse time, and number of injections per vial resulted in savings of SQ HDM SLIT-tablets over HDM SCIT in all scenarios analysed. The CMA indicates that SQ HDM SLIT-tablets are a cost-minimizing alternative to HDM SCIT when considered from a societal perspective in Ontario and Quebec.",

    "abstract": "We showed previously that allergic reactivity to ovalbumin (OVA) could be regulated in mice following perturbation of immune networks using combinations of an immune Ig along with anti-idiotypic Ig. We have explored features of this regulation including: its persistence after cessation of administration of combined Igs; the ability of heterologous Igs to produce immunoregulation; a role for Treg induction in regulation; and the ability to attenuate responses in mice pre-sensitized to an allergic stimulus.BALB/c mice were sensitized to OVA. Mice also received 5 weekly injections of immune Ig or anti-idiotype Ig (at separate sites) from either homologous (mouse) or heterologous (human) sources. In the latter case pooled IVIG (given IM, hence hereafter IMIG) was used as a source of anti-idiotype Ig, and human anti-Tet as immune Ig. Injections of the Ig were given from the time of OVA sensitization (to attenuate development of immunity), or after pre-sensitization of mice (to attenuate existing allergic responses). All mice were assayed for development of OVA-specific serum IgE and IgG, as well as the production of OVA-induced IL-2, IL-4, IL-13, IL-31 and IL-33 in splenocytes cultured for 72 h. In studies examining possible mechanism(s) responsible for inhibition of immunity mice received, in addition to the Ig treatments described, infusion of depleting anti-CD4, and/or anti-CD8 antibodies, or a mAb to TNFSFR25, known to expand Tregs implicated in regulation of Allo immunity.Combinations of both heterologous and homologous immune Igs and anti-idiotype Igs attenuated OVA allergic responses in both naïve and pre-sensitized mice. This attenuation persisted in mice greater than 14 weeks after cessation of treatment with the Igs used. Finally, depletion of either CD4 or CD8 cells ameliorated the suppressive effect seen, while the combination of anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 essentially abolished suppression. Suppression was further enhanced by anti-TNFSFR25 mAb.We conclude that the combine Ig treatment protocols used produced a long-lasting suppression of allergic immunity, even in pre-sensitized animals. The effects seem to depend upon induction and expansion of Tregs and represents a novel approach to treatment of allergic disease in humans and other animals.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Little is known about the epidemiology and associated factors of childhood AD in the markedly different, low-income, tropical environment like Madagascar. Methods We aim to assess the epidemiology and associated factors of AD in individuals fewer than 15 years of age in Antananarivo Madagascar. It was a retrospective and descriptive study over a period of 7 years (2010 to 2016) in children 6 months to 14 years in the Department of Dermatology, Joseph Raseta Befelatanana Antananarivo Madagascar. The diagnosis of AD was based on clinical data. Results The prevalence of AD was 5.6% in children aged 6 months to 14 years. The details of 151 cases of atopic dermatitis were analyzed. The mean age of patients was 4 years. There was a female preponderance (sex ratio: 0.7). A family history of AD was noted in 56 cases (37%). No association between breast-feeding and AD was found. The age of onset of AD was before the age of 3 months in 7.5% and between 6 months to 5 years in 70%. Children born in March (dry season) had the highest risk of AD. Consultations for AD increased during the winter (from July to October; p = 0.005). However, the prevalence of AD was similar in urban and rural areas. Conclusion Weather may have an impact on the prevalence of atopic dermatitis in Madagascar. No significant correlation was found between the duration of breastfeeding and AD, as well as urbanization.",

These rare conditions differ in clinical presentation, pathological features, treatment and prognosis, but overlap has been described implying a challenging clinical management.We describe a case of overlap between TEN and AGEP probably secondary to beta-lactams in a 77-year-old patient treated for a complicated cholangitis. We review the diagnosis and the management of these two conditions. The diagnosis of TEN was suggested by the initial clinical presentation with severe hemodynamic instability, skin detachment, positive Nikolsky sign and mucosal involvement. However, the skin biopsy as well as the rapid improvement of the skin lesions were discriminative for AGEP. This indicated an overlap presentation. Unfortunately, the patient refused allergy investigations in order to find the culprit drug. Medical photographs, proper physical examination and histopathological results are integrated.Despite clinical features indicating a diagnosis of TEN, histopathology was conclusive for AGEP thus indicating a possible clinical-pathological overlap between the two conditions, a scarcely described situation in the medical literature. To our knowledge, this is one of the few cases that portrays a TEN-AGEP overlap probably secondary to Piperacillin Tazobactam. Understanding the immunological implications of these conditions can help us better distinguish and manage these severe reactions.",

The objectives were to examine physician and patient perceptions of seasonal allergy symptoms and their impact on patients, and to examine patient and physician attitudes to allergen immunotherapy (AIT) for seasonal allergies. AsPIRe was led by a steering committee and received research ethics board clearance from Queen's University.Allergists (17) from across Canada enrolled in the AsPIRe program and completed an on-line survey to collect demographic information and baseline perceptions. Allergists then recruited patients and completed paper-based parallel physician and patient questionnaires. Patients received an AIT informational booklet with their questionnaire. Patients who were AIT-naïve with no contraindication to AIT and 12 years of age and older met the inclusion criteria.The survey was in field from February 2018 to June 2018. A total of 141 allergist surveys and 136 patient surveys were completed. Mean age of patients was 30 years old (range 12-70). Fifty-seven percent of patients reported prior knowledge of AIT. Seventy-two percent of patients reported seasonal allergies of longer than 5 years duration and in this subset of patients, 46% were at their first allergist visit. Seventy-three percent of all patients indicated they would be likely or very likely to try sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT), if recommended by their allergist compared to 36% for subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT). Conversely, 10% of patients reported they would be unlikely or very unlikely to try SLIT compared to 46% of patients who would be unlikely or very unlikely to try SCIT if recommended by their allergist.In this particular study cohort, there was a gap in perception between allergists and their patients as to the impact of allergy symptoms on daily life. Patients reported being more frequently impacted vs. their physician's assessment. When asked about preference for AIT options, Canadian patients reported they were more likely to follow their allergists' recommendation for initiation of SLIT compared to SCIT.",

    "abstract": "There has been a significant growth in the prevalence of allergy, mainly associated to IgE-mediated disorders such as asthma and rhinitis. The identification of atopy in asthmatic patients through the measurement of specific IgE can help to identify risk factors that cause asthmatic symptoms in patients. The development and use of individualized allergen-based tests by the Component Resolved Diagnosis has been a crucial advance in the accurate diagnosis and control of allergic patients. The objective of this work was to assess the usefulness of molecular diagnosis to identify environmental allergens as possible factors influencing the development and manifestation of asthma in a group of asthmatic patients from Iran.202 adult asthmatic patients treated at the Loghman Hakim Hospital and Pasteur Institute of Teheran (Iran) from 2011 to 2012. Specific IgE determined by the ImmunoCAP system were used to both evaluate the patients' atopic condition and the molecules involved in the allergic sensitization. SDS-PAGE IgE-immunoblotting associated with mass spectrometry was carried out to study the cockroach IgE-binding sensitizing proteins.Forty-five percent of all patients could be considered atopic individuals. Eighty-two percent of atopic patients were sensitized to pollen allergens. The Salsola kali (Sal k 1) and the Phleum pratense (rPhl p 1 and/or rPhl p 5) major allergens were the most common sensitizers among pollens (71% and 18%, respectively). Thirty-five percent of the atopic population was sensitized to cockroach. Four different allergens, including a previously unknown alpha-amylase, were identified in the cockroach extract. No significant associations could be demonstrated between the severity of asthma and the specific IgE levels in the atopic population. Statistical analysis identified the Sal k 1 as the main protein allergen influencing the development and expression of asthma in the studied population.Pollen and cockroach were the most relevant allergen sources in the asthmatic population. The Salsola kali major allergen was the main cause for sensitization in the atopic patients suffering asthma. Using the Component Resolved Diagnosis, it was possible to identify a new Blattella germanica cockroach allergen (Blattella alpha amylase 53 kDa) that could sensitize a relevant percentage of this population.",

Therefore, we explored whether CRTAM expression is influenced by the presence of allergic asthma. We collected whole peripheral blood cells from non-asthmatic control subjects (n = 17) and patients with asthma (n = 17). All patients with asthma tested positive in allergen skin prick tests. We analyzed CRTAM expression in CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte populations. CRTAM expression was also analyzed in CD177+ neutrophils and IL5Rα+ eosinophils. The percentage of CD4+CRTAM+ and CD8+CRTAM+T lymphocytes in peripheral blood was higher in allergic asthma patients compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, the percentage of CD177+CRTAM+ neutrophils in peripheral blood was also elevated in patients with allergic asthma. However, the percentage of IL5Rα+CRTAM+ eosinophils in peripheral blood was not significantly different in patients with allergic asthma compared with healthy controls. CRTAM expression on T cells, eosinophils, and neutrophils may be involved in bronchial inflammation in allergic asthma. Determination of CRTAM expression in peripheral blood may be useful for the diagnosis of bronchial inflammation and/or to identify recently activated immune cells.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculous pleurisy is a kind of tuberculosis, it is well known that Th1 lymphocytes play a key role in the treatment of tuberculosis infection. However, latest studies show that Th17 lymphocyte may also play an important role tuberculosis infection. There is close relationship between Treg and Thl7 cells, and changes in the number or the function of the two kinds of cells may lead to diseases. The current researches on Thl7 and Treg cells maily focus on autoimmune diseases, however, reports about their role in tuberculosis are limited. In this study, we investigate the function of th17 and Treg cells and the above cytokines in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis pleurisy; by determining the expression of Th17 and Treg cells in peripheral CD4 T cells and the related cytokines in patients with tuberculous compared with healthy people. Th17 cells in patients were higher than that in the Healthy control group, expression of Treg cells in patients were lower than that in the healthy group; IL-17, IL-23 levels in peripheral blood and hydrothorax from the patients were higher than that in the healthy group; IL-17, IL-23 and IL-6 levels in hydrothorax were higher than that in peripheral blood. There was no difference in IL-6 level in peripheral blood between the patients and healthy control; TGF- β level in peripheral blood from the healthy group was higher than that in peripheral blood and hydrothorax from the patients. And there were no differences in TGF- β level between peripheral blood and hydrothorax. Th17 cells were negatively correlated with Treg cells ,but were positive correlation with IL-17, IL-23, IL-6 levels in peripheral blood; TGF- β level was positive correlation with Treg cells in the peripheral blood, but no correlation with Th17 cells. Th17 and Treg cells may be involved in the immune pathological mechanism of tuberculous pleurisy and changes of related cytokines may be involved in the differentiation of Th17 and Treg cells and inflammatory response. Thus, Th17 and Treg cells and related cytokines may be important immunopathogenesis for tuberculous pleurisy.",

Objectives To explore the prevalence of adult eczema/atopic dermatitis (AD) and its risk factors in northern China. Methods A cluster sampling randomized population-based survey was conducted using a face-to-face questionnaire combined with skin prick tests of ten common aeroallergens including nine pollen allergens and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinu (Dp) allergen. The questionnaire was designed by specialists and included questions on the prevalence of eczema, hay fever, and asthma, socioeconomic risk factors, family history of atopy and environmental exposures. The prevalence of eczema with asthma and/or hay fever (EAH) was applied as a proxy of AD in this study. Results Overall, 2096 subjects were enrolled and completed the study. The prevalence of eczema was 15.7% (95% CI 14.3–17.4), while the prevalence of hay fever and asthma were 20.6% (95% CI 18.9–22.4) and 6.5% (95% CI 5.5–7.6), respectively. In particular, the prevalence of EAH was 5.1% (95% CI 4.4–7.0). The prevalence of eczema and EAH was significantly associated with younger age, atopy family history, high education level, urbanization, and antibiotic overuse ( P &lt; 0.05, logistic regression). The sensitization rate was higher in EAH compared with eczema (48.2% vs 41.0%, P = 0.018), with weed pollen sensitization being the most common. Subjects with two or more concomitant allergic diseases had increased risk of eczema and EAH ( P &lt; 0.001). Allergen sensitization increased the risk of eczema and EAH ( P &lt; 0.001, both). Conclusions Adult eczema and EAH are prevalent in northern China under high pollen exposure. Socioeconomic and environmental factors affected the prevalence of adult AD in China.

    "abstract": "Abstract Most Canadian food allergy data has focused on Health Canada’s priority food allergens. This study describes which non-priority (emerging) food allergens were most commonly reported by Canadian parents and categorized/confirmed by allergists. A secondary aim was to describe severity of allergic reactions to emerging allergens. Parents reported allergic reactions to emerging food allergens experienced by their child (&lt; 18 years) which occurred in the past 12 months, and allergists categorized/confirmed them according to likelihood of IgE-mediated food allergy. Of 68 eligible patients completing the survey, the most commonly reported emerging allergens were fruits/vegetables (58.8%), seeds (22.1%), legumes (19.1%) and other (11.8%). Median allergist ranking for legumes was ‘probable’ IgE-mediated food allergy, ‘possible’ for seeds and fruits/vegetables, and ‘unlikely’ for other. Median reaction severity was mild for legumes, and moderate for seeds, fruits/vegetables, and other. Our study highlights that non-priority food allergens, namely legumes and seeds, can lead to probable/likely allergic reactions in Canadian children. These food allergens are increasing in popularity in the Canadian diet, which could lead to increasing reports of allergic reactions. More research is needed to confirm reports of reactions to emerging allergens, and to document their inclusion as ingredients in packaged foods.",

However, adverse events, including life-threatening systemic reactions, may occur. The purpose of this project is to identify risk factors for systemic reactions to SCIT and to provide practice-based solutions using a quality improvement (QI) framework. Methods A QI initiative was performed in a hospital-based, Canadian Allergy clinic administering SCIT in a 12-month period. Results A total of 4242 injections of SCIT were performed over a period of 12 months. Of these, 10 injections resulted in a systemic reaction requiring epinephrine administration (i.e., an incidence of 1 in 424 injections, or 0.24%). Eight patients had at least one documented risk factor for a systemic reaction, and six had multiple risk factors. Major risk factors included seasonal exacerbation of allergic rhinitis, uncontrolled asthma, and an error in route of administration. All reactions occurred with the highest allergen extract concentration. Conclusion This QI initiative highlights the need for improved patient and health care practitioner education and pre-administration screening. We suggest several considerations for SCIT administration: provide patients with written information on safety; screen patients before injections, including a review of treatment plan adherence and asthma control; adjust dosing to slow down buildup of the most concentrated immunotherapy extract, particularly in high risk patients; and apply additional safety measures in patients with multiple risk factors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Insulin hypersensitivity is rare, but challenging for individuals with diabetes. The prevalence of insulin allergy has decreased since the introduction of human recombinant insulin preparations. Hypersensitivity reactions range from injection site erythema and swelling, to anaphylaxis. While some reactions are to excipients (zinc, protamine, metacresol), many are to recombinant insulin itself. We present a case of type 1 hypersensitivity to various preparations of insulin in a patient with insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Case presentation A 61-year-old woman with a 30-year history of insulin-dependent T2DM was referred for evaluation of reactions to insulin. She had two episodes over 5-months; both required Emergency Department visits and epinephrine administration. The first episode entailed a burning sensation of the extremities and nausea, immediately after injecting NovoRapid ® insulin. The second event entailed a similar reaction but this time there was also angioedema of the upper airway with difficulty breathing and hypotension, immediately after injecting Levemir ® and NovoRapid ® , and taking metformin. There were no cofactors such as exercise, infectious illness, or NSAIDs use. Skin testing was performed with metformin, Lantus ® , Humalog ® , NovoRapid ® , glulisine, insulin regular, NPH, Levemir ® and the excipient protamine, as per published testing concentrations. Metacresol was not tested as its use was restricted by the hospital pharmacy. Insulin preparations with and without metacresol were included in testing however. A clinic staff served as a negative control. The patent had negative testing with protamine, but sensitization to all insulin preparations. Metformin skin testing and challenge along with latex IgE were negative. Subsequently, she underwent intentional weight loss of 70 lb, and was started on oral hypoglycemics with good effect. Conclusions Our case highlights the importance of diagnosing insulin allergy through a detailed history and focused testing. Therapeutic strategies include avoidance and insulin alternatives, alternate insulin preparations, or desensitization. In severe recurrent hypersensitivity reactions, Omalizumab or pancreatic transplantation have been effective.",

    "abstract": "Human inborn errors of immunity (IEI) are a group of inherited genetic disorders of the immune system. IEI Patients suffer from severe repeated infections, autoimmunity, lymphadenopathy and/or increased susceptibility to malignancies. IEI are due to absence, disproportion, or loss of function of immune cells; mostly inherited in autosomal recessive manner, hence are more common in countries with high rate of consanguinity. Definite diagnosis of IEI is achieved by genetic analysis, however it is not always available.to report on different IEI categories and impact of expanding the use of flow cytometry (FCM) in diagnosis, categorization and follow up of IEI patients in a highly consanguineous population.Retrospective chart review on different IEI categories diagnosed at the primary immunodeficiency center in Cairo University Specialized Pediatric hospital from 2011 to 2021 based on expanding the use of FCM.1510 IEI patients were diagnosed; 480 were diagnosed genetically with FMF, 11 with cystic fibrosis and 1019 patients were diagnosed with other IEI disorders. Phagocytic defects were the commonest (30%) followed by severe combined immunodeficiency (22%) and combined immunodeficiency (18.3%). FCM testing properly diagnosed and categorized 73% of the cases.Using multi-color FCM to evaluate immune cells populations, subpopulations, functions, and intracellular proteins expression is proved a useful cost-effective method for screening, categorization and follow up of IEI patients. FCM can improve the diagnosis of IEI significantly when tests are properly targeted and well designed. This study presents a 10-year experience in diagnosis of IEI using FCM at a tertiary referral center in a setting of limited resources and yet high prevalence of IEI.",

Vitamin E, an essential nutrient that comprises tocopherol and tocotrienol, is known as a potential therapeutic agent for airway allergic inflammation. This study aimed to investigate the beneficial effects of intranasal Tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) on PAF-induced AR in a rat model.Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned into 3 groups: Control, PAF-induced AR and PAF-induced AR with TRF treatment. To induce AR, 50 μl of 16 μg/ml PAF was nasally instilled into each nostril. From day 1 to 7 after AR induction, 10 μl of 16 μg/μl TRF was delivered intranasally to the TRF treatment group. Complete upper skulls were collected for histopathological evaluation on day 8.The average severity scores of AR were significantly higher in the PAF-induced AR rats compared to both control and PAF-induced AR with TRF treatment. The histologic examination of the nasal structures showed moderate degree of inflammation and polymorphonuclear cells infiltration in the lamina propria, mucosa damage and vascular congestion in the PAF-induced AR rats. TRF was able to ameliorate the AR symptoms by restoring the nasal structures back to normal. H&E staining demonstrated a statistically significant benefit upon TRF treatment, where minimal degree of inflammation, and a reduction in the infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells, mucosa damage and vascular congestion were observed.TRF exhibited symptomatic relief action in AR potentially due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic properties.",

This study aimed to assess infusion parameters and experience of patients with primary (PID) or secondary immunodeficiencies (SID) transitioning to Ig20Gly in clinical practice in Canada. Methods Patients with PID or SID who received subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) for ≥ 3 months before transitioning to Ig20Gly were eligible for this multicenter (n = 6), phase 4, non-interventional, prospective, single-arm study. Ig20Gly infusion parameters, dosing, and adverse events were collected from patient medical records at Ig20Gly initiation and 3, 6, and 12 months post-initiation. Patient satisfaction and quality of life were assessed 12 months post-initiation using validated questionnaires. Results The study included 125 patients (PID, n = 60; SID, n = 64; PID + SID, n = 1). Median volume per infusion was 30.0 ml at initiation, and 40.0 ml at 6 and 12 months post-initiation. Most patients administered Ig20Gly weekly and used two infusion sites (primarily abdomen). At each time point, median infusion duration was ≤ 1 h. At 12 months, 61% of infusions were administered via a pump and 39% manually. Headache and infusion-site reactions were the most reported adverse events of interest. Patients expressed overall satisfaction with Ig20Gly at 12 months post-initiation, with all respondents indicating they would like to continue Ig20Gly. Conclusions This study provides a detailed description of Ig20Gly infusion parameters, tolerability, and quality of life in clinical practice among patients with PID or SID switching to Ig20Gly from another SCIG and confirms the feasibility of infusing Ig20Gly via pump or manual administration.

The overall risk for cancer in children with IEI ranges from 4 to 25% and the type of malignancy is highly dependent on the specific mutant gene underlying IEI. We investigated 3056 IEI patients registered in the Iranian national registry between the years 1999 and 2020 in this retrospective cohort study. The frequency of malignancy and its association with the type of IEI in these patients were evaluated. A total of 82 IEI patients with malignancy were enrolled in this study. Among them, predominantly lymphoma was the most common type of malignancy (67.1%), followed by leukemia (11%), and cancers of the head and neck (7.3%). Among identified lymphoma cancers, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas were the most frequent type (43.9%) followed by different subtypes of Hodgkin's lymphoma (23.2%). Solid tumors (18.3%) appeared to be very heterogeneous by type and localization. The correlation between the type of malignancy and survival status and the association between the type of malignancy and IEI entities were unremarkable. The awareness of the association between the presence of IEI and cancer highlights the importance of a synergistic effort by oncologists and immunologists in the early diagnosis of malignancy and personalized therapeutic strategies in IEI patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The goal of on-demand treatment for hereditary angioedema attacks is to halt attack progression to minimize morbidity and mortality. Four on-demand treatments have been approved thus far (ecallantide, icatibant, recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor [rhC1INH], and plasma-derived C1INH). Results from the sebetralstat phase 3 KONFIDENT trial (NCT05259917) have been reported. To put these results into context without head-to-head trials, an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) was conducted to facilitate comparisons of efficacy and safety across treatment options. Methods Based on a systematic literature review and feasibility assessment, only the pivotal trial for intravenous rhC1INH (NCT01188564) reported necessary data for a comparable primary efficacy endpoint (time to beginning of symptom relief) to enable an ITC with oral sebetralstat. Bayesian fixed-effects network meta-analyses models were conducted to indirectly compare the efficacy and safety outcomes of sebetralstat and rhC1INH (NCT01188564, NCT00225147, NCT00262301). A matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) of efficacy was performed, adjusting for baseline attack severity and demographic characteristics. Results The fixed-effects model found no significant differences in time to beginning of symptom relief between sebetralstat 300 mg and rhC1INH 50 IU/kg (hazard ratio [95% credible interval], 0.96 [0.42–2.15] to 1.19 [0.58–2.45]). After adjusting for baseline attack severity, the MAIC showed numerically favorable results with sebetralstat compared with rhC1INH, regardless of whether baseline demographics were matched. The fixed-effects model found no significant differences in treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events. All sensitivity analyses returned consistent results. Conclusions This ITC found no significant differences in time to beginning of symptom relief and overall treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events between sebetralstat and rhC1INH.",

YouTube has emerged as a significant source of health-related content, offering valuable insights while posing the risk of misinformation that warrants caution among users. The aim of this study was to evaluate the popularity, reliability, understandability, actionability, and overall quality of YouTube videos related to HAE. Method A search was conducted on YouTube using the term “hereditary angioedema.” Videos were categorized based on their origin (health or nonhealth) and content type (medical professional education (MPE), patient education (PE), patient experience, or awareness). The quality, reliability, understandability, and actionability of the videos were assessed via the Global Quality Scale (GQS), the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Audiovisual Materials (PEMAT-A/V), and the Quality Criteria for Consumer Health Information (DISCERN) tool. Three independent allergists evaluated the videos. Results Out of 135 reviewed videos, 111 met the inclusion criteria. The health group presented significantly higher scores than did the nonhealth group in several metrics: PEMAT-A/V understandability (83, IQR: 56–92, p = 0.001), total DISCERN score (37, IQR: 3–45, p &lt; 0.001), reliability (23, IQR: 19–26, p &lt; 0.001), treatment (15, IQR: 8–21, p = 0.007), and modified DISCERN score (3, IQR: 2–4, p = 0.002). Health videos were uploaded more recently (p = 0.006), while awareness videos tended to be older than more recent MPE videos (p = 0.002). The MPE videos had the longest duration, whereas the awareness videos had the shortest duration (p &lt; 0.001). Video quality scores, assessed via the GQS, were higher in both the MPE and PE groups (scores: 3, 4, and 5; p = 0.005). Compared with the other groups, the MPE group also had significantly higher PEMAT-A/V understandability scores (91, IQR: 70.75–92, p &lt; 0.001), total DISCERN scores (40, IQR: 30.75–49.5, p &lt; 0.001), reliability scores (24, IQR: 21–27.25, p &lt; 0.001), and overall scores for moderate to high quality (83, 74.8%, p = 0.002). Conclusion YouTube videos on HAE uploaded by health care professionals generally offer higher-quality information, but their overall reliability remains suboptimal. There is a pressing need for higher-quality, trustworthy content, particularly from professional medical organizations, to address this gap.",

Objective This study aims to identify miRNAs that causally contribute to CRS and to elucidate their clinical relevance and underlying molecular mechanisms. Methods We employed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, leveraging mirQTLs as exposure variables and two independent CRS datasets as outcomes, to identify miRNAs causally linked to CRS. Robustness of the findings was ensured through multiple sensitivity analyses. The expression levels of identified CRS-associated miRNAs were validated using qRT-PCR, and their diagnostic potential was assessed through ROC curve analysis. Target genes and potential pathways regulated by the causal miRNAs were predicted via MiRNet and enrichment analyses, followed by experimental validation using western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Results MiR-130a-3p and miR-196b-5p were significantly associated with an increased risk of CRS, while miR-339-3p was associated with a decreased risk. These associations were confirmed by qRT-PCR, and no evidence of pleiotropy or heterogeneity was observed. ROC analysis revealed diagnostic potential for these miRNAs in CRS. Enrichment and experimental analyses suggested that the MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways are predominantly activated by the target genes of the positively and negatively associated miRNAs, respectively. Conclusions MiR-130a-3p and miR-196b-5p are positively associated with CRS risk, whereas miR-339-3p is protective. These miRNAs represent promising diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for CRS. The MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways likely mediate the effects of these causal miRNAs, offering further insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying CRS.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) deficiency is a rare inborn error of immunity which occurs secondary to mutations in the XIAP/BIRC4 gene. Disease onset usually manifests within the first few years of life, and is associated with a spectrum of clinical features, secondary to immune dysregulation. Males typically present with refractory chronic colitis, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and severe and/or recurrent infections. Laboratory analysis may reveal hypogammaglobulinemia and cytopenias. At present, the only curative treatment is allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Case presentation A 24-year-old gentleman, immigrant from the Democratic Republic of Congo, was referred to outpatient immunology for evaluation of an inborn error of immunity given a past medical history significant for refractory fistulizing Crohn’s disease, arthritis, liver abscesses, prior disseminated tuberculosis, anemia, and recurrent infections. He had been asymptomatic throughout his childhood and adolescence, with no infections or symptoms of inflammatory disease until the age of 19, when he was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease. He was soon after admitted to hospital and was diagnosed with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Primary immunodeficiency gene panel testing revealed a nonsense variant XIAP c833C &gt; G p.(Ser278*), which generates a premature stop codon at exon 2 (of total 7 exons). On flow cytometry analysis, XIAP protein expression was significantly reduced, confirming the diagnosis of XIAP deficiency. Conclusion This is one of the only documented reports of a patient with XIAP deficiency, presenting with symptom-onset in adulthood. This case highlights the need to maintain a high index of suspicion for XIAP deficiency in patients with the appropriate clinical presentation, despite advanced age of presentation.",

Despite the availability of comprehensive on-demand treatment guidelines, compliance to guideline recommendations remains suboptimal, resulting in persisting unmet need. Methods This observational, online survey was conducted between September 6, 2022, and October 19, 2022 to understand the behaviors and perspectives of individuals in the US with hereditary angioedema (HAE). Participants were recruited by the US Hereditary Angioedema Association and were eligible if they were US residents with clinician-diagnosed HAE type I or II and had experienced at least one HAE attack. The survey included multiple-choice, rank-order, and scale-based responses using a 5-point Likert scale for agreement and an 11-point Likert scale for anxiety. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel, summarizing continuous variables as means, medians, and ranges, and categorical variables as frequency distributions and percentages. Results A total of 107 out of 155 participants completed the survey (mean age = 41 years; 80.4% female). Half of the respondents used both prophylaxis and on-demand therapy, while the other half used on-demand therapy only. Icatibant was the most commonly used on-demand treatment (78.5%). The survey revealed that 57% of respondents did not treat all HAE attacks, and only 14% treated attacks immediately. Delays in treatment were common, with a mean time to treatment of 2.4 h, and younger patients were less likely to carry on-demand treatment. Reasons for delaying treatment included the perceived severity of the attack, lack of on-demand treatment availability, and pain associated with treatment. Additionally, 32.7% of respondents experienced the return of an HAE attack after initial treatment, with those delaying treatment more likely to experience recurrence. The survey also found that delayed treatment led to more severe attacks and longer recovery times, impacting work, social activities, and overall quality of life. Conclusions Although guidelines recommend early treatment of HAE attacks, many respondents do not treat immediately. This finding underscores the importance of incorporating open patient-physician communication to improve guideline compliance and the management of HAE.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the use of monoclonal antibodies directed against interleukin-5 (anti-IL-5) and its receptor alpha (anti-IL-5R) has proven to be an effective therapeutic option for patients with severe asthma by reducing the number of eosinophils, which may promote disease remission. This study aimed to evaluate clinical improvement and remission in patients with severe asthma treated with anti-IL-5 and anti-IL-5R antibodies over a period of 12 months. A cohort study was conducted with 49 patients diagnosed with severe eosinophilic asthma and who did not respond to conventional treatment. During follow-up, medical control was performed every 3 months using spirometry, eosinophil counts, quality of life scales, and disease control. The results revealed an improvement in FEV1 after 3 months of treatment, with statistical significance at 12 months in patients treated with anti-IL-5 and at 9 months in those treated with anti-IL-5R. In addition, better perceptions of asthma control and quality of life were observed, with significant differences at 6 and 12 months. Correlations between spirometry and ACT, ACQ, and AQLQ reflect a progressive recovery of well-being and function. Finally, the remission rate was 41.1% with anti-IL-5 treatment and 47.3% with anti-IL-5R treatment after one year of follow-up. These findings support the efficacy of anti-IL-5 and anti-IL-5R treatment in improving severe asthma control and patients' quality of life, suggesting their key role in disease remission.",

Objective To evaluate the role of in vivo and ex vivo diagnostic tools for DHRs occurring &gt;6 h following intravenous low-osmolality ICM. Methods We conducted a prospective, multicenter, international cohort study. The patients were recruited from two tertiary care adult allergy clinics, Austin Health, Australia and the McGill University Health Centre, Canada. Eligible participants were adults who reported a DHR after receiving ICM. In vivo testing (skin testing and intravenous challenge) was performed to identify an alternative agent. Ex vivo testing using interferon-γ enzyme-linked ImmunoSpot assay was performed in four Australian patients to explore its diagnostic performance. Results The culprit ICM was identified by dIDT in 17/20 (85%) while in 3/20 (15%) a challenge was necessary to confirm delayed hypersensitivity. All patients with a positive dIDT to iohexol were positive to iodixanol (15/15; 100%) while 3/4 (75%), 3/4 (75%), 4/6 (67%), and 3/5 (60%) were positive to iopromide, ioversol, iopamidol, and iobitridol, respectively. Overall, 7/20 (35%) patients tolerated a challenge with an alternative ICM. The IFN-γ release assay was negative for the implicated ICM in 4 patients with confirmed DHR through a positive dIDT. Conclusion dIDT allowed confirmation of T cell-mediated allergy to the implicated ICM in 85% of patients with a strong clinical suspicion of DHR and identification of non-cross-reactive ICM in 35% of patients. The IFN-y ELISpot was not useful in the four patients tested.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Mastocytosis is driven by a clonal expansion of mast cells, commonly triggered by the KIT D816V mutation which is present in over 90% of adult patients. Individuals with indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) frequently experience recurrent anaphylaxis and mast cell mediator-related symptoms, leading to substantial morbidity. In rare cases, progression to more severe subtypes, such as smoldering systemic mastocytosis (SSM), can occur. Case presentation We describe one patient with ISM and another with ISM transitioning to SSM, both treated with the selective KIT D816V inhibitor avapritinib at a daily dose of 25 mg. Following initiation of avapritinib, both patients exhibited a marked reduction in serum tryptase levels and complete remission of maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis. Additionally, joint pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and neurocognitive complaints decreased. Sustained clinical improvement over follow-up periods of 9 and 12 months was consistently reflected in disease-specific patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Conclusions Regular clinical and laboratory monitoring, including serum tryptase and KIT D816V mutation assessment in peripheral blood, is essential in all ISM patients to detect early signs of disease progression. In refractory cases, avapritinib is a promising therapeutic option that can reduce mast cell burden, alleviate symptoms, and enhance overall quality of life.",

Objective To characterize variability in drug allergy management among allergists in Canada and identify setting-specific barriers to drug allergy testing and desensitization. Methods We developed a peer-reviewed 40-item survey, distributed via the Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, to assess practice patterns, testing modalities, and perceived barriers among allergists. Descriptive statistics and Fisher’s exact test were used to evaluate responses by practice setting. Results Sixty-six allergists responded (30% estimated response rate), with 48.4% solely practicing in community clinics and 21.9% solely in hospital-based clinics. While 87.9% performed some form of drug allergy testing, hospital-based allergists were significantly more likely to perform intradermal (81.1% vs. 48.7%, p = 0.004) and patch testing (38.2% vs. 8.8%, p = 0.009), as well as non-oral drug challenges (63.6% vs. 20.0%, p = 0.0005). Common barriers included a lack of nursing support and inadequate reimbursement. Conclusion Drug allergy management practices vary substantially across Canada, with drug allergy testing being more frequently performed by allergists practicing in hospital-based clinics than by those in community-based clinics. Findings support the need for equitable access to testing infrastructure and system-level investments in improving drug allergy testing services.",

    "abstract": "Research has shown that the long term management of food allergy is suboptimal. Our study aims to provide direction for improvement, by evaluating food allergy management from the perspective of, food allergic patients or their caregivers, and allergists in selected outpatient settings in Ontario. This two-part study included an anonymous questionnaire completed by patients or their caregivers in allergy clinics, and a qualitative interview with allergists. In Part A, food allergic patients or their caregivers were surveyed about information they received on food allergy, their level of confidence with self-management, and their learning needs. In Part B, allergists were interviewed about teaching priorities and the challenges and strategies that currently exist in food allergy management. The questionnaire was developed and piloted at the Hamilton Health Sciences Corporation-McMaster University Medical Center Site. Using convenience sampling, participants were recruited from 6 allergy clinics in 5 Ontario cities. Patients of any age with food allergy who were evaluated by an allergist were considered for inclusion. Quantitative data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and frequency analysis. Audio recorded interviews with allergists were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using content analysis of grounded theory methodology. Ninety-two food allergic families in the care of 6 allergists in Toronto, Hamilton, London, Kitchener, and Kingston participated in the study. Key areas requiring improvement in food allergy management were identified: 33% of families were not shown how to use an epinephrine auto-injector with a trainer, only 57% were asked to demonstrate an auto-injector, despite being on average at their 5th visit, and only about 30% felt very confident about when and how to give an auto-injector. Fifty percent of families did not receive sufficient information on medical identification and 21% did not receive information about support groups. Interviews with allergists revealed limitations in time and nursing resources. Our study highlights the educational gaps and overall experiences of food allergic families in Ontario, and the challenges faced by the allergists managing them.",

    "abstract": "The importance of using healthcare evidence by policy-makers is widely recognized [1,2]. For over a decade, several strategies to improve the use of knowledge by policy makers have been promoted [3,4]. Among them, the use of individuals called “intermediaries” or “knowledge brokers” is presented as a potential strategy [5,6]. Situated at the organizational interface, these actors benefit from a strategic position allowing easier access to external knowledge [7]. Therefore, they must develop sufficient skills to be able to properly take profit of all opportunities to create the value for their organization. In fact, many authors consider brokers as true knowledge integrators that assess, interpret, synthesize, exploit and transfer relevant knowledge. Despite the availability of several studies that stress the importance of the multifaceted role of brokers, few have explored how they concretely integrate or “absorb” knowledge and especially, which skills are necessary to ensure the success of such activities.\r\n\r\nWe propose a new conceptual model on research integration by knowledge brokers and provide an empirical testing of this proposed model. This conceptual framework (figure ​(figure1)1) builds upon recent theoretical developments on the concept of knowledge absorptive capacity [8]i.e., starting from the following dimensions: knowledge identification (recognize value of new knowledge), acquisition, assimilation, transformation and knowledge exploitation. To test the conceptual framework, we collected survey data. The sample of 297 respondents included members of the knowledge brokerage community of practice (CoP). Data analysis allowed presenting a first portrait of the profile of knowledge brokers working in health organizations in Canada. In this perspective, several descriptive analyses, such as the distribution of knowledge brokers according to their membership organizations, their status, education (last Diploma), experience, etc., were completed. The bivariate analyses used these dimensions to compare knowledge brokers regarding their knowledge absorptive capacity and the explanatory variables documented in the literature. These results show that the brokers’ absorptive capacity of knowledge improved with higher levels of advanced education attainment, such as a PhD. However, employment status of brokers and their skills was also a factor affecting knowledge broker performance. It was found that brokers with professional status identify more knowledge than do brokers with senior managers’ status. Conversely, brokers with senior manager status transform and exploit knowledge more effectively than do brokers with professional status. Also, other organizational factors that act as facilitators or barriers to knowledge absorption by brokers are the organizational unit size where they perform their daily tasks. We found that the brokers who are assigned to medium size units are more able to identify, assimilate, transform and create opportunities of knowledge exchange in their workplace (i.e., actively exploit knowledge). Finally, these results allow us to establish the differences between the brokers according to their level of advanced education, status, organizational affiliation, and the size of the organizational unit. Further multivariate analyses are needed to identify all the factors associated with brokers’ absorptive capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1\r\n\r\nTheoretical framework of the absorptive capacity of knowledge brokers adapted from Todorova & Durisin (2007)",

However, serum periostin may be influenced by factors other than Type 2 inflammation, potentially confounding its interpretation. We aimed to measure change in periostin following bone injury. 102 adults without asthma were recruited into three groups: joint replacement surgery, long bone fracture, short bone fracture. Participants underwent seven measurements of serum periostin over 26 weeks after bone injury, and prior to surgery in the joint replacement group. Differences in periostin were measured using a ratio of geometric mean (RGM), with comparison made with pre-surgery (joint replacement) or 26 week (long and short fracture) reference measurements. In the joint replacement group, periostin fell within 48 h (RGM 0.80, 95% CI 0.75-0.86), then increased to a maximum at 8 weeks (RGM 1.89, 1.77-2.02) and by 26 weeks remained above the reference measurement (RGM 1.27, 1.19-1.36). In the long bone fracture group, periostin was reduced at 48 h (RGM 0.76, 0.71-0.83) and then progressively increased to a maximum at 8 weeks (RGM 1.15, 1.06-1.23) compared with the reference measurement. In the short bone fracture group, periostin was reduced at 48 h (RGM 0.9, 0.85-0.95) but was not different from after week 1 compared with the reference measurement. Serum periostin levels are influenced by bone injury. The timing and extent of bone injury needs consideration if periostin is used as a biomarker in the management of eosinophilic asthma.Trial registration This trial was prospectively registered with the Australia New Zealand Trials Registry on Feb 7 2014, (ACTRN12614000151639: https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=363881).",

    "abstract": "Hereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency (C1-INH-HAE) is an autosomal dominant disease resulting in random and unpredictable attacks of swelling. The swelling in C1-INH-HAE is a result of impaired regulation of bradykinin production. The fact that the array of tests needed to diagnose HAE is not always available to the treating physicians is challenging for them and their patients. The data for this article were extracted from two distinct surveys. The first survey was conducted among HAE treating physicians and aimed to determine the availability and utilization of the various assays performed to help the diagnosis of C1-INH-HAE. The second survey was conducted with the various laboratories across Canada that performs the assays used in the diagnosis of HAE. The aim of this survey was to determine the availability and profile of the various assays used in the diagnosis of C1-INH-HAE in Canada, thereby ultimately bringing a rational basis for the biological testing. C1-INH functional assay was widely available in Canada (93%), but was only offered by a small numbers of hospitals meaning that there could be longer delays in the analysis of these samples that may explain why the physicians expressed a lower level of confidence in this assay (59%). Antigenic C1-INH was available to the vast majority of the physicians treating C1-INH-HAE (93%) and was considered reliable by 96% of the respondents. Antigenic C4 was found available to all Canadian physicians and, although with limited specificity, was considered very reliable by all the participants. This study revealed that 81% of physicians were able to order the antigenic C1q and the confidence in this assay was moderate (70%). Concerning genetic testing, the survey revealed that most of the CHAEN members never had to or couldn't order this test. This study highlights the need for improved education and knowledge exchange, about biological assays available to Canadian physicians and their performance in proper diagnosis of C1-INH-HAE to improve confidence and access to relevant tests.",

Epithelial cells were stimulated with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in the presence of MP-AzeFlu, AZE, or FP (1:102 to 1:105 dilution). Concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were measured by ELISA. Eosinophils were incubated in 10% human epithelial cell–conditioned medium (HECM) and survival assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion. Results are expressed as mean ± SEM percentage secretion/survival compared with FBS/HECM (respectively). FP and MP-AzeFlu (all dilutions) and AZE (1:102) significantly reduced IL-6 secretion and eosinophil survival compared with positive controls. At 1:102 dilution, IL-6 secretion was significantly lower with MP-AzeFlu (38.3 ± 4.2%, compared with FBS = 100%) than with AZE (76.1 ± 4.9%) or FP (53.0 ± 4.9%). At 1:102 dilution, eosinophil survival was significantly lower with MP-AzeFlu at day 3 (17.5 ± 3.0%) and day 4 (2.4 ± 1.4%, compared with HECM = 100%) than with AZE (day 3: 75.2 ± 7.2%; day 4: 44.0 ± 9.7%) or FP (day 3: 38.5 ± 3.5%; day 4: 14.6 ± 4.0%). Greater reductions in cytokine secretion and eosinophil survival observed with MP-AzeFlu in vitro may underlie MP-AzeFlu's superior clinical efficacy vs. AZE or FP alone observed in AR patients.",

In this study, we aim to make a comparison with T-helper 2 (Th2)-related biomarkers, lung function and asthma control between asthmatic patients with high airway reversibility (HR) and low airway reversibility (LR).Patients with asthma diagnosed by pulmonologist according to Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines were recruited from the outpatient department of our hospital from August 2014 to July 2017. Patients were divided into HR and LR subgroups based on their response to bronchodilators of lung function (HR = Δforced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) postbronchodilator ≥ 20%). Blood eosinophil count and serum IgE level, which are biomarkers of T-helper (Th)-2 phenotypes, were detected for patients. Asthma Control Test (ACT) was used to assess asthma control after the first-month initial treatment.A total of 265 patients with asthma were followed 1 month after initial treatment. HR group shows a higher level of Th2-high biomarkers (blood eosinophil count (10^9/L): 0.49 ± 0.28 vs 0.36 ± 0.19, P < 0.01; IgE (ng/ml): 1306 ± 842 vs 413 ± 261, P < 0.01), lower baseline lung function (FEV1%pred: 51.91 ± 19.34% vs 60.42 ± 19.22%, P < 0.01; forced expiratory flow (FEF)25-75: 0.76 ± 0.37 vs 1.00 ± 0.67, P < 0.01; FEF25-75%pred: 21.15 ± 10.09% vs 29.06 ± 16.50%, P < 0.01), and better asthma control (ACT score: 22 ± 4 vs 20 ± 4, P = 0.01) than LR group. HR was associated with a decreased risk of uncontrolled asthma after the first-month initial treatment (adjusted OR: 0.12 [95% confidence intervals: 0.03-0.50]).HR is a physiologic indicator of lower lung function and severer small airway obstruction, and is more related with an increased level of Th2-biomarkers than LR. Moreover, HR may indicate controlled asthma after the first-month initial treatment. This finding may contribute to identification of asthma endotype.",

    "abstract": "A diagnosis of peanut allergy has a major impact on an individual's quality of life. Exposure to even small amounts of peanut can trigger serious reactions. Common cleaning agents can easily remove peanut allergen from surfaces such as table tops. Parents of children with peanut allergy frequently ask if peanut allergen can persist on surfaces if they have not been cleaned.The purpose of this study was to determine the persistence of peanut allergen on a typical table surface over time.Five mL of peanut butter was evenly smeared on a 12 inch by 12 inch (30.5 by 30.5 cm) square on a nonporous (laminated plastic) table surface. Five squares were prepared in the same manner. The table was kept in a regular hospital office at room temperature and ambient lighting. No cleaning occurred for 110 days. Samples were taken at regular intervals from different areas each time. A monoclonal-based ELISA for arachis hypogaea allergen 1 (Ara h 1), range of detection 1.95-2000 ng/mL, was used to assess peanut allergen on the table surface.At baseline, there was no detectable Ara h 1 allergen. Immediately post application and for 110 days of collecting, detectable Ara h 1 was found each time a sample was taken. There was no obvious allergen degradation over time. Active cleaning of the contaminated surface with a commercial cleaning wipe resulted in no detectable Ara h 1 allergen.Peanut allergen is very robust. Detectable Ara h 1 was present on the table surface for 110 days. Active cleaning of peanut contaminated surfaces easily removed peanut residue and allergen. Regular cleaning of surfaces before and after eating should be reinforced as a safety measure for all individuals with peanut allergy.",

We sought to screen for peanut sensitization in a group of atopic Egyptian children in relation to their phenotypic manifestations. We consecutively enrolled 100 allergic children; 2-10 years old (mean 6.5 yr). The study measurements included clinical evaluation for site of allergy, possible precipitating factors, consumption of peanuts (starting age and last consumption), duration of breast feeding, current treatment, and family history of allergy as well as skin prick testing with a commercial peanut extract, and serum peanut specific and total IgE estimation. Children who were found sensitized to peanuts were subjected to an open oral peanut challenge test taking all necessary precautions. Seven subjects (7%) were sensitized and three out of six of them had positive oral challenge denoting allergy to peanuts. The sensitization rates did not vary significantly with gender, age, family history of allergy, breast feeding duration, clinical form of allergy, serum total IgE, or absolute eosinophil count. All peanut sensitive subjects had skin with or without respiratory allergy. Peanut allergy does not seem to be rare in atopic children in Egypt. Skin prick and specific IgE testing are effective screening tools to determine candidates for peanut oral challenging. Wider scale multicenter population-based studies are needed to assess the prevalence of peanut allergy and its clinical correlates in our country.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background We aimed to determine the effect of sampling time during the day on serum periostin levels in adult participants with and without asthma. Methods Serum periostin was measured at 2-h intervals from 0800 to 1800 h in 16 adult participants with stable asthma prescribed inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta-agonist therapy, and in 16 otherwise healthy participants without asthma. Mixed linear models were used to compare time zero (08:00 h) with subsequent measurement time for serum periostin for both groups. Results In both asthma and non-asthma, the mean (SD) serum periostin levels continuously reduced during the day from 53.5 (13.6) ng/mL at 0800 h to 50.9 (13.4) ng/mL at 1800 h (difference log periostin −0.05, P ≤ 0.001) and 50.5 (13.0) ng/mL at 0800 h to 46.2 (11.5) ng/mL at 1800 h (difference log periostin −0.08, P ≤ 0.001) respectively. Conclusions Periostin values are higher in the morning compared with the afternoon in asthmatic and non-asthmatic adults. The small magnitude of the variation in serum periostin levels suggests that the time of day in which the serum periostin measurements are made is unlikely to influence treatment decisions if a specific serum periostin level is used to predict treatment responsiveness.

In particular, long-term studies have shown that adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene delivery into ADA-deficient hematopoietic stem cells that are then transplanted into the patients corrects the abnormal function of the ADA enzyme, which leads to immune reconstitution. In contrast, the outcome was disappointing for patients with X-linked SCID, Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome and chronic granulomatous disease who received GT followed by autologous gene corrected transplantations, as many developed hematological malignancies. The malignancies were attributed to the predilection of the viruses used for gene delivery to integrated at oncogenic areas. The availability of safer and more efficient self-inactivating lentiviruses for gene delivery has reignited the interest in GT for many PID that are now in various stages of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. Moreover, advances in early diagnosis of PID and gene editing technology coupled with enhanced abilities to generate and manipulate stem cells ex vivo are expected to further contribute to the benefit of GT for PID. Here we review the past, the present and the future of GT for PID, with particular emphasis on the Canadian perspective.",

MucilAir™Nasal, a three-dimensional organotypic airway tissue model (with different cell types), was treated with Rhinosectan® (30 µl) or with a control (saline solution). The effects of Rhinosectan® were evaluated at 15 and 60 min post-exposure by: measurement of the cilia beating frequency (Hz), mucin detection (Enzyme-Linked Lectin Assay—ELLA), mucociliary clearance (µm/s) and phagocytosis assay (fluorescence). Exposure of MucilAir™ to Rhinosectan® did not alter the cilia beating frequency at 15 and 60 min post-exposure (diluted and undiluted). Exposure to Rhinosectan® (undiluted) during 60 min increased mucociliary clearance (93.3 ± 2.1 µm/s vs. 80.9 ± 1.8 µm/s; p < 0.01) and phagocytic activity (1.89-fold increase) in comparison with saline solution. Moreover, a significant decrease in mucin concentration was observed after 15 min of exposure (171.4 ng/ml vs. 306.5 ng/ml; p < 0.01) and at 60 min post-treatment (242.7 ng/ml vs. 339 ng/ml; p < 0.05). The application of Rhinosectan® to nasal epithelial cells does not impair ciliary movement, enhances mucociliary clearance and facilitates phagocytosis while reducing mucin secretion, which are optimal properties for the management of rhinitis and associated conditions.",

    "abstract": "Lupine is a member of the legume family and is often used in many food products in Europe (e.g. pasta, pizza, sauces, etc.) as a wheat or soy substitute. Lupine cross-reacts with peanut, and cases of allergic reactions to lupine in peanut-allergic patients have been reported in Europe mainly. In contrast, lupine as an ingredient in food products is relatively new to the Canadian market.We describe a 10-year old boy with diagnosed peanut and tree-nut allergy, who developed anaphylaxis to lupine flour in May 2017. A few minutes after eating a pre-made pancake mix that didn't contain any of his known allergens (peanuts, tree nuts), he developed oral pruritis followed by throat tightness, severe stomach ache, lightheadedness, cough, hoarse throat, nasal congestion, sneezing, and fatigue. He refused epinephrine, but was given cetirizine. The symptoms resolved after 3 h, but he was still unwell the following day. In a conversation between the mother and the allergist, it was determined that lupine was likely the cause of the reaction. To confirm, he was brought into clinic for skin testing to lupine. Results were consistent with lupine allergy (pancake mix: 10 × 7 mm, lupine bean: 12 × 6 mm). The family has since reported this to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, resulting in a product recall and a consumer advisory bulletin published by Health Canada.This is the first reported case of allergic reaction to lupine in Canada, and highlights the need for education of Canadian families with peanut allergy as well as allergists, regarding the possibility of cross-reactivity between peanut and lupine and its new presence in the Canadian food supply. In addition, a precautionary label for those with peanut allergy who purchase products containing lupine should be considered. This case illustrates also the need for a clear mechanism for consumers and allergists to report emerging food allergens to regulatory bodies such as Health Canada.",

In the COMPACT phase 3 study the prophylactic use of a subcutaneous C1 inhibitor (C1-INH [SC], HAEGARDA®, CSL Behring) twice weekly significantly reduced the frequency of acute edema attacks. Analysis of treatment effects by subgroups, onset of effect, and other exploratory analysis have not been reported. This is a post hoc exploratory analysis on data from the randomized, placebo-controlled COMPACT study. 90 patients with C1-INH-HAE were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment sequences: C1-INH (SC) 40 or 60 IU/kg of body weight twice weekly for 16 weeks, preceded or followed by a placebo period. The pre-specified primary efficacy endpoint was the time-normalized number of HAE attacks, and pre-specified secondary efficacy endpoints were the percentage of patients with a certain treatment response (≥ 50% reduction on C1-INH (SC) versus placebo in the time-normalized number of attacks) and the time-normalized number of use of rescue medication. Pre-specified exploratory endpoints included severity of attacks, alone and combined with rescue medication use. Post hoc analyses included exploration of onset of effect and clinical assessment of patients with < 50% of response. Subgroup findings by various patient characteristics showed a consistent preventive effect of C1-INH (SC). In a post hoc analysis of attacks, the onset of the preventive effect within the first 2 weeks after treatment initiation in COMPACT showed that 10/43 patients (23%) experienced attacks of any severity with 60 IU/kg versus 34/42 patients (81%) with placebo. The need for rescue medication was tenfold lower with 60 IU/kg (35 treated attacks) versus placebo (358 treated attacks). A qualitative analysis of the 4 patients treated with 60 IU/kg and with < 50% reduction of attacks demonstrated a reduction in severity of attacks, rescue medication use, and symptom days which was considered a clinically meaningful treatment effect. C1-INH (SC) prophylaxis demonstrated a preventive treatment effect with evidence of benefit within 2 weeks. A consistent treatment effect at recommended C1-INH (SC) dosing was evident in all subgroups of patients with type I/II HAE and by various measures of disease and treatment burden.Trial registration EU Clinical Trials Register, 2013-000916-10, Registered 10 December 2013, https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2013-000916-10; ClinicalTrials.gov Register, NCT01912456, Registered 31 July 2013, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01912456.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Kimura’s disease (KD) is a rare chronic inflammatory disease with unknown etiology. It usually manifests as a painless soft tissue mass or subcutaneous nodule on one side of the patient’s head and/or neck and rarely affects multiple parts of the body. The disease is more common among young Asian males. Case presentation A 57-year-old Chinese woman complained of multiple masses on her body surface. Ultrasonography was used to examine the retroperitoneal, bilateral neck, bilateral supraclavicular, bilateral axillary, and bilateral inguinal superficial lymph nodes. Enlargement of multiple lymph nodes was found in all areas. Many solid nodules were also found in the right parotid gland and right posterior neck area, respectively. Numerous solid nodules were seen on the left chest wall. Laboratory tests showed that the percentage of eosinophils in the whole blood was 39.40%, total immunoglobulin E (IgE) level was &gt; 5000 kU/L, and serum special IgE to Phadiatop (inhaled allergens) and fx5 (food allergens) were 1.01 and 1.04 kUA/L, respectively. After a complete examination, the masses located in the right neck, retroauricular and left axillary regions, and left chest wall were resected directly. Postoperative pathological findings revealed KD. Conclusions The case discussed in this study is extremely rare and did not meet the common affected areas and age characteristics of KD. This presentation can be used to improve disease awareness among physicians.",

    "abstract": "Cutis laxa is a connective tissue disease characterized by loose, wrinkled, and redundant skin. It is either inherited or acquired. In most cases, acquired cutis laxa is associated with neoplasms, drugs, and autoimmune diseases. We present a rare case of acquired cutis laxa following a recurrent urticaria-like eruption in the absence of an autoimmune disease, neoplasm, drugs and or syndrome.We report a case of a 45-year-old Chinese lady with a 1-year history of widespread pruritic urticarial eruption and a 6-month history of progressive skin wrinkling. On examination, the patient appeared older than her actual age, with apparent wrinkling on the mid-torso with generalized smooth, erythematous macules and wheals. A family history of similar conditions was absent. Biopsy revealed hypersensitivity and atrophy. Following the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines, we administered antihistamines, which relieved the itching, but her hyperpigmentation and cutis laxa never improved.Our case shows that the decrease of elastic fibers may be associated with the infiltration of inflammatory cells in the dermis. This supports the hypothesis that chemical mediators may play a major role in the destruction of elastic fibers, thus causing cutis laxa. In addition, we advise practitioners to take a complete clinical and family history to determine if the condition is inherited or acquired.",

Both teff and milk thistle have been presented in the literature (both domestic and foreign) in a positive light, the former as a new part of gluten-free diet, and the latter as a treatment for a number of conditions, particularly those of the liver.A 29-year-old male presented at our clinic due to an episode of itching and burning in his mouth, swollen tongue, and difficulty swallowing following ingestion of teff flakes. He also reported sneezing, runny nose, watering and burning eyes, and wheezing following inhalation exposure to ground milk thistle. The patient's occupation is associated with exposure to these allergens. The patient underwent comprehensive allergy diagnostic assessments (including skin-prick testing, serum specific IgE levels, Faber test, spirometry, and acoustic rhinometry) and gastroenterological assessments. The diagnosis was established on skin tests with native allergens (milk thistle 16/35, teff flour 22/60, negative control 0/0, histamine 3/5) provided by the patient. There are no commercially available (standardized) tests for milk thistle or teff either in Poland or anywhere else in the world.Milk thistle is available in the form of dry, finely-ground preparations (which are used as additives to bread, soups, and yoghurts) and extracts (which are used as ingredients in over-the-counter herbal remedies). Teff is a gluten-free cereal whose grains are rich in methionine, calcium, iron, folic acid, and antioxidants. This case report presents milk thistle and teff as potentially new allergens. A literature review revealed no similar allergy cases in Poland or elsewhere in the world.",

This study aimed at investigating the effects of maternal VitD-deficiency during pregnancy on Treg and Breg responses in offspring mice with house dust mite (HDM)-induced allergic airway inflammation. Methods Female BALB/c mice were randomized and fed with normal chow or VitD-deficient diet until their offspring weaned. The offspring mice were fed with normal chow and injected with vehicle or HDM to induce allergic airway inflammation. The levels of serum 25(OH)D, cytokines and infiltrate numbers as well as percentages of Tregs and Bregs in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were analyzed. The relative levels of VitD receptor (VDR), VitD-binding protein (VDBP), Cytochromes P450 (CYP) 27b1, and CYP24A1 mRNA transcripts in the lungs of different groups of mice were measured. Results Maternal VitD-deficiency significantly reduced serum 25(OH)D levels in offspring mice. VitD-deficiency significantly increased the relative levels of VDR, VDBP and CYP27B1 mRNA transcripts, but decreased CYP24A1 expression in the lungs of mice. In comparison with the control mice, significantly elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, increased numbers of lymphocytes and eosinophils, but decreased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines were detected in the BALF of VitD-deficient mice. VitD-deficiency significantly increased the frequency of Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17 cells, but decreased regulatory T (Tregs) and B cells (Bregs) in the BALF of mice with allergic airway inflammation. Conclusion Maternal VitD-deficiency lowed serum 25(OH)D levels and enhanced HDM-induced allergic airway inflammation in the offspring by impairing Breg and Treg responses.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades there has been an increase in the prevalence of allergic disease. Manifestations of these diseases have allegedly been observed in people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), however, few studies have been directed at patients under 18 years old. In this context, the aim of this study is to estimate the prevalence of allergic disease in patients under 18 years old, living with HIV, and to investigate the relationship between clinico-immunological characteristics of the HIV infection and atopy.This is a cross-sectional epidemiological study involving patients under 18 years of age who were followed up by specialized HIV services in the Southern Region of the State of Santa Catarina, Brazil, from February to October 2012. Data collection tools included a questionnaire established by the International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood (ISAAC), socio-demographic data, as well as laboratory test results obtained from the medical records. Blood samples were taken to measure total serum Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels and a Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST) for the main aeroallergens. Analysis was performed using Student's t test, chi-squared, Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney tests, wherever indicated, with p < 0.05 value considered significant.29 individuals were evaluated. The prevalence of symptoms of allergic disease was 65.5% (95% CI 56.1-74.8), the most frequent being rhinitis 44.8% (95% CI 35.0-54.5), followed by asthma 37.9% (95% CI 28.3-47.4) and eczema 27.6% (95% CI 18.8-36.3). RAST was positive in 20.7% of the individuals. There was no significant difference in terms of total serum IgE between individuals with and without symptoms of allergic disease. Nevertheless, a high frequency of raised levels of total serum IgE (40.7%) and an association between raised IgE and clinical staging of disease were observed. A further association between CD8+ cell count and prevalence of symptomatic allergic disease (p = 0.014) was observed.There was a high prevalence of reported allergic disease, as well as a high frequency of raised levels of total serum IgE. The association between CD8+ cell count and the prevalence of symptomatic allergic disease corroborates studies that demonstrated the role of such cells in the development of allergic disease.",

    "abstract": "Food-allergic children frequently avoid other highly allergenic foods. The NIAID 2010 guidelines state that individuals with an IgE-mediated food allergy should avoid their specific allergens and physicians should help patients to decide whether certain cross-reactive foods also should be avoided. Patients at risk for developing food allergy do not need to limit exposure to foods that may be cross-reactive with the major food allergens. The purpose of this study was to determine if parents of food-allergic children are given advice regarding introduction of allergenic foods; if these foods are avoided or delayed; if there is anxiety when introducing new foods; and if introducing other allergenic foods leads to any allergic reaction. The study also determined if there was a similar pattern seen amongst younger siblings.An online survey was administered between December 2011 and March 2012 via Anaphylaxis Canada's website, available to Canadian parents and caregivers who are registered members of the organization and who have a child with a food allergy.644 parents completed the online survey. 51% of families were given advice regarding the introduction of other allergenic foods. 72% were told to avoid certain foods, and 41% to delay certain foods. 58% of parents did avoid or delay other highly allergenic foods, mainly due to a fear of allergic reaction. 69% of children did not have an allergic reaction when these foods were subsequently introduced. 68% of parents felt moderate or high levels of anxiety when introducing other foods. A similar pattern was seen amongst the younger siblings.Canadian parents and caregivers of children with food allergies receive varied advice from health care professionals regarding the introduction of new allergenic foods, and feel moderate to high levels of anxiety. A similar pattern may be seen amongst younger siblings. While the majority of children in our study did not have an allergic reaction to a new food, a significant proportion of children did react. A more consistent approach to the advice given by health care professionals may decrease parental anxiety. Further research to support the 2010 NIAID guidelines may be necessary to clarify recommendations.",

    "abstract": "A girl was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis (CF) at birth, with repeatedly positive sweat tests and homozygous F508del mutations of her CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. From an early age, her lung disease was more severe than her birth cohort peers despite aggressive treatment. At the age of 16 she was listed for lung transplantation, but prior to transplant was not on systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents. In response to ex vivo stimulation, her pre-transplant peripheral blood T cells unexpectedly failed to produce detectable levels of IFN-γ, unlike cells from healthy controls or from another girl with CF and lung disease of comparable severity. Furthermore, naïve T cells freshly isolated from her peripheral blood showed a complete block of T cell differentiation into Th1, Th17 and Treg lineages, even in the presence of cytokines known to promote differentiation into the respective lineages. Her serology has been remarkably devoid of evidence of exposure to viruses that have been associated with T cell exhaustion. However, her freshly isolated naïve T cells showed sustained expression of markers of T cell exhaustion, which were further induced upon ex vivo stimulation, pointing to T cell exhaustion as the cause of the failure of naïve T cells to undergo differentiation in response to cytokine stimulation. Although excessive inflammation in CF lung can be both ineffective at clearing certain pathogens as well as destructive to the lung tissue itself, adequate inflammation is a component of an effective overall immune response to microbial pathogens. Our present findings suggest that intrinsic impairment of T cell differentiation may have contributed to the greater severity and more rapid progression of her CF lung disease than of the lung disease of most of her peers.",

    "abstract": "Anaphylaxis, a form of IgE mediated hypersensitivity, arises when mast cells and possibly basophils are provoked to secrete mediators with potent vasoactive and smooth muscle contractile activities that evoke a systemic response. We report a case of IgE mediated anaphylaxis to peppermint (Mentha piperita) in a male shortly after sucking on a candy.A 69 year old male developed sudden onset of lip and tongue swelling, throat tightness and shortness of breath within five minutes of sucking on a peppermint candy. He denied lightheadedness, weakness, nausea, vomiting, or urticaria. He took 25 mg of diphenhydramine, but his symptoms progressed to onset of cough, wheeze and difficulty with talking and swallowing. He was rushed to the nearest emergency department, where he was treated with intramuscular epinephrine, antihistamines and steroids. On history, he reported recent onset of mouth itchiness and mild tongue and lip swelling after using Colgate peppermint toothpaste. He denied previous history of asthma, allergic rhinitis, food or drug allergies. His past medical history was remarkable for hypercholesterolemia, gastroesophageal reflux and gout. He was on simvastatin, omeprazole, aspirin, and was carrying a self-injectable epinephrine device. He moved to current residence three years ago and cultivated mint plants in his backyard. He admitted to develop nasal congestion, cough and wheeze when gardening. Physical examination was unremarkable apart from slightly swollen pale inferior turbinates. Skin prick test (SPT) was strongly positive to a slurry of peppermint candy and fresh peppermint leaf, with appropriate controls. Same tests performed on five healthy volunteers yielded negative results. Skin testing to common inhalants including molds and main allergenic foods was positive to dust mites. Strict avoidance of mint containing items was advised. Upon reassessment, he had removed mint plants from his garden which led to resolution of symptoms when gardening.IgE mediated anaphylaxis to peppermint is rare. This case demonstrates a systemic reaction to a commonly consumed item, incapable of triggering anaphylaxis in the far majority of the population, yet causing a severe episode for our patient.",

Most recently in April 2013, it was approved in Europe for short-term prophylaxis (STP), prior to medical, dental, or surgical procedures, to prevent HAE attacks in both children and adults. Currently, C1 INH is not approved in Canada or the United States for STP of HAE attacks. Our objective was to demonstrate the effectiveness of C1 INH as a short-term prophylactic treatment for patients with Type I HAE undergoing invasive surgical procedures.A retrospective chart review between 1997-2013 was performed at one Canadian Tertiary Care Allergy and Asthma Clinic affiliated with The Ottawa Hospital, in Ottawa, Canada. The standard dose of C1 INH for STP was 10 or 20 U/kg.In all 24 procedures, there were no post-procedure HAE attacks after short-term prophylactic administration of C1 INH.In this retrospective chart review at one tertiary care Allergy and Clinical Immunology Clinic, short-term prophylactic use of C1 INH was found to be effective at preventing post-procedure HAE attacks, in patients diagnosed with Type I HAE.",

The aim of this study was to investigate eosinophiluria, urinary eosinophil cationic protein (uECP) and urinary IL-5 (uIL-5) in patients with Lupus Nephritis. Seventy-four patients with SLE—20 with clinical and laboratory evidence of lupus nephritis (LN group) and 54 without evidence of renal involvement (non-LN group)—were analyzed regarding eosinophiluria, uECP and uIL-5. Eosinophiluria was observed by Hansel's stain, ECP by fluoroenzymeimmunoassay and uIL-5 by quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay. Both uECP and urinary IL-5 (uIL-5) were corrected by urinary creatinine. Eosinophiluria and uECP were compared with glomerular erythrocyturia, protein/creatinine ratio (Pr/Cr ratio), serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA), serum levels of complement (C3 and C4), uIL-5/Cr ratio, and SLE disease activity index. Patients of the LN group had higher eosinophiluria, uECP, uECP/Cr ratio levels, and uIL-5 than patients of the non-LN group (p<0.001 for all). These variables showed a statistically significant correlation with glomerular erythrocyturia, casts, Pr/Cr ratio, serum creatinine, eGFR, anti-dsDNA, uIL-5/Cr, and SLE disease activity index (all p<0.05). These results provide evidence of increased urinary eosinophils, ECP and IL-5 in patients with SLE and LN; uECP/Cr ratio showed better correlation with markers of renal function and SLE disease activity.",

Most of the loci were related to immune response pathway. In this study, we tested whether the lipid metabolic gene HELZ2 was associated with the pathogenesis of PBC. In 586 PBC cases (358 in case 1 group and 201 in case 2 group) and 726 healthy controls of Chinese Han, six nonsynonymous SNPs were genotyped by MassArray iPLEX. The same control were used for the two groups of PBC cases. Allele frequencies were calculated by χ2 test based on 2 × 2 contingency tables. All data were analyzed using the PLINK tool set. The odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) were calculated, and p values (corrected for multiple testing by Bonferroni adjustment) less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The A allele of rs79267778 was significantly associated with PBC (ORcombined = 4.204 [1.670–10.582], p combined = 1.87E−04). It changed the amino acid at position 1904 (NM_001037335) from Threonine (ACG) to Methionine (ATG). This site was highly conserved in mammals and predicted to be POSSIBLY DAMAGING with a score of 0.469 by PolyPhen-2.

The survey addressed food allergies with respect to age of onset, allergy testing, self-injectable epinephrine (SIE) prescription, associated allergic conditions, and attitude and behavior of university students regarding food avoidance and epinephrine use.In total, 5497 completed surveys were analyzed; 526 participants were clinically diagnosed with allergies to at least one food item. A SIE device was prescribed for only 129 (24.5%) of the diagnosed individuals, of which only 4.7% carried the device at all times. Thirty-nine individuals (30.2%) reported that they and their family members know the proper epinephrine device technique. Strict avoidance of food allergens was reported by 30.2% of the individuals. Associated allergic conditions were observed in 69.3% of the clinically diagnosed individuals.Food allergies are prevalent among IAU students, with under-prescription of SIE devices. A high rate of high-risk behaviors with respect to food avoidance and carrying SIE was noted. Interventional strategies are needed to mitigate the risk of severe reactions among these university students.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of epinephrine auto-injectors (EAI) use is on the rise. Our objective was to describes children with hooked EAI needles that were embedded in soft tissues.Results: Two children self-injected in their shins. The embedded EAIs required removal in the Emergency Department. Both needles were hooked and splayed at the tip. A boy in anaphylaxis kicked his leg during EAI injection and the hooked needle embedded under his skin and was difficult to dislodge. The exposed needle was curved. A girl had an EAI administered for anaphylaxis, which was also difficult to dislodge. On removal, the distal needle tip was hooked approximately 160 degrees. Images of the device revealed that the needle fired off-center from the device and the device components were cracked. We propose three different explanations for these hooked EAI needles. The first is that the needle could hit bone during injection and curve rather than penetrates further. Secondly, the needle could bend when the patient moves during injection. Thirdly, if a needle fires sufficiently off-center to hit the cartridge carrier, this could hook the needle prior to injection.Awareness of the reasons for needle hooking, damage observed, and challenges and successful approaches to their removal, can better prepare the provider for these uncommon events. Teaching parents, children and educators about safe EAI storage and appropriate restraint during use may prevent some of these accidental injuries. Reporting device failures may lead to improvements in device performance and design.",

Anaphylaxis following treatment with mepolizumab or benralizumab is considered rare. Case presentation We report the case of a 35-year-old woman with severe asthma, who experienced anaphylaxis following the administration of benralizumab, mepolizumab, and omalizumab, separately. The therapy with biologics was chosen to avoid the repeated use of systemic corticosteroids for asthma exacerbations. The mechanisms underlying anaphylaxis caused by these three biologics remain unclear. The patient’s asthma symptoms and lung function improved after treatment with bronchial thermoplasty. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first report of an asthmatic patient developing anaphylaxis after commencement of benralizumab, mepolizumab, and omalizumab therapy. These three biologics should be administered carefully, and patients should be monitored for anaphylaxis.",

    "abstract": "Omalizumab is an efficient drug for patients with uncontrolled severe allergic asthma (SAA). However, little is known about the differences in omalizumab treatment outcomes among patients with different types of atopic sensitization. Here, we assessed the effect of sensitization to individual allergens or their combinations on the outcomes of anti-IgE therapy in patients with SAA.We performed a post hoc analysis of data of subgroups of patients enrolled in the Czech Anti-IgE Registry (CAR). The patients were evaluated at baseline and 16 weeks and 12 months after omalizumab treatment initiation. We analyzed the dependence of primary treatment outcomes [global evaluation of treatment effectiveness (GETE) after 16 weeks of treatment, a reduction in severe exacerbation rate (ER), and an improvement in the asthma control test (ACT) result during 12 months of treatment] and secondary outcomes [a reduction in systemic corticosteroid (SCS) use, an improvement in lung functions, and a fraction of exhaled nitric oxide] of patients with SAA treated with omalizumab for 12 months on sensitization to different perennial aeroallergens. We assessed sensitization to house dust mites, molds, and pets at baseline using skin prick tests and/or specific IgE measurement (semiquantitative evaluation). We compared polysensitized patients (sensitized to all tested allergens) with monosensitized (single positivity) or partially polysensitized patients (combined positivity but not to all allergens).We enrolled 279 patients (58.3% women, mean age 52.9 years). Omalizumab treatment presented an 82.8% response rate (according to GETE). It significantly reduced severe asthma exacerbations and SCS use, and improved the ACT result in 161 responders. We identified a subgroup of responders with distinct sensitization patterns (polysensitization to all tested perennial allergens) with higher odds of being responders (OR = 2.217, p = 0.02) and lower tendency to improve ACT result (OR 0.398, p = 0.023) and reduce ER (OR 0.431, p = 0.034) than non-polysensitized patients.The clinical benefit of sensitization for patients with SAA receiving omalizumab may be particularly dependent on sensitization pattern. Polysensitized patients showed a higher tendency to be responders (GETE), but a lower tendency to improve the ACT result and reduce ER than non-polysensitized patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) is the standard approach for treating patients with sensitizations to aeroallergens. However, immunotherapy can trigger severe systemic reactions if delivered inappropriately or to high risk patients. We sought to characterize and quantify SCIT systemic reactions requiring epinephrine administration during a 6-year period in a Canadian setting following the recommendations for components and dosages published in the 2010 Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (CSACI) Immunotherapy Manual. Methods A single centre retrospective chart review was performed for all patients with systemic reactions to subcutaneous immunotherapy requiring intramuscular epinephrine injection between January 2011 and October 2017. Each systemic reaction requiring epinephrine was reviewed for baseline patient characteristics, details of the reaction, and reaction severity. Research ethics approval was obtained through McMaster University. Results 28 of 380 patients experienced a systemic reaction requiring epinephrine administration, with an incidence rate of 1 per 1,047 injection visits (0.095%). 26 of the 28 reactions occurred within the mandatory 30-minute observation period post allergen immunotherapy. Of the 28 patients that experienced a systemic reaction to SCIT, 11 patients had asthma and 5 patients had a history of possible food allergy. All of the systemic reactions occurred during injections from vial number 4, and five patients reacted to their first shot of a re-ordered extract. 10 of the 28 patients required more than one intramuscular injection of epinephrine, and 20 of 28 patients were transferred to the hospital by ambulance. Conclusions This is the first Canadian study to review patients with systemic reactions to subcutaneous immunotherapy. Several best practice methods were employed throughout the study to optimize subcutaneous delivery of immunotherapy extract, and our recorded per injection incidence rate for systemic reactions was comparable or below the rate published in similar studies. The recommendations in the CSACI Immunotherapy Manual provide an approach to standardizing prescriptions for SCIT to maximize immunotherapy efficacy and reduce the risk of systemic reactions, though similar studies in larger multicenter settings are needed to confirm these observations. These observations provide important objective information to clinicians about the potential risks for systemic reactions in patients considering SCIT.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Air pollution may be associated with increased airway responsiveness to allergens in allergic rhinitis (AR). Ozone-aged environmental black carbon (O 3 BC) is an important constituent of atmospheric particulate matter (PM), for which the mechanisms underlying its effects have not been fully elucidated in AR. The objective of the present study was to determine the O 3 BC and pollen-induced alterations in the transcriptome in human nasal epithelial cells (hNECs) in vitro. Methods hNECs from nasal epithelial mucosal samples of healthy individuals undergoing nasal surgery (turbinoplasty or septoplasty) were established as air–liquid interface (ALI) cultures and exposed to O 3 BC, pollen, or a combination of O 3 BC+ pollen. Changes in cell viability were analyzed by fluorescence and changes in the transcriptome by high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Several differentially expressed genes were verified by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Enrichment analysis, based on Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, was performed to determine major biological functions and pathways involved. Results Exposure to ≥ 50 μg/ml O 3 BC or 25 μg/ml O 3 BC+ 200 μg /ml pollen significantly decreased cell viability of the hNECs compared to control (p &lt; 0.05) or 25 μg/ml O 3 BC alone (p &lt; 0.05); whereas exposure to pollen alone did not alter cell viability at any concentration investigated. High-throughput RNA sequencing analysis indicated that there was significant difference in gene expression between pollen or O 3 BC alone and O 3 BC+ pollen exposed cells. Exposure to 200 μg/ml O 3 BC was associated with hypoxia stress response GO terms, whereas exposure to 25 μg/ml O 3 BC+ 200 μg/ml pollen was associated with inflammatory response GO terms; including regulation of neutrophil migration and chemotaxis, macrophage differentiation and chemotaxis, mast cell activation, and phagocytosis. KEGG pathway analysis indicated the top 10 upstream regulators to be IL1B, CSF1, CCL2, TLR2, LPL, IGF8, SPP1, CXCL8, FCER1G and IL1RN; of which expressions of inflammation-related genes IL1B, CSF1 and FCER1G were significantly increased. Conclusion O 3 BC and pollen allergen combined exposure may induce innate immune and allergic inflammation in hNECs, and therefore potentially exacerbate the symptoms of AR in affected individuals.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Melkersson–Rosenthal syndrome (MRS) is a rare neuro-mucocutaneous disorder of unknown cause, clinically characterized by a triad of recurrent facial palsy, orofacial swelling, and fissured tongue. It is frequently seen in females in their second and third decades of life. MRS is diagnosed based on clinical features and it is rarely possible to observe all the classical triad symptoms at the same time. The disorder may cause recurring peripheral facial palsy that is wrongly diagnosed as recurrent Bell’s palsy Case presentation A 25-year-old female patient was presented to the neurology clinic of Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital in Addis Ababa complaining of recurrent left-side peripheral facial weakness, facial swelling and fissured tongue of 5 days duration. Her past medical history was positive for similar symptoms, for which she was diagnosed with Bell’s palsy and received oral corticosteroid treatment. On examination left side lower facial swelling with flat naso-labial fold and fissured tongue were identified. After excluding other mimickers, she was diagnosed with Melkersson–Rosenthal syndrome and completely recovered with high dose of corticosteroid treatment. Conclusion Melkersson–Rosenthal syndrome may present with the classic triads of symptoms, but mostly it shows an incomplete clinical pattern. Therefore, when clinicians including allergists encountered patients with facial swelling and facial palsy, they should have to consider MRS in their differential diagnosis and specifically assess for recurrent facial palsy and fissured tongue. Unlike true angioedema, the facial swelling in MRS often develops gradually and it might cause permanent swelling with cosmetic disfigurement from multiple relapses, which can be prevented by early detection and timely initiation of treatment.",

The aim of the study was to compare the concentration of proangiogenic factors in the sera of asthmatic patients and in healthy subjects (HS), and to refer the concentrations to both clinical and inflammatory markers of the disease severity. Serum was collected from 45 patients with severe/refractory asthma (SRA) and 51 patients with non-severe asthma (nSA). The control group included 30 HS. Serum concentrations of Angiopoietin-1, Angiopoietin-2, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and osteopontin were assessed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The levels of Angiopoietin-1 (68.8 ± 2.7 vs 56.4 ± 9.3 ng/ml; p < 0.05), Angiopoietin-2 (4.9 ± 0.35 vs 1.38 ± 0.14 ng/ml; p < 0.0001) and VEGF were significantly higher in asthmatic patients (n = 94) as compared to HS (255 ± 45.4 vs 424.5 ± 27.8 pg/ml; p < 0.01). The mean serum level of Angiopoietin-2 was found to be significantly higher in patients with SRA as compared to nSA patients (6.04 ± 0.46 vs 3.84 ± 0.43; p < 0.001). Angiopoietin-2 serum level correlated with respiratory function and with parameters of asthma severity: the mean number of asthma exacerbations in the preceding 12 months (R = 0.21; p < 0.05), mean number of emergency visits due to severe asthma exacerbation (R = 0.24; p < 0.04) and mean number of hospitalizations (R = 0.21; p < 0.05) or dose of inhaled glucocorticosteroids taken by the patients (R = 0.36; p < 0.001). Angiopoietin-2 seems to be a crucial proangiogenic cytokine overproduced in patients with SRA characterized by repeated exacerbations and Angiopoietin-2 serum levels can serve as a biomarker of severe asthma.",

Pulmonary inflammation was analysed in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and total serum immunoglobulin (Ig) E, IgG1 and IgG2a were measured in serum samples. Histological analysis of lung slides was performed. Mice dermally sensitized and intranasally challenged with AP showed respiratory responsiveness to methacholine as long as 45 days after initial sensitization, as well as increased percentage of neutrophils in BAL compared with the control group. At day 60, dermally sensitized mice still presented bronchial hyperresponsiveness, while the percentage of neutrophils returned to baseline levels similar to those of controls. Total serum IgE increased significantly on day 22 after dermal sensitization. Total serum IgG1 and IgG2a increased from 45 days after dermal sensitization and remained high at 90 days. Both respiratory responsiveness to methacholine and airway inflammation responses decrease with increasing time between sensitization and challenge. Respiratory responsiveness to methacholine tends to persist longer than inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Airway obstruction (AO) in asthma is driven by airway smooth muscle (ASM) contraction. AO can be induced extrinsically by direct stimulation of ASM with contractile agonists as histamine, or by indirect provocation with antigens as ovalbumin, while the airway tone is dependent on intrinsic mechanisms. The association of the ASM phenotypes involved in different types of AO and airway tone in guinea pigs was evaluated. Guinea pigs were sensitized to ovalbumin and challenged with antigen. In each challenge, the maximum OA response to ovalbumin was determined, and before the challenges, the tone of the airways. At third challenge, airway responsiveness (AR) to histamine was evaluated and ASM cells from trachea were disaggregated to determinate: (a) by flow cytometry, the percentage of cells that express transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), interleukin-13 (IL-13) and sarco-endoplasmic Ca2+ ATPase-2b (SERCA2b), (b) by RT-PCR, the SERCA2B gene expression, (c) by ELISA, reduced glutathione (GSH) and, (d) Ca2+ sarcoplasmic reticulum refilling rate by microfluorometry. Control guinea pig group received saline instead ovalbumin. Antigenic challenges in sensitized guinea pigs induced indirect AO, AR to histamine and increment in airway tone at third challenge. No relationship was observed between AO induced by antigen and AR to histamine with changes in airway tone. The extent of antigen-induced AO was associated with both, TGF-β1 expression in ASM and AR degree. The magnitude of AR and antigen-induced AO showed an inverse correlation with GSH levels in ASM. The airway tone showed an inverse association with SERCA2b expression. Our data suggest that each type of AO and airway tone depends on different ASM phenotypes: direct and indirect AO seems to be sensitive to the level of oxidative stress; indirect obstruction induced by antigen appears to be influenced by the expression of TGF-β1 and the SERCA2b expression level plays a role in the airway tone.",

    "abstract": "In the era of COVID-19, utilization of telemedicine has dramatically increased. In addition to reduced travel times, patient expenses, and work or school days missed, telemedicine allows clinicians to provide continued care while minimizing face-to-face interactions, maintaining social distancing, and limiting potential COVID-19 exposures. Clinical Immunology and Allergy (CIA), like many specialties, has adapted to incorporate telemedicine into practice. Previous studies have demonstrated similar patient satisfaction between virtual and in-person visits. However, evidence from fully publicly funded health care systems such as Canada has been limited.We performed a quality improvement (QI) initiative to assess the feasibility of telemedicine. Between 1 March and 30 September 2020, patient encounters of two academic allergists at a single institution in London, Ontario, Canada were analyzed. Assessments were categorized into in-person or telemedicine appointments. A random sample of patients assessed virtually completed a voluntary patient satisfaction survey. Qualitative analysis was performed on survey comments.In total 3342 patients were seen. The majority were adults (n = 2162, or 64.7%) and female (n = 1872, or 56%). 1543 (46.2%) assessments were virtual and 1799 (53.8%) assessments were in-person. 67 of 100 random patient surveys sent to those in the virtual assessment group were completed. 89.6% (n = 60) agreed or strongly agreed when asked if they were satisfied with their telemedicine visit. 64.2% (n = 43) felt they received the same level of care compared to in-person assessments and 91% (n = 61) stated they would attend another virtual appointment. 95.4% (n = 62) of patients reported saving time with virtual assessment, the majority (n = 42, 62.7%) estimating between 1-4 h saved. Reported shortcomings included technical difficulties, \"feeling rushed\", and missing in-person interactions.Our quality improvement initiative demonstrated high patient satisfaction and time savings with virtual assessment in a publicly funded health care system. Studies suggest that CIA may be uniquely situated to benefit from permanent integration of virtual care into regular practice for both new and follow-up appointments. We anticipate continued increased utilization of telemedicine, signifying a lasting beneficial change in the delivery of healthcare.",

Objective To evaluate use of lanadelumab in a French Authorization for Temporary Use (ATU) program. Methods ATU requests were made between October 12, 2018, and March 13, 2019; patients were followed through September 23, 2019. At entry, patients received lanadelumab 300 mg every 2 weeks. HAE attack characteristics were evaluated at day (D) 0 and months (M) 3 and 6. Patients completed the Angioedema Quality of Life (AE-QoL) questionnaire at initiation and monthly and the Angioedema Activity Score questionnaire daily in 28 day cycles (AAS28). Results In total, 77 patients received ≥ 1 lanadelumab dose; 69 had ≥ 1 quarterly follow-up visit (analyzed population). Mean (standard deviation [SD]) lanadelumab exposure was 240.4 (53.7) days. Lanadelumab dose was modified in 12 patients (mostly to every 4 weeks). For the analyzed population, compared with attacks/month (mean [SD]) within 6 months before ATU (2.68 [2.54]), fewer attacks occurred between initiation and first visit (0.16 [0.42]; P &lt; 0.001) or last visit (0.16 [0.42]; P &lt; 0.001); D15 and last visit (0.15 [0.41]); and D70 and last visit (0.17 [0.70]). AE-QoL total and domain scores were significantly higher at initiation versus M3 and M6; 55% and 65% of patients, respectively, achieved a minimal clinically important difference from D0 to M3 and D0 to M6. Proportion of patients with AAS28 of 0 was higher during M3 (90%) and M6 (83%) than initiation (59%). The most frequently reported adverse events included headache (7.3%) and injection site pain (6.3%). Conclusions Lanadelumab reduced attack rates, improved quality of life, and was generally well tolerated.",

Auto-injectors for use in the treatment of anaphylaxis are available in four strengths (0.1, 0.15, 0.3, and 0.5 mg). However, in many countries, only the 0.15 and 0.3 mg strengths are available. Consequently, many adult, heavy patients are prescribed the 0.3 mg dose, which may result in only one-fifth to one-third of the recommended weight-based dose being administered in heavy patients experiencing anaphylaxis. Underdosing may have therefore contributed to mortality in anaphylaxis. Objective To review the doses of epinephrine recommended for the treatment of anaphylaxis in the community, and assess whether recommendations should be made to increase dosing for heavy adult patients in hopes of avoiding future deaths from anaphylaxis. Methods We reviewed multiple national and international recommendations for the dosing of epinephrine. We also reviewed the literature on adverse drug reactions from epinephrine, lethal doses of epinephrine, and epinephrine dose-finding studies. Results The majority of national and regional professional societies and authorities recommend epinephrine delivered by auto-injectors at doses far lower than the generally accepted therapeutic dose of 0.01 mg/kg body weight. Furthermore, we found that the recommendations vary even within regions themselves. Conclusions We suggest prescribing more appropriate doses of epinephrine auto-injectors based on weight-based recommendations. There may be some exceptions, such as for patients with heart disease. We hypothesize that these recommendations will lead to improved outcomes of anaphylaxis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Penicillin allergy is a commonly listed medication allergy despite rare overall incidence. Many patients erroneously have this label, which has personal, health, and societal costs. Penicillin allergy delabelling requires an oral challenge, which can be a rate limiting step in the de-labeling process; this is even more relevant with the reduction of in-person visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective To identify the utility and broader applicability of using a virtually supported platform, initially adopted given COVID-19 restrictions, to expedite penicillin oral provocation challenge and penicillin de-labeling in patients at low to moderate risk of immediate hypersensitivity reaction and based on shared decision making. Methods Patients in Vancouver catchment area were referred for penicillin allergy and virtually assessed by the consulting allergist between July 2020 and April 2021. Those deemed appropriate for oral challenge based on the allergist consultant were offered the option of a virtual oral provocation challenge to oral amoxicillin in a subsequent virtual visit. Patients who agreed and were consented underwent a virtually supervised oral amoxicillin challenge during the second virtual visit. Findings are summarized in this case series. Results Twenty-three patients, both adult and pediatric, ranging from no to significant co-morbidities were consented and underwent the virtual challenge. One hundred percent of patients were successful with no reaction after an hour post virtual oral provocation challenge with amoxicillin. Conclusion Virtual medicine is likely to remain in the allergist’s practice. Virtually supported penicillin allergy delabelling, based on shared decision making and risk stratification, presents another pathway for penicillin allergy delabelling.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between occurrence of asthma in children and systemic antibiotic use in the first year of life based on an incidence density study with careful consideration of the temporal aspects of the determinant-outcome relationship. We conducted an incidence density study nested in a data collection project with information on 1128 mother-child pairs. Systemic antibiotic use in the first year of life was defined as excessive (≥ 4 courses) vs. non-excessive (< 4 courses) use based on information from weekly diaries. Events (cases) were defined as the first parent-reported occurrence of asthma in a child between 1 and 10 years of age. Population time 'at risk' was probed by sampling population moments (controls). Missing data were imputed. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the association between current first asthma occurrence (incidence density) and systemic antibiotic use in the first year of life, to evaluate effect modification and adjust for confounding. Forty-seven first asthma events and 147 population moments were included. Excessive systemic antibiotic use in the first year of life showed more than twice the incidence density of asthma compared to non-excessive use (adjusted IDR [95% CI]: 2.18 [0.98, 4.87], p = 0.06). The association was more pronounced in children who have had lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in the first year of life compared to children who had no LRTIs in the first year of life (adjusted IDR [95% CI]: 5.17 [1.19, 22.52] versus 1.49 [0.54, 4.14]). Excessive use of systemic antibiotics in the first year of life may play a role in the genesis of asthma in children. This effect is modified by the occurrence of LRTIs in the first year of life, with a stronger association observed in children experiencing LRTIs in the first year of life.",

    "abstract": "Inaccurate penicillin allergy labels lead to inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions and harmful patient consequences. System-wide efforts are needed to remove incorrect penicillin allergy labels, but more health services research is required on how to best deliver these services.Data was extracted from five hospitals in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada from October 2018-May 2022. The primary outcomes of this study were to outline de-labelling protocol designs, identify the roles of various healthcare professionals in de-labelling protocols and identify rates of de-labelling penicillin allergies and associated adverse events at various institutions. Our secondary outcome was to describe de-labelling rates for special populations, including pediatric, obstetric and immunocompromised subpopulations. To achieve these outcomes, participating institutions provided their de-labelling protocol designs and data on program participants. Protocols were then compared to find common themes and differences. Furthermore, adverse events were reviewed and percentages of patients de-labelled at each institution and in total were calculated.Protocols demonstrated a high level of variability, including different methods of participant identification, risk-stratification and roles of providers. All protocols used oral and direct oral challenges, heavily involved pharmacists and had physician oversight. Despite the differences, of the 711 patients enrolled in all programs, 697 (98.0%) were de-labelled. There were 9 adverse events (1.3%) with oral challenges with mainly minor symptoms.Our data demonstrates that de-labelling programs effectively and safely remove penicillin allergy labels, including pediatric, obstetric and immunocompromised patients. Consistent with current literature, most patients with a penicillin allergy label are not allergic. De-labelling programs could benefit from increasing clinician engagement by increasing accessibility of resources to providers, including guidance for de-labelling of special populations.",

    "abstract": "Primary immunodeficiency disorders (PID) are rare disorders with heterogeneous manifestations, overlapping with other diseases such as autoimmunity, malignancy, and infections. This makes the diagnosis very challenging and delays management. Leucocyte adhesion defects (LAD) are a group of PIDs in which patients lack adhesion molecules on leukocytes needed for their emigration through blood vessels to the site of infection. Patients with LAD can present with diverse clinical features including severe and life-threatening infections, early in life, and the absence of pus formation around infection or inflammation. There is often delayed umbilical cord separation, omphalitis, late wound healing, and a high white blood cell count. If not recognized and managed early, can lead to life-threatening complications and death.LAD 1 is characterized by homozygous pathogenic variants in the integrin subunit beta 2 (ITGB2) gene. We report two cases of LAD1 with unusual presentations (post-circumcision excessive bleeding and chronic inflammation of the right eye) which were confirmed by flow cytometric analysis and genetic testing. We found two disease-causing ITGB2 pathogenic variants in both cases.These cases highlight the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to recognizing clues in patients with uncommon manifestations of a rare disease. This approach initiates a proper diagnostic workup of primary immunodeficiency disorder leading to a better understanding of the disease, and appropriate patient counseling, and helps clinicians to be better equipped to deal with complications.",

To this end, peer-to-peer education is paramount. Food Allergy Canada offers an online, peer-to-peer mentoring program. However, the impact of this program has not previously been formally evaluated. To determine if Allergy Pals, an online, peer-to-peer mentoring program, for children aged 7-11 years, increased child and parental food allergy competency, and confidence. Our secondary aim was to qualitatively describe the experiences of the program. From May 2020-May 2021, children and their parents were invited to participate in an online, anonymous survey about Allergy Pals, at pre-program, and post-program. Primary outcomes, which were described and compared using chi2 or t-tests, as appropriate for the respective variables, included food allergy competence (epinephrine carriage, signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis) and food allergy confidence (e.g. comfort asking other for food allergy-related support). Secondary outcomes included child and parent perceptions of the program, which were analysed thematically. Overall, 17 children completed the pre-program, and 11 completed the post-program survey. Corresponding numbers for parents were 25 and 23. Food allergy competence was high pre-program, and remained so post-program. Food allergy confidence improved from pre-program to post-program. E.g. Children tended to feel less left out (5/12, 41.7%; 3/10; 30.0%, respectively), a finding that was reflected also in parents' scores. Themes identified for child and parent perceptions further supported improved food allergy confidence. Although food allergy competence was high pre-program, Allergy Pals improved food allergy confidence.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Canada has high immunoglobulin (IG) product utilization, raising concerns about appropriate utilization, cost and risk of shortages. Currently, there is no national set of standardized IG guidelines, and considerable variations exist among the existing provincial guidelines. The aims of this study were: (1) to compare the existing Canadian provincial guidelines on the use of IG products to identify their consistencies and differences and (2) to examine the existing research in Canada on IG supply and utilization following the establishment of IG guidelines to understand the scope of research and pinpoint the gaps. Methods A comparative analysis accounted for the differences across provincial IG guidelines. We highlighted similarities and differences in recommendations for medical conditions. A scoping review of citations from MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus and Embase databases was conducted for studies published from January 01, 2014, to April 12, 2023. Results While provincial guidelines represented a considerable overlap in the medical conditions delineated and relatively uniform dose calculations, numerous differences were observed, including in recommendation categories, provision of pediatric dosing, and divergent recommendations for identical conditions based on patient demographics. The scoping review identified 29 studies that focused on the use of IG in Canada. The themes of the studies included: IVIG utilization and audits, the switch from IVIG to SCIG, patient satisfaction with IVIG and/or SCIG, the economic impact of self-administered SCIG versus clinically administered IVIG therapy, and the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of alternative medications to IG treatment. Conclusion The differences in guidelines across provinces and the factors influencing IVIG/SCIG use, patient satisfaction, and cost savings are highlighted. Future research may focus on clarifying costs and comparative effectiveness, exploring factors influencing guideline adherence, and evaluating the impact of updated guidelines on IG use and patient outcomes.",

Objectives We conclude that people living with HIV (PLWH) who are antiretroviral therapy (ART) naïve could be at a greater risk of morbidity or mortality once co-infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods Here, we performed extensive immune phenotyping using flow cytometry. Moreover, to compare the range of values observed in the co-infected case, we have included a larger number of mono-infected cases with SARS-CoV-2. We also quantified soluble co-inhibitory/co-stimulatory molecules in the plasma of our patients. Results We noted a robust immune activation characterized by the expansion of CD8 + T cells expressing co-inhibitory/stimulatory molecules (e.g. PD-1, TIM-3, 2B4, TIGIT, CD39, and ICOS) and activation markers (CD38, CD71, and HLA-DR) in the co-infected case. We further found that neutrophilia was more pronounced at the expense of lymphopenia in the co-infected case. In particular, naïve and central memory CD8 + T cells were scarce as a result of switching to effector and effector memory in the co-infected case. CD8 + T cell effector functions such as cytokine production (e.g. TNF-α and IFN-γ) and cytolytic molecules expression (granzyme B and perforin) following anti-CD3/CD28 or the Spike peptide pool stimulation were more prominent in the co-infected case versus the mono-infected case. We also observed that SARS-CoV-2 alters T cell exhaustion commonly observed in PLWH. Conclusion These findings imply that inadequate immune reconstitution and/or lack of access to ART could dysregulate immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can result in poor clinical outcomes in PLWH. Our study has implications for prioritizing PLWH in the vaccination program/access to ART in resource-constrained settings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Drug allergy encompasses a spectrum of immunologically-mediated hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) with varying mechanisms and clinical presentations. This type of adverse drug reaction (ADR) not only affects patient quality of life, but may also lead to delayed treatment, unnecessary investigations, and increased morbidity and mortality. Given the spectrum of symptoms associated with the condition, diagnosis can be challenging. Therefore, referral to an allergist experienced in the diagnosis and management of drug allergy is recommended if a drug-induced allergic reaction is suspected. Diagnosis relies on a careful history and physical examination and, in some instances, skin testing or in vitro testing and drug challenges. The most effective strategy for the management of allergist-confirmed drug allergy is avoidance or discontinuation of the offending drug. When available, alternative medications with unrelated chemical structures should be substituted. Cross-reactivity among drugs should also be taken into consideration when choosing alternative agents. Additional therapy for drug HSRs may include topical corticosteroids, oral antihistamines and, in severe cases, systemic corticosteroids and other immunomodulators. In the event of anaphylaxis, the treatment of choice is intramuscular epinephrine. If a patient with a history of anaphylaxis requires a specific drug and there is no acceptable alternative, desensitization to that drug may be considered. This article provides a background on drug allergy and strategies for the diagnosis and management of some of the most common drug-induced allergic reactions.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is one of the most common respiratory disorders in Canada, however, many Canadians with asthma remain poorly controlled. In most patients, control can be achieved through appropriate therapy, including: inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), combination ICS/long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA), \"triple therapy\" with ICS/LABA/long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (LAMA), and biologic therapies. The medical management of severe asthma, in particular, has changed dramatically with the incorporation of biologics in asthma treatment plans. Allergen-specific immunotherapy represents a potentially disease-modifying therapy for many patients with asthma; it must only be prescribed by physicians with appropriate training in allergy. Other essential components of asthma management include: regular monitoring of asthma control and risk of exacerbations; patient education and written asthma action plans; assessing barriers to treatment and adherence to therapy; adequate management of comorbidities (e.g., allergic rhinitis) and reviewing inhaler device technique.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Severe asthma and moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis can significantly impact the lives of children and adolescents. However, real-world data on pediatric patients’ perceptions of their medication are limited. Methods This non-interventional cross-sectional study at a university hospital explored patients’ perceptions. We included patients aged between 6 and 17 with severe asthma and/or moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. For patients treated with dupilumab, a minimum dupilumab treatment duration of 16 weeks was required. We conducted one structured interview per patient, based on a questionnaire consisting of open questions and ratings on 6-point Likert scales (response scale range: “0: not at all” to “5: very strongly”). Results The study included 57 participants (severe asthma: n = 31; moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: n = 21; both: n = 5) who reported a “rather moderate” burden of asthma (median: 2; Q25/Q75: 0.3/2.8) or atopic dermatitis (3; 1.5/3.5). They experienced their current medications as “rather helpful” (asthma: 4; 3/5; atopic dermatitis: 4; 3/5). Twelve of the participants (21%) reported refusing to take their medication because of reluctance, but all resumed treatment. All participants receiving dupilumab therapy ( n = 16) reported an improvement in their disease within a maximum of 2.5 months after starting treatment. The median fear of injection decreased from 3 (0/5) before the first injection to 0.5 (0/1) at the time of the survey. Conclusions In this real-world, interview-based study, we found that pediatric patients perceived treatment as highly beneficial for asthma and atopic dermatitis. Furthermore, pediatric patients seemed to respond well to dupilumab therapy in terms of both disease improvement and less fear of injection. Trial registration DRKSID DRKS00028092",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Hyper-IgE Syndrome, also known as Job’s syndrome, is a rare primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by recurrent infections and elevated levels of immunoglobulin E. While respiratory and systemic manifestations have been more emphasized, dermatological manifestations in Hyper-IgE Syndrome also play a significant role in disease presentation. Methods This narrative review explores the dermatologic presentations of Hyper-IgE Syndrome in pediatric populations, including descriptions, associated symptoms/findings, and available treatment options. Results and conclusion Neonatal rash, mucocutaneous candidiasis, noma neonatorum, psoriasis, cold staphylococcal abscesses, and candida onychomycosis are among the dermatological manifestations of Hyper-IgE Syndrome. Each manifestation has unique characteristics and treatment considerations, necessitating accurate recognition and diagnosis for effective management. Optimal treatment strategies involve a combination of supportive care, topical/systemic therapies, antifungal medications, and surgical interventions when necessary. Further research is needed to enhance our understanding of these manifestations and evaluate treatment modalities for individuals affected by Hyper-IgE Syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic and inflammatory skin disease which requires continuous self-management by patients and caregivers. Patient education in AD can improve the self-management practices, treatment adherence rates, and clinical outcomes of patients. Patient-reported outcome measures and objective clinical outcome measures have been used to assess the effectiveness of AD patient education interventions, however they have limited use in assessing learning outcomes, such as knowledge. The literature on knowledge outcome measures for AD patient education interventions has not been examined to date. Main We performed a scoping review of the literature on knowledge assessment tools for AD patient education interventions following the PRISMA-ScR framework. Search databases included MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Education Source, Web of Science, Grey Matters, Clinical Trials.gov, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). Of the 3914 articles identified from the search strategy, 20 studies were eligible for data extraction and summarized by narrative synthesis. Most studies were randomised controlled trials originating in the United States, Europe, and Asia, and published in the years of 2003–2023. Researchers commonly evaluated caregivers’ knowledge of AD and included assessments of clinical outcome measures. Similar methods were employed for assessing subjective knowledge across studies. Likewise, studies measuring AD patient/caregiver objective knowledge used comparable methods. Multiple-choice and true/false question formats were used in objective knowledge assessments, and Likert-type scales were common for evaluating subjective knowledge. Objective knowledge assessments consisted of more questions than subjective knowledge outcome measures. Content assessed in knowledge outcome measures was relatively consistent across studies. Delivery of subjective and objective AD knowledge assessments was by telephone, in clinic, and/or online. In pre- and post-test study designs, identical knowledge outcome measures were administered. Conclusion This scoping review highlights the diverse components of knowledge assessment tools for AD patient education interventions. Further studies on developing and validating high-quality AD knowledge outcome measures are needed for assessing the true effects of patient education interventions on improving patient/caregiver knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (ARC), asthma and eczema carry a substantial morbidity. These conditions often co-exist within the same individual and their prevalence can differ based on age, ethnicity and gender. Objectives Using a UK primary care database, we estimated the trends in prevalence over the last decade for ARC, asthma and eczema and associated risk factors. Methods Longitudinal cohort analysis of the health improvement (THIN) database between 1st Jan 2010 and 1st Jan 2019. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore risk factors for diagnosis of these conditions. Results An average of 4.17 million records per year were analysed, 19.4% were children and 49.75% were male. There was an increase in prevalence of ARC, asthma and eczema amongst adults during the study period, whereas ARC and asthma prevalence amongst children has fallen. By 2018, 1:8 adults and 1:14 children had ARC; asthma was diagnosed in 1:7 adults and 1:10 children whereas eczema was diagnosed in 1:6 adults and 1:4 children respectively. There were regional discrepancies in allergy prevalence across the UK. Caucasians generally had the highest rates of asthma and lower rates of ARC compared with other ethnic groups. Having other allergies substantially increases the odds of having asthma, eczema and ARC. Conclusion The population burden of ARC, asthma and eczema in the UK is substantial. These conditions are often associated with other allergies and can, therefore, be complex to manage. These data support calls for improvement of pathways of care for allergy patients in the UK.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Since 2015, our nasal allergen challenge (NAC) protocol has been used to investigate the pathophysiology of allergic rhinitis (AR) with various allergens. However, we have yet to publish a comprehensive examination of the pathophysiology associated with AR to ragweed pollen. Methods Nineteen ragweed pollen allergic and 12 healthy (nonallergic) control participants from Kingston, Ontario, Canada, completed the NAC to ragweed pollen extract out-of-season. Total nasal symptom score (TNSS) and percent fall in peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) were collected up to 48 h post-exposure. Nasal fluid and serum samples were collected post-exposure, and white blood cell differential counts, serum ragweed-specific and total immunoglobulin-E (IgE), and nasal cytokine concentrations were analyzed. Statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism 10.4.0. Results The mean TNSS and percent PNIF fall from baseline were significantly higher in participants with ragweed pollen allergy compared to nonallergic controls up to 24 h ( P ≤ 0.05) and 12 h ( P ≤ 0.05) post-NAC, respectively. Nasal eosinophils significantly increased in allergic participants at 6 h ( P = 0.0010) and 24 h ( P = 0.0049), while peripheral blood eosinophil percentages decreased significantly at 6 h compared to baseline ( P = 0.0499). The specific to total IgE ratio for allergic participants significantly increased 1 h and 24 h ( P = 0.0022 and P = 0.0034, respectively) post-NAC, with a decrease at 6 h compared to both 1 h and 24 h ( P = 0.0224 and P = 0.0316, respectively). Allergic and nonallergic participants had significantly different cytokine profiles, particularly IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-13, MIP-1β, and TNF-α. Conclusions This study confirms the effectiveness of our NAC protocol in eliciting clinical and biological responses in ragweed-allergic participants, particularly highlighting eosinophil activity, IgE, and cytokine dynamics. Future research should investigate the roles of specific IgE, IL-4, and eosinophil activation in allergic inflammation. Additionally, this NAC study population provides a strong foundation for examining the nasal microbiome in AR. Longitudinal studies exploring the relationship between allergic responses and microbiome shifts could offer deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms of disease.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Food allergy imposes considerable financial costs on families, but few programs are available in Canada to offset these costs. To fill this gap, we developed, piloted, and evaluated a program designed to address the financial burden of food allergy. Methods The current study employed the use of an unblinded, crossover design. Participating families who began the study in the case condition received biweekly deliveries of food packages for 2 months, while those in the control condition received recipes and educational materials. Following the initial study period, the groups entered a one-month washout period and the conditions were reversed. During both conditions, an adult member of each participating family (“caregivers”) responded to a quantitative cost measure and completed a qualitative interview. Quantitative data were analysed using a series of linear mixed models. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results A total of 14 participants were randomized to a sequence using Stata. However, 5 participants were dropped from the final quantitative sample due to a failure to complete one or more set of quantitative measures. Caregivers included in the final quantitative sample were 32.1 years old, on average, overwhelmingly female (89%), and had annual, after-tax, household income of $52,660.00 (SD=$23,188.92; CAD). Target children were largely under six years old (89%) and were evenly split between boys (44%) and girls (44%). Milk (67%), peanut (67%), and egg (67%) allergies were most common. Quantitative results revealed participants had non-significantly lower indirect costs in the food delivery condition ($724.56 vs. $797.83), largely because of lower food preparation costs ($561.41 vs. $656.15). In contrast, participants reported non-significantly higher direct costs when they were receiving the food packages ($678.47 vs. $655.56). Findings from the qualitative interviews suggest that this increase may reflect the fact that participants purchased more expensive grocery items in response to the cost savings afforded by the program. Conclusions Participants derived several benefits from the program, but more research is needed to better understand how to maximize the impact of programs like NOURISH-US and to identify families most in need of financial support.",

While corticosteroids remain a standard treatment option, their use is often hindered by significant adverse side effects. This case series discusses a novel treatment of duo-administration of monoclonal antibodies for two patients that reduced their exacerbations, spared the use of steroids, and improved their quality of life. Case presentation Both patients were diagnosed with ABPA. Before the administration of treatment, they experienced almost monthly exacerbations and infections requiring constant systemic oral corticosteroids and antibiotics. After the implementation of successive concomitant monoclonal antibody treatments, absolute eosinophil levels were brought down to normal levels, and the monthly exacerbations were eliminated. Conclusion This case series describes a novel approach for ABPA therapy that holds potential in improving patient outcomes for those with severe ABPA. Duo biologic therapy may improve disease control and reduce corticosteroid reliance in patients with refractory ABPA by targeting multiple mechanistic pathways of inflammation. Mepolizumab with Omalizumab offers a potential treatment strategy to reduce exacerbation frequency and severity and has minimal adverse effects.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Hypersensitivity reactions to iodinated contrast media (ICM) are rare but can be life-threatening. Management typically involves avoidance of the offending agent and the use of alternative imaging strategies. The phenomenon of a transient refractory period—wherein a patient does not exhibit an allergic response upon re-exposure to the allergen shortly after an initial reaction—has been proposed but is not well-documented in the context of ICM. Case presentation We report the case of a 56-year-old woman who experienced an anaphylaxis associated cardiac arrest following administration of iopamidol 370 (Niopam 370) during a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA). She was resuscitated, intubated, and stabilized with noradrenaline. Two hours later, she underwent a second CT scan using iopamidol 300 (Niopam 300) without any obvious immediate hypersensitivity reaction. Subsequent skin testing was positive for both Niopam 370 and Niopam 300, but negative for alternative agents - iodixanol (Visipaque) and iohexol (Omnipaque). Conclusions This case suggests the presence of a transient refractory period following a severe hypersensitivity reaction to ICM, during which re-exposure to the allergen does not elicit an immediate response. Understanding this phenomenon could have significant implications for the management of urgent imaging needs in patients with known ICM hypersensitivity.",

Approximately 20% of our patients have chosen the subcutaneous route, mainly because of adverse effects from intravenous (IV) infusions or difficulties with venous access. Unit dose regimens using whole bottles of currently available 16% intramuscular preparations or sucrose-containing lyophilized preparations intended for IV use but reconstituted to 15% IgG for subcutaneous administration were individually tailored to each patient. In most cases, self-infusions or home infusions were administered once or twice a week, most commonly requiring two subcutaneous sites and 2 to 3 hours per infusion. On average, patients took 0.18 mL of IgG per kilogram of body weight per site per hour. There were no systemic adverse effects.

This article questions whether growing public anti-vaccine sentiments might have the potential to spill-over into other therapies distinct from vaccination, namely allergen-immunotherapy. Allergen-immunotherapy shares certain medical vernacular with vaccination (e.g., allergy shots, allergy vaccines), and thus may become \"guilty by association\" due to these similarities. Indeed, this article demonstrates that anti-vaccine websites have begun unduly discrediting this allergy treatment regimen.

One hundred and ninety-one patients were taking beta-blockers when skin testing occurred. Seventy-two patients had positive skin tests. No tests resulted in an adverse event. This data demonstrates the relative safety of administrating of skin prick tests to patients on beta-blocker treatment. Larger prospective studies are needed to substantiate the findings of this study.",

    "abstract": "Chronic diseases are the major cause of death anddisability worldwide. Healthcare systems are reformingthemselves to improve the health of people with, or atrisk of developing, chronic diseases. One of the majorgoals of these health reforms is to provide both self-management support and decision support to patientsso that they become involved and informed [1]. “Shareddecision making” (SDM) is described as a process inwhich the health professional and patient go through allphases of the decision-making process together and inwhich they share the preference for treatment and reachan agreement on treatment choice [2]. It has been posi-tioned between a paternalistic model, where the healthprofessional assumes the leading role in treatment deci-sion-making, and an informed patient choice modelwhere the health professional’s role is limited to provid-ing information and the patient is responsible for treat-ment decision-making [3].SDM is recommended because of its potential toimprove the quality of the decision-making process ofpatients for treatment choices that are informed andvalue-based, adherence to treatment decisions and ulti-mately, patient outcomes. It is one of the elements com-monly considered important in patient-centered care, agold standard to improve thequality of chronic diseasecare. Recently, SDM has also been advocated as a promis-ing strategy to promote effective knowledge translation(KT) between patients and their health care provider. Inthat context, a SDM approach to KT is defined as a pro-cess that is embedded in a specific relationship and bywhich both the health care provider and the patient influ-ence each other’s cognitions, emotions and behaviours,and come to agreement about a decision [4]. Althoughthere is a growing clinical interest in SDM, it is still notwidely adopted by health professionals.Frequently reported barriers include time constraints,lack of applicability due to patient characteristics and lackof applicability related to the clinical situation. Otherwise,factors such as the health professional’s motivation, posi-tive impact on the clinical process, and positive impact onpatient outcomes are often reported as facilitating theadoption of SDM [5]. Theory-based approaches are sug-gested to better inform the design of SDM implementationinterventions, as they provide insights on factors that mayinfluence the adoption of SDM by health professionalsandpatientsinagivencontext.Inconclusion,SDMisincreasingly regarded as an ideal chronic disease care strat-egy. SDM may enhance adherence to treatment decision,which is a major public health issue in chronic care.",

We evaluated the risk of childhood peanut allergy in association with pregnancy exposure to Rh immune globulin, folic acid and ingestion of peanut-containing foods. We conducted a web-based case-control survey using the Anaphylaxis Canada Registry, a pre-existing database of persons with a history of anaphylaxis. A total of 1300 case children with reported peanut allergy were compared to 113 control children with shellfish allergy. All were evaluated for maternal exposure in pregnancy to Rh immune globulin and folic acid tablet supplements, as well as maternal avoidance of dietary peanut intake in pregnancy. Receipt of Rh immune globulin in pregnancy was not associated with a higher risk of peanut allergy (odds ratio [OR] 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51 to 1.45), nor was initiation of folic acid tablet supplements before or after conception (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.48). Complete avoidance of peanut-containing products in pregnancy was associated with a non-significantly lower risk of peanut allergy (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.03). The risk of childhood peanut allergy was not modified by the following common maternal exposures in pregnancy: Rh immune globulin, folic acid or peanut-containing foods. Rh immune globulin, folic acid supplement use and peanut avoidance in pregnancy have yet to be proven to modulate the risk of childhood anaphylaxis to peanuts. Identification of prenatal factors that contribute to peanut allergy might allow for prevention of this life-threatening condition. This article explores the role of three such factors.",

Subjects underwent a control challenge (normal saline) followed by 4 consecutive daily NAC. Allergen challenge consisted of spraying the chosen allergen extract into each nostril until a positive nasal response occurred. Symptoms were recorded on a Likert scale, and oral peak expiratory and nasal peak inspiratory flows allowed assessment of a nasal blockage index (NBI), for a period of 7 hours. Induced sputum and nasal lavage were performed on control day and after 1 and 4 days of NAC.Compared with the control day, there was a significant increase in symptom scores and NBI 10 minutes after each last daily NAC in both groups (p < 0.05). Symptom scores and NBI were similar for the 2 groups, except for nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea, which were more marked in subjects with asthma and rhinitis, respectively. Nasal lavage eosinophils were increased after 4 days of challenges in both groups, but there was no change in sputum eosinophils. No cumulative effect or any late response were observed in any of the groups over the challenge period.Multiple NAC may be a useful tool to study the pathophysiology of allergic rhinitis or its relationships with asthma.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01286129.",

The American Academy of Pediatrics offers dietary recommendations that were updated in 2008.

A 9-item survey was distributed to pediatricians and dietitians online and by mail. Information on practitioner type, gender, length of practice and specific recommendations regarding complementary food introduction and exposure was collected. 181 surveys were returned with a 54% response rate from pediatricians. It was not possible to calculate a meaningful dietitian response rate due to overlapping email databases. 52.5% of all respondents were pediatricians and 45.9% were dietitians. The majority of pediatricians and dietitians advise mothers that peanut abstinence during pregnancy and lactation is unnecessary. Dietitians were more likely to counsel mothers to breastfeed their infants to prevent development of atopic dermatitis than pediatricians. Hydrolyzed formulas for infants at risk of developing allergy were the top choice of formula amongst both practitioners. For food allergy prevention, pediatricians were more likely to recommend delayed introduction of peanut and egg, while most dietitians recommended no delay in allergenic food introduction. In the prophylaxis of food allergy, pediatricians are less aware than dietitians of the current recommendation that there is no benefit in delaying allergenic food introduction beyond 4 to 6 months. More dietitians than pediatricians believe that breastfeeding decreases the risk of atopic dermatitis. Practitioners may benefit from increased awareness of current guidelines.",

Five clinical areas were reported to be suboptimal by multiple categories of participants, and specific causes were identified for each. These areas included: Integration of guidelines into clinical practice, use of spirometry, individualisation of asthma devices to patient needs, emphasis on patient adherence and self-management, and clarity regarding roles and responsibilities of different members of the asthma healthcare team. Common causes for gaps in all these areas included suboptimal knowledge amongst healthcare providers, differing perceptions on the importance of certain interventions, and inadequate communication between healthcare providers.This study provides a better understanding of the specific causes underlying common gaps and challenges in asthma care in Canada. This information can inform future continuing medical education, and help providers in community settings obtain access to adequate materials, resources, and training to support optimal care of adult patients with asthma.",

    "abstract": "Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a potentially life-threatening group of conditions that is often underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. As HAE is typically diagnosed by detecting C1 inhibitor deficiency, there is a critical need for methods that can identify affected individuals with normal C1 inhibitor. The recent discovery of associations between PLG K330E and ANGPT1 A119S and HAE of unknown genetic cause (HAE-U), has raised the possibility that genetic evaluation could be used to diagnose HAE-U in patients with unexplained angioedema or non-confirmatory laboratory testing. We analyzed genome sequences from a generally healthy population cohort of 2820 adults and identified PLG K330E in one individual. Subsequent review of this participant's medical history revealed symptoms clinically attributed to allergy of unknown etiology but that are consistent with published descriptions of HAE patients carrying the PLG K330E variant. The participant, a 31 year old female, reported lip and tongue angioedema, without wheals, which did not respond to treatment with steroids or antihistamines. The genotype-first approach demonstrated that detection of PLG K330E in undiagnosed or misdiagnosed individuals can identify patients actually affected with HAE-U. The genetic diagnosis will facilitate selection of appropriate treatment, discontinuation of therapies ineffective for this condition, and timely diagnosis of affected family members. The results support a role of PLG K330E in the pathogenesis of HAE and suggest that genetic testing be considered as an approach to diagnose patients with unexplained angioedema.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor (HAE-nC1 INH) is a rare, underappreciated condition characterized by recurrent subcutaneous angioedema. The underlying pathophysiology and diagnostic criteria continues to evolve. There is a significant overlap between HAE-nC1 INH and idiopathic nonhistaminergic angioedema, ultimately this may be found to be the same condition. Characterization of cohorts suspected to have either of these conditions is warranted to help refine diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment response. Methods A retrospective chart review of 418 patients diagnosed with angioedema was conducted. The following inclusion criteria was used: lack of response to antihistamines, steroids, and epinephrine; normal C4, C1 inhibitor (C1 INH) level and function; lack of urticaria or pruritus; occurrence without offending drugs; and positive family history. Enzyme immunoassays for C1 INH function were performed at the Mayo Clinic. Charts meeting these criteria were reviewed for frequency and type of episodes as well as use and response to therapies. Results 6 patients met the above criteria. 3 of these completed genetic testing, none were found to have factor XII abnormalities. None had angiopoietin 1 or plasminogen gene sequencing. 5 of 6 patients were successfully treated with C1 INH or tranexamic acid for acute treatment of attacks (4 with C1 INH and 1 with tranexamic acid). 4 patients have used Icatibant with good response (typically under 40 min for near full recovery); of these, 3 required Icatibant as acute treatment after other therapies (C1 inhibitor and tranexamic acid) were ineffective. There were 9 patients who otherwise met criteria, but due to a lack of family history were classified as having idiopathic non-histaminergic angioedema. Conclusions This retrospective chart review found 6 HAE-nC1 INH patients in Manitoba. 1 responded to tranexamic acid and not C1 INH, 4 typically responded to C1 INH, and 1 responded exclusively to Icatibant. All patients—4 total—who used Icatibant responded; of these 4 patients, 3 required Icatibant after other therapies had failed.",

Ideally, it should be administered into the subcutaneous space in the mid-posterolateral upper arm. Injections are commonly given using a standard allergy syringe with a needle length of 13 mm. Therefore, there is a risk of intramuscular administration if patients have a skin-to-muscle depth <13 mm, which may increase the risk of anaphylaxis. The objective of this study was to determine whether the needle length of a standard allergy syringe is appropriate for patients receiving subcutaneous immunotherapy.Ultrasounds of the left posterolateral arm were performed to measure skin-to-muscle depth in 200 adults receiving subcutaneous immunotherapy. The proportion of patients with a skin-to-muscle depth >13 mm vs. ≤13 mm was assessed and baseline characteristics of the two groups were compared. The proportion of patients with skin-to-muscle depths > 4 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm and 10 mm were also calculated. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of skin-to-muscle depth.Of the 200 patients included in the study, 80% had a skin-to-muscle depth ≤13 mm; the majority (91%) had a skin-to-muscle depth >4 mm. Body mass index was found to be a significant predictor of skin-to-muscle-depth.Most patients receiving subcutaneous immunotherapy have a skin-to-muscle depth less than the needle length of a standard allergy syringe (13 mm). These patients are at risk of receiving injections intramuscularly, which may increase the risk of anaphylaxis. Using a syringe with a needle length of 4 mm given at a 45° angle to the skin may decrease this risk.",

HAE manifests as recurrent episodes of edema in various body locations. Atypical symptoms, such as ascites, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and hypovolemic shock, have also been reported. Management of HAE conventionally involves the treatment of acute attacks, as well as short- and long-term prophylaxis. Since attacks can be triggered by several factors, including stress and physical trauma, prophylactic therapy is recommended for patients undergoing surgery. Human plasma-derived C1-INH (pdC1-INH) concentrate is indicated for the treatment of both acute HAE attacks and pre-procedure prevention of HAE episodes in patients undergoing medical, dental, or surgical procedures. We report the first case of a patient with HAE who experienced an abdominal attack precipitated by a retroperitoneal bleed while being converted from warfarin to heparin in preparation for surgery. Subsequently, the patient had a protracted course in hospital with other complications, which included hypovolemic shock, ascites, severe sepsis from nosocomial pneumonia, renal and respiratory failure. Despite intensive interventions, the patient remained in a critical state for months; however, after a trial of daily intravenous infusion of pdC1-INH concentrate (Berinert®, CSL Behring GmbH, Marburg, Germany), clinical status improved, particularly renal function. Therefore, pdC1-INH concentrate may be an effective treatment option to consider for critically-ill patients with HAE.",

Transgenic animals are currently the best available bioreactors to produce recombinant proteins, which can be secreted in milk. It has not been clearly demonstrated whether milk from transgenic animals expressing recombinant allergens has immunomodulatory effects on allergic asthma.We aimed to determine whether the oral administration of milk containing a mite allergen can down-regulate allergen-specific airway inflammation. Transgenic CD-1 mice that express a recombinant group 2 allergen from Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dp2) in their milk were generated using an embryonic gene-microinjection technique. Mouse pups were fed transgenic Dp2-containing milk or wild-type milk. Subsequently, these mice were sensitized and challenged with Dp2 to induce allergic airway inflammation.Upon sensitization and challenge, mice fed transgenic Dp2 milk had decreased T-helper 2 (Th2) and increased T-helper 1 (Th1) responses in the airway compared with mice fed wild-type milk. Moreover, pre-treatment with transgenic Dp2 milk attenuated airway inflammation and decreased airway hyper-responsiveness.This study provides new evidence that oral administration of transgenic milk containing the Dp2 allergen down-regulated and moderately protected against allergic airway inflammation. Milk from transgenic animals expressing allergens may have potential use in the prevention of allergic asthma.",

    "abstract": "While a growing body of research is uncovering the aetiology and effective treatments for allergy, research that assess the broader ethical implications of this disease is lacking significantly. This article will demonstrate both the paucity of academic research concerning ethical implications in allergy and explain why ethical analysis is integral to formulating effective health strategies for allergic disease. An exhaustive literature search of publications in French and English identified less than 35 academic articles focussed on the topic of ethics and allergy; this is a miniscule number when compared to the amount of articles published on ethical issues related to other chronic illnesses, such as obesity. It is important to demonstrate to allergy specialists the need for, and utility of, further incorporating ethical analyses in allergology; the current success of Ethical, Legal, Social Implications (ELSI) research programmes in human genetics and nanotechnology will serve as notable examples. Indeed, future research and innovation in allergy will undoubtedly encounter ethical dilemmas and the allergology community should play a significant role in helping to address these issues. However, incorporating ethical analyses in allergology does not imply that the allergology community must acquire extensive knowledge in bioethics; instead, interdisciplinary research that incorporates expertise from allergology and bioethics would enable allergy specialists to advance critical knowledge development in this largely overlooked domain of study.",

    "abstract": "Goldenhar syndrome (GS) results from an aberrant development of the 1st and 2nd branchial arches. There is a wide range of clinical manifestations, the most common being microtia, hemifacial microsomia, epibulbar dermoids and vertebral malformations. We present two cases of GS and secondary immunodeficiency due to anatomical defects characteristic of this disorder. Case 1 (3-year-old female) averaged 6 episodes of sinusitis and otitis media per year. Case 2 (7-year-old female) also had recurrent otitis media, an episode of bacterial pneumonia, and 2 episodes of bacterial meningitis. Their immune evaluation included a complete blood count with differential, serum immunoglobulin levels and specific antibody concentrations, lymphocyte phenotyping, and mitogen and antigen responses, the results of which were all within normal ranges. Both children demonstrated major structural abnormalities of the inner and middle ear structures, retention of fluid in mastoid air cells, and chronic sinusitis by computed tomography. These two cases illustrate how a genetically-associated deviation of the middle ear cleft can cause recurrent infections and chronic inflammation of the middle ear and adjacent sinuses, even meninges, leading to a greatly reduced quality of life for the child and parents.",

The purpose of our research was to determine the influence of apoptotic factors on the immunity of patients with atopic bronchial asthma according to the degree of severity. The study was performed on the peripheral blood of patients with atopic bronchial asthma with different severity. The Immunological aspects were determined with ELISA, the fluorimetric method and the method of precipitation with polyethylene glycol. And the quantification of the parameters of the programmed cell death was performed by the method of flow cytometry and electron microscopy method. The data obtained from morphological and biochemical parameters show the deregulation of Programmed Death of lymphocytes of patients with atopic bronchial asthma but individual for each group of patients. This dysfunction might induce the secretion of autoantibodies against DNA. This could explain the accumulation of circulating immune complex with average size considered as the most pathogenic in patients with bronchial asthma especially in the patients of serious severity. It should be noted that Patients with bronchial asthma of mild and severe severity had different way and did not have the same degree of deficiency of the immune system. These data suggested that apoptotic factor of lymphocytes may play an important role in controlling immunity of patients with atopic bronchial asthma.",

    "abstract": "Symptoms of allergic rhinitis (AR) have a detrimental effect on quality of life. The AR-Patient Benefit Index (AR-PBI), a specific self-assessment tool has been developed to assess treatment-related benefit in two separate sections: the Patient Needs Questionnaire (PNQ) which explores the patient's expectations before treatment and the Patient Benefit Questionnaire (PBQ) which evaluates treatment benefit. For the PNQ, three dimensions summarize patients' expectations: symptoms, social life and emotional state, thus covering a larger field than symptomatic relief. The aim of the study was to validate the French language version of the AR-PBI and to assess the treatment-related expectations and benefits provided in patients with allergic rhinitis treated with H1-antihistamines in a real-life study.BENEFICA was a prospective, observational study involving patients with allergic rhinitis who were starting treatment with H1-antihistamines. The Patient Needs Questionnaire (PNQ) was administered before treatment (D0) and the Patient Benefit Questionnaire (PBQ) was collected after a 14-day course of H1-antihistamines (D15). Discomfort (visual analog scale), and quality of life (miniRQLQ) were measured on D0 and D15.Three thousands and eighty-nine patients were enrolled in the study: mean age 39 ± 14 years, women 52%, 81% of patients with moderate to severe persistent rhinitis (Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma, ARIA); 19% had (a) concomitant condition(s), 18% were asthmatic, and 12% had atopic dermatitis. Discomfort and quality of life improved between D0 and D15. AR-PBI was 2.7 ± 0.8, superior to 1 (threshold for clinically relevant benefit) for 97% of patients and greater in patients willing to continue the treatment. PBI was moderately correlated to change in miniRQLQ (r = -0.45, p < 0.0001) and change in discomfort (r = -0.38, p < 0.0001), suggesting a richer conceptual content than symptoms relief.The French version of the Allergic Rhinitis-Patient Benefit Index (AR-PBI) has been validated. It complements the discomfort and quality of life tools and assesses the needs and benefits in patients suffering from allergic rhinitis. This new tool may help physicians to better understand patients' expectations and to discuss treatment issues with their patients.",

    "abstract": "The 10th C1-inhibitor deficiency workshop will be held between 18 and 21 May 2017 in Budapest (2017.haenetworkshop.hu),among the picturesque surroundings of Margaret Island.As indicated by the name of this event, most of the interest focused on angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency in 1999, when it was first organized.The name is unchanged, but the range of angioedemas has expanded since to include all known varieties of hereditary and acquired angioedemas with a bradykinin-mediated pathomechanism.Looking back to the agenda of this biennial conference, many questions remained unanswered and new issues have arisen despite the enormous scientific progress made.On this occasion, 318 participants have registered from 42 countriesthis is the greatest attendance in the history of the Workshop since the start of the series.Eighty-six presentations have been submitted for this 4-day long scientific forum.The scientific program sounds interesting-it comprises novel achievements by leading scientific teams in basic research into bradykinin-mediated angioedema, the new findings of diagnostics and genetics, promising therapeutic solutions awaiting introduction, and the experience accumulated with the latest therapeutic procedures.Several presentations discuss the efforts related to improving the patients' quality of life.This time, we have invited five prominent experts-namely, Alvin Schmaier (Cleveland, OH, USA), Marco Cicardi (Milan, Italy), Avner Reshef (Tel-Hashomer, Israel), Dumitru Moldovan (Tirgu-Mures, Romania) and Attila Mócsai (Budapest, Hungary).Alvin Schmaier will show us that our knowledge about the underlying mechanisms of bradykinin-mediated angioedemas is still limited-this may be remedied by extending our interest to other forms of angioedema with different pathophysiological backgrounds.Marco Cicardi will expose the similarities and the differences between bradykinin-mediated edema formation, and the idiopathic systemic capillary leak syndrome.Avner Reshef will explore a similar issue in his presentation titled 'Angioedema-Histamine or Bradykinin?' .The lecture on neutrophil granulocytes by Attila Mócsai will take us closer to understanding the pathomechanism of angioedema.The agenda also contains the traditional roundtable session, an opportunity to develop consensus and international guidelines-this year, genetics will be in the limelight.In this session, the keynote lectures will be read by Margarita-Lopez Trascasa (Madrid, Spain) on the extended diagnostic approach integrating serological and genetic methodology; by Anastasios Germenis (Larissa, Greece) on the latest techniques for studying the SERPING1 gene; and by Nancy Brown (Nashville, TN, USA) on the pharmacogenetics of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema.Notwithstanding the remarkable progress made in South-America and in the former Soviet-bloc countries of Europe, state-of-the-art diagnostic and therapeutic modalities are still not available in many regions of the World.Dumitru Moldovan will review the stages along the way to making these accessible, and the experience accumulated in the effort to achieve high levels of patient care.The conference will be attended both by researchers and by clinicians-medical professionals and nurses, by the representatives of patient organizations, and by pharmaceutical industry experts involved in drug development, in order to assist the efforts of each other through joint thinking.Within the framework of this fruitful cooperation, the pharmaceutical companies also lent financial support to the conference-in addition to their scientific contribution.The travel grants, make it possible for an increasing number of professionals involved in the research or the management of patients with angioedema to attend the Workshop.The generous support by our Sponsors enabled us again to present the \"For HAE Patients\" award, as well as the \"Grant for Young Investigators\".The major donors to this event are CSL Behring and Shire.Pharming Group NV, Swedish Orphan Biovitrum, BioCryst Phamaceuticals, KininX SAS also contributed the sponsorship of the Workshop.On occasion of this tenth, jubilee event, the \"For HAE Patients\" award goes to Bruce Zuraw (San Diego, USA), who will present his lecture 'Let the Treatment Fit the Disease' on the festive session of the scientific section on Day 1.His achievements in bettering the management of patients will be recalled by Antony Castaldo, the chair of the International Patient Organization for C1 Inhibitor Deficiencies.The concluding event of the conference will be the awarding of the 'Grant for Young Investigators' to the top four young presenters.The support referred to above made it possible to publish the submitted abstracts of the Workshop in the journal Allergy, Asthma, and Clinical Immunology, in order to make them available to an even broader range of professionals interested in this subject.",

    "abstract": "Omalizumab is licensed as add-on therapy for patients with severe allergic asthma. Response is in most studies scored by the physician's global evaluation of treatment effectiveness (GETE). A good clinical and validated parameter for treatment response is currently missing. Also, there are no established criteria for identifying patients who will respond to omalizumab based on pre-treatment characteristics. The Dutch National Omalizumab in Asthma Registry was developed in 2011 to better evaluate inclusion criteria and measure treatment response after 4 months. This is a \"real world\" prospectively designed, observational data registry in which the outcomes of patients who received omalizumab between 2012 and 2015 were evaluated. Data were collected from all centers in the Netherlands comprising demographic features, criteria for starting treatment, GETE, FEV1, oral corticosteroid use and ACQ. 65.5% of the 403 patients had a good or excellent response to omalizumab after 16 weeks according to the treating physician GETE. 64.5% fulfilled all the criteria for prescribing omalizumab at baseline. The mean ACQ improved from 2.96 at baseline to 1.83 at 16 weeks (p < 0.001). 75.3% of the responders showed more than 0.5 points improvement in the ACQ. The mean FEV1 increased from 71.58 to 79.06 (p < 0.001). There was no relationship between patients with a FEV1 <80 and ≥80% at baseline and response (p = 0.981). Most of the responders had a considerable improvement of FEV1 either/or ACQ or OCS use (88.3%). While 86.7% of the responders had an improvement of either ACQ or FEV1. 75.4% of the responders had an improvement of ACQ, while 50.4% had an improvement of FEV1. Finally 11.7% of the patients with no improvement of FEV1, ACQ or OCS use were considered to have a good response. This registry of 403 inadequately controlled severe allergic asthma patients in the Netherlands showed a good or excellent response of 65.5% to omalizumab after 16 weeks, in accordance with previous studies. The assumption that careful registration would lead to higher response rates could not be supported by the data from this registry. Improvement of ACQ appears to be a useful additional assessment tool to measure response in omalizumab treated patients.",

    "abstract": "Hymenoptera venom allergy is one of the most frequent causes of anaphylaxis. In its most severe form, the reaction to wasp and honey bee stings may be life-threatening. Therefore, immediate and proper diagnosis of venom allergy and implementation of suitable therapy are extremely important. Broadening the knowledge on the mechanism of the allergic reaction may contribute to the improvement of both diagnostic and treatment methods. Thus, this study aimed to discover changes in protein expression in serum of patients allergic to Hymenoptera (wasp and honeybee) venom and to point out proteins and peptides involved in the allergic inflammation. Serum proteomic patterns typical to allergic patients and healthy volunteers were obtained with MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight) mass spectrometer. The spectra were processed, analyzed and compared using advanced bioinformatics tools. The discriminative peaks were subjected to identification with liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. This methodology allowed for the identification of four features differentiating between allergy and control groups. They were: fibrinogen alpha chain, coagulation factor XIII chain A, complement C4-A, and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4. All of these proteins are involved in allergic inflammatory response. Extending the knowledge of the Hymenoptera venom sensitization will contribute to the development of novel, sensitive and specific methods for quick and unambiguous allergy diagnosis. Understanding the basis of the allergy at the proteomic level will support the improvement of preventive and therapeutic measures.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The prevalence of food allergy in Canada is high and has increased over time. To date, there are no Canadian data on the healthcare costs of visits to allergists. Methods We sent an anonymous survey to allergist members of the Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (CSACI) between October and December 2019. Survey questions included demographic information and billing fees for various types of allergy visits and diagnostic testing. Results Of 200 allergists who are members of CSACI, 43 allergists responded (21.5% response rate). Billing fees varied widely. The greatest ranges were noted for oral immunotherapy (OIT; both initial consultation [mean $198.70; range $0 to $575] and follow up/build up visits [mean $125.74; range: $0 to $575]). There were significant provincial differences in billing fees, as well as significant billing fee differences between hospital versus community allergists (e.g. oral food challenge [OFC]: $256.38 vs. $134.94, p &lt; 0.01). Billing fees were higher outside of Ontario, with the exception of specific Immunoglubulin E (sIgE) testing and OIT visits. Conclusions Greater standardization of billing fees across provinces and between hospital versus community allergy could result in more consistency of billing fees for OFC and OIT across Canada. Further knowledge of exact costs will help inform practice and policy in the diagnosis and management of food allergy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Both intravenous and subcutaneous human immune globin G (IgG) replacement (IVIG and SCIG, respectively) reduce severe infection and increase serum IgG levels in primary immune deficiency disorder (PIDD) patients who require replacement. SCIG can be administered either with the aid of an infusion pump, or by patients or caregivers themselves, using butterfly needles and a syringe (“SCIG push”). SCIG offers advantages over IVIG, including higher steady state IgG levels, improved patient quality of life indicators, and decreased cost to the healthcare system, and for these reasons, SCIG has been increasingly used in Manitoba starting in 2007. We sought to determine the effectiveness of SCIG push in our local adult PIDD population. Methods We conducted a retrospective chart review of all adult patients enrolled in the SCIG push program in Manitoba, Canada from its inception in November 2007 through September 2018. We included patients who were naïve to IgG replacement prior to SCIG, and those who had received IVIG immediately prior. We collected data regarding serum IgG levels, antibiotic prescriptions, hospital admissions, and adverse events during a pre-defined period prior to and following SCIG initiation. Statistical significance was determined via two-tailed t-test. Results 62 patients met inclusion criteria, of whom 35 were on IVIG prior and 27 were IgG replacement naïve. SCIG push resulted in an increase in serum IgG levels in those naïve to IgG replacement, as well as in those who received IVIG prior. SCIG push also resulted in a statistically significant reduction in number of antibiotic prescriptions filled in the naïve subgroup, and no significant change in antibiotics filled in the IVIG prior group. 8/62 PIDD patients (12.9%) left the SCIG program during our review period for varying reasons, including side-effects. Conclusions In a real-life setting, in the Manitoba adult PIDD population, SCIG push is an effective method of preventing severe infections, with most patients preferring to continue this therapy once initiated.",

The anti-bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI), produced by neutrophils, peripheral blood monocytes or epithelial cells, can neutralize lipopolysaccharide activity and enhance phagocytosis regulation function. This study aimed to assess the clinical significance of BPI in asthmatic patients. Methods We recruited 18 controlled asthma, 39 uncontrolled asthma and 35 healthy controls individuals. Clinical characteristics (age, gender, allergy history, body mass index (BMI) and smoking history), clinical indicators [whole blood count, forced expiratory volume in one second as percentage of predicted volume (FEV1% predicted), IgE level, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and fractional expiratory nitric oxide (FeNO)] and serum BPI levels were measured to compare among each group. We then evaluated the correlation between BPI, clinical characteristics and clinical indicators. Finally, linear regression analysis was performed to exclude the influence of other factors and to find the independent influencing factors of BPI. Results Our results showed that the serum BPI levels increased by twofold in the controlled asthma group (12.83 ± 6.04 ng/mL) and threefold in the uncontrolled asthma group (18.10 ± 13.48 ng/mL), compared to the healthy control group (6.00 ± 2.58 ng/mL) (p &lt; 0.001). We further found that serum BPI levels were positively correlated with the hs-CRP (p = 0.002). There was no significant association among BPI, age, gender, BMI, allergy, blood eosinophils, blood neutrophils, IgE, FeNO or FEV1% predicted. Conclusion BPI levels were increased in asthma and positively correlated with hs-CRP. BPI as a potential asthma biomarker that still needs further research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Human microbiota plays a fundamental role in modulating the immune response. Western environment and lifestyle are envisaged to alter the human microbiota with a new microbiome profile established in Chinese immigrants, which fails to prime the immune system. Here, we investigated how differences in composition of oropharyngeal microbiome may contribute to patterns of interaction between the microbiome and immune system in Chinese immigrants living in Australia. Methods We recruited 44 adult Chinese immigrants: newly-arrived (n = 22, living in Australia &lt; 6 months) and long-term Chinese immigrants (n = 22, living in Australia &gt; 5 years), with age and gender matched. Oropharyngeal swabs, serum and whole blood were collected. The 16 s ribosomal RNA gene from the swabs was sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Innate immune responses were determined by 23 Toll-like receptors (TLR) pathway cytokines, while adaptive immune responses were determined by IgG-associated response to specific microbial/viral pathogens. Results The relative abundance of the genus Leptotrichia was higher in long-term immigrants as compared to that in newly-arrived Chinese immigrants, while the genus Deinococcus was significantly lower in long-term Chinese immigrants. The genera uncultured Lachnospiraceae , Erysipelotrichaceae UCG - 007 , Veillonella , and Actinomycetales_ambiguous taxa were negatively correlated with cytokine IL-6 in long-term Chinese immigrants (rho range: − 0.46 ~ − 0.73). With respect to adaptive immunity, several microbial taxa were significantly associated with IgG1 responsiveness to microbial antigens in long-term immigrants, while a significant correlation with IgG1 responsiveness to viral antigens was detected in newly-arrived immigrants. Conclusions The composition of the oropharyngeal microbiome varies between newly-arrived and long-term Chinese immigrants. Specific microbial taxa are significantly associated with immunological parameters but with different association patterns between newly-arrived and long-term Chinese immigrants.",

Here, we report a new patient from a non-consanguineous Argentinian family, who was followed for recurrent ulcerative skin lesions, cerebral calcifications and lung disease. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) revealed two novel compound heterozygous variants (c.285del and c.299_312del, NM_005101.4 GRCh37(hg19), both classified as pathogenic according to ACMG criteria) in the ISG15 gene, resulting in a complete deficiency due to disruption of the second ubiquitin domain of the corresponding protein. The clinical phenotype of this patient is unique given the presence of recurrent pulmonary manifestations and the absence of mycobacterial infections, thus resulting in a phenotype distinct from that previously described in patients with biallelic loss-of-function (LOF) ISG15 variants. This case highlights the role of ISG15 as an immunomodulating factor whose LOF variants result in heterogeneous clinical presentations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by reversible bronchoconstriction and airway inflammation. According to Statistics Canada in 2014, 8.1% of Canadians aged 12 and older reported having asthma diagnosed by a health care professional. Therefore, in 2014 there were an estimated 274,661 persons with asthma in Alberta. Most epidemiological studies estimate prevalence and incidence using survey-based data, which has limitations. The Ontario Asthma Surveillance Information System (OASIS) group has developed and validated an algorithm for epidemiologic asthma studies using provincial health databases. In Alberta, there are some studies using provincial databases, but most are restricted to emergency department visits and do not represent the entire asthma population. Using the validated asthma definition for epidemiologic studies, we performed an analysis of the Alberta Health administrative databases to investigate and report province-wide asthma prevalence, incidence and mortality in Alberta from 1995 to 2015. Methods Data from administrative databases, provided by Alberta Health, was analyzed to determine age and sex specific prevalence, incidence and mortality of the asthma population. The population cohort was all individuals residing in the province of Alberta, ages 0 to 99 from 1995–2015. Kendall’s Tau coefficient test was used to ascertain whether the observed trends were statistically significant. Results Between 1995 and 2015, the age-standardized incidence of asthma decreased by more than 50% in both males and females. Prevalence, however, increased threefold over the 20 years (for both genders) from 3.9 to 12.3% (Tau = 1.00, p &lt; 0.0001) in females and from 3.5 to 11.6% (Tau = 1.00, p &lt; 0.0001) in males. Thus, in 2015 there were 496,927 people with asthma in Alberta. All-cause mortality in the asthma population decreased over time, in both females (Tau = − 0.71, p &lt; 0.0001) and males (Tau = − 0.69, p = 0.0001). For the last several years, all-cause mortality was higher in those with asthma. There were ~ 7 deaths/1000 in the population with asthma versus ~ 5 deaths/1000 in those without asthma. Conclusions The incidence of asthma decreased in both females and males while prevalence continued to increase, although at a slower rate than previously. All-cause mortality in asthma patients was higher than in those without asthma, but both decreased over time.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background An allergy to kiwi is rare in Poland. Most (65–72%) of the patients who are allergic to kiwi report symptoms of an oral allergy syndrome (OAS); however, systemic manifestations (18–28%) have also been reported. Case report A 27-year-old male patient, previously not suffering from chronic diseases, exercised in the gym. He began with isometric training and then continued with aerobic exercise on a treadmill. After exercise, he ate 2 kiwi ( Actinidia deliciosa) fruits. He experienced a swelling of the lips after eating the fruit, followed by an itchy scalp and a swollen face. Approximately 60 min later, the symptoms worsened: the patient suffered from generalized hives, general weakness and a \"rumbling\" sensation in ears. The patient's condition improved upon the consumption of antihistamines. However, the swelling of the face persisted for 24 h despite previously eating a kiwi without any side effects. By means of diagnostics based on allergen components, an allergy to grass allergen components, especially timothy grass—Phl p 1, Phl p 2 and Phl p 5, was confirmed. The presence of IgE that is specific for Act d 2 kiwi was also found. The patient had an oral food challenge with kiwi fruit at rest and after exercise provocation test. The challenge was negative at rest and positive after exercise. A food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis gathered with a kiwi sensitization was diagnosed. Conclusion To our knowledge, this case is the first report of a kiwi-allergic patient in whom exercise was a necessary cofactor to induce an anaphylactic reaction.",

While several studies proposed a cause-and-effect relationship between allergy and chronic sinusitis, several others reported the lack of any existing association. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between allergy and sinusitis.We conducted a cross-sectional study using a representative sample of the US population from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005‒2006 (n = 7244). A self-reported allergy questionnaire and total and allergen-specific IgE levels were used for analysis. Participants were divided into positive and negative allergy symptoms groups (PAS, NAS, respectively) to eliminate the influence of allergy symptoms on the apparent incidence of sinusitis. Pearson's chi-square test and the linear regression analysis using Durbin Watson test were used for statistical analysis.Sinusitis incidence in the PAS group (22.4%; 521/2327) was significantly higher than that in the NAS group (7.1%; 348/4917) [odds ratios (OR) = 3.788, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.272‒4.384, P < 0.001]. sinusitis incidence in non-sensitized and sensitized groups was not statistically different. After controlling for allergy symptoms, there was a negative correlation between sensitization status and the occurrence of sinusitis in the PAS group (OR = 1.407, 95% CI 1.156‒1.711, P < 0.01). Increase in serum total IgE levels correlated with decrease in incidence of sinusitis in both PAS and NAS groups. sinusitis incidence was significantly reduced in the PAS group in participants sensitized to allergens such as cockroaches, ragweed, ryegrass, Bermuda grass, oak, birch, and thistle.Allergy is related to sinusitis incidence. It is likely that sensitization status could reduce the incidence of sinusitis, albeit in an antigen-specific manner.",

    "abstract": "The knowledge of general practitioner(s) (GPs) regarding food allergy and anaphylaxis and practices in the prescription of epinephrine auto-injector(s) (EAIs) among GPs has previously only been studied using questionnaires and hypothetical cases. Therefore, there are currently no data as to whether or not GPs prescribe EAIs to high risk food-allergic patients presenting to primary care practices. The aim of this study was therefore to describe and evaluate practice in EAI prescription by GPs to food-allergic patients in The Netherlands. Patients aged 12–23 years who consulted their GP for allergic symptoms were identified in a primary care database. Patients were classified as probably or unlikely to be food-allergic. A risk factor assessment was done to identify probably food-allergic patients at high risk for anaphylaxis to assess the need for an EAI. One hundred forty-eight out of 1015 patients consulted their GP for allergic symptoms due to food. Eighty patients were excluded from analysis because of incomplete records. Thirty-four patients were classified as probably food-allergic. Twenty-seven of them were considered high risk patients and candidates for an EAI. Importantly, only 10 of them had actually been prescribed an EAI by their GP. This study shows that high risk food-allergic patients that visit their GPs are often not prescribed an EAI. Thus, previously identified low rates of EAI ownership may be partly due to GPs not prescribing this medication to patients for whom it would be appropriate to do so. These data suggest that there is a need for improvement of the quality of care for high risk food-allergic patients in primary care.",

Despite our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which lymphocytes are activated, we know little about the physiological mechanisms. T-lymphocytes predominantly express delayed rectifier K+-channels (Kv1.3) in their plasma membranes and these channels play crucial roles in inducing the lymphocyte activation and proliferation. In the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), these channels, which are overexpressed in proliferating lymphocytes within the inflamed organs, are responsible for the progression of the diseases. Since the over-activation of cellular immunity is also mainly involved in the pathogenesis of COPD, this disease could share similar pathophysiological features as those of CKD or IBD. From a literature review including ours, it is highly likely that the Kv1.3-channels are overexpressed or over-activated in T-lymphocytes isolated from patients with COPD, and that the overexpression of the channels would contribute to the development or progression of COPD. The involvement of the channels leads to novel therapeutic implications of potentially useful Kv1.3-channel inhibitors, such as calcium channel blockers, macrolide antibiotics, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, in the treatment of COPD.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Pollen food allergy syndrome (PFAS) is an immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated reaction that causes oropharyngeal pruritus or angioedema due to homologous proteins present in the culprit food as well as a sensitizing aeroallergen. This cross-reactivity has been well established between pollen and fruits/vegetables. Given the evolutionary similarity between all fungi; cross-reactivity between spore forming microfungi and edible macrofungi have been suggested, however only a limited number of case reports have ever been published on this phenomenon. We present a case of a patient who experiences pollen food allergy syndrome-like symptoms following lightly cooked mushroom ingestion who otherwise was able to tolerate cooked mushrooms. We then review the literature to highlight the limited studies of an underrecognized PFAS cross-reactivity between molds and mushrooms. Case presentation A 15-year-old male presents with symptoms of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis was found to have multiple environmental sensitizations to molds via skin prick testing ( C. gramineum , A. Pullulans and B. cinerea ) and ImmunoCAP serum-specific IgE ( A. alternata , C. herbarum , and P. notatum ). He developed throat pruritus and subjective throat tightness following ingestion of mushroom containing pizza. ImmunoCAP serum specific IgE to whole mushroom was negative but fresh food prick testing to fresh portobello mushroom and cremini mushroom were both positive with a negative test to canned mushroom. The patient then underwent a graded oral challenge and successfully tolerated canned mushrooms. Conclusion This case highlights the potential cross-reactivity between microfungi aeroallergens and edible fungi, leading to PFAS-like reactions in susceptible individuals. The patient’s ability to tolerate canned mushrooms suggests a possible heat-labile protein as the cause of the reaction, similar to PFAS patients tolerating cooked but not raw fruits/vegetables. Positive skin prick test to both spore-forming fungi and edible fungi with negative and whole mushroom IgE results further support the hypothesis of cross-reactivity and sensitization. Further research is needed to identify the specific allergenic proteins involved in these cross-reactions and the susceptible species of mold and mushroom. Understanding these components will contribute to improved diagnosis and management of mold and mushroom allergies, and enhance our knowledge of allergenic cross-reactivity in general.",

Methods Our pilot intervention was a proactive penicillin allergy de-labeling program for new inpatients with penicillin allergy. Patients deemed appropriate for a challenge with a low-risk penicillin allergy history were administered 250 mg amoxicillin and monitored for 1 h. We performed an explorative economic evaluation using various healthcare professional wages. Results Over two separate 2-week periods between April 2021 and March 2022, we screened 126 new inpatients with a penicillin allergy. After exclusions, 55 were appropriate for formal assessment. 19 completed the oral challenge, and 12 were directly de-labeled, resulting in a number needed to screen of 4 and a number needed to assess of 1.8 to effectively de-label one patient. The assessor’s median time in the hospital per day de-labeling was 4h08 with a range of (0h05, 6h45). A single-site annual implementation would result in 715 penicillin allergy assessments with 403 patients de-labeled assuming 20,234 annual weekday admissions and an 8.9% penicillin allergy rate. Depending on the assessor used, the annual cost of administration would be between $21,476 ($53.29 per effectively de-labeled patient) for a pharmacy technician and $61,121 ($151.67 per effectively de-labeled patient) for a Nurse Practitioner or Physician Assistant. Conclusion A proactive approach, including a direct oral challenge for low-risk in-patients with penicillin allergy, appears safe and feasible. Similar programs could be implemented at other institutions across Canada to increase access to allergy assessment.",

Objective To describe the perceived causes of AD-associated maternal sleep disturbances and the association between AD severity and infant sleep outcomes. Methods Mothers with infants aged &lt; 19 months old with a diagnosis of AD were recruited from social media and medical clinics in Winnipeg, Canada between October 2021 and May 2022. Infant AD severity was classified using maternal-reported data on the Patient-Oriented Scoring Atopic Dermatitis tool (PO-SCORAD). Quantitative data were collected via a series of questionnaires with a subset of mothers subsequently completing semi-structured interviews. Quantitative and qualitative data were integrated in the discussion. Results Mothers of infants with moderate/severe AD (6/12) were more likely to report their infant suffering from a higher degree of sleeplessness (i.e., ≥ 5 on a scale of 0–10) over the past 48 h compared to mothers of infants with mild AD (0/18). This was supported by qualitative findings where mothers described how their infant’s sleep quality and quantity worsened with AD severity. Additionally, 7/32 mothers reported that their child’s AD, regardless of severity, disturbed their sleep. Maternal sleep loss was most commonly attributed to infant itching (6/7), followed by worry (4/7). Conclusion Infantile AD severity was associated with worse sleep outcomes for both mothers and infants. We propose that maternal and infantile sleep quality and quantity can be improved by reducing AD severity through adherence to topical treatments.",

For each cohort, the date of the qualifying claim was the index date. SCS users were further stratified by SCS use during each quarter of follow-up: low (≤ 6 mg/day), medium (&gt; 6–12 mg/day), high (&gt; 12 mg/day), and continuous high (≥ 20 mg/day for 90 days). SCS-related complications were evaluated in the quarter following SCS exposure. The adjusted odds ratios (OR) of experiencing SCS-related complications during follow-up in each of the SCS use groups versus the non/burst SCS cohort were calculated using generalized estimating equations models. Results SCS and non/burst-SCS use cohorts included 7473 and 89,281 patients (mean follow-up: 24.6 and 24.2 months), respectively. Compared with the non/burst-SCS use cohort, medium, high, and continuous high SCS use was associated with greater odds of any SCS-related complication (adjusted OR [95% confidence interval]: 1.30 [1.21, 1.39], 1.49 [1.35, 1.64] and 1.63 [1.40, 1.89], respectively) including increased acute gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and immune system-related complications, and chronic cardiovascular, metabolic/endocrine, central nervous system, bone-/muscle-related, ophthalmologic, and hematologic/oncologic complications. Low-dose SCS use was also associated with significantly increased odds of acute gastrointestinal and immune system-related complications, and chronic bone-/muscle-related and hematologic/oncologic complications versus the non/burst-SCS use cohort. Conclusion SCS use, even at low doses, is associated with increased risk of SCS-related complications among patients with severe asthma.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Diet restrictions and fear of adverse reactions put a significant burden on the nutrition, growth and life style of children and adults with food allergies. While various disease-modifying options are pursued, there are so far no published clinical data on immunotherapy for crustaceans. The efficacy and safety of desensitization to crustaceans by means of sublingual immunotherapy is assessed for the first time in this study with a view of validating it as a clinical-practice modality. Methods Charts of a Midwest Allergy-Immunology practice from the period January 2014–June 2023 were reviewed to identify patients with allergy to shrimp treated with sublingual immunotherapy and to retrospectively evaluate their responses to oral challenge. Results Sixty-six patients were identified who had been treated by sublingual immunotherapy for either systemic or localized reactions to shrimp. Demographics and relevant comorbidities were consistent with those of the atopic population. Sublingual immunotherapy with serially diluted mixtures was initiated at 64–320 ng/dose and was gradually escalated to 0.5 mg/dose three times a day. The sublingual immunotherapy course ranged from 5 to 72 months (average: 51 months), following which, 18 patients underwent shrimp oral challenge. No systemic reactions occurred upon challenge; no patient required epinephrine. Tolerance of target dose equal to or exceeding 42 g shrimp was achieved in 11 patients (61%), seven of whom had originally presented with systemic reactions to crustaceans. Seven patients (38%) developed one or more of the following localized reactions: oral itching, nasal symptoms, localized perioral hives, localized hives at pressure points, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain upon exposure to a cumulative dose of 39.2–148.2 g of shrimp during the 4 h of the challenge. Five of these patients had originally presented with systemic reactions to crustaceans. Five of the 7 patients who developed localized symptoms during the challenge were subsequently placed on routine exposure to 12–20 g shrimp every other day. Two patients continued sublingual immunotherapy but declined routine exposure to shrimp every other day because they had no intention to incorporate crustaceans to their routine diet. On repeat challenge 6–9 months after original challenge, all five patients who had routine exposure to 12–20 g shrimp every other day tolerated the procedure to target dose without any symptoms. Conclusions Desensitization to shrimp by sublingual immunotherapy appears to be safe and effective as shown in this study. Whether the immune modification induced by sublingual immunotherapy is permanent resulting in sustained tolerance, or the achieved degree of desensitization depends on regular exposure is not known; therefore, following challenge, regular consumption three-four times per week was recommended.",

Methods The expression level of miR-155 in the skin tissues of patients with CSU and experimental rats were detected by RT-qPCR, followed by the measurement of the histamine release rate in the serum through the histamine release test. Besides, hematoxylin &amp; eosin staining was used to observe the pathological changes of the skin tissues; Corresponding detection kits and flow cytometry to measure the changes of immunoglobulins, inflammatory cytokines and T cell subsets in the serum of rats in each group; and western blot to check the expression level of proteins related to JAK/STAT signaling pathway in the skin tissues. Results Knockdown of miR-155 reduced the number and duration of pruritus, alleviated the skin damage, and decreased the number of eosinophils in CSU rats. Moreover, knockdown of miR-155 elevated the serum levels of IgG and IgM, decreased the levels of IgA and inflammatory cytokines, and reduced the proportion of CD4 + and CD4 + CD25 + T cells, as well as the CD4+/CD8 + ratio in CSU rats. However, Tyr705 intervention could reverse the effects of knockdown of miR-155 on CSU model rats. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of miR-155 significantly reduced the protein expression of IRF-9, as well as the P-JAK2/JAK2 and P-STAT3/STAT3 ratios in the skin tissues of CSU rats. Conclusion Knockdown of miR-155 can alleviate skin damage and inflammatory responses and relieve autoimmunity in CSU rats by inhibiting the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway.",

Asthma exacerbations significantly increase the disease burden, necessitating new therapeutic approaches. Emerging evidence suggests probiotics, through the gut-lung axis, may benefit asthma management by modulating immune responses and reducing inflammation. Methods This systematic review and meta-analysis adhered to PRISMA guidelines and was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023480098). A comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase was conducted up to March 2024. Inclusion criteria encompassed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating probiotic interventions in asthma patients. Statistical analysis was done using RevMan 5.3, with odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) calculated, and heterogeneity assessed using I 2 statistics. Results Twelve RCTs, comprising 1401 participants, met the inclusion criteria. The probiotic strains investigated included various Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species. Meta-analysis revealed significant improvements in asthma control test scores (OR 1.18, 95% CI: 1.18–3.64, p = 0.0001) following probiotic supplementation. Probiotics also improved fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) in one study, but pooled FeNO and eosinophil data were not statistically significant (p = 0.46 and p = 0.29, respectively). One study observed fewer asthma exacerbations in the probiotic group (24/212) compared to placebo (67/210), with no difference in exacerbation duration. Conclusion Probiotic supplementation may be beneficial in improving asthma symptom control with no significant impact on lung function indices or eosinophil levels. Probiotics can be a potential adjunctive therapy in asthma management, particularly for asthma symptom control.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is a potentially disease-modifying therapy that is effective for the treatment of allergic rhinitis/conjunctivitis, allergic asthma and stinging insect hypersensitivity. The decision to proceed with AIT should be made on a case-by-case basis, based on a comprehensive evaluation of the patient, allergy testing and a thorough discussion with the patient about treatment goals, risks vs. benefits, and long-term commitment to the treatment plan. For those with allergic rhinitis and/or asthma, it is also important to consider individual patient factors, such as the degree to which symptoms can be reduced by avoidance measures and pharmacological therapy, the amount and type of medication required to control symptoms, the adverse effects of pharmacological treatment, and patient preferences. Since AIT is associated with a risk of anaphylaxis, it should only be prescribed by physicians who are adequately trained in the treatment of allergic conditions. Furthermore, for subcutaneous therapy, injections must be given under medical supervision in clinics that are equipped to manage anaphylaxis. In this article, we review the indications and contraindications, patient selection criteria, and details regarding the administration, safety and efficacy of AIT for allergens other than foods. Immunotherapy for food allergy will be discussed in the Oral Immunotherapy article in this supplement.",

It has a great impact on patients' quality of life. In spite of this prevalence and morbidity, we are only beginning to understand its physiopathology and we do not have a curative treatment. Moreover, a patient with chronic urticaria may undergo extensive laboratory evaluations seeking a cause only to be frustrated when none is found. In recent years there have been significant advances in our understanding of some of the molecular mechanisms responsible for hive formation. The presence and probable role of IgG autoantibodies directed against epitopes expressed on the alpha-chain of the IgE receptor and to lesser extent, to IgE in a subset of patients is generally acknowledged. These autoantibodies activate complement to release C5a, which augments histamine release, and IL4 and leukotriene C4 are released as well. A perivascular cellular infiltrate results without predominance of either Th1 or Th2 lymphocyte subpopulations. Basophils of all chronic urticaria patients (autoimmune or idiopathic) are hyperresponsive to serum, regardless of source, but poorly responsive to anti IgE. In this review we will summarize the recent contributions to this field and try to provide insights to possible future directions for research on this disease.",

Recent studies have suggested that the recognition of subphenotypes of airway disease based on the pattern of airway inflammation may be particularly useful in increasing our understanding of the disease. The use of non-invasive markers of airway inflammation has suggested the presence of four distinct phenotypes: eosinophilic, neutrophilic, mixed inflammatory and paucigranulocytic asthma. Recent studies suggest that these subgroups may differ in their etiology, immunopathology and response to treatment. Importantly, novel treatment approaches targeted at specific patterns of airway inflammation are emerging, making an appreciation of subphenotypes particularly relevant.

The article that dealt with mast cells suggested that the presence of these important cells within the smooth muscle layer in asthmatic airways renders this cell type primal in asthma and an obvious and important target for therapy. This article proposes that in a complex inflammatory milieu characterizing the complex syndromes we call asthma, no single cell phenotype is responsible for the condition and thus should be a sole target for therapeutic strategies. Our reductionist approach to research in asthma and related conditions has provided us with convincing evidence for multiple roles that immune, inflammatory, and structural cell types can play in complex diseases. The next stage in understanding and ameliorating these complex conditions is to move away from the simplistic notion of one cell type being more important than another. Instead, what is needed is to acquire knowledge of intricate and exquisite biological systems that regulate such conditions in both health and disease involving various cell types, mediators, pharmacologically active products, their multifaceted capacities, and their socio-biological networking.",

OPN expression in the nasal mucosa was examined with immunohistochemistry. Healthy non-AR controls (n = 5) were used as a comparator.OPN expression was detected in epithelial cells, subepithelial infiltrating/inflammatory cells and cells lining the vessels and glands of all subjects. Comparison of the pre- and peak-pollen season biopsy sections in placebo treated patients revealed no increase in OPN expression during the grass pollen season (5.7% vs 6.4%). Treatment with a local glucocorticosteroid did not alter the expression of OPN during pollen exposure (6.2% vs 6.7%).OPN has been increasingly associated with the pathogenesis of various Th2-mediated diseases. However, our finding that the OPN expression in the nasal mucosa of AR patients is not significantly affected by allergen exposure and is comparable to that of the healthy controls, suggests that intracellular OPN is not directly involved in the pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis.",

Early life antibiotic use is one factor which may contribute to immune dysfunction and the recent surge in allergies by virtue of its effects on gut microbiota.As a first step towards determining whether a relationship exists between perinatal antibiotic induced changes in the gut microbiota and the later development of a peanut allergy, we exposed newborn mice to either the broad-spectrum antibiotic vancomycin or to a vehicle for 6 weeks and then used a novel murine model of peanut allergy.Early-life treatment with vancomycin resulted in a significant shift in the gut microbiota community characterized by a reduction in the abundance of firmicutes and preponderance of inflammatory proteobacteria. Mice with an antibiotic-altered microbiota, showed a localized allergic-like response characterized by ear swelling and scratching following intra-dermal peanut antigen challenge. Likewise, circulating IgE levels were increased in antibiotic-treated mice, but no evidence of a systemic allergic or anaphylactic-like response was observed. Importantly, we utilized the naturally occurring pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), rather than the more commonly used cholera toxin, as an adjuvant together with the peanut antigen.Our data suggest that early antibiotic exposure promotes a shift in the gut microbiota community that may in turn, influence how mice later respond to a TNF-α + antigen challenge. However, further studies verifying the capacity of microbiota restoration to protect against allergic responses will be needed to confirm a causal role of antibiotic-induced microbiota variations in promoting allergic disease phenotypes.",

We sought to investigate whether aberrant FOXJ1 localizations correlate with the disease severity and the co-existence of allergic rhinitis (AR) or asthma in patients with nasal polyps (NPs).We elucidated localization patterns of FOXJ1 by performing immunofluorescence assays in nasal specimens and cytospin samples from controls and patients with NPs. We also assayed mRNA expression levels of FOXJ1 by using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Four localization patterns [normal (N), intermediate (I), mislocalization (M), and absence (A)] were defined. A semi-quantitative scoring system was applied for demonstrating FOXJ1 localization in five areas per paraffin section, with individual sections being scored between 0 and 2.FOXJ1 localization score was significantly higher in samples from NPs than in controls (P < 0.001). Elevated FOXJ1 localization scores and down-regulation of FOXJ1 mRNA levels were observed in NPs with co-existing AR or asthma (all P < 0.05). Moreover, FOXJ1 localization scores positively correlated with Lund-Mackay score (r = 0.362, P = 0.007).

    "abstract": "Chorioamnionitis is a risk factor for future asthma development. Animal models of chorioamnionitis demonstrate increased TH17-to-Treg ratios associated with proinflammatory cytokine elevations. The association of chorioamnionitis on human neonatal immune cells systemically and within tissues is not known. We enrolled two cohorts to evaluate TH17 and regulatory T cell (Treg) phenotypic markers in chorioamnionitis. From a cohort of 19 live birth infants, we collected cord blood and placenta samples to evaluate for signs of acute and chronic histologic inflammation and cell phenotype characterization. We analyzed a second cohort of stillborn infants with and without chorioamnionitis to classify and enumerate cell infiltrate phenotypes in the spleen, thymus, and lung. We used linear regression analysis determine the association of retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gamma t positive (RORγt+) and Treg cell frequency with different types of inflammation seen in the live cohort subjects. Using linear mixed models, we evaluated for any associations between chorioamnionitis and T- and B-cell with a logarithmic scale for level of expression of cellular markers. We then performed Wilcoxon rank sum tests to assess the associations between cell count and chorioamnionitis. In the live birth subjects with chronic placental inflammation we observed an increased proportion of RORγt+ cells in Foxp3+ cells, regardless of the presence of acute inflammation, compared to subjects with neither acute nor chronic inflammation. We also found an increased proportion of RORγt+ cells within Foxp3+ cells in subjects with acute high stage fetal and maternal inflammation compared to those without acute or chronic inflammation. In the stillborn subjects with chorioamnionitis, we observed a decrease in splenic Foxp3+ cells and an increase in lung CD3+ cells compared with subjects that did not have chorioamnionitis. Exposure to chorioamnionitis in utero may affect immune activation in neonates with an increased frequency of RORγt+ cells systemically as well as lymphocytic infiltrate in the lung. Our findings suggest an increase in RORγt+ cells during chorioamnionitis and thus may support the known associations between chorioamnionitis with asthma.",

    "abstract": "Daclizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks CD25, the high affinity alpha subunit of the interleukin-2 receptor. Daclizumab therapy targets T regulatory cell and activated effector T cell proliferation to suppress autoimmune disease activity, in inflammatory conditions like relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis. Here, we present the first report of agranulocytosis with daclizumab therapy in a patient with relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis. Our patient was a 24-year-old Australian female with a clinical history of atopy, lymphocytic enteritis complicated by B12 deficiency, relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis, recurrent lower respiratory tract infections, vulval/cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and melanoma. She was commenced on daclizumab therapy after failing several lines of treatment for relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis. During a hospital admission for lymphocytic enteritis, she was incidentally diagnosed with combined immunodeficiency with hypogammaglobulinaemia and declined proposed regular intravenous immunoglobulin infusions. Following six months of daclizumab therapy, our patient presented to hospital with febrile neutropenia. No clear infective cause was found, despite numerous investigations. However, bone marrow biopsy revealed agranulocytosis with an apparent maturation block at the myeloblasts stage. Neustrophil recovery occurred following cessation of daclizumab and the initiation of T cell immunosuppressive agents including systemic corticosteroids and methotrexate. The patient was further investigated for combined immunodeficiency and whole exome sequencing revealed a novel heterozygous missense variant in cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4), leading to a diagnosis of CTLA-4 haploinsufficiency with autoimmune infiltration (CHAI). This case demonstrates that autoimmune disease may be the presenting feature of primary immunodeficiency and should be appropriately investigated prior to the commencement of immunotherapy. Genetic clarification of underlying primary immunodeficiency may provide critical clinical information that alters the safety of the proposed treatment strategy.",

    "abstract": "H1N1 is responsible for the first influenza pandemic in 41 years. In the fall of 2009, an H1N1 vaccine became available in Canada with the hopes of reducing the overall effect of the pandemic. The purpose of this study was to assess the safety of administering 2 different doses of a monovalent split virus 2009 H1N1 vaccine in egg allergic patients. Patients were skin tested to the H1N1 vaccine in the outpatient paediatric and adult allergy and immunology clinics of the Health Sciences Centre and Children's Hospital of Winnipeg, Manitoba Canada. Individuals <9 years of age were administered 1.88 μg's of hem-agglutinin antigen per 0.25 ml dose and individuals ≥9 years were administered 3.75 μg's of hemagglutinin antigen per 0.5 ml dose. Upon determination of a negative skin test, the vaccine was administered with a 30 minute observation period. A total of 61 patients with egg allergy (history of an allergic reaction to egg with either positive skin test &/or specific IgE to egg >0.35 Ku/L) were referred to our allergy clinics for skin testing to the H1N1 vaccine. 2 patients were excluded, one did not have a skin prick test to the H1N1 vaccine (only vaccine administration) and the other passed an egg challenge during the study period. Ages ranged from 1 to 27 years (mean 5.6 years). There were 41(69.5%) males and 18(30.5%) females. All but one patient with a history of egg allergy, positive skin test to egg and/or elevated specific IgE level to egg had negative skin tests to the H1N1 vaccine. The 58 patients with negative skin testing to the H1N1 vaccine were administered the vaccine and observed for 30 minutes post vaccination with no adverse results. The patient with the positive skin test to the H1N1 vaccine was also administered the vaccine intramuscularly with no adverse results. Despite concern regarding possible anaphylaxis to the H1N1 vaccine in egg allergic patients, in our case series 1/59(1.7%) patients with sensitization to egg were also sensitized to the H1N1 vaccine. Administration of the H1N1 vaccine in egg allergic patients with negative H1N1 skin tests and observation is safe. Administering the vaccine in a 1 or 2 dose protocol without skin testing is a reasonable alternative as per the CSACI guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Atopic asthma is characterized by intermittent exacerbations triggered by exposure to allergen. Exacerbations are characterized by an acute inflammatory reaction in the airways, with recruitment of both innate and adaptive immune cells. These cell populations as well as soluble factors are critical for initiating and controlling the inflammatory processes in allergic asthma. Detailed data on the numbers and types of cells recruited following allergen challenge is lacking. In this paper we present an extensive phenotypic analysis of the inflammatory cell infiltrate present in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid following bronchoscopically directed allergen challenge in mild atopic asthmatics. Methods A re-analysis of pooled data obtained prior to intervention in our randomized, placebo controlled, double blinded study (costimulation inhibition in asthma trial [CIA]) was performed. Twenty-four subjects underwent bronchoscopically directed segmental allergen challenge followed by BAL collection 48 hours later. The BAL fluid was analyzed by multi-color flow cytometry for immune cell populations and multi-plex ELISA for cytokine detection. Results Allergen instillation induced pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6) and immune modulating cytokines (IL-2, IFN-γ, and IL-10) along with an increase in lymphocytes and suppressor cells (Tregs and MDSC). Interestingly, membrane expression of CD30 was identified on lymphocytes, especially Tregs, but not eosinophils. Soluble CD30 was also detected in the BAL fluid after allergen challenge in adult atopic asthmatics. Conclusions After segmental allergen challenge of adult atopic asthmatics, cell types associated with a pro-inflammatory as well as an anti-inflammatory response are detected within the BAL fluid of the lung.",

    "abstract": "Mastocytosis are rare diseases characterized by an accumulation of clonal mast cells (MCs) in one or multiple organs or tissues. Patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM), whose MCs frequently arbor the activating D816V KIT mutation, may have indolent to aggressive diseases, and they may experience MC mediator related symptoms. Indolent SM with recurrent anaphylaxis or vascular collapse in the absence of skin lesions, ISMs(-), is a specific subtype indolent SM (ISM), and this clonal MC activation disorder represents a significant fraction of all MC activation syndromes. The V560G KIT mutation is extremely rare in patients with SM and its biological and prognostic impact remains unknown.A 15-year old boy was referred to our hospital because of repeated episodes of flushing, hypotension and syncope since the age of 3-years, preceded by skin lesions compatible with mastocytosis on histopathology that had disappeared in the late-early childhood. Diagnosis of ISM, more precisely the ISMs(-) variant, was confirmed based on the clinical manifestations together with increased baseline serum tryptase levels and the presence of morphologically atypical, mature appearing (CD117+high, FcεRI+) phenotypically aberrant (CD2+, CD25+) MCs, expressing activation-associated markers (CD63, CD69), in the bone marrow. Molecular genetic studies revealed the presence of the KIT V560G mutation in bone marrow MCs, but not in other bone marrow cells, whereas the screening for mutations in codon 816 of KIT was negative. The patient was treated with oral disodium cromoglycate and the disease had a favorable outcome after an eleven-year follow-up period, during which progressively lower serum tryptase levels together with the fully disappearance of all clinical manifestations was observed.To the best of our knowledge this first report of a patient with ISM, whose bone marrow MCs carry the KIT V560G activating mutation, manifesting as recurrent spontaneous episodes of flushing and vascular collapse in the absence of skin lesions at the time of diagnosis, in whom disodium cromoglycate had led to long term clinical remission.",

    "abstract": "Allergic, especially anaphylactic, reactions during immunoglobulin replacement therapy are rare, but their pathophysiology and classification remain ambiguous. Recent findings show positive results of skin tests with commercially available immunoglobulins, but target antigens and responsible compounds of the tested immunoglobulins have not been strictly identified.Four adult patients with recently diagnosed common variable immunodeficiency qualified for standard subcutaneous immunoglobulin replacement therapy regimen. They had no history of receiving immunoglobulins, blood or blood product transfusions. Edema, confluent wheals and erythema were observed at the site of subcutaneous immunoglobulin infusion: typical early and late phase reaction. A transient increase in various passively transferred IgG and IgE antibodies was responsible for misleading positive outcome of the serological testing for active humoral response such as type I allergy, anti-Rh, isohemagglutinins and rheumatoid factor (RF). Although the clinical presentation was very unusual and severe, the retrospective analysis showed no isohemagglutinins, RF and IgE in the patients' serum before but it was positive after the infusion (median IgE = 18 IU/ml, RF = 8 IU/ml). Type I allergic reaction (laryngeal edema, rhinoconjuctivitis) came out at +14 days of replacement therapy when the patient visited countryside. In the second patient anaphylactic reaction was observed 5 days after ScIg administration, and only when the patient consumed peanuts. Therefore, IgE concentration was measured retrospectively in a series of commercial preparations used in the initial subcutaneous immunoglobulin replacement therapy that caused the adverse event (AE) and it was determined between 138 and 232 IU/ml (kU/l), i.e. 690-2100 IU per g of protein. Specific IgE was within a wide range from 198 (mix of food) to 2809 kUA/l (mix of grass) but many of the tested allergen-specific IgE were class 2 or 3 (i.e. 0.71-17.5 kUA/l).The case resembles passive cutaneous anaphylaxis and Prausnitz-Küstner reaction but clinical significance of the classical phenomena has not yet been described. This observation indicates that anaphylactic reactions during immunoglobulin replacement therapy may result from IgE or pathological IgG content. Such IgE presence was sporadically reported (34.5-105 IU/ml, i.e. 862.5-1450 IU/g of protein) in intravenous immunoglobulins that are used and monitored by healthcare professionals. In clinical practice the definition of adverse events is inadequate since individual batches of immunoglobulins come with different specificity therefore, they should be classified as transfusion products (not bioequivalents). Such new approach implies establishing (1) new control methods and strategies to ensure introduction of the safety regulations for subcutaneous home self-administration of immunoglobulins as well as (2) guidelines for the prevention of anaphylaxis in patients receiving immunoglobulins (for example peanut).",

He was initially treated with intravenous cyclophosphamide and high-dose prednisolone followed by maintenance treatment consisting of azathioprine and prednisolone.

Multivariate analyses were performed to determine the prevalence of adverse food reactions and their associated symptoms.459 subjects, with an average age of 32 years old, completed the questionnaire; 45.3% were male.

Peach and nectarine were also shown to be common causative foods with 6.8% of the study group showing an adverse reaction to peach and 5.2% to nectarine. Seafood mainly caused skin symptoms and fruits gave rise to more throat, oral, and gastrointestinal problems.The prevalence of adverse food reactions is high for patients with respiratory diseases.

Several controlled clinical studies demonstrated the effectiveness of BT on clinical outcomes, particularly the reduction of asthma exacerbations. During procedure or shortly after, significant but transient respiratory adverse events have been reported.We describe the case of a male, caucasian, 56-year-old, non-smoker patient with non-allergic severe asthma. A few days after the second BT session performed in the left lower lobe, persistent haemoptysis appeared requiring patient hospitalization. A chest CT scan showed mild varicoid bronchiectasis and distal parenchymal infiltrate in the basal anterior segment of the left lower lobe. At fibreoptic bronchoscopy two small nodular neoformations were observed in sub-segmental areas of the same lobe. Histological examination showed mild non-specific inflammation of bronchial mucosa, and some large fragments of peribronchial pulmonary parenchyma with an area of haemorrhagic necrosis. The patient was treated empirically with co-amoxiclav, azithromycin and prednisone. A new chest CT showed a complete resolution of the parenchymal opacity. Finally, the patient underwent the third session of BT, without recurrence of haemoptysis or radiological changes.Bronchial thermoplasty is a generally safe procedure. To our knowledge this is the first report of necrosis of the treated bronchus and haemoptysis complicating BT after the second session. The pulmonary damage was most likely determined by a thermal shock induced by BT. One hypothesis could be a structural fragility of the treated bronchus, possibly related to bronchiectasis. A technical malfunction of the BT controller or the catheter, causing an excessive energy delivery could not be excluded. Adverse events following BT deserve particular attention but should not discourage clinicians from the application of this promising procedure.",

    "abstract": "Sweet syndrome is a rare skin condition characterised by fever, neutrophilia, and tender erythematous skin lesions and has been reported to occur in association with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) as well as complicate treatment with azathioprine therapy. Azathioprine, a relatively safe immunosuppressive, is frequently used to maintain disease remission in the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis. The occurrence of Sweet syndrome in a patient with ANCA-positive vasculitis and following treatment with azathioprine prompted us to present this clinical case and share this unusually rare occurrence. In doing so, we also wish to discuss current understanding of the disease and plausible associations. Herein, we discuss the case of a 54-year old white male, who presented with features of ANCA vasculitis with haemoptysis, arthralgia, abnormal kidney function with active urine sediment and a positive p-ANCA titre. Standard immunosuppressive treatment with corticosteroids and intravenous rituximab resulted in disease remission. Due to significant steroid side effects, his steroid treatment was gradually tapered and switched to azathioprine over a 6-month period. Two weeks following initiation of azathioprine, he developed a painful maculo-papular erythematous skin rash and fever. A skin biopsy confirmed classical features consistent with Sweet syndrome. Withdrawal of azathioprine and treatment with oral corticosteroids and colchicine therapy resulted in complete resolution of the rash, although he continued to have high titres of MPO positive ANCA. Sweet syndrome is a rare adverse reaction to azathioprine but has also been reported to occur in association with ANCA vasculitis. The temporal association with azathioprine in our case and the relatively rapid resolution of the skin vasculitis upon its withdrawal suggested a primarily drug-induced reaction rather than an associated feature of ANCA vasculitis.",

There are two major species of ginseng, Panax ginseng (Korean or Asian ginseng), and Panax quinquefolius (American ginseng). Although cases of allergy due to Korean ginseng have been reported in adults, there are no reported cases of allergy to American ginseng, and no reported cases of ginseng allergy in pediatric patients. We present two unique cases of pediatric patients with suspected allergic reactions to American ginseng. The first patient is a 6-year-old girl who presented to the emergency department in anaphylaxis (urticaria and respiratory symptoms) minutes after inhaling powdered American ginseng. There was evidence of sensitization to American ginseng on skin prick testing (SPT) (13 × 12 mm wheal) and evidence of allergy to American ginseng on basophil activation testing, with a dose-dependent increase in expression of CD63 on basophils in response to American ginseng extract. The second patient is a 3-year-old boy who presented with recurrent allergic conjunctivitis upon exposure to aerosolized powdered ginseng, with evidence of sensitization to American ginseng on SPT (13 × 7 mm wheal), but with no evidence of IgE-mediated allergic reaction during oral challenge with American ginseng powder. These cases highlight two different allergic responses to American ginseng in pediatric patients. To our knowledge, these are the first reported cases of allergy to American ginseng, in addition to the first reported cases of allergy to ginseng in pediatric patients.",

    "abstract": "Patients presenting to Accident and Emergency (A&E) facilities with dyspnoea, coughing, wheezing and nasal blockage are presumed to have allergic asthma and/or rhinitis. Occupational asthma (OA), which has similar symptoms is rarely considered. Triggers of OA include exposure to diesel engine exhaust emissions exposure (DEEEE) that are carcinogenic. We report the case of a patient who presented to an A&E facility with asthma-like symptoms, was treated for allergic asthma. Frequent exacerbations were experienced. Upon investigations it was shown that were symptoms triggered by DEEE exposure.A 36-year-old female bank employee was referred for the evaluation of suspected asthma. She reported a 3-month history of symptoms suggestive of asthma and rhinitis, for which she had previously required A&E treatment. There was no history of atopy. The symptoms only occurred at work or after work. Their onset had coincided with changing offices to one located proximal to a diesel-powered electricity generator. A diagnosis of asthma had been made at the A&E facility and the appropriately used inhaled fluticasone and salbutamol provided limited relief. Skin prick testing was weakly positive for seasonal pollen and house dust mite allergens. Allergen specific IgE tests for 16 regionally relevant aeroallergens were negative. Tests to exclude connective tissue diseases were positive for the anti-Ro-52/TRIM-21 autoantibody. Baseline spirometry values were markedly reduced and bronchodilator administration showed limited reversibility, FEV1 (+ 8%), PEF (+ 5%). Following a 10-day discontinuation of work exposure, the symptoms abated and FEV1 and PEF increased by 10-14% from baseline. The recent onset of asthma, in a non-atopic adult, with workday related symptoms and improvement upon discontinuation of exposure were attributed to passive occupational exposure to DEEE. The diesel generator was relocated, a short course of inhaled fluticasone and oral prednisolone was prescribed and symptoms resolved. This is the first report of the health effects of DEEE mimicking asthma and rhinitis in Zimbabwe.Atypical presentations of adult onset asthma in the absence of a history of either atopy or allergen specific IgE antibody sensitization should trigger in-depth evaluation of occupational exposure in all cases including office workers. Serial monitoring of lung function values should be used for diagnostic and monitoring of the patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background There is interest in better understanding vessel pathology in asthma, given the findings of loss of peripheral vasculature associated with disease severity by imaging and altered markers of endothelial activation. To date, vascular changes in asthma have been described mainly at the submucosal capillary level of the bronchial microcirculation, with sparse information available on the pathology of bronchial and pulmonary arteries. The aim of this study was to describe structural and endothelial activation markers in bronchial arteries (BAs) and pulmonary arteries (PAs) of asthma patients who died during a fatal asthma attack. Methods Autopsy lung tissue was obtained from 21 smoking and non-smoking patients who died of an asthma attack and nine non-smoking control patients. Verhoeff–Masson trichrome staining was used to analyse the structure of arteries. Using immuno-histochemistry and image analyses, we quantified extracellular matrix (ECM) components (collagen I, collagen III, versican, tenascin, fibronectin, elastic fibres), adhesion molecules [vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1)] and markers of vascular tone/dysfunction [endothelin-1 (ET-1) and angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2)] in PAs and BAs. Results There were no significant differences in ECM components, ICAM-1, ET-1 or AT2 between asthma patients and controls. Smoking asthma patients presented with decreased content of collagen III in both BA (p = 0.046) and PA (p = 0.010) walls compared to non-smoking asthma patients. Asthma patients had increased VCAM-1 content in the BA wall (p = 0.026) but not in the PA wall. Conclusion Our data suggest that the mechanisms linking asthma and arterial functional abnormalities might involve systemic rather than local mediators. Loss of collagen III in the PA was observed in smoking asthma patients, and this was compatible with the degradative environment induced by cigarette smoking. Our data also reinforce the idea that the mechanisms of leukocyte efflux via adhesion molecules differ between bronchial and pulmonary circulation, which might be relevant to understanding and treating the distal lung in asthma.",

The aim of this study was to assess the level of control for asthma in adult patients, using a cross sectional study design. The assessment of control for asthma was based on the ACQ.We conducted a cross-sectional study to measure the level of control for asthma among patients with asthma who volunteered and were reporting to Chitungwiza Central Hospital. We interviewed and conducted spirometry (lung function testing) on 400 adult patients with asthma. We used the ACQ questions to interview patients. A trained health care provider performed spirometry using the Koko Legend spirometer after meeting all the ambient conditions as outlined in the American Thoracic Society guidelines.Our study assessed levels of asthma control among 400 adult patients with physician-diagnosed asthma. The results showed that 248 (62%) participants had uncontrolled asthma. The median age of the adult patients who had uncontrolled asthma was 35 years (IQR: 27-44). Using the clinical practice cut-point of 0.75 for controlled asthma, only 152 (38%) were controlled, while 72 (18.8%), 50 (12.5%) and 123 (30.7%) were mildly uncontrolled, moderately uncontrolled and very uncontrolled respectively. Among participants who were widowed had uncontrolled asthma (p = 0.003) while most of the married 103 (67.8%) had controlled asthma (p = 0.018). The findings of the study showed that all the items on the ACQ were significantly different in asthma mean scores (p ≤ 0.0001).We concluded that most asthma patients that participated in the study were uncontrolled. We therefore, recommend an evaluation of factors associated with poor asthma control in order to improve asthma care and achieve good asthma control outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Direct inhalation challenges (e.g. methacholine) are stated to be more sensitive and less specific for a diagnosis of asthma than are indirect challenges (e.g. exercise, non-isotonic aerosols, mannitol, etc.). However, data surrounding comparative sensitivity and specificity for methacholine compared to mannitol challenges are conflicting. When methacholine is inhaled by deep total lung capacity (TLC) inhalations, deep inhalation inhibition of bronchoconstriction leads to a marked loss of diagnostic sensitivity when compared to tidal breathing (TB) inhalation methods. We hypothesized that deep inhalation methacholine methods with resulting bronchoprotection may be the explanation for conflicting sensitivity/specificity data. Methods We reviewed 27 studies in which methacholine and mannitol challenges were performed in largely the same individuals. Methacholine was inhaled by dosimeter TLC methods in 13 studies and by tidal breathing in 14 studies. We compared the rates of positive methacholine (stratified by inhalation method) and mannitol challenges in both asthmatics and non-asthmatics. Results When methacholine was inhaled by TLC inhalations the prevalence of positive tests in asthmatics, 60.2% (548/910), was similar to mannitol, 58.9% (537/912). By contrast, when methacholine was inhaled by tidal breathing the prevalence of positive tests in asthmatics 83.1% (343/413) was more than double that of mannitol, 41.5% (146/351). In non-asthmatics, the two methacholine methods resulted in positive tests in 18.8% (142/756) and 16.2% (27/166) by TLC and TB inhalations respectively. This compares to an overall 8.3% (n = 76) positive rate for mannitol in 913 non-asthmatics. Conclusion These data support the hypothesis that the conflicting data comparing methacholine and mannitol sensitivity and specificity are due to the method of methacholine inhalation. Tidal breathing methacholine methods have a substantially greater sensitivity for a diagnosis of asthma than either TLC dosimeter methacholine challenge methods or mannitol challenge. Methacholine challenges should be performed by tidal breathing as per recent guideline recommendations. Methacholine (more sensitive) and mannitol (more specific) will thus have complementary diagnostic features.",

    "abstract": "Abstract MP-AzeFlu is relatively new a pharmaceutical drug used in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. It is comprised of azelastine hydrochloride (AZE), a potent histamine-H1-receptor antagonist and fluticasone propionate (FP), corticosteroid. It’s somewhat bitter taste (often considered a disadvantage) can be attributed to AZE. We here hypothesize that MP-AzeFlu may induce some of its beneficial effects through activation of bitter taste receptors (Tas2R), which have recently been described in human airways. In the nose Tas2Rs induce secretion of antimicrobial peptides and increase ciliary activity, while in the lung they cause airway smooth muscle relaxation. The mechanisms behind Tas2R-mediated effects are not yet fully known. In order to evaluate the role of Tas2R in the effects induced by MP-AzeFlu the dilatory response of pre-contracted isolated airways from Balb/c mice was investigated in tissue bath myographs in the presence or absence of various well-characterized pharmacological antagonists or their corresponding vehicles. MP-AzeFlu caused a potent dose-dependent relaxation of pre-contracted airways, an effect probably mediated by its AZE component. The dilatory effect of MP-AzeFlu and AZE both mimicked the response induced by the Tas2R agonist, chloroquine, but was independent of histamine receptor (H1-, H2- and H3-), prostaglandins, cAMP and cGMP involvement, all known to be common pathways for airway dilation. Other bitter-tasting antihistamines (i.e. olopatadine and desloratadine) also relaxed airway segments. These data support the notion that MP-AzeFlu has the ability to activate Tas2R in the same way as chloroquine. The effect appears to be mediated by AZE, but not via the histamine receptor. Activation of Tas2R by MP-AzeFlu may contribute to its superior efficacy over FP observed in controlled clinical trials in patients with moderate/severe allergic rhinitis.",

This study determined the sensitization profile of Filipinos to pollen using skin prick test (SPT) and pollen-specific ELISA. Methods Pollen from fifteen selected plant sources was collected and extracted for use in sensitization tests. Volunteers were interviewed for their clinical history prior to blood sampling and SPT. The blood samples collected were assessed using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Results The best panel of pollen allergens for the skin prick test was Mangifera indica (64%), Acacia auriculiformis (28%), Mimosa spp. (25%) Amaranthus spinosus (22%), Lantana camara (20%), Pilea microphylla (16%) and Dichanthium aristatum (15%). Young adults had more sensitizations to pollen than among early childhood and elderly. There were more allergic subjects that have rhinitis (61%) than asthma (42%) and atopic dermatitis (35%). Pollen-specific IgE levels show low percent reactivity as compared to the skin test with Cocos nucifera obtaining the highest IgE reactivity (21%).

Although arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15) is positioned as a marker of eosinophilic inflammation, its study in differentiating ECRSwNP has not been reported. The aim of this study is to assess the potential of ALOX15 in distinguishing and predicting ECRSwNP. Forty-eight patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), including 30 ECRSwNP and 18 nonECRSwNP patients, were enrolled. ALOX15 mRNA level was determined in polyps by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The patients' baseline characteristics were evaluated and analyzed for correlations with ALOX15. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess the predictive significance of the potential predictors for ECRSwNP. ALOX15 mRNA level was significantly higher in ECRSwNP patients than in nonECRSwNP patients (P < 0.001). ALOX15 mRNA was significantly correlated with tissue and blood eosinophil percentages (r = 0.565, P < 0.001 and r = 0.395, P = 0.006), olfaction scores (r = 0.400, P = 0.005), total visual analogue scale (VAS) symptom scores (r = 0.383, P = 0.007), ethmoid/maxillary sinus (E/M) ratio (r = 0.463, P = 0.001), and endoscopy scores (r = 0.409, P = 0.004). Logistic regression analysis showed ALOX15 mRNA level and percentage of blood eosinophils to be predictive factors for ECRSwNP (P = 0.004 and P = 0.036, respectively). ROC curve indicated ALOX15 to have high predictive accuracy for ECRSwNP (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.909), which was further improved by combination of ALOX15 with percentage of blood eosinophils (AUC = 0.933). The relative ALOX15 mRNA level alone or in combination with blood eosinophils might be a reliable biomarker for predicting a diagnosis of ECRSwNP.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Egg allergy is one of the most common food allergies in children. To date, oral immunotherapy (OIT) has been considered as a promising treatment option for egg allergy. However, safety issues remain concerning severe adverse events requiring epinephrine injection. Hence, establishing a safer method to treat egg allergy would be beneficial. We report here two children with egg allergy who were safely treated with sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) before transitioning to OIT. Case presentation Patient 1 was a 7-year-old girl and Patient 2 was a 5-year-old girl. Although OIT for egg had been attempted in both patients, severe anaphylactic symptoms were induced by ingesting only 0.1 g of heated whole egg. Therefore, SLIT was conducted with aqueous suspensions consisting of water and heated whole egg powder. Suspensions were administered sublingually, kept in the mouth for 2 min, and spat out immediately thereafter. SLIT was continued for 7 months for Patient 1 and 8 months for Patient 2 due to the exploratory character of the study. Afterwards, the patients successfully transferred to low-dose OIT with 1 g of heated whole egg (≒170 mg of egg protein) daily, and are continuing the therapy as of June 2020. As for adverse reactions, Patient 1 expressed oral cavity itchiness once at the beginning of SLIT. Patient 2 had no adverse reaction. The levels of antigen-specific IgE decreased in both patients after SLIT, and further decreased after switching to OIT. Conclusions Few clinical studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of SLIT for egg allergy. Although the treatment was conducted in only two patients, our results have shown that SLIT is a promising treatment procedure for egg allergy. Further clinical trials will be needed to additionally assess the efficacy and safety of SLIT in children with food allergy.",

Objectives To determine the phenotypic distinction regarding age at onset in patients with severe asthma. Methods The present study enrolled thirty-two patients with severe early-onset (onset age &lt; 12 years) asthma and thirty-two patients with severe late-onset (onset age &gt; 12 years) asthma. Severe asthma was defined according to Global Initiative for Asthma criteria. The clinical, spirometric, and laboratory parameters were collected for group comparisons. Results Among the 64 patients included (mean age, 46.22 ± 13.90 years; 53.1% male), the mean percent of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) was 68.43 ± 20.55%. Patients with severe early-onset asthma had a younger age, longer duration of asthma, higher rate of family history, and better small-airway function (MEF25% and MMEF75/25%) compared with severe late-onset asthma. Furthermore, levels of serum IL-17 and sputum neutrophil percentage were significantly higher for patients with severe early-onset asthma ( P = 0.016, 0.033, respectively). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that increased serum IL-17 (odds ratio = 1.065, P = 0.016) was independently associated with severe early-onset asthma. The combination of serum IL-17 and sputum neutrophil percentage yielded a sensitivity of 80.0% and a specificity of 86.7% for identifying patients with severe early-onset asthma. Conclusions Patients with severe early-onset asthma exhibit elevated levels of serum IL-17 and sputum neutrophil percentage, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of severe early-onset phenotype.",

Methods A murine model of AR was established. CD8 + Tregs were isolated from mice nasal mucosa and cultured in vitro. We examined interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β in cell cultures. Then, we administered CD8 + Tregs into mice nasal mucosal cultures, and examined eosinophil cation protein (ECP), IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 in these cultures. Finally, we adoptively transferred CD8 + Tregs into mice models, and evaluated percentages of CD8 + Tregs, numbers of sneezing and nasal rubbing, and counts of eosinophils and contents of ECP, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-10 and TGF-β in nasal lavage fluid (NLF) in mice. Results The percentage of CD8 + Tregs from AR mice was reduced. IL-10 and TGF-β were increased in cell cultures from AR mice. ECP, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 were decreased after the AR mice CD8 + Tregs administration in mucosal cultures. However, their contents were not changed after normal CD8 + Tregs treatment. Additionally, the adoptive transfer of AR CD8 + Tregs enhanced the percentage of CD8 + Tregs and levels of IL-10 and TGF-β in NLF, reduced numbers of sneezing and nasal rubbing, and counts of eosinophils and concentrations of ECP, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 in NLF. However, normal CD8 + Tregs could not change above parameters. Conclusion These findings show that CD8 + Tregs may inhibit inflammatory responses in the AR condition.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Rationale The Environmental Exposure Unit (EEU), a controlled allergen exposure model of allergic rhinitis (AR), has traditionally utilized seasonal allergens. We sought to clinically validate the use of house dust mite (HDM), a perennial allergen, in the HDM-EEU, a specially designed facility within the larger EEU. Methods Forty-four HDM-allergic and eleven non-allergic participants were screened and deemed eligible for one of two 3-h exposure sessions in the HDM-EEU. Participants were exposed to a modest or higher HDM target, with blood and nasal brushing samples collected before and after allergen exposure. Symptomatic data, including Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS), Total Ocular Symptom Score (TOSS), Total Rhinoconjunctivitis Symptom Score (TRSS), and Peak Nasal Inspiratory Flow (PNIF) were collected at baseline, every 30 min until 3 h, on an hourly basis for up to 12 h, and at 24 h following the onset of HDM exposure. Results The modest and higher HDM target sessions respectively featured cumulative total particle counts of 156,784 and 266,694 particles (2.5–25 µm), Der f 1 concentrations of 2.67 ng/m 3 and 3.80 ng/m 3 , and Der p 1 concentrations of 2.07 ng/m 3 and 6.66 ng/m 3 . Allergic participants experienced an increase in symptoms, with modest target participants plateauing at 1.5 to 2 h and achieving a mean peak TNSS of 5.74 ± 0.65, mean peak TOSS of 2.47 ± 0.56, and mean peak TRSS of 9.16 ± 1.32. High HDM-target allergics reached a mean peak TNSS of 8.17 ± 0.71, mean peak TOSS of 4.46 ± 0.62, and mean peak TRSS of 14.08 ± 1.30 at 3 h. All allergic participants’ symptoms decreased but remained higher than baseline after exiting the HDM-EEU. Sixteen participants (37.2%) were classified as Early Phase Responders (EPR), eleven (25.6%) as protracted EPR (pEPR), seven (16.3%) as Dual Phase Responders (DPR), and nine (20.9%) as Poor Responders (PR). Allergic participants experienced significant percent PNIF reductions at hours 2 and 3 compared to healthy controls. Non-allergics were asymptomatic during the study period. Conclusions The HDM-EEU is an appropriate model to study HDM-induced AR as it can generate clinically relevant AR symptoms amongst HDM-allergic individuals.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background IL13, IL4, IL4RA, FCER1B and ADRB2 are susceptible genes of asthma and atopy. Our previous study has found gene–gene interactions on asthma between these genes in Chinese Han children. Whether the interactions begin in fetal stage, and whether these genes interact with prenatal environment to enhance cord blood IgE (CBIgE) levels and then cause subsequent allergic diseases have yet to be determined. This study aimed to determine whether there are gene–gene and gene-environment interactions on CBIgE elevation among the aforementioned five genes and prenatal environmental factors in Chinese Han population. Methods 989 cord blood samples from a Chinese birth cohort were genotyped for nine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the five genes, and measured for CBIgE levels. Prenatal environmental factors were collected using a questionnaire. Gene–gene and gene-environment interactions were analyzed with generalized multifactor dimensionality methods. Results A four-way gene–gene interaction model ( IL13 rs20541, IL13 rs1800925, IL4 rs2243250 and ADRB2 rs1042713) was regarded as the optimal one for CBIgE elevation (testing balanced accuracy = 0.5805, P = 9.03 × 10 –4 ). Among the four SNPs, only IL13 rs20541 was identified to have an independent effect on elevated CBIgE (odds ratio (OR) = 1.36, P = 3.57 × 10 –3 ), while the other three had small but synergistic effects. Carriers of IL13 rs20541 TT, IL13 rs1800925 CT/TT, IL4 rs2243250 TT and ADRB2 rs1042713 AA were estimated to be at more than fourfold higher risk for CBIgE elevation (OR = 4.14, P = 2.69 × 10 –2 ). Gene-environment interaction on elevated CBIgE was found between IL4 rs2243250 and maternal atopy (OR = 1.41, P = 2.65 × 10 –2 ). Conclusions Gene–gene interaction between IL13 rs20541, IL13 rs1800925, IL4 rs2243250 and ADRB2 rs1042713, and gene-environment interaction between IL4 rs2243250 and maternal atopy begin in prenatal stage to augment IgE production in Chinese Han children.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Shrimp allergy is a growing problem among the European population. TSLP, IL-25 and IL-33 are involved in the pathophysiology of allergic diseases, including asthma and atopic dermatitis, as they activate the Th2-dependent immune response. Methods Thirty-seven patients (18 male and 19 female) with a positive history of symptoms associated with shrimp consumption were selected. All patients had blood samples taken to assess the concentration of allergen-specific IgE (sIgE) to house dust mites (HDM) and shrimp (Singleplex, quantitative method with cut off value &gt; 0,35 kAU/L) as well as the level of allergen components using the ImmunoCap ISAC method (Microarray test, semi-quantitative with cut off value &gt; 0,3 ISU-E). The concentrations of TSLP, IL-25 and IL-33 in the patients’ blood serum was assessed using the ELISA method (Cusabio). Twenty patients with negative allergy history of allergic disease tests were included in the control group. Results Among the 37 shrimp-allergic patients, ImmunoCap ISAC was identified the presence of sIgE to the available shrimp allergen components in only 14 cases (37.8%). TSLP and IL25 levels were significantly higher in the study group. No statistically significant correlation was found between the concentration of analyzed alarmins and the concentration of sIgE level to shrimp or HDM between the study and control groups. No statistically significant correlation was found between poly-sensitization occurring in patients and levels of TSLP, IL-25 and IL-33 . Conclusion In shrimp-allergic patients, the concentrations of TSLP and IL-25 were significantly higher than in the control group (1.33 vs. 0.49 and 157 vs. 39.36, respectively). There was no correlation between the concentrations of TSLP, IL-25 and IL-33 and the concentration of sIgE in the patients or the number of allergen components that the patients were sensitized to.

    "abstract": "Allergy immunotherapy is an effective treatment for patients with allergic rhinitis whose symptoms are unresolved with pharmacotherapy. Allergy immunotherapy for grass pollen-induced allergic rhinitis is available in three modalities: subcutaneous immunotherapy and sublingual immunotherapy as a tablet or drop. This study aimed to understand trends in allergy immunotherapy prescribing and practice patterns for grass allergies in adult and paediatric patients in Germany. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using IMS Disease Analyzer in Germany. Patients with an allergy immunotherapy prescription for grass pollen (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical [ATC] classification code V01AA02) from September 2005 to December 2012 were included in the study. General Practitioners (GPs), dermatologists, Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT)-specialists, paediatricians and pneumologists were included as the allergy immunotherapy prescribing physicians in the study. Descriptive analyses were conducted on patient characteristics at index and prescribing physician specialty; a test for trend was conducted for timing of initiation of first allergy immunotherapy prescription in each annual prescribing season. Eighteen thousand eight hundred fifty eligible patients were identified during the study period. The majority of patients received subcutaneous immunotherapy; however, the proportion of patients receiving sublingual immunotherapy tablets increased from 8 % in 2006/2007 to 29 % in 2011/2012 (p < 0.001). Initiation of subcutaneous immunotherapy and Oralair® generally peaked during each prescribing year in two seasons (September-October and January) while GRAZAX® prescriptions peaked in autumn (September-October). ENT-specialists and dermatologists were the largest allergy immunotherapy prescribers in adults, while paediatricians and ENT-specialists were the largest prescribers of allergy immunotherapy in paediatric patients. Subcutaneous immunotherapy remained the dominant allergy immunotherapy modality for grass pollen-induced allergic rhinitis in Germany for adult and paediatric patients; however, there was a marked increase in proportion of patients receiving sublingual immunotherapy tablets from 2006/2007 to 2011/2012, after their introduction to the market in 2006. ENT-specialists, dermatologists and paediatricians were responsible for the majority of prescribing. The predominance of particular modalities within certain physician specialties likely reflects different treatment goals or needs.",

Both diseases are well known entities but their coexistence in the same patient is rarely reported. This is a unique case presentation of a patient with celiac disease who developed concomitant IgE-mediated wheat allergy and presented with immediate symptoms in two body systems.We report the case of a girl with celiac disease who subsequently developed IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to wheat. The patient is a Caucasian female who was diagnosed with celiac disease at 18 months of age after presenting with recurrent vomiting and failure to thrive. Her anti-tTG antibody level was greater than 200 E.U. and biopsy results from endoscopy were consistent with celiac disease. Specific IgE antibody to wheat was negative at 2 years of age. Around seven years of age, she developed immediate symptoms of urticaria, cough and shortness of breath with accidental exposures to wheat. Specific IgE antibody testing was repeated and positive to wheat (42.5 kU/L), as well as rye (33.9 kU/L), barley (53.4 kU/L) and oat (11.3 kU/L). At 9 years of age, skin prick testing was positive to wheat, barley and rye but negative to oat. The patient has subsequently tolerated an open oral food challenge to oat. She continues to avoid wheat, rye and barley and carries an epinephrine autoinjector at all times.To our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient with celiac disease and concomitant IgE-mediated allergy to wheat presenting with immediate symptoms in two body systems. Although the pathophysiology of these diseases is different, this case demonstrates that they are not exclusive of one another. In patients who develop unexplained symptoms consistent with IgE-mediated allergy, an allergy assessment should be considered.",

    "abstract": "Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is characterized by potentially severe and life-threatening attacks of localized swelling. Prophylactic therapies are available, including attenuated androgens. Efficacy of attenuated androgens has not been assessed in large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials and can be associated with frequent, and sometimes severe, side effects. As better tolerated targeted therapies become available, attenuated androgen withdrawal is increasingly considered by physicians and their patients with HAE. Attenuated androgens withdrawal has not been systematically studied in HAE, although examination of other disorders indicates that attenuated androgen withdrawal may result in mood disturbances and flu-like symptoms. Standardized protocols for attenuated androgen discontinuation that continue to provide control of attacks while limiting potential attenuated androgen withdrawal symptoms are not established as the outcomes of different withdrawal strategies have not been compared. We aim to describe the challenges of attenuated androgen discontinuation in patients with HAE and how these may continue into the post-androgen period. We present a retrospective case series of 10 patients with confirmed type I HAE who have discontinued prophylactic treatment with attenuated androgens. The most common reason for attenuated androgen discontinuation was side effects. Attenuated androgens were either immediately withdrawn, tapered and/or overlapped with another treatment. The major challenge of discontinuation was the management of an increased frequency and severity of HAE attacks in some patients. Healthcare teams need to undertake careful planning and monitoring after attenuated androgens discontinuation, and modify treatment strategies if HAE control is destabilized with an increased number of attacks. Discontinuation of attenuated androgens is definitively an option in an evolving HAE treatment landscape, and outcomes can be favourable with additional patient support and education.",

The most common food triggers include soy, cow's milk and grains. Symptoms may include intractable vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, pallor, abdominal distention, hypotension and/or shock. Oral food challenges (OFCs) given at food protein dose of 0.06-0.6 g/kg in 3 equivalent doses administered over a few hours are recommended in guidelines to confirm a diagnosis.The patient is a 6-month-old girl with a history of severe FPIES symptoms to egg. In our clinic, we perform OFC with 1/100 serving dose on visit 1 and then increase the dose monthly. The patient takes the tolerated dose daily at home between visits. An OFC to baked egg at 1/100 of a serving was performed and was well-tolerated on her initial visit. The patient remained on the same dose upon returning home. Within 1-week, she developed FPIES symptoms including watery diarrhea and severe emesis requiring ondansetron. She required an Emergency Department visit for one of the reactions.Our patient had severe FPIES symptoms with a small amount of egg. We believe that administration of three large food challenge doses on one clinic visit, as guidelines currently suggest, does not allow adequate time for symptoms to appear. Our patient likely would have suffered a severe reaction. Also, this guidelines protocol does not allow for monitoring of more delayed or chronic FPIES. We propose a modified protocol to OFCs with cautious up-dosing to allow for safer OFCs and monitoring of chronic FPIES. We have implemented an OFC approach where only one food challenge dose (starting with 1/100 of final dose) is given at each visit. The up-titration of the dose is completed every 4-weeks with one dose only. When the serving sized dose is reached and tolerated, the food can be maintained in the diet.",

    "abstract": "Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to COVID-19 vaccines have been postulated to be linked to their excipients, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) in Pfizer Comirnaty, or polysorbate 80 and ethylenediaminetetracetic acid (EDTA) in AstraZeneca ChAdOx1-S [recombinant] (Vaxzevria). These excipients are found in a range of other products, including injectable and oral medications as well as intravenous radiocontrast media (RCM) and various cosmetic products. Patients with proven excipient allergy may be advised to avoid a COVID-19 vaccine containing that excipient and/or potentially cross-reactive excipients. This may result in individual patients not receiving vaccines, especially if an alternate option is not available, and on a broader level contribute to vaccine hesitancy. We present two cases of previously confirmed EDTA anaphylaxis with positive intradermal testing, who had negative Vaxzevria vaccine in-vivo testing and subsequently tolerated the vaccine. CASE 1: A patient with history of anaphylaxis to RCM and local anaesthetics (LA) had positive intradermal test (IDT) to EDTA nine years earlier. Skin testing to Vaxzeria vaccine (up to 1:10 IDT), Comirnaty vaccine (up to 1:10 IDT) and EDTA 0.3 mg/mL IDT were negative. However, following EDTA 3 mg/ml IDT, he developed immediate generalised urticaria without anaphylaxis. Basophil activation testing was negative to disodium EDTA, Vaxzevria and Cominarty vaccines. Given the negative in-vitro and in-vivo testing to Vaxzevria vaccine, he proceeded to Vaxzevria immunisation and tolerated both doses. CASE 2: A patient with history of anaphylaxis to RCM had positive skin testing to EDTA and RCM containing EDTA six years earlier. Following referral to COVID19 vaccine clinic, Vaxzevria vaccine (1:10 IDT) and Cominarty vaccine (1:10 IDT) were negative whilst EDTA was positive at 0.3 mg/mL IDT. He subsequently tolerated both Vaxzevria vaccinations.Excipient allergy does not necessarily preclude a patient from receiving a vaccine containing that excipient. Allergy testing can help identify excipient-allergic patients who may still tolerate vaccination, which is important in situations where COVID-19 vaccination options are limited.",

Case presentation A 33-year-old previously healthy male with no history of atopic disease presented with abdominal pain, hematochezia, peripheral eosinophilia as high as 10,000 eos/µL, right and left portal vein, mesenteric, and splenic vein thrombi with ischemic colitis resulting in hemicolectomy and small bowel resection. Despite an extensive workup for primary and secondary etiologies of hypereosinophilia by hematology/oncology, infectious disease, rheumatology and allergy/immunology, no other clear causes were identified, and the patient was diagnosed with idiopathic HES. His eosinophilia was successfully treated with high-dose oral corticosteroids (OCS) and subsequently transitioned to anti-IL-5-receptor therapy with benralizumab. He has continued this treatment for over a year with no recurrence of eosinophilia or thrombosis while on benralizumab. Conclusion In patients with an unexplained coagulopathy and eosinophilia, eosinophilic disorders such as HES should be considered. Corticosteroid-sparing agents, such as benralizumab show promise for successfully treating these patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Patients with asthma frequently over rely on short-acting beta-agonists (SABA) to treat acute symptoms. This can adversely impact quality of life and increase the risk of exacerbations. SABA overuse is also associated with an increased risk of mortality. In their 2021 update on the diagnosis and management of mild asthma, the Canadian Thoracic Society (CTS) newly recommended that a combination inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting beta-agonist, specifically budesonide/formoterol, may be used as-needed (PRN) as an alternative reliever to SABA. The CTS developed an algorithm as a guide for deciding for whom PRN budesonide/formoterol versus PRN SABA is appropriate as a reliever. While the CTS algorithm provides necessary and precise guidance, the somewhat complicated requirements for determining control and exacerbation risk may still end up leaving some patients at-risk of SABA overreliance. This communication simplifies the reliever decision algorithm developed by the CTS for application in daily practice. A 30-s evaluation of 2 simple questions related to reliever use can usually accurately assess if a patient’s asthma is controlled: How many SABA canisters do you use a year AND how many times do you use SABA a week? If the patient indicates use of &gt; 2 SABA canisters per year or &gt; 2 administrations of SABA per week for any reason, the patient does not have controlled asthma and PRN SABA is not an appropriate treatment regimen. Similarly, for patients using PRN ICS/formoterol, more than 2 administrations per week indicates a clinical review and reevaluation of their management, including augmentation. An education process is essential to inform patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers that overuse of any reliever is not acceptable and is potentially harmful.",

Such programs already exist in the United States and Britain. Herein, we describe the outcomes of recent conference proceedings to inform the educational needs for such a program. As part of the 76th Annual Meeting of the Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (CSACI), held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we hosted a virtual workshop on the need for a food allergy educator program for Canadian allied health professionals. This workshop was co-developed with the CSACI and an industry partner, and featured allergy specialist dietitians. Attendance was open to all conference delegates, and to allied health professionals. As part of the registration process, registrants posed diverse food allergy-related questions, ranging from how to use an epinephrine autoinjector, to daily management and, how to cure food allergy. A national food allergy educator program will empower both allergy and non-allergy specialist healthcare professionals to appropriately counsel patients.

    "abstract": "We compared patient and caregiver knowledge and confidence for managing asthma, and participant experiences when comprehensive asthma education was delivered in person versus in the virtual setting.We performed a multi-methods study using structured surveys and qualitative interviews to solicit feedback from patients and caregivers following participation in a comprehensive asthma education session between April 2018 and October 2021. We compared participant knowledge and confidence for managing asthma as well as user experience when the education was attended in-person or virtually. Quantitative responses were summarized descriptively, and qualitative feedback was analyzed for major themes.Of 100 caregivers/patients who completed post education satisfaction surveys and interviews, 52 attended in person and 48 virtually, with the mean age of patients being 6.7 years (range: 1.2-17.0). Participant reported gains in knowledge and confidence for asthma management were not different between groups and 65.2% preferred attending virtual asthma education. The majority of participants described virtual education as a safer modality that was more convenient and accessible.We demonstrated the successful implementation of a novel, virtual asthma education program for patients and caregivers of children with asthma. Both virtual and in-person delivered asthma education were equally effective for improving perceived knowledge and confidence for asthma self-management and virtual education was considered safer, more convenient and accessible. Virtual asthma education offers an attractive and effective option for improving the reach of quality asthma education programs and may allow more children/patients to benefit.",

    "abstract": "Childhood adenoid hypertrophy (AH) is common and is often associated with allergic asthma, resulting in complications like obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Management of the disease and its complications is often challenging.We report here a case of a 10-year-old boy who suffered from severe allergic asthma and rhinitis and was treated with omalizumab. Before the treatment, the childhood asthma control test (C-ACT, 14), visal analog scale (VAS, 7) and lung function (mild obstructive ventilation dysfunction and moderate to severe dysfunction in ventilation in small airway) were seriously affected. Polysomnography showed OSAS (apnea hypopnea index, AHI, 6.4), low hypooxia saturation (lowest pulse oxygen saturation, LoSpO2, 70%), and adenoid hypertrophy (at grade III). After treating with omalizumab for 4 weeks (once treatment), the ventilation function, symptoms of asthma and allergic rhinitis (C-ACT, 24; VAS, 2), and OSAS (AHI: 1.8 and LoSpO2: 92.6%) were all improved, and the adenoids size was also significantly reduced to grade II. And during the following 3 times of treatment, the allergic symptoms continued improving, and the size of adenoid was reduced to grade I. Even 6.5 months after cessation of omalizumab, the size of adenoid remained at grade I.This is the first documented case that childhood adenoid hypertrophy can be significantly improved by omalizumab.",

White blood cell counts have been largely unexplored as a risk factor for CRS even though different types of white blood cells are involved in the inflammatory process of CRS. Objective To investigate causal associations between different types of white blood cells on risk of CRS utilizing a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Methods A two-sample MR analysis was performed using respective GWAS summary statistics for the exposure traits (neutrophil count, eosinophil count, basophil count, lymphocyte count, and monocyte count) and outcome trait (CRS). For the exposure traits, the European Bioinformatics Institute database of complete GWAS summary data was used. For the outcome trait, summary statistics for CRS GWAS were obtained from FinnGen. Primary analysis for MR was performed using inverse-variance weighted two-sample MR. Sensitivity analyses included weighted median, MR-Egger, and MR-PRESSO (raw and outlier-corrected). Results Eosinophils were associated with CRS (OR = 1.55 [95% CI 1.38, 1.73]; p = 4.3E-14). Eosinophil results were similar across additional MR methods. MR results did not demonstrate significant causal relationships between neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, or basophils with CRS. No significant pleiotropic bias was observed. Conclusions In a two-sample MR analysis, a potential causal link between blood eosinophil counts and CRS has been demonstrated. In addition, causal relationships between blood counts among other white blood cell types and CRS were not found. Further studies involving genetic variation in CRS are needed to corroborate genetic causal effects for CRS.",

Objective To investigate the usefulness of the antigen avoidance test in patients with fibrotic HP in stable phase. Methods The antigen avoidance test was conducted during a 2-week hospitalization comparing clinical parameters at admission and before discharge. A retrospective review of patients who underwent surgical lung biopsy or transbronchial lung cryobiopsy, who were diagnosed with fibrotic HP by multi-disciplinary discussion, and whose disease progression was stable for more than two months before the antigen avoidance test was done. Results Between 2016 and 2021, 40 patients met the criteria, and 17 (43%) patients had a positive antigen avoidance test. The patients with positive in the antigen avoidance test had significantly greater annual forced vital capacity (FVC) decline than those with negative before the test (− 6.5% vs. − 0.3%, p = 0.045). The patients with positive antigen avoidance test had less annual FVC decline than those with negative in the year following the test (0.8% vs. − 5.0%, p = 0.048). The differences in annual improvement were found for serum Krebs von den Lungen-6 between the positive and negative patients in the year following the test (− 27% vs. − 5%, p = 0.049). In multivariate Cox hazard regression analysis, a negative result of the antigen avoidance test was a risk factor for death or acute exacerbation of fibrotic HP (HR = 0.26 [95% CI: 0.07–0.90], p = 0.034). Conclusions In fibrotic HP patients in stable phase, the antigen avoidance test under a 2-week hospitalization was valuable in predicting prognosis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Previous studies have shown that CD134 (OX40) co-stimulation is involved in the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) models and the antigen is expressed within multiple sclerosis lesions in humans. OX40 (CD134) is thought to be a secondary co-stimulatory immune checkpoint molecule that is expressed by T cells. This study aimed to evaluate the mRNA expression of OX40 and its serum levels in the peripheral blood of patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) or Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO). Methods Patients with MS (n = 60), NMO (n = 20), and 20 healthy subjects were recruited from Sina Hospital, Tehran, Iran. The diagnoses were confirmed by a specialist in clinical neurology. Peripheral venous blood was obtained from all subjects, and mRNA quantification of OX40 was conducted using real-time PCR. Serum samples were also obtained and the concentration of OX40 was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results There was a significant correlation between the mRNA expression and serum levels of OX40 and disability as assessed using the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) in the patients with MS, but not in the patients with NMO. Expression of OX40 mRNA was significantly higher in the peripheral blood of MS patients compared to healthy individuals and NMO patients (*P &lt; 0.05). In addition, serum OX40 concentrations were also significantly higher in patients with MS patients compared with healthy subjects (9.08 ± 2.48 vs. 1.49 ± 0.54 ng/ml; P = 0.041). Conclusions It appears that an increased expression of OX40 may be associated with the hyperactivation of T cells in patients with MS, and this may play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Peanut allergy and its current management, involving peanut avoidance and use of rescue medication during instances of accidental exposure, are burdensome to patients and their caregivers and can be a source of stress, uncertainty, and restriction. Physicians may also be frustrated with a lack of effective and safe treatments other than avoidance in the current management of peanut allergy. Efficacy, determined using double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFCs), of oral immunotherapy with peanut (Arachis hypogaea) allergen powder-dnfp (PTAH; Palforzia®) was demonstrated versus placebo in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years in multiple phase 3 trials; continued benefit of PTAH was shown in a follow-on trial. The DBPCFC is a reproducible, rigorous, and clinically meaningful assessment accepted by regulatory authorities to evaluate the level of tolerance as an endpoint for accidental exposures to peanut in real life. It also provides useful clinical and patient-relevant information, including the amount of peanut protein an individual with peanut allergy can consume without experiencing dose-limiting symptoms, severity of symptoms, and organs affected upon ingestion of peanut protein. We explored symptoms of peanut exposure during DBPCFCs from phase 3 and follow-on trials of PTAH to further characterize treatment efficacy from a perspective relevant to patients, caregivers, and clinicians.Symptom data recorded during screening and/or exit DBPCFCs from participants aged 4 to 17 years receiving PTAH or placebo were examined post hoc across three PTAH trials (PALISADE [ARC003], ARC004 [PALISADE follow-on], and ARTEMIS [ARC010]). The maximum peanut protein administered as a single dose during DBPCFCs was 1000 mg (PALISADE and ARTEMIS) and 2000 mg (ARC004). Symptoms were classified by system organ class (SOC) and maximum severity. Endpoints were changes in symptom severity and freedom from symptoms (ie, asymptomatic) during DBPCFC. Relative risk (RR) was calculated for symptom severity by SOC and freedom from symptoms between groups; descriptive statistics were used to summarize all other data.The risk of any respiratory (RR 0.42 [0.30-0.60], P < 0.0001), gastrointestinal (RR 0.34 [0.26-0.44], P < 0.0001), cardiovascular/neurological (RR 0.17 [0.08-0.39], P < 0.001), or dermatological (RR 0.33 [0.22-0.50], P < 0.0001) symptoms was significantly lower in participants treated with PTAH versus placebo upon exposure to peanut at the end of the PALISADE trial (ie, exit DBPCFC). Compared with placebo-treated participants (23.4%), the majority (76.3%) of PTAH-treated participants had no symptoms at the exit DBPCFC when tested at the peanut protein dose not tolerated (ie, reactive dose) during the screening DBPCFC. Significantly higher proportions of PTAH-treated participants were asymptomatic at doses ≤ 100 mg in the exit DBPCFC compared with placebo-treated participants (PALISADE: 69.35% vs 12.10%, RR 5.73 [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.55-9.26]; P < 0.0001; ARTEMIS: 67.42% vs 13.95%, RR 4.83 [95% CI 2.28-10.25]; P < 0.0001); findings were similar at peanut protein doses ≤ 1000 mg (PALISADE: RR 15.56 [95% CI 5.05-47.94]; P < 0.0001; ARTEMIS: RR 34.74 [95% CI 2.19-551.03]; P < 0.0001). In ARC004, as the period of PTAH maintenance became longer, greater proportions of participants were asymptomatic at doses of peanut protein ≤ 1000 mg in the exit DBPCFC (from 37.63% after ~ 6 months of maintenance treatment [exit DBPCFC of PALISADE] to 45.54% after ~ 13 months and 58.06% after ~ 20 months of overall PTAH maintenance treatment).PTAH significantly reduced symptom severity due to exposure to peanut, which is clinically relevant. When exposed to peanut, participants with peanut allergy treated with PTAH rarely had moderate or severe respiratory or cardiovascular/neurological symptoms. Oral immunotherapy with PTAH appears to reduce frequency and severity of allergic reactions in individuals with peanut allergy after accidental exposure to peanut and may enable them and their families to have an improved quality of life.

A phenomenon where patients reacquire food allergy by resuming daily consumption after a negative oral food challenge has not yet been reported. Case presentation We report two cases of TAFA after liver transplantation and cord blood transplantation. In each case, the threshold of daily consumption to cause allergic symptoms decreased when a negative oral food challenge was obtained. Conclusions Our cases show an importance of gastrointestinal tract as a route of food sensitization because thresholds that caused allergic reactions decreased during their resuming process. We need to be careful with possible resensitization once a negative substantial dose was confirmed.",

    "abstract": "The mainstay of treatment for eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is systemic corticosteroid therapy; some patients also receive intravenous immunoglobulins, other immunosuppressive agents, and biologics. Mepolizumab, an anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody, induces remission and decreases the daily corticosteroid dose; however, the clinical efficacy of mepolizumab in EGPA and the prognosis with long-term treatment with this drug are unknown.Seventy-one EGPA patients were treated at Hiratsuka City Hospital, Japan, between April 2018 and March 2022. We administered mepolizumab for a mean of 2.8 ± 1.7 years to 43 patients in whom remission could not be induced by conventional treatment. After excluding 18 patients who had received mepolizumab for less than 3 years, we classified 15 patients into a \"super-responder group\" (the daily dose of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressant could be decreased, or the interval between IVIG treatments could be prolonged) and 10 patients into a \"responder group\" (neither of these changes was achievable). Eosinophil numbers, serum IgG levels, daily doses of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants, Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS), and relapse frequency before and after mepolizumab initiation were determined.Blood eosinophil count at diagnosis and the lowest serum IgG level before mepolizumab treatment were significantly higher in super-responders than in responders (p < 0.05). In super-responders, the prednisolone dose at last visit on mepolizumab treatment was lower than that before treatment (p < 0.01) and lower than that at last visit in the responders (p < 0.01). In both groups, peripheral blood eosinophil numbers and BVAS were lower after starting mepolizumab than before (p < 0.01). BVAS before mepolizumab (p < 0.05) and at last visit (p < 0.01) were lower in super-responders than in responders. Relapse rates every year after the start of mepolizumab were lower in super-responders than in responder groups (p < 0.01). In super-responders, relapse rates were lower during the 3 years following mepolizumab initiation (p < 0.01) and at last visit (p < 0.01) were significantly lower than after 1 year of treatment.Mepolizumab treatment of super-responders sustainably reduced the relapse rate.",

Reactions to this agent can occur following cow’s milk ingestion which could lead to an erroneous diagnosis of cow’s milk allergy in the absence of another explanation. Case presentation Our patient, a 48-year-old male with eczema, exercise-induced asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis, presented with four episodes of systemic reactions characterized by mucosal swelling and asthma symptoms following ice-cream exposure. It was later recognized that he had been taking a lactase enzyme supplement just prior to all of his reactions. Epicutaneous testing was strongly positive to a saline slurry of the lactase supplement he had been using. The patient has been avoiding supplemental lactase since with no subsequent reactions. Discussion Our patient was diagnosed with an allergy to supplemental lactase enzyme on the basis of convincing Immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated symptoms and positive skin testing. He continued to eat cow’s milk products, ruling out an IgE-mediated allergy to cow’s milk. In the literature, there is one prior case of anaphylaxis documented. Another case of localized oropharyngeal symptoms described in the literature was thought to be a form of oral allergy syndrome as the patient had positive epicutaneous testing to Aspergillus oryzae-derived lactase as well as Aspergillus species. Occupational sensitization, rhinitis/asthma, and protein contact dermatitis have also been detailed in the literature. Although rare, this case highlights the importance of a thorough history of over-the-counter supplements when assessing a patient with features of anaphylaxis.",

The objective of this study was to report real-life clinical outcomes in adult patients with chronic urticaria who had an inadequate response to omalizumab and were switched from omalizumab to cyclosporine. Medical records of adult patients with chronic urticaria who had an inadequate response with omalizumab and were later treated with cyclosporine were reviewed retrospectively. Data pertaining to treatment method, clinical response, and adverse effects were recorded. Results/presentation of cases Five patients with omalizumab-refractory chronic urticaria, three of whom also had angioedema and one with an inducible urticaria, were treated with low doses of oral cyclosporine (1–3 mg/kg/d). Four of five patients in this case series had complete resolution of symptoms with oral cyclosporine, while continuing other standard therapies. Systemic side effects occurred in three patients which prompted drug discontinuation in two patients. Discussion Cyclosporine alone was effective in inducing urticaria control in adult patients with chronic urticaria who had an inadequate response to omalizumab, though the impact of cyclosporine was limited by reversible adverse effects. Adverse effects were associated with pre-existing medical conditions. As novel chronic urticaria therapies are being investigated, this experience highlights the importance of uncovering chronic urticaria subtypes which tend to respond to cyclosporine, while providing alternative treatments with better tolerability.",

The risk of certain adverse effects may be increased in the setting of recent use of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, although it is unclear whether recent use of ICI therapy is a risk factor for Osimertinib-induced SJS specifically.We present a patient with EGFR L858R mutation-positive metastatic NSCLC who developed Osimertinib-induced SJS after recent administration of eight cycles of a pembrolizumab-containing chemotherapy regimen. Osimertinib, which was the best treatment targeting his lung cancer, was avoided due to history of SJS. Four years later, because of unresponsiveness or side effects of alternative treatments, he underwent Osimertinib challenge and tolerated it.This case highlights the importance of multi-disciplinary care and supports the hypothesis that the risk of SJS to Osimertinib is significantly higher in the context of recent administration of ICI therapy and, patients may tolerate Osimertinib after certain time has elapsed after the last dose of ICI.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic validity of sIgE levels to alpha-gal ≥ 0.1 kUA/L for identifying AGS.This was a cross-sectional analysis of adult patients with available data on sIgE levels to alpha-gal, classified into two groups according to the presence (Group 1) or absence (Group 2) of symptoms after being exposed to potential sources of alpha-gal. Values of sIgE to alpha-gal ≥ 0.1 kUA/l were considered a positive result. A descriptive analysis of internal and external validity parameters was performed in the entire population and adjusted by sex.The study included 33 individuals in Group 1 and 65 in Group 2, with a mean age of around 47 years. The analysis of internal validity parameters revealed a high sensitivity, specificity, and positive probability ratio, with higher sensitivity in men and higher specificity in women. The analysis of external validity parameters showed a high negative predictive value and global value in all populations and both sexes. However, the positive predictive value was relatively high in men, but low in women.Our results suggest that sIgE levels ≥ 0.1 kUA/L may be a useful tool for the diagnosis of AGS, although other factors and diagnostic techniques should also be considered.",

    "abstract": "Non-esophageal eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorder (non-EoE-EGID) is a rare disease in which eosinophils infiltrate parts of the gastrointestinal tract other than the esophagus; however, the number of patients with non-EoE-EGID has been increasing in recent years. Owing to its chronic course with repeated relapses, it can lead to developmental delays due to malnutrition, especially in pediatric patients. No established treatment exists for non-EoE-EGID, necessitating long-term systemic corticosteroid administration. Although the efficacy of dupilumab, an anti-IL-4/13 receptor monoclonal antibody, for eosinophilic esophagitis, has been reported, only few reports have demonstrated its efficacy in non-EoE EGIDs.A 13-year-old boy developed non-EoE-EGID with duodenal ulcers, with chicken eggs as the trigger. He was successfully treated with an egg-free diet, proton pump inhibitors, and leukotriene receptor antagonists. However, at age 15, he developed worsening upper abdominal pain and difficulty eating. Blood analysis revealed eosinophilia; elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate; and elevated levels of C-reactive protein, total immunoglobulin E, and thymic and activation-regulated chemokines. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a duodenal ulcer with marked mucosal eosinophilic infiltration. Gastrointestinal symptoms persisted even after starting systemic steroids, making it difficult to reduce the steroid dose. Subcutaneous injection of dupilumab was initiated because of comorbid atopic dermatitis exacerbation. After 3 months, the gastrointestinal symptoms disappeared, and after 5 months, the duodenal ulcer disappeared and the eosinophil count decreased in the mucosa. Six months later, systemic steroids were discontinued, and the duodenal ulcer remained recurrence-free. The egg challenge test result was negative; therefore, the egg-free diet was discontinued. Blood eosinophil count and serum IL-5, IL-13, and eotaxin-3 levels decreased after dupilumab treatment. The serum levels of IL-5 and eotaxin-3 remained within normal ranges, although the blood eosinophil counts increased again after discontinuation of oral prednisolone.Suppression of IL-4R/IL-13R-mediated signaling by dupilumab may improve abdominal symptoms and endoscopic and histologic findings in patients with non-EoE-EGID, leading to the discontinuation of systemic steroid administration and tolerance of causative foods.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Real-world data on subcutaneous C1INH (C1INH[SC]) usage and patient-level impacts on hereditary angioedema (HAE)-related outcomes and quality of life (QoL) are both lacking and challenging to generate using conventional study methodologies. Using a hybrid study design involving patient interviews supplemented by retrospective medical chart data review, we conducted a real-world assessment of the impact of C1INH(SC) prophylaxis on HAE attack patterns, QoL, and on-demand medication use. Methods The study was conducted at seven US sites and included 36 adults with HAE who had been treated with C1INH(SC) long-term prophylaxis following ≥ 12 months of on-demand management only. Patients underwent 30-min interviews, facilitated and analyzed by a trained qualitative research specialist. Medical records were reviewed for 12 months before (pre-index) and after (post-index) initiation of C1INH(SC). Using interview data with descriptive terms converted to numerical values, we compared pre- versus post-index attack frequency, severity, and rescue medication usage. Results Mean (SD) annualized attack frequency per patient decreased 82.0%, from 38.8 (38.8) attacks/year pre-index to 7.0 (15.3) attacks/year (P &lt; 0.001); the median number of attacks decreased by 97.0% (30 pre-index to 1 post-index). For 20 patients, the annualized attack rate after starting C1INH(SC) prophylaxis was ≤ 1 attack/year; 12 of these patients reported 0 attacks. Mean (SD) attack severity (scale: 0 = none/mild to 4 = very severe) decreased from 2.3 (0.7) pre-index to 0.9 (0.9) post-index (P &lt; 0.001). Mean/median rescue medication use decreased by 77.2%/96.3%. Improved QoL was narratively described for many domains. Conclusions These real-world findings indicate that long-term prophylaxis with C1INH(SC) markedly improves important factors that contribute to the goal of achieving total disease control and normalization of patients’ lives, including fewer and less severe attacks, less rescue medication usage, and improved QoL.",

Coengagement of FcεRI with immunoglobulin G (IgG) low-affinity receptor FcγRIIB/CD32 inhibits degranulation and the release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells and has therefore been proposed as a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of allergies. In this study, we investigated whether FcγRIIB, besides inhibiting degranulation, negatively regulates other signalling pathways downstream of FcεRI. For this, we determined the phosphorylation and/or expression of proteins involved in the regulation of mast-cell apoptosis. Coaggregation led to an attenuation of Akt phosphorylation but did not inhibit phosphorylation of transcription factor Foxo3a or its proapoptotic target, Bim. Similarly, FcεRI-dependent expression of the prosurvival gene A1 was not affected by coaggregation. Our data demonstrate that coengagement of FcεRI and FcγRIIB inhibits degranulation but not the signalling pathways regulating Bcl-2 family members Bim and A1.",

The chickpea, a small legume, is a staple ingredient in culinary traditions from around the world, especially in India, the Middle East, and North Africa. Chickpea-containing dishes are also becoming more widespread in the Western world with the growing popularity of South Asian, Middle Eastern, and African cuisines. It is important to consider FDEIA in cases of unexplained anaphylaxis as reactions can occur several hours after ingesting the culprit food(s). Furthermore, no reaction occurs if a sensitized individual eats the culprit food(s) without exercising afterward; therefore, triggering foods can easily be overlooked. Current ideas on the pathophysiology, predisposing factors, workup, and treatment of FDEIA are also summarized here.",

    "abstract": ": Allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT) is the cornerstone of the management of allergic diseases, which targets modification of the immunologic response, along with environmental allergen avoidance and pharmacotherapy. SIT is associated with improved tolerance to allergen challenge, with a decrease in immediate-phase and late-phase allergic inflammation. SIT has the potential to prevent development of new sensitizations and progression of allergic rhinitis to asthma. It has a role in cellular and humoral responses in a modified pattern. The ratio of T helper (Th)1 cytokines to Th2 cytokines is increased following SIT, and functional regulatory T cells are induced. Interleukin-10 production by monocytes, macrophages, and B and T cells is increased, as well as expression of transforming growth factor beta. SIT is associated with increases in allergen-specific antibodies in IgA, IgG1, and IgG4 isotypes. These blocking-type immunoglobulins, particularly IgG4, may compete with IgE binding to allergen, decreasing the allergen presentation with the high- and low-affinity receptors for IgE (FcepsilonRI and FcepsilonRII, respectively). Additionally, SIT reduces the number of mast cells and eosinophils in the target tissues and release of mediators from these cells.",

Rare cases of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis, a vasculitic disorder frequently associated with the presence of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis have been described in literature.We report two middle-aged female patients with rheumatoid arthritis who developed anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and symptoms reminiscent of granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Despite the lack of antibodies specific for proteinase 3 and the absence of a classical histology, we report a probable case of granulomatosis with polyangiitis in the first patient, and consider rheumatoid vasculitis in the second patient.Taken together with previous reports, these cases highlight that anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies have to be evaluated very carefully in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In this context, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies detected by indirect immunofluorescence appear to have a low diagnostic value for granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Instead they may have prognostic value for assessing the course of rheumatoid arthritis.",

    "abstract": "Diagnostic testing to antibiotics other than to penicillin has not been widely available, making the diagnosis of antibiotic allergy difficult and often erroneous. There is often reluctance in performing challenges to antibiotics when standardized testing is lacking. However, while the immunogenic determinants are not known for most antibiotics, a skin reaction at a non-irritating concentration (NIC) may mean that antibodies to the native form are present in the circulation. While the NIC’s for many non penicillin antibiotics have been determined in adults, the use of these concentrations for skin testing pediatric subjects prior to provocative challenge has not been done. Our objective was to determine if we could successfully uncover the true nature of antibiotic allergy in children using these concentrations for testing. Children were included between 2003–2009 upon being referred to the Drug and Adverse Reaction/Toxicology (DART) clinic of the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Ontario Canada. The referral needed to demonstrate that clinical care was being compromised by the limitation in antibiotic options or there was a significant medical condition for which the label of antibiotic allergy may prove detrimental. Patients were not seen if there was a suggestion of serum like sickness, Stevens Johnson Syndrome or Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis. Patients were excluded from testing if there was objective evidence of anaphylaxis. All other patients were consented to receive testing and/or challenges. A retrospective chart review was then performed of the results. We were able to exclude an antibiotic allergy in the majority of our patients who had a negative intradermal test result and were then challenged (>90%). Only one patient was challenged with a positive intradermal test to Cotrimoxazole because of a questionable history and this patient failed the provocative challenge. While we did not challenge more patients with positive testing, we did note that 10/11 (91%) patients with positive intradermal testing had some aspect of a Type 1 reaction in their history. Through testing with NIC’s of various antibiotics in children and providing provocative challenges based on negative skin testing results, we were able to advance the medical care of the majority of our patients by increasing their antibiotic options in order to successfully treat future infections. While challenging patients with positive testing was not deemed ethically appropriate at this stage of our study, it would be a useful future step to reaching statistical validity of testing to these antibiotics.",

BABL/c mice were sensitized twice by intraperitoneal injection of HDM extracts and Al(OH)3 on day 1 and day 8. Then, the mice received challenge to induce airway inflammation by intratracheal instillation of HDM extracts on days 29–31. The treatment group received immunotherapy with oral HDM extracts ingestion before the challenge. All the mice were sacrificed on day 32 for bronchoalveolar inflammatory cytokines, mediastinal lymph node T cells, lung histology, and serum HDM-specific immunoglobulins analyses. Upon HDM sensitization and following challenge, a robust Th2 cell response and eosinophilic airway inflammation were observed in mice of the positive control group. The mice treated with HDM extracts ingestion had decreased eosinophilic airway inflammation, suppressed HDM-specific Th2 cell responses in the mediastinal lymph nodes, and attenuated serum HDM-specific IgE levels. Oral immunotherapy with HDM extracts ingestion was demonstrated to have a partial therapeutic effect in the murine model of allergic asthma. This study may serve as the basis for the further development of oral immunotherapy with HDM extracts in allergic asthma.",

Recent evidence suggests that children with STBD less than the exposed needle length of available pediatric EAIs (dose: 0.15 mg, needle length: 12.7 mm) are at risk for unintentional injections to the bone during their use for an allergic emergency.Described here is a case of a female child with multiple food allergies prescribed a pediatric EAI (0.15 mg EpiPen Jr®) who experienced an unintentional injection to her femur. The patient's STBD at the recommended injection site (vastus lateralis) was shorter than the needle length of her prescribed EAI (12.7 mm) at the time of the injury (age: 7, height: 122 cm; weight: 25 kg), even though her weight was within the indication for this EAI (15-30 kg). The patient and her family were made aware of the risk of unintentional bone injection at the time the EAI was prescribed.Some children, even those at an appropriate weight per the indication of available pediatric EAIs (0.15 mg), may be at risk for unintentional injections to the bone. The effects of an unintentional bone injection with an EAI can have lasting effects on a child, including pain. Healthcare providers who prescribe pediatric EAIs for any child should consider evaluating this risk, inform patients and parents of the risk, and take measures to potentially mitigate unintentional bone injections. For some children, an EAI with a shorter needle length may be a more appropriate choice of treatment for anaphylaxis.",

    "abstract": "Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare primary immunodeficiency of the phagocytic cells, which results in absent or diminished levels of microbicidal reactive oxygen species. The disease occurs due to germline mutations in the genes encoding the five subunits of NADPH oxidase complex. The present study is a pilot study to understand the clinical and genetic aspects of CGD in Sri Lanka. Clinical records of thirteen CGD patients were analysed and compared with similar studies performed in different countries and regions to identify patterns in demographics, clinical manifestations and infectious agents. Genomic DNA and cDNA were analysed in eight patients to identify mutations in CYBB and NCF1 genes, thereby to ascertain the potential X-linked and autosomal recessive (AR) CGD patients. The onset of symptoms in the patient cohort was very early (mean 4.6 months) compared to 20 months in India and 23.9 months in Latin America. Similarly, the age at diagnosis was lower (mean 1.6 years after birth) compared to other studies; 4.5 years in India and 6.1 years in Europe. Pulmonary manifestations were the most common (85%), followed by skin/subcutaneous infections (77%) and lymphadenopathy (62%). The death rate of local patients (38%) was higher than other countries (India 35%, Europe 20%). Majority (77%) were treated for tuberculosis at some point in life. Genetic analysis confirmed six out of eight patients as X-linked CGD cases with mutations in CYBB gene. A novel splice site mutation was identified in P-07 at position c.141+6 which resulted in the deletion of entire exon 2. Two siblings (P-05 and P-06) from consanguineous parents, were identified with AR-CGD based on the homozygous GT deletion mutation in NCF1 gene. The clinical presentation, manifestations and genetic subtypes in the local cohort, appear to be comparable with global trends. Mycobacterial infections should be investigated and treated with more prominence. Effective treatment options are required to control the high mortality rate.",

    "abstract": "Allergic rhinitis affects around one quarter of the Western European population. Prophylactic allergen immunotherapy may be useful to reduce the risk of acute symptomatic attacks (hayfever). A five-grass pollen extract sublingual immunotherapy (5GPE-SLIT) has been developed for the treatment of allergic rhinitis to grass pollen. The objective of this study was to describe real-world treatment patterns with 5GPE-SLIT in France with respect to the prescribing information.This prospective cohort study was conducted by 90 community and hospital allergists. Adults and children (> 5 years old) starting a first treatment with 5GPE-SLIT prior to the 2015 pollen season were eligible. Data was collected at the inclusion visit and at the end of the pollen season. The primary outcome variable was compatibility of 5GPE-SLIT prescription with the prescribing information. This was determined with respect to four variables: (1) interval between 5GPE-SLIT initiation and onset of the pollen season ≥ 3 months, (2) age of patient ≥ 5 years, (3) intermittent symptoms or mild symptom severity (4) confirmatory diagnostic test. At study end, symptoms reported during the pollen season and any modifications to treatment or adverse events were documented.280 adults and 203 children were enrolled. The prescribing information was respected for 82.5% of adults and 86.7% of children. A skin test was performed for all patients. 5GPE-SLIT was started 3-5 months before the pollen season for 85.3%. Treatment was discontinued before the start of the pollen season in 11.0% of patients overall, generally because of an adverse event (78.8% of discontinuations). The mean duration of treatment was 5.2 months in adults and 5.6 months in children. At the end of follow-up, symptoms during the pollen season were intermittent for 75.0% of adults and 85.7% of children, and severity was mild for 61.8 and 66.0% respectively. During 5GPE-SLIT, the following symptoms reported during the previous year were not reported again in > 50% of patients: nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, repeated sneezing, conjunctivitis and nasal pruritus.5GPE-SLIT use was generally consistent with prescribing recommendations and was associated with an improvement of AR severity, with resolution of the principal AR symptoms in around half the patients treated.Trial registration EUPAS9358.

Moreover, IFNα mRNA expression was evaluated in purified pDCs, by qRT-PCR.After SCIT administration we observed a strong decrease of circulating pDCs, although accompanied by higher levels of IFNα mRNA expression, and an increase of circulating CD16+ monocytes. AR participants under SCIT exhibited a higher expression of receptor-bound IgE in all cell populations that expressed the high affinity receptor for IgE (FcεRI) and a higher frequency of CD16+ monocytes producing TNFα. Conversely, we observed a decrease in the frequency of mDCs producing TNFα in AR under SCIT, similar to the observed in the control group.SCIT seems to induce numeric, phenotypic, and functional changes in circulating monocytes and dendritic cells, contributing at least in part to the well described immunological alterations induced by this type of immunotherapy.",

The underlining cause may be malignant or due to autoimmune diseases, but some cases remain idiopathic.We report a case of a 75 year old woman suffering from recurrent episodes of angioedema since the age of 66, considered first induced by treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI). She continued to have angioedema attacks during 6 years after discontinuation of ACEI, until evaluation in our clinic in 2014, when C1 inhibitor esterase (C1-INH) deficiency was confirmed. The extended medical evaluation for inflammatory, allergic, autoimmune and neoplasic diseases was negative. C1-INH and complement fraction C4 plasma levels were significantly decreased at all measurements, but no diagnostic criteria for diseases known to induce C1-INH deficiency could be found. We first initiated daily prophylactic treatment with tranexamic acid, with no amelioration after 3 months. During the last and most severe attack, with the first facial and laryngeal edema, we have switched to attenuated androgen danazol. The evolution was very good, with prompt remission of angioedema and significant increase of C1-INH and C4 plasma levels after 2 weeks of daily danazol use. She completed 3 years of continuous treatment with low daily maintenance dose of danazol (ongoing), with no angioedema attack. We closely monitored C1-INH and C4 plasma levels, possible danazol side effects and any signs suggesting late onset of C1-INH deficiency causal disease.We reported a particular case of rare angioedema due to acquired deficiency of C1-inhibitor, which has no clear cause after long follow-up, but good response to attenuated androgen. We concluded that the awareness of angioedema due to C1-INH deficiency should be increased within medical community and therapeutic options should be more clearly indicated and available for all diagnosed cases.",

Perinatal determinants conceivably modify the epigenetic makeup of the developing fetal immune system preventing or predisposing the development of allergies. The aim of this study therefore was to identify independent perinatal factors associated with allergic sensitization in childhood. Methods In a single center retrospective case-cohort study electronic obstetric medical records and available skin prick testing results of children were analyzed. For the analysis 286 skin prick test positive (sensitized) children [median (IQR): 3.47 (1.70–7.34) years] were compared with data from all remaining live births in the obstetric cohort (n = 66,583). Results Sensitized children more frequently had a mother born in Asia (19.1% vs. 10.2%; P &lt; 10–6). Applying backward elimination logistic regression, seven out of 23 initially entered perinatal factors remained in the model. High maternal age (&gt; 35 years; OR: 1.912; P &lt; 0.001), male offspring sex (OR: 1.423; P &lt; 0.01) and assisted conception (OR: 1.771; P &lt; 0.05) increased the risk for allergic sensitization. In contrast, maternal smoking (OR: 0.469; P &lt; 0.005), increasing parity (OR: 0.881; P &lt; 0.05), maternal pre-pregnancy overweight (OR: 0.742; P &lt; 0.005) and preterm birth (OR: 0.484; P &lt; 0.05) decreased the risk for allergic sensitization. Conclusions In addition to supporting previous findings, this study is first to report an increased risk of allergic sensitization after assisted conception. Beyond this finding’s potential implementation in preventative strategies, exploration of this association could further pathophysiological understanding of allergic disease.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Erythema multiforme (EM) is an acute, immune-mediated mucocutaneous disease, most often preceded by herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection or reactivation. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Mp) is considered the second major trigger of EM and is often associated with an atypical and more severe presentation of disease, characterized by prominent mucosal involvement. However, contrary to HSV-associated Erythema multiforme (HAEM), immunological mechanisms of Mp-associated EM remain unclear. Case presentation We present the case of a 50-year-old male patient presenting with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and erythema multiforme majus (EMM). Acute Mp infection was diagnosed by seroconversion, with no evidence of HSV infection as a cause of EMM. We performed immune phenotyping of blister fluid (BF) and peripheral blood (PB) T cells and detected a clonally expanded TCRVβ2 + T cell population that was double positive for CD4 and CD8, and expressed the cytotoxic markers granulysin and perforin. This CD4 + CD8 + population comprised up to 50.7% of BF T cells and 24.9% of PB T cells. Two years prior to the onset of disease, the frequency of PB CD4 + CD8 + T cells had been within normal range and it gradually returned to baseline levels with the resolution of symptoms, suggesting an involvement of this population in EMM disease pathophysiology. Conclusions This report is the first to provide a phenotypic description of lesional T cells in Mp-associated EMM. Characterizing the local immune response might help to address pathophysiological questions and warrants further systematic research.",

We sought to evaluate TCM effects in severe eczema in a 7-year-old male with refractory disease and corticosteroid withdrawal syndrome. Methods Prior to referral, the patient had been treated since infancy with increasingly intensive standard of care, including high-dose topical and systemic corticosteroid and antibiotic therapy and was unable to tolerate further steroid treatment. The patient was administered a combination of oral and topical TCM for 17 months following discontinuation of his steroid regimen. His overall medical condition was assessed by SCORAD criteria and laboratory evaluations of serum IgE, absolute eosinophil count, and liver and kidney function tests. Results The patient showed rapid improvement of clinical measures of disease after starting TCM therapy, with marked improvement of sleep quality within the first week, complete resolution of itching, oozing, and erythema at 2 weeks, and a 79% and 99% decrease in his SCORAD values after one month and 3–6 months of TCM, respectively. Serum total IgE decreased by 75% (from 19,000 to 4630 (kIU/L), and absolute eosinophil counts decreased by 60% (from 1000 to 427 cells/μL) after 12 months of treatment. The patient did not require oral or topical steroids during the 17-month trial of TCM. TCM was tapered without complications. His dermatologic manifestations continued to be well-controlled 3 months after discontinuation. Conclusion This case study suggests TCM should be further evaluated in controlled clinical studies of patients with severe, refractory eczema and steroid withdrawal syndrome.",

The association between perceived and probable food allergy and demographic characteristics was assessed through weighted multivariable random effects logistic regressions. Results Children, females, Canadian-born participants, adults with post-secondary education, and those residing in smaller households were more likely to report perceived or probable food allergy. Although immigrant parents self-reported less food allergy, Canadian-born children of Southeast/East Asian immigrant versus other immigrant or Canadian-born parents reported more food allergy.

Methods The dataset used for this study was inclusive of data from EMR initiation up to Dec 31st 2018. The sample included 1235 primary care providers representing 1,556,472 patients across Canada. Results In total, there were 536,005 patients with a documented allergy that fit into one of the 10 suggested categories. The allergy table includes 718,032 distinct entries representing 564,242 unique patients, which is 36.3% of the patients within the CPCSSN repository. The most common allergies recorded were drug allergy (39.0%), beta-lactam allergy (14.4%), environmental allergy (11.0%), and food allergy (8.0%). Anticipated upcoming studies include physician-documented drug allergy with a focus on beta-lactam allergy, as well as stinging insect allergy, among others. To our knowledge, these will also be the first such prevalence studies of primary care physician-documented allergic disease done in Canada. Interpretation The CPCSSN dataset represents electronic medical records from 1.5 million patients across Canada including documentation of allergic diseases. This dataset provides a national representative population to describe and characterize Canadian patients with common allergic conditions.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background A formulation of black cumin ( Nigella sativa L.), licorice ( Glycyrrhiza glabra L.), anise ( Pimpinella anisum L.) and tea ( Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze) (denoted BLAB tea) is traditionally used to relief allergy reaction including allergic rhinitis. However, little is known about its underlining mechanism of anti-allergic effects. Methods To investigate the anti-allergenic mechanism of BLAB tea, we treated ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic rhinitis (AR) model of mice with BLAB tea, and elucidated its possible mechanism of action. Mice in the control group were treated with phosphate-buffered saline only. Subsequently, the infiltration of different inflammatory cells was measured. In addition, histopathological changes in the nasal mucosa, and the levels of allergen-specific cytokines and OVA-specific immunoglobulins were measured. Results The aqueous extract of BLAB significantly alleviated the nasal symptoms and reduced the accumulation of inflammatory cells in the nasal mucosa and nasal lavage fluid of AR model of mice. Conclusion The aqueous extract of BLAB induced the production of Th1 and Treg cytokines and inhibited the release of Th2 cytokines and histamine in nasal mucosa and serum of mice while decreasing the serum levels of OVA-specific IgE, IgG1, and IgG2a. These results suggest the potential of the aqueous extract of BLAB as a treatment option for allergic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Epinephrine is the first line treatment for anaphylaxis, an acute potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. It is typically administered intramuscularly in the anterolateral thigh at a dose of 0.01 mg/kg of 1:1000 (1 mg/ml) solution to a maximum initial dose of 0.5 mg. Currently in Canada, epinephrine autoinjectors (EAI) are available in three doses, 0.15 mg, 0.30 mg, and 0.50 mg. There are currently no published studies comparing 0.3 mg and 0.5 mg EAIs in the paediatric or adult populations to compare clinical effectiveness. However, as weight increases above 30 kg, the percentage of the recommended 0.01 mg/kg epinephrine dose from an existing 0.3 mg EAI decreases resulting in potential underdosing. As such, The Canadian Society of Allergy and Immunology (CSACI) recommends that for those who weigh ≥ 45 kg, physicians could consider prescribing the 0.50 mg EAI based on shared decision making with patients.",

Conclusion:The data demonstrate a high level of cross-reactivity between birch-specific IgE and IgG4, and allergens from the birch homologous group, which suggests that the significant clinical effect determined previously for both birch and oak exposure may extend to the entire birch homologous group.",

Although complement dysregulation has historically been shown to be associated with various malignancy and immune disorders, it is currently not known if HAE patients are at an increased risk of developing malignancy or autoimmune conditions.We reviewed the charts of 49 HAE patients and identified 6 patients who had a co-existing malignancy diagnosis (two with breast cancer, one with melanoma, one with pancreatic cancer, one with renal cancer and one with cervical dysplasia) and 6 patients who had a diagnosis of a co-existing immune disorder (two with rheumatoid arthritis, two with ulcerative colitis, one with chronic urticaria with hypothyroidism and one with Sjogren's syndrome). Nearly all malignancy cases occurred in older HAE patients (> 50 years) and malignancy was diagnosed before HAE in 3 of the patients.Our case series identified multiple hereditary angioedema (HAE) patients with co-existing malignancy and immune disorders. Based on these findings, we would advocate that physicians managing HAE patients should maintain a high index of suspicion for these conditions and that in patients with angioedema, C1 inhibitor deficiency and malignancy, a diagnosis of HAE should still be considered in addition to acquired angioedema (AAE).",

Patients with chronic renal insufficiency have an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions with allopurinol. 75 year old male patient with gout, renal insufficiency, history of metastatic colorectal carcinoma status post-resection was referred to Allergy clinic for a maculopapular eruption that developed 1 week after initiating therapy with allopurinol. The rash resolved with discontinuation of allopurinol. However, his serum urate level rose to 19.9 mg/dl. We initially proposed a slow 4 week oral allopurinol desensitization. The treating nephrologist felt it was critical to lower urate more rapidly. As a result, we modified the dose and standard 4 week protocol down to 2 weeks. A suspension of allopurinol was prepared by the allergy nurse practitioner with a 300 mg allopurinol tablet. The sensitization protocol was modified as a starting dose of 0.3 mg escalating to a final dose of 300 mg/day in 2 weeks. There was no reaction during or after the desensitization. The patient's urate level normalized (6.3 mg/dl) and has continued on 300 mg allopurinol daily without reaction. A 2 week modified allopurinol desensitization protocol is a safe alternative for elderly patients with multiple comorbidities.",

Contamination of toys, books or other items by peanut butter in areas where individuals have eaten may occur in hospital waiting rooms and cafeterias. It is not known if hospital cleaning wipes are effective in removing peanut allergen.The purpose of this study was to determine whether cleaning peanut contaminated items with common household and hospital cleaning wipes would remove peanut allergen.5 mL of peanut butter was evenly smeared on a 12 inch by 12 inch (30.5 by 30.5 cm) square on a nonporous (laminated plastic) table surface, a plastic doll, and a textured plastic ball, and 2.5 mL was applied to smooth and textured book covers. Samples for measurement of Ara h 1 were collected prior to the application of the peanut butter (baseline), and after cleaning with a common household wipe and two commercial hospital wipes. A monoclonal-based ELISA for arachis hypogaea allergen 1 (Ara h 1), range of detection 1.95-2000 ng/mL, was used to assess peanut allergen on each item. The samples were diluted 1:50 for testing.At baseline, there was no detectable Ara h 1 allergen on any item at baseline. Detectable Ara h 1 was detected on all products after applying peanut butter (range 1.2-19.0 micrograms/mL). After cleaning with any product, no Ara h 1 was detected on any item.Table surfaces, book covers and plastic toys can be cleaned to remove peanut allergen Ara h 1 using common household and hospital cleaning wipes. Regular cleaning of these products or cleaning prior to their use should be promoted to reduce the risk of accidental peanut exposure, especially in areas where they have been used by many children.",

However, the food used for heated milk challenge is often prepared in a non-standardized manner by the parents at home, which may prove inconvenient and even sometimes raise concerns with regards to test validity. Instant skim milk powder is made by a food process that involves heating skim milk to up to 250 °C (390 °F) for up to 30 min which ought to be sufficient to denature thermo-labile proteins.To appraise the use of instant skim milk for the purpose of heated milk food challenge.We reviewed all oral food challenges to instant skim milk powder performed at Sainte-Justine University Hospital Center in Montreal, Canada between November 2008 and January 2013 (cumulative dose of 4 g proteins).During the study period, 39 children underwent an open food challenge to instant skim milk powder. Thirty patients (76.9 %) passed the challenge without clinical reaction, of which 26 successfully introduced heated milk products at home. The remaining four children reported intermittent mild reactions to specific forms of heated milk goods while they tolerated others. Subjects' clinical and paraclinical characteristics were comparable to previous cohorts evaluating baked milk challenge, which reported similar rates of heated milk positive challenges, ranging from 17 to 28 %.Challenge with instant skim milk powder could be a safe, convenient and easily standardizable alternative to home baked food for heated milk challenge. Further controlled studies are needed before this can be implemented to practice.",

The purpose is to report anaphylaxis to IGIV during initial infusion in a patient with common variable immunodeficiency with absent IgA without prior sensitization and in the absence of detectable IgG anti-IgA antibodies, and positive skin tests for immediate hypersensitivity to four different preparations of IGIV, one subcutaneous immunoglobulin preparation, and to purified IgA. Patient was treated without side effects with IGIV preparation depleted of IgA to which immediate hypersensitivity skin test was negative. This case demonstrates that patients with CVID with no IgA and without prior exposure to immunoglobulin or plasma may develop anaphylaxis following initial infusion of IGIV, which appears to be due to IgE anti-IgA, and independent of IgG anti-IgA antibodies. Since there is no good correlation between anaphylaxis/anaphylactic reactions and IgG anti-IgA antibodies, and IgE anti-IgA antibody test is commercially unavailable, we suggest that the patients with CVID with absence of IgA might be skin tested for immediate hypersensitivity prior to initiation of immunoglobulin administration. However, such recommendation may require studies on a large number of patients with CVID with no detectable IgA.",

The aim was to assess the accuracy and reproducibility (over a time-period of at least 12 months) of SPT to Ara h2 in comparison with four predictors of clinical peanut allergy (Peanut SPT, Ara h2 specific Immunoglobulin E (sIgE), Peanut sIgE and FeNO).

Their repeat assessment involved a questionnaire, SPT to peanut and Ara h2 purified protein, FeNO and sIgE to peanut and Ara h2 measurements. Ara h2 SPT was no worse in accuracy when compared with peanut SPT, FeNO, Ara h2 sIgE and peanut sIgE (AUC 0.908 compared with 0.887, 0.889, 0.935 and 0.804 respectively) for predicting allergic reaction at previous food challenge.

As secondary objectives, we compared trial disease definition to established concensus guidelines, and the efficacy of current EoE treatments. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and CINAHL since 2001. We also searched clinical trial registries (portal.nihr.ac.uk; clinicaltrials.gov; isrctn.com; and anzctr.org.au) and references of included studies. We included RCTs of EoE treatment in patients 0–18 years. Two authors independently assessed articles. Eleven studies met inclusion criteria. All identified primary outcomes, however, of 9 unique primary outcomes, only 2 were used in more than one study. In total, 25 unique primary and secondary outcome measures were employed for pediatric EoE treatment trials. Measurement properties and rationale for their selection was rarely provided. Uptake of consensus-based diagnostic criteria was 25 % in trials initiated after 2011. Due to the small number and heterogeneity of studies obtained, no meta-analysis of treatment efficacy could be undertaken. This SR was limited to exclusively pediatric RCTs. The results of this study confirm the need for a standardized set of core outcomes that are universally reported in pediatric EoE trials. Consistent disease definition and standardized outcome reporting will facilitate meta-analyses across similar trials and inform future clinical decision-making.

Although glucocorticoid therapy with or without immunosuppressants leads to remission in the majority of cases, most EGPA patients remain dependent on glucocorticoid therapy and experience frequent relapses. Here, we report a case of refractory EGPA which responded to stellate ganglion blocks (SGBs). Case presentation A 32-year-old woman with aggravated wheezing, purpura, numbness of multiple fingers, and epigastric and abdominal pain was referred to our clinic. Laboratory and radiographic studies led to the diagnosis of EGPA. After an initial favorable response to glucocorticoid and immunosuppressant therapy , she experienced a relapse during a glucocorticoid taper. We found that SGB brought symptomatic relief and impeded disease progression. The mechanism of action of SGB on EGPA is undetermined, but may be related to vasodilation, immune modulation, and central nervous system regulation. Conclusions This report not only proposes a novel treatment modality for EGPA, but also provides a clinical reference point for further in-depth studies of SGB in multiple immune-linked disorders.",

High density lipoprotein (HDL) often plays anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative roles by suppressing immune cell chemotaxis and activation. We aimed to explore the role of HDL in the regulation of group II innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) in allergic rhinitis (AR). Methods The blood lipid levels and their correlation with symptom scores of 20 AR subjects and 20 controls were analyzed. Purified ILC2 were stimulated by HDL and cytokines production were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and flow cytometry. The mRNA levels of GATA binding protein 3(GATA3) and retinoid-related orphan receptor α (RORα) expressed by ILC2 were detected using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results HDL level was significantly lower in AR than controls and correlated with the symptom scores. The serum HDL levels were negatively related to the increased number of ILC2, IL-5 + ILC2, and IL-13 + ILC2 in AR patients. HDL decreased the number of ILC2 and type II cytokines levels significantly by inhibiting expression of GATA3 and RORα. Conclusions Our data provide preliminary evidence that HDL may play a negative role in ILC2 inflammation in AR, suggesting that HDL may serve as promising treatment target in AR.",

Conclusions Food allergy education is necessary for the entire school community and should include parents of school-aged children with and without food allergy, students with and without food allergy, and teachers and school staff. These members of the school community recognized their own and others’ needs for increased food allergy education and awareness in the school setting.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism of action behind anaphylactic reactions to the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines remains unknown, but the excipient polyethylene glycol, PEG-2000, has been implicated. Initial recommendations were made for excipient testing with PEG-3350 to help risk stratify individuals and identify an etiology. Here we present a case of a patient with a history of polyethylene glycol anaphylaxis and positive skin testing to PEG-3350, who successfully received both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in a single step with only premedication.A 56-year-old man was referred to our clinic for assessment of his eligibility in receiving the COVID-19 vaccine given a history of anaphylaxis to PEG. He had two anaphylactic episodes: one in 2018 to methylprednisolone acetate intra-articular injection and one to oral PEG-3350 in 2020. Confirmatory skin prick testing was done in our clinic to PEG-3350 that was positive at 35 mm with appropriate positive and negative controls. Despite this he wanted to receive the PEG-containing mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and was counselled on the risks and benefits. He successfully received both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in a single step with only pre-treatment with Cetirizine 20 mg daily and Montelukast 10 mg daily for 5 days.In conclusion, our case demonstrates that a patient with a confirmed polyethylene glycol anaphylaxis could safely receive both doses of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in a single step with pre-treatment. We hope that our case will further support the limited role in skin testing to PEG in the assessment of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine allergy and highlight the need for further research to elucidate the mechanism of action behind these allergic reactions.",

History of the reaction to penicillin was poorly detailed even when patients required beta-lactam therapy (table 1). In the 87 patients who did require a beta-lactam, half received it without any skin testing, challenge or desensitization. No adverse reaction occurred. The main antibiotics used in the remaining patients were fluoroquinolones and vancomycin. Decision-making concerning the choice of antibiotic was documented in only 18%. Upon discharge, only two patients were referred to an allergy clinic for elective penicillin skin testing, even though referral was strongly indicated in 97 patients (table 2). Conclusion Penicillin allergy is a frequent problem in hospital practice. Its management is not optimal in most cases.

This is particularly true of those conditions that change in frequency as populations develop from the human \"environment of evolutionary adaptedness\" to the living conditions of the rich industrialized countries. This development entails major changes in lifestyle, leading to reductions in contact with environmental microorganisms and helminths that have evolved a physiologic role as drivers of immunoregulatory circuits. It is suggested that a deficit in immunoregulation in rich countries is contributing not only to increases in the incidence of allergic disorders but also to increases in other chronic inflammatory conditions that are exacerbated by a failure to terminate inappropriate inflammatory reponses. These include autoimmunity, neuroinflammatory disorders, atherosclerosis, depression associated with raised inflammatory cytokines, and some cancers.",

We hypothesize, that lower DC density in deeper cutaneous compartments and/or different DC subsets exhibiting distinct functional immunomodulatory properties in the various layers of the skin may confer to the observed absence of clinical reactivity against prilocaine after deep subcutaneous injection.The term compartment allergy indicates that the route of allergen administration together with the targeted immunologic environment orchestrates on the immunologic outcome: overt T-cell mediated allergy or clinical tolerance.",

We explore the serologic response of patients with moderate to severe asthma to the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23).Seventeen moderate to severe adult asthma patients that had not been vaccinated against pneumococcus over the 5 previous years were prospectively recruited from a tertiary care asthma clinic. Serum was analyzed for the presence of antibodies to five capsular polysaccharide (CP) antigens (6B, 9V, 19A, 19F, 23F) before and 4 weeks after PPSV23 vaccination.There was a wide variability in baseline anti-CP antibody concentrations. Other than for serotype 19A, our patients frequently have baseline anti-CP antibody concentrations below 1 µg/mL (35% for serotype 19F, 41% for serotypes 9V and 23F, and 59% for serotype 6B). All post-vaccination geometric mean antibody concentrations were significantly higher than baseline. In the 31 tests where the baseline antibody concentration was <1 µg/mL, 77.4% had at least a twofold increase post-vaccination. Despite this, a large proportion of post-vaccination anti-CP antibody concentrations remained <1 µg/mL (51.6% of tests). Nine patients had at least one anti-CP antibody concentration <1 µg/mL post-vaccination. There was no difference between these patients and the remaining eight patients in demographic or clinical variables.Patients with moderate to severe asthma have variable baseline and low post-vaccination antibody concentrations to common CP antigens included in the PPSV23 vaccine. The clinical relevance of these observations remains to be determined since the threshold concentration in adults required for clinical protection from invasive pneumococcal disease is uncertain.",

    "abstract": "There is ongoing controversy surrounding the appropriate standards and limits of accommodation of children with food allergies in schools. We identify and explain how relevant Canadian common law, legislation, constitutional law and human rights policy can inform future school policy around allergy, disability and food bans. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies to governmental laws or policies, including the policies of schools, and grants every individual the right to freedom from discrimination based on, among other things, disability. Canadian constitutional and human rights law define disability broadly including perceived disabilities. Provincial human rights tribunals in both Ontario and BC have explicitly found allergy to be a disability requiring accommodation, even in cases not involving anaphylaxis risk. However, the cases most pertinent to the scenarios faced by schools have found that food bans may not be required, due to recent scientific evidence that they do not render allergy sufferers safer. Anaphylaxis-level allergy constitutes a disability under both the Charter and human rights legislation, despite the fact that higher courts have not definitively ruled on the matter. Accordingly, schools must make careful decisions about how to deal with life-threatening allergies among their students. Food bans are generally not legally necessary, and, in the absence of new legislation, are only likely to become so if sufficient scientific evidence demonstrates that they increase safety for students. School policies should be substantially informed by evidence-based research in order to ensure ongoing congruence with human rights law.",

    "abstract": "Omalizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody widely used for treatment of persistent allergic asthma and antihistamine-refractory chronic urticaria. Immediate adverse events to omalizumab are well characterized. Delayed anaphylactoid and serum sickness-like reactions have also been described; however, their relationship to the drug remains uncertain, and the frequency is unknown. We present a case of a 59-year old female who developed amyopathic dermatomyositis (DM) after receiving omalizumab infusions for steroid-refractory severe asthma. After 6 months of omalizumab, the patient developed an erythematous, intensely pruritic cutaneous eruption. Skin biopsy indicated nonspecific features of dermatitis. However, neither topical corticosteroids nor gabapentin and maximal doses of multiple antihistamines gave her relief. On follow-up clinical exam 8 months later, she had classic cutaneous features of dermatomyositis, with confirmatory repeat skin biopsy. Laboratory investigations revealed negative myositis specific antibodies, positive antinuclear antibody, and negative anti-histone antibodies. Creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase levels and C-reactive protein were also within normal limits. These findings supported the clinical impression of amyopathic DM. The patient's symptoms improved with oral corticosteroid therapy. A malignancy screen was negative. There was no evidence of end organ dysfunction. Dermatomyositis is not a known adverse effect of omalizumab therapy. DM has a low incidence, but potentially life threatening consequences. Amyopathic DM may represent up to 21% of cases of DM, with similar risks of malignancy and end organ dysfunction. DM has been associated with biologic therapy. Using the Naranjo adverse drug reaction (ADR) probability scale, our patient had a \"probable\" omalizumab related ADR. A more likely explanation is that the patient had underlying DM that remained occult due to chronic corticosteroid therapy. Our case highlights the need for clinical vigilance and maintenance of a broad differential when patients on biologic therapies present with cutaneous eruptions. In our patient, the cutaneous clinical features of DM became pronounced over serial assessments. Laboratory markers may be deceptively normal, as in amyotrophic DM, or confounded by ongoing corticosteroid therapy. There are important clinical implications of prompt diagnosis, given the association of DM with end organ disease including interstitial lung disease, and possible concomitant malignancy.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophils play an important role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It has recently been reported that in addition to T helper (Th) 17 cells, other cells, including neutrophils, produce IL-17A, an important inflammatory cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of RA. The purpose of this study was to examine the presence of interleukin 17A-producing neutrophils in patients with RA. We performed a cross-sectional study including 106 patients with RA and 56 healthy individuals. Whole peripheral blood cells were analyzed by flow cytometry to identify CD66b+ CD177+ IL-17A+ neutrophils and CD3+ CD4+ IL-17A+ T cells. Serum levels of IL-17A and IL-6 were measured by means of cytometry bead array (CBA). In purified neutrophils, mRNA levels of IL-17 and RORγ were measured by RT-PCR. In addition, purified neutrophils from patients and healthy controls were stimulated with the cytokines IL-6 and IL-23 to evaluate differences in their capacity to produce IL-17A. Neutrophils from RA patients expressed IL-17 and RORγ mRNA. Consequently, these cells also expressed IL-17A. Serum IL-17A levels but not Th17 cell numbers were increased in RA patients. Neutrophils positive for cytoplasmic IL-17A were more abundant in patients with RA (mean 1.2 ± 3.18%) than in healthy individuals (mean 0.07 ± 0.1%) (p < 0.0001). Although increased IL-17A+ neutrophil numbers were present in RA patients regardless of disease activity (mean 6.5 ± 5.14%), they were more frequent in patients with a more recent diagnosis (mean time after disease onset 3.5 ± 4.24 years). IL-6 and IL-23 induced the expression of RORγ but failed to induce IL-17A expression by neutrophils from RA patients and healthy individuals after a 3 h stimulation. IL-17A-producing neutrophils are increased in some RA patients, which are not related to disease activity but have an increased frequency in patients with recent-onset disease. This finding suggests that IL-17A-producing neutrophils play an early role in the development of RA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare primary immunodeficiency disorder caused by a defect in the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase complex. The disease primarily presents with recurrent infections, and patients may also present with inflammatory conditions, including noninfectious colitis, and an increased frequency of autoimmunity. We report here a patient with CGD in whom the presentation, unlike the classical presentation of CGD, was predominantly of an inflammatory and autoimmune phenotype. Case presentation A 3-year-old Pakistani female presented with bloody diarrhea since the age of 7 days, followed by the development of perianal abscesses and fistula. There was no other history of recurrent infections. The patient subsequently developed joint pain and stiffness with persistently elevated inflammatory markers and elevated anti-cyclic citrullinate peptide (anti-CCP) antibody titer. She was diagnosed with oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and colitis. The diagnosis of CGD was later made and was based on the absence of NADPH oxidase activity in the patient’s neutrophils upon phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulation using the dihydrorhodamine-1,2,3 (DHR) flow cytometry test. Targeted next-generation sequencing revealed an unreported deletion mutation in exon 10 as a homozygous loss-of-function variant of the human neutrophil oxidase factor 2 ( NCF2 ) ( NCF2 : NM_001190789, nucleotide change: c.855_856del:p.T285fs). The gene encodes a protein subunit, p67 phox , in the NADPH enzyme complex. Conclusions The case emphasizes the importance of maintaining high clinical suspicion of immunodeficiency and CGD in patients with very-early-onset colitis and autoimmune disorders. This case is important due to its rarity and because it might represent a previously undiscovered mutation, which is possibly more common in the patient’s ethnic group. Other mutations in NCF2 have been linked to inflammatory bowel disease and autoimmunity, but without CGD, suggesting similarities in the pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Allergy to Vespa affinis venom is common in the Asia Pacific region. Venom preparations for diagnosis are not commercially available for this species.The prominent allergens in V. affinis venom were identifiedusing immunochemical methods. Use of ImmunoCAP of Vespula vulgaris crude venom/its components and a passive basophil activation test (BAT) in the diagnosis of patients who had anaphylaxis to V. affinis venom (n = 30) were also accessed. The IgE double-positivity rates (positive to both hornet and honeybee) in ImmunoCAP and the passive BAT were determined.High IgE reactivity was seen with the five allergens in V. affinis venom; 96% (29/30) for 34 and 24 kDa, 93% (28/30) for 45 kDa and 90% (27/30) reactivity for the 100 and 80 kDa respectively. IgE cross-reactivity was low with ImmunoCAP using V. vulgaris venom (43%; 13/30) and Ves v1 (3%; 1/30), but relatively high with Ves v5 (73%; 22/30). All patients (100%) were positive to V. affinis venom in passive BAT. In ImmunoCAP, a high double-positivity rate (76%; 23/30) was detected while no double-positivity was detected in passive BAT.High IgE reactivity for five allergens of V. affinis points to the potential of using these allergens in component resolved diagnosis (CRD). The passive BAT has shown its importance as a promising diagnostic tool with high accuracy. It would be particularly useful in cases with doubtful double-positive results of other diagnostic tests.",

    "abstract": "Fatigue, sleep disturbance and altered mood are frequently reported in patients with primary antibody deficiency syndrome (PADS) on adequate immunoglobulin replacement therapy. This study aimed to determine the frequency of symptoms compatible with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) in patients with PADS.The study involved the distribution of 682 self-completed postal questionnaires to ascertain the presence and frequency of symptoms compatible with CFS in patients with PADS. The reporting of symptoms for each patient were scored against the CFS diagnostic criteria used within our own South London Chronic Fatigue service.The frequency of symptoms compatible with CFS were evident in 26 of the 188 patients (16.25%) returning adequately completed questionnaires. We considered a bias in the return of questionnaires amongst PADS patients with fatigue to be likely. As such we estimated the minimum frequency of CFS in patients with PADS to be 4% based on the 682 PAD patients to whom the questionnaire was distributed. This was significantly higher than the 0.5% estimate of the prevalence of CFS in the community in western populations. While the presence of significant fatigue correlated with the presence of anxiety and depression, there was no association with self-reported lung damage. Sleep disturbance affected 60% of the PAD patients returning satisfactory questionnaires and as expected the CFS score was higher in those with greater physical limitation.We conclude that patients with PADS have a high frequency of fatigue, low mood and anxiety. We suggest routine questioning for the symptoms of fatigue, disturbed sleep and altered mood in patients with PADS. The use of several treatment strategies in CFS may prove beneficial in improving the quality of life of patients with PAD.",

The TGF-β/Smad signal transduction pathway plays an important role in allergic bronchial asthma. However, the effect of M. vaccae nebulization on the TGF-β/Smad signal transduction pathway in mouse models of allergic asthma remains unclear. This study investigated the preventive effect of M. vaccae nebulization during bronchial asthma in a mouse model and elucidate the implication of TGF-β/Smad signal transduction pathway in the process.In total, 24 female Balb/c mice were randomized to normal control (group A), asthma control (group B), and M. vaccae nebulization (group C) groups. Both groups B and C were sensitized using ovalbumin for establishment of the asthmatic model; group A received phosphate-buffered solution. Prior to the establishment of asthma, Group C was nebulized with M. vaccae. Airway responsiveness was measured in all the groups, using a noninvasive lung function machine before and 24 h after establishment of the asthmatic model. The animals were then harvested, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue were collected. The total cell counts in BALF was estimated. Protein expression of TGF-β1, TβR1, Smad1, and Smad7 was detected by immunohistochemistry. The population of CD3 + γδT, IL-13 + CD3 + T, TGF-β + CD3 + T, IL-13 + CD3 + γδT, and TGF-β+ CD3+ γδT cells were detected by flow cytometry. One-way analysis of variance for within-group comparisons, the least significant difference t-test or Student-Newman-Keuls test for intergroup comparisons, and the nonparametric rank sum test for analysis of airway inflammation scores were used in the study.The eosinophil count; protein expression of TGF-β1, TβR1, and Smad1; and percentages of CD3 + γδT and IL-13 + CD3 + T cells were significantly lower in the M. vaccae nebulization group than in the asthma control group (P < 0.01). There were significant intergroup differences in the percentages of TGF-β + CD3 + T and IL-13 + CD3 + γδT cells (P < 0.05).Mycobacterium vaccae nebulization could confer protection against allergic bronchial asthma by reducing airway responsiveness and alleviating airway inflammation in mice. The underlying mechanism might be attributed its effect on the deregulated expression of TGF-β1, TβR1, Smad1, and Smad7 of the TGF-β/Smad signal transduction pathway.",

Although the environment and lifestyle of the Korean people have recently undergone rapid changes, corresponding changes in the characteristics of AR patients have not been well documented. Therefore, we aimed to outline the changes in allergens and clinical manifestations of AR in Korean patients from the 1990s and 2010s. We reviewed 1447 and 3388 AR patients who visited the same tertiary hospital in the 1990s and 2010s, respectively. All patients were diagnosed with AR based on the presence of characteristic symptoms, positive skin prick test results, and answered a symptom questionnaire at the time of visit. We compared differences in the allergens and results of the symptom questionnaire between the two sets of patients. When compared with the 1990s, the rate of sensitization to house dust mites, cockroaches, Aspergillus, Alternaria, and tree pollen significantly increased and that to cat fur significantly decreased in patients from the 2010s (all P < 0.05). Male predominance was observed with two peaks in the age distribution of patients from the 2010s. The proportion of patients with moderate-to-severe nasal obstruction and itching of the nose/eye increased (each P < 0.05) and that of patients with minor symptoms such as olfactory disturbances, cough, sore throat, and fatigue also increased (all P < 0.01) in the 2010s. Allergen reactivity and type and symptom severity in Korean AR patients significantly varied between the 1990s and 2010s. Our results may therefore be helpful for patient counseling and management.",

Despite this, there is a relative scarcity of data concerning the development of food-related allergic disease in the adult population. In addition, the paucity of data as it pertains to the Canadian population is particularly marked when compared to other nations. We sought to determine common culprit foods and the reactions they elicited in a series of 14 patients seen in the Winnipeg allergy and immunology clinic. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of patients identified by academic allergists in Winnipeg, Manitoba as fitting criteria for adult-onset IgE-mediated food allergy from May 2018–July 2020. We included patients with IgE-mediated symptoms, including the pollen-food syndrome which developed at the age of 16 or later. We collected data regarding the food which induced the reaction, what the reaction was, and any concomitant atopic disease. Results The most common culprit food identified was shellfish, followed by finfish, pollen-food syndrome, and wheat/flour. The most common reaction experienced was anaphylaxis, followed by food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis and isolated (muco)cutaneous symptoms. With regard to concomitant atopic disease, allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis stood out as the most prevalent. Conclusions Adult-onset food allergy—particularly with resultant anaphylaxis—is an important phenomenon to recognize, even when patients have previously tolerated the food in question.",

    "abstract": "This differential diagnosis of allergic vs non-allergic asthma is typically made on the basis of sensitization to allergens, such that absence of sensitization could result in a patient being managed as having non-allergic asthma. In Germany, the number of specific allergen tests is limited and non-standardized (across clinicians and laboratories), with the potential for false negative diagnoses. IDENTIFY aimed to gain data on sensitizations toward aeroallergens in patients with severe asthma who had tested negative to perennial aeroallergens in previous tests. This was a single visit, non-randomized, non-interventional study conducted in 87 centers across Germany. The only inclusion criteria were that patients had to be adults (at least 18 years of age) with a diagnosis of severe asthma (receiving at least Global Initiative for Asthma Step IV therapy), and who had previously tested negative to perennial aeroallergens. Patients were then tested for sensitization to a panel of 35 perennial aeroallergens, with positive sensitization indicated by CAP ≥ 0.35 kU/L. Of 588 patients recruited, 454 had complete and valid data, and had previously tested negative to perennial aeroallergens. Overall, 43.6% of the analyzed patients tested positive for at least one of the included aeroallergens, with 18.7% testing positive for three or more, and 4.2% positive for more than ten. The five most common sensitizations were to Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B, Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, Dermatophagoides farinae, and Rhizopus nigricans, each of which tested positive in at least 9.7% of the population. In this group of patients being managed as having non-allergic asthma (and who had all previously tested negative to perennial aeroallergens), a high proportion tested positive to a broad panel of aeroallergens. A diagnosis of allergic asthma therefore cannot be excluded purely on the basis of standard aeroallergen panels.",

This paper examines the effects of grass SLIT-T in Canadians. Data for grass-allergic Canadians in three randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials were analyzed post hoc: 1) adults ≥18 y, grass-pollen season [GPS] 2009; 2) children 5– <18 y, 2009; and 3) adults 18–65 y and children 5– <18 y, GPS 2012. Data from the GPS 2009 trials were pooled to provide a more precise estimate of treatment effects than the individual studies would provide. In every trial, participants received once-daily grass SLIT-T or placebo approximately 12 weeks before and continuing throughout the GPS. Participants used daily electronic diaries to record AR/C symptoms and medication use for treatment of symptoms. The therapeutic effect of grass SLIT-T was measured as a total combined score (TCS = daily symptom score + daily medication score) averaged over the entire GPS. Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events (AEs). In the three trials, 386 Canadian participants were randomized; the overall population had 2284 participants. Canadian participants treated with grass SLIT-T in the pooled adult-pediatric 2009 trials showed a 38% mean TCS reduction relative to placebo (-2.06 difference [95% CI: -3.72, -0.39]; 3.32 vs. 5.37). Participants treated with grass SLIT-T in the adult-pediatric 2012 trial showed a 37% median TCS reduction relative to placebo (-1.53 difference [95% CI: -2.1, -0.3]; 2.58 vs. 4.11). Similar efficacy findings were observed over the peak GPS. Approximately 90% of treatment-related AEs were mild or moderate in severity. Two Canadian participants had moderate systemic allergic reactions (skin, respiratory, abdominal symptoms) to grass SLIT-T; symptoms resolved within 1 hour without medical intervention or treatment. No serious or life-threatening treatment-related AEs occurred. The 2800 BAU Timothy grass SLIT-T significantly improved AR/C induced by Timothy grass pollen in adults and children ≥5 y in Canadians, which was consistent with the robust efficacy observed in the overall trial population. The treatment was generally well tolerated. Clinicaltrials.gov identifiers NCT00562159 , NCT00550550 , NCT01385371 .",

Twelve-week-old NC/Nga mice were divided into 6 groups (n = 8 for each group): hydrophilic petrolatum only (control); hydrophilic petrolatum plus ASD (ASD); hydrophilic petrolatum and heat inactivated-ASD (H-ASD); Dermatophagoides farinae extract (Df); Df and ASD (Df + ASD), and; Df and H-ASD (Df + H-ASD). The NC/Nga mice in each group were subjected to treatment twice a week for 4 weeks. We evaluated skin lesions by symptoms, pathologic changes, and serum IgE levels. ASD alone did not induce atopic dermatitis (AD)-like skin symptoms. However, Df alone, Df + H-ASD and Df + ASD all induced AD-like symptoms, and dermatitis scores in the group of Df + ASD group were significantly greater than that of the Df group (P = 0.0011 at day 21; and P = 0.017 at day 28). Mean serum IgE was markedly increased in the Df and Df + ASD groups, compared to the ASD and control groups (P < 0.0001), and serum IgE levels in the Df + ASD group were significantly higher compared to the Df group (P = 0.003). ASD alone did not cause AD-like symptoms in NC/Nga mice. However, AD-like symptoms induced by Df, a major allergen, were enhanced by adding ASD. Although no epidemiological studies have been conducted for the association between ASD and symptoms of dermatitis, our data suggest that it is likely that ASD may contribute to the exacerbation of not only respiratory symptoms, but also skin diseases, in susceptible individuals.",

    "abstract": "Methods The objectives of this study were to explore preferences surrounding attributes of RSV using proxy- and selfperspectives. Time trade-off (TTO) and best-worst scaling were used to derive utilities for health states of RSV and determine relative preferences for different levels of disease attributes. Vignettes were constructed from focus group data and expert opinion. Respondents were randomized to either a child perspective (“imagine that your child has RSV”), or an adult perspective (“imagine that you have RSV”). Experimental design for the BWS was developed using Sawtooth Software. 1000 Canadians were recruited through a market research panel facilitating a societal perspective. Five attributes were used – hospitalization status, oxygen support, presence of tubes (IV/NG), breathing symptom severity, and risk of long term wheeze. Ethics approval was obtained from the UBC BREB. Respondents completed both TTO and BWS tasks. Results Disutility associated with the short term health state of RSV was significant. Disutility followed an expected gradient, with more time traded for more severe RSV, and less time traded for less severe RSV (mean range: 0.57 – 0.14). Utilities were lower in the child perspective than the adult perspective. 0% risk of long term risk of wheeze was most preferred over all other attributes, and respiratory failure was least preferred (-4.7). Strong negative preferences were similar for IV/NG (-3.3), ICU admission (-3.5), mechanical ventilation (-3.6), and severe breathing problems (-3.6). Utility associated with risk of wheeze became lower as risk increased, with a relative preference for 80% risk of wheeze (-2.8) between moderate (-1.5) and severe (-3.7) breathing problems. Conclusions Preferences indicate societal willingness to accept immediate, short term, potentially clinically significant consequences to avoid long term risk of wheeze. This study provides utilities that can be utilized for the evaluation of any potential or proposed treatment of RSV in children, and is important to understanding and applying priorities in health care.",

    "abstract": "Bronchoprovocation challenges use direct or indirect acting stimuli to induce airflow obstruction. Indirect stimuli either non-allergic/non-IgE mediated (e.g. exercise, mannitol) or allergic/IgE mediated (i.e. allergen) trigger mast cells to release bronchoconstricting mediators (e.g. cysteinyl leukotrienes, histamine). Performing repeat challenges within a short timeframe (e.g. 3 h) with non-allergic indirect stimuli results in a diminished, refractory response to the second challenge that is inhibited by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications. Cross refractoriness occurs between indirect stimuli. It follows that repeat bronchoprovocation with allergen might exhibit refractoriness that might be altered by ibuprofen. We assessed the response to a second allergen challenge performed 24 h after an initial allergen challenge to determine if the response is refractory. If refractoriness developed, the study aimed to determine whether a single dose of ibuprofen would alter the refractory response to the second allergen challenge. In the absence of a refractory response, the study design allowed for the assessment of the effect of ibuprofen on allergen challenge outcomes, including indices of airway inflammation.Thirteen mild atopic asthmatics were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over study. Ibuprofen (400 mg) or placebo was administered 1 h prior to the first of two allergen challenges, performed 24 h apart. Blood and sputum eosinophils, airway responsiveness to methacholine and levels of fractional exhaled nitric oxide were assessed before and 7 h after each allergen challenge. All data were log transformed and differences in geometric means were analyzed by paired t-tests.After placebo, early asthmatic responses for the two challenges were not significantly different (p = 0.82). A single 400 mg dose of ibuprofen decreased both the early (p = 0.03; n = 12) and late asthmatic responses (p = 0.03; n = 3).Allergen challenges conducted 24 h apart do not exhibit refractoriness. Single dose ibuprofen inhibits early and late asthmatic responses to allergen bronchoprovocation. Ibuprofen should be withheld for at least 24 h prior to investigations utilizing allergen bronchoprovocation. Trial registration clinicaltrials.gov #NCT02327234.",

    "abstract": "Food allergy is a common clinical problem in adults. Given logistical barriers to conducting food challenges, the use of skin prick test (SPT) and specific IgE (sIgE) are important in establishing the diagnosis. The purpose of this study is to investigate the agreement of SPT and sIgE results in adults presenting to an allergy clinic with suspected food allergy. Retrospective analysis of medical records at the University of Alberta Allergy Clinic between September 2013 and May 2015 was performed. Demographic, medical history as well as SPT and specific IgE results were recorded. Agreement of SPT and sIgE for individual food allergens was analyzed by Kappa statistics. Data from 260 patients was collected. The population was predominantly female, often having other atopic diseases. Very few food challenges were performed; IgE mediated food allergy was diagnosed in a minority (29.6 %) of cases. Kappa values which reached statistical significance were moderate for peanut ĸ = 0.535 (p = 0.0002, CI 0.364–0.707), walnut ĸ = 0.408 (p = 0.001 CI 0.159–0.657), pecan ĸ = 0.530 (p = 0.001 CI 0.211–0.848), and lobster ĸ = 0.543 (p = 0.004 CI 0.197–0.889), substantial for pistachio ĸ = 0.657 (p = 0.023 CI 0.224–1.000), codfish ĸ = 0.770 (p = 0.0002 CI 0.558–0.983), shrimp ĸ = 0.627 (p = 0.0006 CI 0.383–0.871) and egg white ĸ = 0.625 (p = 0.002 CI 0.293–0.957), almost perfect for cashew ĸ = 0.894 (p = 0.0008 CI 0.693–1.000) and salmon ĸ = 0.874 (p = 0.004 CI 0.705–1.000). The agreement between SPT and sIgE results on adults being evaluated for food allergy is at least moderate or better for peanut, walnut, pecan, pistachio, cashew, lobster, shrimp, codfish, salmon and egg white. This should be reassuring for patients who have contraindications or restricted access to either test as the results for the above allergens will likely agree. These findings may suggest that these tests could possibly be interchangeable in adults being evaluated for suspected food allergy and will aid primary care physicians in the triage of patients requiring allergist care.",

Skin test and RAST scores both differed significantly from clinical severity (p < .05), but there was a significant correlation between skin test reactivity and RAST score (p = .042). There was no correlation between skin test reactivity and time since reaction (Spearman's coefficient = 0.18, p = .294) nor between RAST and time since reaction (r = 0.1353, p = .438).

    "abstract": "Abstract With the judicious use of inhaled corticosteroids, β 2 agonists, and leukotriene modifiers, most patients with asthma are easily controlled and managed. However, approximately 5% of asthmatics do not respond to standard therapy and are classified as \"difficult to control.\" [1] Typically, these are patients who complain of symptoms interfering with daily living despite long-term treatment with inhaled corticosteroids in doses up to 2,000 μg daily. Many factors can contribute to poor response to conventional therapy, and especially for these patients, a systematic approach is needed to identify the underlying causes. First, the diagnosis of asthma and adherence to the medication regimen should be confirmed. Next, potential persisting exacerbating triggers need to be identified and addressed. Concomitant disorders should be discovered and treated. Lastly, the impact and implications of socioeconomic and psychological factors on disease control can be significant and should be acknowledged and discussed with the individual patient. Less conventional and novel strategies for treating corticosteroid-resistant asthma do exist. However, their use is based on small studies that do not meet evidence-based criteria; therefore, it is essential to sort through and address the above issues before reverting to other therapy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Trained immunity is the ability of the innate immune system to form immune memory responses to provide support the formation of appropriate adaptive responses. Allergic airways disease (AAD) is a maladapted immune response to allergens, initiated and maintained by the type 2 (T2) inflammatory pathway. It is predicated by the elaboration of cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 and follows activation of the STAT6 transcription factor. Objective To investigate the role of trained immunity in mucosal immune responses following neonatal vaccination with the STAT6 inhibitory peptide (STAT6-IP), in preventing the development of ragweed-induced AAD. Methods We demonstrate that transfer of CD4 + T cells or dendritic cells (DC) from STAT6-IP vaccinated wild-type BALB/c mice to naïve mice, that were subsequently chronically exposed to sensitizing doses of ragweed allergen, is sufficient to prevent development of T2 responses in recipients. Results Our results demonstrate significant reductions in; airways hyperresponsiveness (AHR); ragweed-specific IgE; pulmonary inflammation; T2 cytokines; and inflammatory gene expressions in recipient mice. Expression of IDO, TGFβ and T regulatory cells were all significantly increased. Anti-TGFβ treatment during the ragweed sensitization phase re-constituted the pro-inflammatory T2 immune response. We show that tolerance can be attained via DC trained in the STAT6-IP-mediated tolerant milieu. This effect is not restricted to a particular allergen and does not require antigen-mediated T cell activation prior to transfer. Conclusion Adoptive transfer experiments suggest that STAT6-IP treatment trains dendritic and cells to mediate tolerant immunity to chronic ragweed exposure in the airways. This indicates that early transient STAT6-inhibition constitutes an effective immunomodulatory airways allergy preventative strategy.",

Methods The effects of IL-35 on cell proliferation, cytokine expression, and histamine release in a human mast cell line (HMC­1) were investigated by CCK8, ELISA, or RT-PCR. The phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK1/2, in PMA plus A23187 induced HMC-1 cells was detected by Western Blot. Results We found that IL-35 significantly inhibited the proliferation of HMC-1 cells stimulated by PMA and A23187. IL-35 also down-regulates the release of histamine and the mRNA expression of IL-6 and IL-17 in activated HMC-1. Furthermore, IL-35 markedly inhibited the phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK1/2, in PMA plus A23187 induced HMC-1 cells.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Recent research has pointed out the important roles of epigenetic modifications in the development and persistence of allergic rhinitis (AR), especially in relation to DNA methylation of disease-associated genes. We investigated whether AR susceptibility genes were epigenetically regulated, and whether methylation modulation of these genes in response to early-life environment could be a molecular mechanism underlying the risk for AR onset in a cohort of children aged 3–6 years in China. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples were collected from 130 children patients, aged 3–6 years and diagnosed with AR; and 154 matched controls to detect promoter methylation in 25 AR susceptibility genes with the MethylTarget approach. Methylation levels were compared for each CpG site, each amplified region, and each gene. In addition, the relationship among DNA methylation, early-life environmental risk factors and AR onset were assessed. Results Maternal allergic history (P = 0.0390) and pet exposure (P = 0.0339) were significantly associated with increased AR risk. Differential methylation analyses were successfully performed for 507 CpG sites, 34 amplified regions and 17 genes and significant hypomethylation was observed in the promoter region of ADAM33 in AR patients [multiple test-corrected (FDR) P-value &lt; 0.05]. Spearman correlation analysis revealed that the hypomethylation of ADAM33 was significantly associated with higher eosinophil counts (Spearman’s ρ: − 0.187, P-value = 0.037). According to the results of the multiple regression analysis, after adjusting for cofounders, the interaction of early-life pet exposure with methylation level of ADAM33 increased the risk for AR onset 1.423 times more in children (95% CI = 0.0290–4.109, P-value = 0.005). Conclusion This study provides evidence that early-life pet exposure and low methylation level of ADAM33 increase AR risk in children, and the interaction between pet exposure and methylation level of ADAM33 may play an important role in the development of AR.",

We conducted a content analysis of promotional asthma-related posts on Instagram to understand whether promoted products and services are consistent with the recommendations found in the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) 2019 guidelines. Methods We collected every Instagram post incorporating a common, asthma-related hashtag between September 29, 2019 and October 5, 2019. Of these 2936 collected posts, we analyzed a random sample of 266, of which, 211 met our inclusion criteria. Using an inductive, qualitative approach, we categorized the promotional posts and compared each post’s content with the recommendations contained in the 2019 GINA guidelines. Posts were categorized as “consistent with GINA” if the content was supported by the GINA guidelines. Posts that promoted content that was not recommended by or was unrelated to the guidelines were categorized as “not supported by GINA”. Results Of 211 posts, 89 (42.2%) were promotional in nature. Of these, a total of 29 (32.6%) were categorized as being consistent with GINA guidelines. The majority of posts were not supported by the guidelines. Forty-one (46.1%) posts promoted content that was not recommended by the current guidelines. Nineteen (21.3%) posts promoted content that was unrelated to the guidelines. The majority of unsupported content promoted non-pharmacological therapies (n = 39, 65%) to manage asthma, such as black seed oil, salt-room therapy, or cupping. Conclusions The majority of Instagram posts in our sample promoted products or services that were not supported by GINA guidelines. These findings suggest a need for providers to discuss online health information with patients and highlight an opportunity for providers and social media companies to promote evidence-based asthma treatments and self-management advice online.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a rare but serious delayed hypersensitivity reaction that can be caused by antibiotic exposure. The reaction typically develops in 2 to 6 weeks. The pathophysiology is thought to involve toxic drug metabolites acting as a hapten, triggering a systemic response. The diagnosis is made clinically but can be confirmed using assays such as the lymphocyte toxicity assay (LTA), which correlates cell death upon exposure to drug metabolites with susceptibility to hypersensitivity reactions. Case presentations Case 1 involves a previously healthy 11-month-old male with first exposure to amoxicillin-clavulanate, prescribed for seven days to treat a respiratory infection. The patient developed DRESS fourteen days after starting the drug and was successfully treated with corticosteroids. LTA testing confirmed patient susceptibility to hypersensitivity reactions with amoxicillin-clavulanate. Parental samples were also tested, showing both maternal and paternal susceptibility. Neither parent reported prior hypersensitivity reactions. Lifelong penicillin avoidance for the patient was advised along with the notation in medical records of penicillin allergy. The parents were advised to avoid penicillin class antibiotics and be monitored closely for DRESS if they are exposed. Case 2 involves an 11-year-old female with atopic dermatitis with first exposure to amoxicillin-clavulanate, prescribed for ten days to treat a secondary bacterial skin infection. She developed DRESS eleven days after starting antibiotics and was successfully treated with corticosteroids. LTA testing confirmed patient susceptibility to hypersensitivity reactions with amoxicillin-clavulanate. Maternal samples were also tested and showed sensitivity. The mother reported no prior hypersensitivity reactions. Lifelong penicillin avoidance for the patient was advised along with the notation in medical records of penicillin allergy. Conclusions Amoxicillin-clavulanate is a commonly used antibiotic and the cases we have described suggest that it should be recognized as a potential cause of DRESS in pediatric patients. Furthermore, these cases contribute to current literature supporting that there may be a shorter latent period in DRESS induced by antibiotics. We have also shown that the LTA can be a helpful tool to confirm DRESS reactions, and that testing may have potential implications for family members.",

Although hen’s eggs are known to cause more gastrointestinal symptoms than other foods, it is not known whether there is a difference in organ-specific symptoms between egg yolk (EY) and egg white (EW). The present study aimed to determine whether there are organ-specific differences in the immediate symptoms of EY and EW in patients with hen’s egg allergies. We retrospectively investigated the immediate symptoms and treatment contents of those who had a positive result in an oral food challenge (OFC) of boiled whole EY or 10 g of boiled EW in our hospital from January 2013 to July 2019. We compared 80 patients in the EY-OFC-positive group with 106 patients in the EW-OFC-positive group. The EY-OFC-positive group had significantly fewer respiratory symptoms and significantly more gastrointestinal symptoms than the EW-OFC-positive group and had significantly more gastrointestinal symptoms only. In terms of treatment, significantly fewer patients in the EY-OFC-positive group required beta 2-agonist inhalation, and a significantly higher proportion of patients did not require treatment. Compared to EW, EY is more likely to cause gastrointestinal symptoms and less likely to cause respiratory symptoms. It may be necessary to discriminate between EY and EW allergy during diagnosis.",

A 6-year-old male presented with a history of food allergy, productive coughs, and recurrent purulent rhinitis, poor weight gain and hypothyroidism.

Antiviral and antibiotic prophylaxis, along with monthly IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulin) was started and the patient was subsequently referred for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. PIDs should be considered as the differential diagnosis in any patient with unexplained and bizarre symptoms associated with recurrent infections, allergic and autoimmune manifestations. Clinicians should also bear X-SCID in mind in case of approach to any patient with poor weight gain, unusual allergic or endocrine manifestations, even in the case of a normal or increased level of serum immunoglobulins or T and B cells numbers.",

The whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis identified a homozygous frameshift deletion mutation (c.1512delG, p.I505Sfs*28) in exon 16 of the DOCK2 gene. We also conducted electronic searches in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases and reviewed the articles reporting patients with DOCK2 deficiency. The literature search yielded 14 DOCK2-deficient patients suffering from both cellular and humoral immune defects leading to early-onset infections, particularly human herpesvirus (HHV) infection. Conclusion DOCK2 deficiency should be considered in the context of severe or unusual early-onset infections, especially HHV infections, in a patient with a probable clinical diagnosis of combined immunodeficiency. We also recommended that DOCK2-deficient patients might benefit from T-cell receptor excision circle (TREC) assay as part of the routine newborn screening program.",

    "abstract": "Methods Mild asthmatics and normal controls were recruited as study subjects. This crossover study was double-blinded, randomized and counter-balanced to the order of three conditions: diesel exhaust with anti-oxidant, diesel exhaust with placebo, or filtered air with placebo. The subjects were exposed to either filtered air or diesel exhaust (300 ug PM2.5/m ) in a state-of-the-art diesel exhaust exposure facility. An anti-oxidant, N-acetylcysteine (600 mg), or a placebo was taken orally for five days preceding, and on the day of the exposure. Each subject was exposed to each of the three conditions. Peripheral blood samples were taken pre-exposure, and also at 2, 6, and 30 hours after the beginning of exposure. Sputum induction was performed by inhalation of hypertonic saline according to ATS guidelines pre-exposure, and also at 6, and 30 hours after the beginning of exposure. FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences) was used for flow cytometry. A 5-colour, 12-marker (CD3/CD9/ CD14/CD16/CD19/CD20/CD45/CD56/CD83/CD206/ CD326/HLA-DR) combination was used to identify dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and bronchial epithelial cells. Direct immunolabelling was performed on whole peripheral blood. After incubation, red blood cells were lysed. Remaining cells were washed and resuspended in PBS with 0.5% paraformaldehyde. Sputum plugs were homogenized with 0.1% DTT, filtered, and then centrifuged to remove supernatant. Sputum cells were resuspended in PBS at 1 million per mL. Direct immunolabelling was performed. After incubation, cells were washed and resuspended in PBS with 0.5% paraformaldehyde. Spectral compensation for flow cytometry was performed using an automatic calibration technique (BD CompBeads). Cellular debris was eliminated on the SSC/FSC scattergram. A gating strategy was designed to identify the leukocyte sub-populations and bronchial epithelial cells. Surface markers were chosen based on differential cell-specific expression according to existing literature.",

    "abstract": "Post-hospital syndrome refers to the period of generalized risk of adverse health outcomes among patients who are recently discharged from hospital. This period is associated with a short-term increased risk of readmission which may not be related to the original condition. While the majority of studies of post-hospital syndrome have focused on all-cause readmissions, whether and to what extent such a phenomenon exists within discrete medical conditions is not yet known. To investigate whether the risk of admission due to asthma is increased in individuals who are discharged following any-cause hospital admission. Using administrative health data for the period 1997 to 2007 from the province of British Columbia, Canada, we created a cohort of adults with asthma. Using a case-crossover design, we assessed the association between discharge from a hospital (exposure) within 30 days before an asthma-related hospitalization (the outcome), using two 30-day control periods within the same subject. Conditional logistic regression was performed to calculate the relative risk (RR) of the outcome in association with exposure. We performed several sensitivity and subgroup analyses. The final cohort included 3,852 patients experiencing 6,333 instances of the outcome. Mean age at the time of the outcome was 43.7 (SD 14.2), 69.0% of such outcomes belonged to females. The RR of the outcome within the next 30 days of a previous any-cause discharge was 1.40 (95% CI 1.22 - 1.59). However, the association was mainly caused by discharge from asthma-related admission [RR = 1.99 (95% CI 1.65 - 2.39)]. The RR associated with non-asthma-related discharge was 0.88 (95% CI 0.74 - 1.04) and was not statistically significant. Similar results were obtained in a range of sensitivity analyses. Our results indicate that in patients with asthma, the 30-day risk of asthma-related admission is increased after an episode of asthma-related hospitalization, but not after an episode of non-asthma-related hospitalization.",

    "abstract": "In Canada, numerous initiatives have been developed in the recent years to improve guidelines implementation in respiratory care. Following the Canadian Thoracic Society (CTS) 1999 Canadian Asthma Consensus Guideline (CACG), efforts have been devoted to better disseminate this document and foster its implementation. This included among others, the production of a series of publications, development of a web-site, mailings of key messages to primary care physicians, interactive workshops and integration of CACG recommendations in educational programs.\r\n\r\nIn the past, Canadian respiratory health guidelines have been produced and disseminated according to various agendas and methods, but in the last few years, the CTS has decided to develop a common body, the Canadian Respiratory Guidelines Committee (CRGC). The goal of the CRGC is to produce, disseminate, help implement and evaluate Canadian respiratory guidelines according to uniform methods and in a collaborative fashion, with a common annual agenda [1]. The methods used to produce and assess the performance of those guidelines are described in the publication by Gupta et al. [2]. Hopefully, this new strategy will allow a better use of resources and a more efficient translation process. Initiatives aimed at improving guideline implementation have also been developed and a specific Dissemination and Implementation Subcommittee has been formed to address this. A large scale project, the “Guidelines Implementation in Primary Care” (GIPC) study, based on quality circles and mentorship for primary care physicians (PCP) and involving interactive sessions and the use of practice tools had been developed but faced difficulties in regard to physicians recruitment, stressing the challenges associated in the involvement of busy PCPs is such studies. Various other means of contributing to guidelines implementation are presently considered. Documents and tools to facilitate the translation of guidelines can be found at www.respiratoryguidelines.ca.\r\n\r\nThere is, therefore, a need to promote implementation initiatives according to the most effective methods recognized and to develop innovative strategies to improve the translation of guidelines recommendations, while considering the cost-effectiveness of these interventions in addition to the needs and motivations of the targeted groups. This is also one of the key mandates of the recently developed Laval University Chair on Knowledge Transfer, Education and Prevention in Respiratory and Cardiovascular Health, and various means of translating current cardio-respiratory guidelines are being developed and will soon be available on the site www.coeurpoumons.ca.\r\n\r\nFinally, numerous other asthma guidelines implementation initiatives have been proposed in many Canadian provinces in the last two decades (the reader is invited to consult their web site at http://www.lung.ca/about-propos/provincial-provinciales_e.php), and additional efforts are currently devoted to improving the effectiveness of such interventions. More recently, the National Lung Health Framework [3] has been developed, and should help address many of the remaining care gaps and target populations most in need of such interventions. The “Framework” is an action plan developed by and for a wide range of stakeholders working to improve lung health in Canada, using a collaborative approach to the prevention and management of respiratory disease. Finally, many educational and support networks such as the Canadian Network for Respiratory Care (http://www.cnrchome.net/), the Quebec Asthma and COPD Network (http://rqam.ca/), patient support groups and various other organizations, are contributing to the respiratory guidelines implementation through their educational programs.\r\n\r\nHopefully, learning from the past, inspired by other countries’ initiatives and acting in collaboration with all stakeholders, we will be able to build and maintain a successful long-term guidelines implementation program that contributes to the improvement of respiratory health in Canada.",

    "abstract": "Case presentation A 53 year-old female bridge inspector presented with allergic reaction to diethyltoluamide (DEET) containing insect repellent. She had prior use without difficulty. In 2013, she used the insect repellent and with only a small amount making contact with her forehead, she had immediate pruritus and erythema on her forehead, persisting for an hour. The following week, she used a different insect repellent and sprayed her face and body. Within minutes, she became diffusely pruritic with generalized urticaria and angioedema of her eyes. She called 911 and was given intramuscular diphenhydramine. Her symptoms gradually eased and she was subsequently well. Her regular medications include venlafaxine and ketorolac. She has no history of atopy. Since the reaction, she has been avoiding all forms of insect repellent, including riding in separate vehicles as her co-workers who use insect repellent. She carries an epinephrine device at all times. Skin testing was performed using two DEET-containing insect repellents: Lloyd’s Bug Spray (23.75% DEET) and OFF Family Care Bug Spray (5% DEET). She had positive skin prick test to both insect repellents, more prominent with the higher containing DEET repellent. There was also a significant reaction on the skin adjacent to the test site where the repellent had not made contact. She developed significant pruritus and was treated with oral anti-histamine. She had appropriate controls. A control subject tested in the office was negative to both insect repellents. Conclusion The patient had a severe allergic reaction to insect repellent, and exhibits sensitization based on skin testing. This represents a unique case of severe cutaneous reaction to insect repellent and such patients may be at risk of anaphylaxis with future exposure.",

    "abstract": "Due to its high allergenic potential Ambrosia artemisiifolia has become a health threat in many European countries during the last few decades. Hence, several cities and communities initiated ragweed eradication campaigns. In Berlin, Germany, so-called Ambrosia scouts are being assigned the task of finding and eliminating this weed. We sought to evaluate the potential risk of sensitization and allergy in these individuals.In order to assess the risk of sensitization and allergy, we followed-up 20 Ambrosia scouts by skin-prick test with inhalant allergens, immunoserological and pulmonary function tests. Additionally, medical conditions were evaluated by a questionnaire especially designed for this study. Despite close contact to ragweed over a median duration of 13.8 months, none of the participants became sensitized or allergic to ragweed. One individual developed a clinical non-relevant sensitization towards the taxiconomically-related plant mugwort. A decline in relative FEV1 was most probably due to heavy smoking.Our surprising findings suggest that intensive contact and exposure to high ragweed pollen concentrations do not necessarily result in sensitization and/or allergy, meaning that the allergenic potential of this weed might be lower than hitherto expected. However, it is also conceivable that continuous exposure to high allergen levels induced tolerance in the ragweed workers. Due to the relatively small number of subjects studied, our results might be biased and therefore investigations on larger study groups are needed.",

Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study of a community-based adult population to evaluate the environmental exposure and health impact of the Pohang Industrial Complex, Korea. Participants were examined based on self-reported questionnaires, nasal swab, and blood sampling. Results There were 307 participants, and the overall prevalence of SA carriage and SE IgE-sensitization was 26.1% (80/307) and 25.7% (79/307), respectively. An urban environment was significantly correlated with SA carriage, whereas age and obesity were significantly correlated with SE IgE-sensitization. SA carriage was not associated with an increase in total IgE and blood eosinophil count, whereas SE IgE-sensitization was associated with an increased total IgE and blood eosinophil count. SA carriage was significantly correlated with cough persisting for more than three weeks (OR, 3.044; 95% CI, 1.137–8.153) and sputum (OR, 2.429; 95% CI, 1.008–5.854).

We report the case of a child with APDS accompanied by unique clinical features: nephromegaly and growth hormone deficiency with associated pituitary anatomic abnormality. The patient is a nine-year-old boy with a heterozygous de novo variant in phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit δ (p.E1021K), previously reported in association with APDS. Our patient, who had no family history of immunodeficiency, exhibits classic findings of this syndrome but also has unique features that extend the phenotypic spectrum of this disorder. At 5 years of age, the patient showed marked growth deceleration and was demonstrated to have growth hormone (GH) deficiency with associated pituitary anatomic abnormality. He started GH therapy with an excellent response. He additionally has bilateral nephromegaly of unclear etiology, microscopic hematuria and proteinuria, asthma, and has developed left hip pain with arthrocentesis consistent with oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. At age nine, the patient was referred to genetics and whole exome sequencing revealed APDS. Though there was initial concern that GH may increase risk for malignancy as GH signals through the PI3K pathway, he was allowed to continue treatment as the PI3K pathway was considered constitutively active at baseline. Our patient's unique presentation adds to the clinical information regarding APDS, demonstrates the utility of genetic testing and illustrates the importance of a multidisciplinary collaborative approach in managing this complex syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The prevalence of allergic diseases is increasing in Zimbabwe and the data relate to local as well as exotic allergen sources. As entomophagy, the practice of eating insects, is a recognised source of local allergens, we sought to measure the prevalence of and risk factors for sensitisation to Imbrasia belina (mopane worm), a popular edible insect. This was investigated alongside other locally relevant allergens in a rural community in Gwanda district, south of Zimbabwe. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted among 496 adults and children aged 10 years and above in Gwanda district, a mopane worm harvesting area in Zimbabwe. Data on individual characteristics and mopane worm exposure factors were collected using questionnaires. Sensitivity to allergens was assessed by performing skin prick tests at a local clinic using 10 different commercial allergen extracts (Stallergenes, France) and in-house extracts of mopane worm (Imbrasia belina) and mopane leaves ( Colophospermum mopane ). Data were analysed using Stata version 13 software. Results The prevalence of sensitisation to at least one allergen was 31.17% (n = 144). The prevalence of atopy was higher in adults (33.33%) than in children (23.53%) (p = 0.059). The commonest inhalant allergen sources were mopane worm (14.29%), Tyrophagus putrescentiae (14.29%), mopane leaves (13.42%), Alternaria alternata (6.49%) and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (6.49%). Polysensitisation was demonstrated in the study population and of the 108 participants (75%) who were sensitised to two or more allergens, 66 (61%) were women. Sensitisation to mopane worm and mopane leaves often clustered with Tyrophagus putrescentiae amongst adults. Adjusted logistic regression analyses between mopane worm sensitisation and self-reported exposure variables showed that sensitisation was more likely amongst mopane worm harvesters (OR = 1.92, 95%CI = 0.77–4.79), those who cooked or roasted mopane worms during harvesting (OR = 2.69, 95%CI = 0.78–9.31) and harvesting without personal protective equipment (PPE) (OR = 2.12, 95%CI = 0.83–5.44) compared to non-harvesters. Conclusion Atopic sensitization was common in this mopane worm harvesting community in Gwanda district of Zimbabwe. There was frequent co-sensitisation of mopane worm and mopane leaves with Tyrophagus putrescentiae in children and adults. It is important to determine the clinical relevance of our findings, particularly relating to mopane worm sensitisation.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) contributes to the contractility and inflammation in the pathophysiology of asthma. This intrigued us to clarify the effect of microRNA (miR)-224-5p on biological characteristics of ASMCs in mice with asthma-like airway inflammation and responses through the FHL1-dependent MAPK pathway.An ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma mouse model was established, where ASMCs were isolated. The expression of FHL1 was determined in asthmatic mice. Artificial modulation of FHL1 expression was performed to explore its effect on airway inflammation of asthmatic mice and ASMC proliferation and apoptosis. Afterwards, we analyzed the interaction among miR-224-5p, FHL1 and the MAPK pathway, and explored their combined impacts on airway inflammation of asthmatic mice and ASMC proliferation and apoptosis.FHL1 was highly expressed and miR-224-5p was poorly expressed in asthmatic mice. FHL1 was verified to be a target of miR-224-5p. Loss of FHL1 function reduced airway inflammation in asthmatic mice and proliferation of ASMCs while inducing their apoptosis. Besides, miR-224-5p inhibited the MAPK pathway by binding to FHL1. Overexpression of miR-224-5p relieved airway inflammation, inhibited ASMC proliferation, and increased apoptosis, which could be reversed by overexpression of FHL1.Altogether, miR-224-5p inhibited airway inflammation in asthmatic mice and ASMC proliferation through blocking the MAPK pathway by down-regulating FHL1.",

    "abstract": "Since the first reported case of COVID-19, infections due to the virus have ranged from mild to severe. Patients with inborn errors of immunity are thought to be at increased risk for infections such as COVID-19 due to the nature of their disease and being immunocompromised. Similarly, pregnant women by nature of physiological changes in immunity are susceptible to infections and consequently are felt to be at greater risk of contracting COVID-19 with potential grave consequences for not only the mother but also the fetus. Early treatment with novel therapeutics against the SARS-CoV-2 virus to prevent progression and these complications is paramount.A 31-year-old woman with a 22-year history of common variable immunodeficiency on subcutaneous immunoglobulin replacement therapy and 24 weeks pregnant with her third child presented to the Emergency Department with two-day history of pharyngitis that progressed to include nasal and chest congestion, non-productive cough and shortness of breath. Her vitals indicated temperature of 35 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 109 beats per minute, blood pressure 142/92 mmHg, respiratory rate 22/min and an oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. A workup was done and she was found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus confirmed by PCR. She had a close contact, her husband, who had tested positive a few days prior. She had been previously vaccinated with three doses of the Moderna COVID-19 (Spikevax ®) vaccine. As she met the criteria for monoclonal antibody treatment, she received Sotrovimab on the same day of testing positive and tolerated it well with no side-effects. Her symptoms resolved within two to three days.Our case, is the first to our knowledge, of a pregnant patient with common variable immunodeficiency diagnosed with COVID-19 and symptomatic successfully receiving treatment with Sotrovimab. Her rapid resolution of symptoms makes the use of monoclonal antibodies such as Sotrovimab a safe and useful option in this unique population.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is an important non-communicable disease worldwide. DNA methylation is associated with the occurrence and development of asthma. We are aimed at assuring differential expressed genes (DEGs) modified by aberrantly methylated genes (DMGs) and pathways related to asthma by integrating bioinformatics analysis.One mRNA dataset (GSE64913) and one gene methylation dataset (GSE137716) were selected from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Functional enrichment analysis was performed using GeneCodies 4.0 database. All gene expression matrices were analyzed by Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) software. STRING was applied to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network to find the hub genes. Then, electronic validation was performed to verify the hub genes, followed by the evaluation of diagnostic value. Eventually, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was utilized to detect the expression of hub genes.In total, 14 hypomethylated/high-expression genes and 10 hypermethylated/low-expression genes were obtained in asthma. Among them, 10 hub genes were identified in the PPI network. Functional analysis demonstrated that the differentially methylated/expressed genes were primarily associated with the lung development, cytosol and protein binding. Notably, HLA-DOA was enriched in asthma. FKBP5, WNT5A, TM4SF1, PDK4, EPAS1 and GMPR had potential diagnostic value for asthma.The project explored the pathogenesis of asthma, which may provide a research basis for the prediction and the drug development of asthma.",

The most common allergens causing FPIES reactions include cow’s milk, followed by soy, grains, and rice [1, 3]. Increasing clinical awareness of FPIES has resulted in the expansion of emerging triggers of FPIES, including fruit antigens. Case presentation We describe an infant diagnosed with FPIES to prune. Conclusion Fruit allergens are an emerging group of triggers for FPIES, both in their fresh and dried forms. To our knowledge, this case is the first presentation of FPIES to prunes (dehydrated plum). This case highlights that careful history taking can avoid unnecessary investigations and delay in diagnosing FPIES.",

This syndrome was once thought to be rare, but emerging literature suggests an increasing incidence along with more foods being implicated. Also, with the introduction of guidelines on early peanut introduction, peanut-induced FPIES seems to be increasing in Australia and USA. Although most patients are diagnosed with FPIES within the first year of life, most commonly with food triggers to cow's milk or soy, other phenotypes exist in comparison to this classic presentation. In this case report, we present a patient with late onset of acute FPIES at age 3 to walnut.We describe a case of FPIES in a 12-year-old boy who had recurrent episodes of repetitive emesis, that began at age 3, each time after consuming walnuts. Mom does not give a history of intentional feeding (or avoidance) of walnut and/ or pecans. She also described possible reactions with pine nuts and macadamia. He was assessed with an oral food challenge to walnut, which triggered an episode of acute FPIES. He developed vomiting with onset 2 h post-ingestion, pallor, lethargy, and required an emergency department visit for anti-emetic medications and oral rehydration therapy. He improved on the therapy and now avoids cashew, pistachio, hazelnuts, walnuts, pecans, pine nuts, and macadamia nuts.This case report adds to the limited literature that exists on culprit food allergens in FPIES. We present an acute FPIES triggered by the ingestion of walnuts. The diagnosis, common food triggers, and natural history of FPIES are described.

Case introduction A 22-years-old male with a 6-month history of severe plaque psoriasis vulgaris was presented to the dermatology clinic two weeks after the fifth serial weekly doses of secukinumab, for the reason of the outbreaks of multiple erythematous papules and pruritus nodules on the trunk and extremities. Physical examination showed that psoriatic rash were under effective control with the previous targeted therapy of secukinumab for plaque psoriasis vulgaris, but new dermatologic condition was spotted with multiple edematous red firm papules on the trunk and extremities, in the form of soy or hemispherical nodules, red in color, firm to touch, with some ulcerated crusts visible at tops, but negative Auspitz sign. Pathological examination confirmed these papules as PN.

There is currently no approved treatment, but complete remission of symptoms can be induced with IL-1 antagonists. Case presentation A patient with a history of chronic urticaria presented frequently at the outpatient clinic with severe hives and was treated unsuccessfully with antihistamines and omalizumab. After several years, additional symptoms such as joint pain, recurrent fever, and IgM-gammopathy developed. After the diagnostic criteria for Schnitzler syndrome were met, treatment with anakinra was initiated and resulted in an improvement of the symptoms. Shortly after the first injection, the patient developed large and painful erythematous lesions at the injection sites, leading to discontinuation of treatment and a rapid recurrence of symptoms. Subsequently, treatment with a longer-acting IL-1 antagonist (canakinumab) was initiated, resulting in a complete remission of symptoms. Conclusion This case report demonstrates that patients with urticarial symptoms that are not relieved by typical treatments should prompt repeated reassessments of the diagnosis, even years later, because gammopathy and other diagnostic criteria for Schnitzler syndrome can occur with a delay.",

However, whether IL-36 family cytokine levels are correlated with the results of the assessment of allergic rhinitis (AR) and affect the severity of AR remains unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the correlations between IL-36 family cytokine levels and subjective and objective assessment results and to further analyze the possible mechanisms of IL-36 family cytokines in the development of AR. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the concentrations of the IL-36 family cytokines IL-36α, IL-36β, IL-36γ, IL-36Ra, and IL-38 in the peripheral blood of patients with AR. The condition of patients with AR was assessed by 22-item sino-nasal outcome test (SNOT-22) score, visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for disease severity, and serum inhalant allergen immunoglobulin E (IgE) detection. Correlations between IL-36 family cytokine levels and subjective and objective assessment results in patients with AR were analyzed. The concentration of IL-36α in the peripheral blood of patients with AR was the highest, and the concentration of IL-36β was the lowest. The concentration of IL-36α was higher in juvenile patients than in adult patients, and there was a difference in the IL-36Ra level between the perennial allergen group and the seasonal allergen group. There was a positive correlation between IL-36α level and IL-36γ level, IL-36γ level and IL-36Ra level, and IL-36Ra level and IL-38 level, and IL-36β level was positively correlated with IL-36Ra and IL-38 levels, respectively. IL-36α level was positively correlated with VAS score for nasal congestion symptom. IL-36β level was positively correlated with the total VAS score for ocular symptoms and VAS scores for ocular itching and eye pain symptoms. However, there was no correlation between the levels of all cytokines in IL-36 family and SNOT-22 score, the number of positive inhaled allergens, or the highest positive intensity of allergen specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE). Peripheral blood IL-36 family cytokines play an important role in AR, and the concentrations of IL-36α and IL-36β were related to the severity of symptoms in patients with AR.",

In lean women, the use of HT was significantly associated with a higher risks for AR (OR = 2.26 [95% CI: 1.31-3.91]), the time course of AR (OR = 2.54 [95% CI: 1.37-4.74]), hay fever (OR = 2.54 [95% CI: 1.37-4.74]), and accompanying symptoms (including canker sores, diarrhea, and stomachache) (OR = 2.26 [95% CI: 1.309-3.907]) when compared to normal or heavier weight women (course of AR: pinteraction = 0.032; hay fever; pinteraction = 0.006; accompanying symptoms: pinteraction = 0.009).HT can reduce the risk for AR in perimenopausal women. Lean women who used HT were at a higher risk for AR when compared to overweight women who used AR. There exists an interaction between HT and BMI that influences AR. Furthermore, HT and obesity increase the risk for AR by some common pathways, more follow-up work is needed to explore common pathways.",

    "abstract": ": A 59-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with pulmonary infiltration, fever, erythema, and eosinophilia. Two weeks before admission, he received amoxicillin, acetaminophen, and shoseiryu-to (a Japanese herbal medicine) for a common cold. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed, and an increased number of eosinophils was recovered. Transbronchial biopsy specimens showed granuloma and interstitial thickening with eosinophils and lymphocytes. Drug-induced eosinophilic pneumonia was suspected, so all drugs were discontinued. The symptoms and infiltration shadow disappeared. A drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST) was positive for acetaminophen but not for amoxicillin. In contrast to the DLST, a provocation test revealed that amoxicillin induced the drug allergy. A very striking observation was the coexistence of pulmonary eosinophilia and granulomatous lung infiltrations. In addition, there was a discrepancy between the DLST and provocation test findings. To our knowledge, there is no previous report of drug-induced eosinophilic pneumonia with a granulomatous reaction.",

    "abstract": ": Subtle increases in immaturity of immune function in early infancy have been implicated in the rising susceptibility to allergic disease, particularly relative impairment of type 1 interferon (IFN)-gamma responses in the neonatal period. Although genetic predisposition is a clear risk factor, the escalating rates of allergic disease in infancy suggest that environmental factors are also implicated. We previously showed that maternal smoking in pregnancy may impair neonatal IFN-gamma responses. Our more recent studies now indicate that this common avoidable toxic exposure is also associated with attenuation of innate immune function, with attenuated Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated microbial responses (including TLR-2, -3, -4, and -9 responses). Most notably, the effects were more marked if the mothers were also allergic. In this review, we discuss the significance of these observations in the context of the emerging hypothesis that variations in TLR function in early life may be implicated in allergic propensity. There is now growing evidence that many of the key pathways involved in subsequent T-cell programming and regulation (namely, antigen-presenting cells and regulatory T cells) rely heavily on microbe-driven TLR activation for maturation and function. Factors that influence the function and activity of these innate pathways in early life may contribute to the increasing predisposition for allergic disease. Although \"cleaner\" environments have been implicated, here we explore the possibility that other common environmental exposures (such as maternal smoking) could also play a role.",

A precipitous and significant decrease in vaginal fungal burden toward the end of week 3 postinfection was concurrent with a significant increase in vaginal lymphocyte numbers. During this period, the percentage of CD3 + , CD3 + CD4 + , CD152 + , and CD28 + vaginal T cells gradually and significantly increased. The percentage of CD3 + and CD3 + CD4 + cells increased from 43% and 15% at day 0 to 77% and 40% at day 28 postinfection. Compared with 29% CD152 + vaginal T cells in naive mice, &gt; 70% of vaginal T cells were CD152 + at day 28 postinfection. In conclusion, estrogen-maintained vaginal candidiasis results in postinfection time-dependent changes in the pattern of expression of CD152, CD28, and other T-cell markers, suggesting that T cells are subject to mixed suppression and activation signals.",

The workup revealed undetectable levels of C2, C4 and undetectable CH50. Quantitative levels of C1 inhibitor and C1q were low. C1 inhibitor function was less than 40%. Anti-cardiolipin antibodies were found. The patient was initially treated on demand with intravenous plasma-derived human C1-INH concentrates, (Cinryze® Shire). Later the patient received prophylactic therapy with danazol. She was diagnosed with lymphoma 3 years after her first episode of angioedema. Single agent therapy with rituximab was not only effective in treating her lymphoma but also preventing further episodes of angioedema. Anti-cardiolipin antibody titers also declined. Additionally, marked early primary pathway complement component abnormalities and CH50 also corrected, although incomplete normalization of C4 proved to be due to a heterozygous C4 deficiency.This case shows the unique association of AAE, APS and NHL in a patient with undetectable levels of early complement components.

    "abstract": "Little is known about the prevalence of asthma, allergic rhinitis, eczema and allergies among Canadian Inuit children, especially those living in the arctic and subarctic areas. A cross-sectional study among grade seven students attending schools in Iqaluit, the capital city of Nunavut, was conducted during the 2016/2017 school year. We used the International Study of Allergy and Asthma in Children (ISAAC) questionnaire with added questions relevant to the population. In addition, skin prick tests (SPT) were conducted to test for sensitization to common food and environmental allergens. The prevalence of current asthma is 5.2%, all of them were males and 2/3 of them were Inuit and all had a previous respiratory hospitalization. Past asthma prevalence is 8.6%, 60% males and 60% Inuit. There was an inverse relationship to crowdedness possibly as a confounding factor because of getting a higher prevalence among the non-Inuit who usually live in less crowded houses. Current allergic rhinitis prevalence is 8.6%, 60% of the cases were among the mixed Inuit/Caucasian ethnicity while no cases among the non-Inuit, there was a female predominance 3:2. Past history of allergic rhinitis prevalence is 10.3%, half of the cases were among the mixed ethnicity (5.2% of that ethnicity) followed by Inuit (3.4%) and non-Inuit (1.7%), female: Male ratio 1:1. Current eczema prevalence was 27.6%, with half of the cases among the mixed ethnicity (13.8% of that group), followed by Inuit (8.6%). There was a female predominance with protective effect of exclusive breastfeeding. Past eczema prevalence 34.5%, with half of the cases were among the mixed ethnicity (17.2% of that group), followed by Inuit (10.3%). There was a female predominance. We noted a high rate of sensitization to Cat at 29.2%, most of the cases were among the mixed ethnicity, while absent sensitization to other common inhalant allergens. While being cautious about firm conclusions due to the small sample size and power, the noticed variations in the prevalence and risk factors of asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema among different ethnicities living at the same subarctic environment might be related to several possible explanations like genetic, gene-environment interaction and/or lifestyle factors, it was out of the scope of this study to determine the causality of such variation in prevalence, which emphasizes the need for further investigation.",

Objective To study whether injection through clothing influences the frequency of subcutaneous and intraosseous/periosteal deposition of epinephrine. Methods Skin to muscle and skin to bone distances were measured for 303 children and adolescents and 99 adults. Distance was determined by ultrasound, with high or low pressure on the ultrasound probe. The risk/percentage of subcutaneous and intraosseous/periosteal injections was calculated using the lower and upper limits for the authority-approved length of EAI needles as provided by two high pressure EAI manufacturers and one low pressure EAI manufacturer. The addition winter clothing on the delivery of epinephrine was illustrated by comparing drug delivery fissue depth with no clothes. Furthermore, the riof non-intramuscular delivery for the shortest and longest approved needle length was calculated. Results When using EpipenJr ® in children &lt; 15 kg the risk of intraosseous/periostal injection was reduced from 1% and 59% for the shortest and longest approved needle length to 0 and 15% with winter clothes. The Auvi-Q ® 0.1 mg had no risk of intraosseous/periosteal injection. However, the subcutaneous deposition risk increased from 94% and 28% to 100% and 99% with winter clothes.

As the immune system players such as immunoglobulins play prominent roles in the development of CRS, we aimed to investigate the expression of IgA subclasses and factors involved in IgA class switching in the sinonasal mucosa of CRS patients. Methods Specimens were collected from the sinonasal mucosa of the healthy controls and CRS patients. Histological assessments were performed by H&amp;E and immunohistochemistry. Real-time PCR and ELISA methods were applied to measure gene expression and protein levels extracted from tissue samples, respectively. Results We observed that total IgA and subclass-positive cells were higher in the patient groups than controls. There was a significant correlation between the number of eosinophils and total IgA and subclasses-positive cells (Pv &lt; 0.0001). The expression of CXCL13, BAFF, AID, and germline transcripts were increased in CRSwNP patients. In contrast to IgA2 levels, IgA1 levels were significantly increased in the sinonasal tissue of CRSwNP patients (Pv &lt; 0.01). TGF-β was significantly elevated in the sinonasal tissue of patients with CRSsNP. Conclusions Increased protein levels of IgA subclasses and related antibody-producing cells were associated with elevated eosinophils in CRSwNP patients which may result in eosinophil pathological functions. Several therapeutic approaches might be developed to modulate the IgA production to ameliorate the inflammatory mechanisms in CRSwNP patients.",

We investigated the association between season of birth and risk of AD and FA in Japanese infants. Methods Study subjects were 612 newborn infants born at a single obstetric/pediatric clinic without perinatal diseases. Season of birth was classified as spring (March–May), summer (June–August), autumn (September–November) or winter (December–February). AD was diagnosed according to the United Kingdom Working Party’s criteria. FA was defined as present if there was a history of immediate allergic symptoms within 2 h after ingestion of a food. Specific IgE to the corresponding food was also assessed to support the diagnosis. We assessed the association between season of birth and risk of AD and FA using Cox proportional hazard models. Results We identified a total of 365 cases of AD occurring during 3659 person-months of follow-up. Compared with summer birth, autumn, winter, and spring birth were significantly positively associated with the risk of AD: adjusted HRs (95% CIs) were 2.67 (1.96–3.63), 1.42 (1.03–1.95), and 1.43 (1.04–1.98), respectively. We identified a total of 23 cases of physician-diagnosed FA occurring during 6815 person-months of follow-up. Conclusions Being born in the summer is associated with a lower risk of AD compared to other seasons of birth. The low incidence of FA in our cohort group made it difficult to establish a valid association between FA and season of birth as the statistical power was low.",

However, data on the pattern of clinical reaction types elicited by specific β-lactams are scarce and inconsistent. We aimed to determine patterns of β-latam allergy, i.e. the association of a clinical reaction type with a specific β-lactam antibiotic. Methods We retrospectively evaluated data from 800 consecutive patients with suspected β-lactam hypersensitivity over a period of 11 years in a single German Allergy Center. Results β-lactam hypersensitivity was definitely excluded in 595 patients, immediate-type (presumably IgE-mediated) hypersensitivity was diagnosed in 70 and delayed-type hypersensitivity in 135 cases. Most (59 out of 70, 84.3%) immediate-type anaphylactic reactions were induced by a limited number of cephalosporins. Delayed reactions were regularly caused by an aminopenicillin (127 out of 135, 94.1%) and usually manifested as a measles-like exanthem (117 out of 135, 86.7%). Intradermal testing proved to be the most useful method for diagnosing β-lactam allergy, but prick testing was already positive in 24 out of 70 patients with immediate-type hypersensitivity (34.3%). Patch testing in addition to intradermal testing did not provide additional information for the diagnosis of delayed-type hypersensitivity. Almost all β-lactam allergic patients tolerated at least one, usually several alternative substances out of the β-lactam group. Conclusions We identified two patterns of β-lactam hypersensitivity: aminopenicillin-induced exanthem and anaphylaxis triggered by certain cephalosporins. Intradermal skin testing was the most useful method to detect both IgE-mediated and delayed-type β-lactam hypersensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Kimura’s disease (KD) is a rare chronic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology. Clinically, KD is characterized by nodular subcutaneous masses, that are typically localized to the neck and head. Involvement of the lacrimal glands and limbs is uncommon and seldom reported. Case presentation We report a case of a 4-year-old Japanese boy presenting with bilateral upper eyelid swelling with nodular subcutaneous lesions and peripheral eosinophilia. Based on clinical, histopathological, and laboratory findings, the patient was diagnosed with KD. An itchy subcutaneous mass on the left arm developed at the age of 14 years. Treatment with steroids was effective. However, as the steroids were tapered after the patient developed side effects, the masses relapsed within a few months. Treatment with cyclosporine A was then initiated, which led to an improvement of clinical features and serial levels of cytokines. Conclusions We report a rare case of KD with a peculiar clinical presentation. The patient responded well to treatment with cyclosporine A.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Adolescence, as a transition between childhood and adulthood, is a critical stage for the long-term control of atopic diseases. We aim to determine if sleep characteristics are involved in the increased risk of atopic disease among adolescents. Methods Adopting the stratified cluster random sampling method, this cross-sectional survey included 4932 participants aged 12–18 years. The Chinese version of adolescent sleep disturbance questionnaire and the adolescent sleep hygiene scale were used to collect information on sleep problems and sleep hygiene, respectively. Logistic regression models were implemented to examine the associations of sleep with atopic diseases. Results Sleep duration was not found to be related with allergic diseases. By contrast, sleep-disordered breathing was associated with an increased risk of asthma (adjusted OR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.25–2.55), allergic rhinitis (adjusted OR = 1.95, 95% CI 1.52–2.49), and eczema (adjusted OR = 1.63, 95% CI 1.23–2.16); poor sleep physiology was correspondent to increased odds of asthma (adjusted OR = 1.69, 95% CI 1.24–2.29), allergic rhinitis (adjusted OR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.13–1.73) and eczema (adjusted OR = 1.66, 95% CI 1.32–2.09); non-optimal sleep environment was associated with an increased prevalence of asthma (adjusted OR = 1.52, 95% CI 1.08–2.12), allergic rhinitis (adjusted OR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.04–1.69) and eczema (adjusted OR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.19–1.96). Conclusions As sleep-disordered breathing, poor sleep physiology and non-optimal sleep environment were associated with a higher risk of allergic diseases, the results of this study provide a new concept for the adjuvant treatment of allergic diseases in adolescents. Management strategies of allergic diseases should take regular screening and targeted treatment of sleep issues into account.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Glucocorticoids rarely cause anaphylaxis. Common methods for the determination of allergens include in vivo skin prick test (SPT) and intradermal skin test (IDST) and the in vitro basophil activation test (BAT). However, to our knowledge, the best strategy for diagnosing glucocorticoid-induced anaphylaxis has not been elucidated. Case presentation A 10-year-old boy was admitted to our hospital because of 2 weeks of fever and arthralgia. He had not been treated with glucocorticoids before, including methylprednisolone (mPSL). He was suspected to have bacterial myositis and was treated with ceftriaxone. However, his symptoms persisted for &gt; 2 weeks. Autoinflammatory arthritis was suspected, and he was treated with mPSL sodium succinate (MPS) pulse therapy (30 mg/kg). After 15 min of mPSL injection, he had wheezing and generalized wheal formation with decreased oxygen saturation. As anaphylaxis was suspected, mPSL was discontinued, and olopatadine and oxygen were administered. The symptoms improved considerably without the use of epinephrine and disappeared in 30 min. One month after discharge, SPT, IDST, and BAT were performed without discontinuing his prescribed oral prednisolone. SPTs for MPS, hydrocortisone sodium succinate (HCS), prednisolone sodium succinate (PSS), dexamethasone sodium phosphate (DSP), and betamethasone sodium phosphate (BSP) were negative. IDSTs for MPS, HCS, and PSS were positive, whereas those for DSP and BSP were negative. By contrast, BATs for MPS, HCS, and PSS were negative. Although glucocorticoid-induced hypersensitivity caused by nonmedicinal ingredients such as lactose, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, and hexylene glycol has been reported; the glucocorticoids tested in this patient did not contain any of these nonmedicinal ingredients. As the glucocorticoids that were positive on IDST share a succinate ester, this might have caused MPS-induced anaphylaxis. Conclusions We report the case of MPS-induced anaphylaxis diagnosed by IDST but not BAT. In case reports of glucocorticoid-induced anaphylaxis in the literature, most patients were diagnosed with SPT or IDST. These results suggest that BAT should be considered when IDST and SPT are negative. Further studies are necessary to clarify the best strategy for diagnosing glucocorticoid-induced anaphylaxis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Currently, several biologics are used for the treatment of cutaneous pathologies such as atopic dermatitis (AD), psoriasis or skin cancers. The main administration routes are subcutaneous and intravenous injections. However, little is known about antibody penetration through the skin. The aim was to study the transcutaneous penetration of a reduced-size antibody as a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) compared to a whole antibody (Ab) and to determine its capacity to neutralize an inflammatory cytokine involved in AD such as human interleukin-4 (hIL-4). Transcutaneous penetration was evaluated by ex vivo studies on tape-stripped pig ear skin. ScFv and Ab visualization through the skin was measured by Raman microspectroscopy. In addition, hIL-4 neutralization was studied in vitro using HEK-Blue™ IL-4/IL-13 cells and normal human keratinocytes (NHKs). After 24 h of application, analysis by Raman microspectroscopy showed that scFv penetrated into the upper dermis while Ab remained on the stratum corneum . In addition, the anti-hIL4 scFv showed very efficient and dose-dependent hIL-4 neutralization. Thus, scFv penetrates through to the upper papillary dermis while Ab mostly remains on the surface, the anti-hIL4 scFv also neutralizes its target effectively suggesting its potential use as topical therapy for AD.",

We aimed to explore this in the Correlated Expression and Disease Association Research (CEDAR) patient cohort. Methods Differential expression analysis of ileal, transverse colon, and rectal biopsies were supplemented by a comparison of transcriptomes from platelets and leukocytes subsets, including CD4+, CD8+, CD14+, CD15+, and CD19+ cells. Asthma patients (n = 15) and controls (n = 15) had similar age ( p = 0.967), body mass index ( p = 0.870), similar numbers of females (80%) and smoking rates (13.3%). Results Significant differential expression was found in the ileum alone, and not in any other cell/tissue types. More genes were found to be overexpressed (1,150) than under-expressed (380). The most overexpressed genes included Fc Fragment of IgG Binding Protein ( FCGBP , logFC = 3.01, pFDR = 0.015), Mucin 2 ( MUC2 , logFC = 2.78, pFDR = 0.015), and Alpha 1B Defensin ( DEFA1B , logFC = 2.73, pFDR = 0.024). Gene ontology implicated the immune system, including interleukins 4 and 13, as well as antimicrobial peptides in this overexpression. There was concordance of gene over- ( STAT1 , XBP1 ) and underexpression ( NELF , RARA ) in asthma and Crohn’s disease ileum when our results were compared to another dataset (p = 3.66 × 10 –7 ).

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The symptoms of patients with respiratory disease are influenced by local environmental factors. The incidence of allergic rhinitis in grassland areas was significantly higher than that in non-grassland areas. We aimed to compare the profiles of chronic rhinitis patients obtained during the autumn pollen season in Baotou (grassland city) and Beijing (non-grassland city), China. Methods Questionnaire surveys and allergen testing were conducted on 1170 and 1232 patients with chronic rhinitis visiting the Second Affiliated Hospital of Baotou Medical College and Beijing Tongren Hospital, respectively, during the autumn pollen period. Information regarding medical history, severity of symptoms, and diagnosis and treatment was collected. Results More patients with moderate to severe chronic rhinitis and asthma (both, P &lt; 0.001) were present in Baotou than in Beijing. Mugwort was the most abundant allergen in both regions, but the number of patients sensitized to outdoor allergens in Baotou was higher than that in Beijing ( P &lt; 0.001). Indoor allergens in Beijing represented a considerable proportion of allergens, especially dust mites (33.4%). For patients with allergic rhinitis, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and runny nose were more severe in Baotou than in Beijing ( P &lt; 0.001). In both Baotou and Beijing, allergy ( P &lt; 0.001 vs. P = 0.004) and combined asthma ( P = 0.049 vs. P = 0.005) were common factors affecting the severity of the clinical symptoms chronic rhinitis. In Baotou, age ( r s = 0.195, P &lt; 0.001) and family allergy history ( P = 0.010) were also associated with symptom severity. Although significantly more patients in Baotou received oral antihistamines, nasal corticosteroids, and surgical treatment than in Beijing ( P &lt; 0.001), the number of people receiving allergy immunotherapy in Baotou was lower ( P = 0.004) and post-treatment symptom control was worse ( P &lt; 0.001) that that in Beijing. Conclusions During the pollen period, there were significant differences in the allergen spectrum between Baotou and Beijing. Allergy and combined asthma were common factors affecting the severity of clinical symptoms. Patients in Baotou presented with more severe clinical symptoms that were not satisfactorily managed due to the impact of pollen exposure, inconsistent access to care, and differing treatment modalities.",

    "abstract": "Intimacy-related allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, are under-reported due to social stigma, lack of awareness, and misdiagnosis. The differential diagnosis for intimacy-related anaphylaxis is extensive and includes systemic human seminal plasma allergy, exercise-induced anaphylaxis, asthma exacerbation, latex allergy, and transference of food or drug allergens through saliva or seminal fluid.Two adolescents met on a popular dating phone application. One individual had a long-standing history of asthma and peanut allergy. Although they never kissed, the male with peanut allergy received fellatio, while the other male had eaten peanut butter before they met. During fellatio, the peanut allergic male developed respiratory symptoms, used his bronchodilator, and collapsed. He remained unconscious despite aggressive interventions by emergency personnel called to the site. The clinical history and autopsy results suggested anaphylaxis to peanut allergen exposure from the intimate exposure as the cause of death.To date, nearly all reported cases of intimacy-related anaphylaxis involve symptomatic women. This is the first report of intimacy-related anaphylaxis involving men who have sex with men and the first report of potential allergen transfer from oral mucosa to a patient receiving fellatio. Based on the paucity of published cases, death from intimacy-related anaphylaxis is exceedingly rare. Post-mortem analysis is inherently difficult, as an elevated tryptase level has myriad potential causes; nevertheless, the authors suggest that intimacy-related anaphylaxis due to peanut allergy is the most likely diagnosis. With increasing popularity of relationship applications, especially amongst stigmatized populations, this case highlights the importance of allergy awareness and patient education to decrease risk, particularly in the adolescent population, who are already at increased risk of severe anaphylaxis. Especially amongst those participating in intimate activities, disclosure of one's allergies warrants discussion, as the outcome can be fatal. Our case demonstrates the crucial need for increased advocacy in food allergy, education around intimacy-related anaphylaxis, and the importance of allergy awareness and prevention across all populations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by unpredictable localized episodes of edema, which is frequently managed with long-term prophylactic medications. Until recently, long-term prophylaxis has predominantly required regular intravenous or subcutaneous administration, however the recent approval of berotralstat (Orladeyo™) offers an orally administered prophylactic which may be associated with a lower burden of treatment compared to injectable options for some patients. Case presentation This report describes four participants in the APeX-S trial who transitioned from subcutaneously administered lanadelumab (Takhzyro ® ) to daily oral berotralstat for long-term HAE prophylaxis. Lanadelumab dosing continued after berotralstat commencement in all patients and was tapered before discontinuation in three of the four patients. No substantial increases in HAE attack rates were observed after the transition to berotralstat monotherapy. One patient experienced a treatment-related adverse event (dyspepsia), which was mild and self-resolving. Conclusions All four patients described in this case series successfully transitioned from lanadelumab to berotralstat monotherapy for long-term prophylaxis without significant complications and without the use of a complex transition protocol. The decision to transition to berotralstat monotherapy and how the transition should be achieved was discussed between patient and physician, ensuring that the comfort and perspectives of the patients were considered during the treatment transition. This report highlights the importance of individualization of HAE management plans to address both the disease and treatment burdens of HAE, and thus to provide the best possible quality of life for each patient.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in childhood and is generally characterized by exercise induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). Assessing EIB is time consuming and expensive as it requires a fully equipped pulmonary function laboratory. Analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath is a novel technique for examining biomarkers which may associate with asthma features. The aim of this pilot study was to identify potential markers in the relationship between EIB and VOCs. Methods Children between four and 14 years old were asked to provide a breath sample prior to undergoing an exercise challenge test to assess for EIB. Results Breath samples were collected and analyzed in 46 asthmatic children, 21 with EIB and 25 without EIB (NO-EIB). Molecular features (MFs) were not significantly different between EIB and NO-EIB controls. 29 of the 46 children were corticosteroid naïve, 10 with EIB and 13 without. In the corticosteroid naïve group EIB was associated with increased MF23 and MF14 in the lower breath sample (p-value &lt; 0.05). Conclusion This pilot study shows that EIB was related to an increased MF14 and MF23 in corticosteroid naïve children. The tentative identities of these compounds are octanal and dodecane/tetradecane respectively. These candidate biomarkers have a potential to enable non-invasive diagnosis of EIB in steroid-naïve children. Trial registration This study is registered in the Netherlands trial register (trial no.

Older adult patients with bronchial asthma are defined as patients older than 65 and with a previous or current clear diagnosis of asthma. The purpose of this study was to determine the characteristics of older adult hospitalized patients with bronchial asthma. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the data from patients with bronchial asthma admitted to the General Hospital of the Northern Theater Command from September 2018 to January 2020. We divided them into the older adult (≥ 65 years) and the younger (&lt; 65 years) groups. We compared the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the two groups. Results There were 181 inpatients with bronchial asthma, including 41 older adult patients, accounting for 22.7%. There were significant differences in age, sex, smoking, duration of disease, age at diagnosis of asthma, hospital stays, hospitalization costs, number of acute attacks 1 year before admission, number of hospitalizations in our hospital one year before admission, asthma control test score, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), FEV1/FVC, the severity of acute attacks, comorbidities, and inhaled corticosteroid dose between the two groups. There were many older adult patients with asthma (mostly late-onset asthma). The hospitalization costs were high. Most patients had many comorbidities, poor asthma control, severe attack, and heavy economic burdens. Conclusion Attention should be focused on achieving asthma control in older adult patients to improve their quality of life and reduce their economic burdens.",

The gold standard for diagnosing clinical peanut allergy is the oral food challenge, but this method is time-consuming and can cause severe allergic reactions. It would therefore be beneficial to develop a tool for predicting clinical peanut allergy in peanut-sensitized individuals whose peanut allergy status is unknown so as to better determine who requires an oral food challenge for diagnosis. Two separate studies were conducted. In Study 1, we recruited 100 participants from the allergy clinic at McMaster University and community allergy outpatient clinics in the greater Hamilton area. We examined 18 different variables from participants and used univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis to determine how well these variables, singly and in combination, were able to predict clinical peanut allergy status. In Study 2, we conducted a retrospective chart review of a second cohort of 194 participants to investigate the reproducibility of our findings. This was a matched case–control study where 97 peanut-allergic participants were gender- and age-matched to 97 non-allergic control participants. Peanut skin prick test wheal size was the best predictor of clinical peanut allergy in both study cohorts. For every 1 mm increase in wheal size, the odds ratio of an individual having clinical peanut allergy was 2.36 in our first cohort and 4.85 in our second cohort. No other variable approached the predictive power of wheal size. Peanut skin prick test wheal size is a robust predictor of clinical peanut reactivity. The findings of this study may be useful in guiding clinician decision-making regarding peanut allergy diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "Scratching in infants is considered to be related to early development of eczema. Little is known about the effects of maternal immune markers on scratching among infants. The objective is to compare the risks related to maternal serum immune markers (IMs) during pregnancy and IMs in breast milk for the occurrence of scratching in infants at 6 and 12 months of age. Pregnant women were recruited in Columbia and Charleston, South Carolina. Blood (median 3 weeks prepartum) and breast milk (3 weeks postpartum) samples were collected. The concentrations of interferon (IFN)-γ, IFN gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) (or CXCL10), CCL11, interleukin (IL) 1β, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 (CXCL8), IL-10, IL-12 (p70), IL-13, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and immunoglobulin (Ig) A in both maternal serum and whey were assayed using optimized immunoassays. Scratching and skin manifestations were ascertained at 6 and 12 months. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate relative risks (RRs) of IMs for repeated measurements of scratching, considering intra-individual correlations and adjusting for confounders. Of 178 women, 161 provided blood and 115 breast milk samples. IL-1β, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, and CCL11 in maternal serum and whey were not analyzed due to a large proportion of non-detectable values. Infants in the highest tertile of IL-6 and IL-13 in maternal serum were at higher risk of scratching (RR 1.73 and 1.84, respectively; p ≤ 0.002) compared to infants in the first tertile; similarly, infants born to mothers with high (versus low) levels of serum IL-5 were also at increased risk (RR 1.60, p = 0.002). None of the breast milk IMs studied were associated with scratching. Scratching but not doctors diagnosed eczema was associated with higher levels of maternal IL-5, IL-6, and IL-13 during pregnancy. Further investigations are necessary to determine how maternal serum IMs influence infants scratching.",

He had a persistently elevated serum tryptase and demonstrated evidence of high titre serum specific IgE to shellfish. He responded well to histaminergic blockade.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma have been published over the last 15 years; however, there has been little focus on issues relating to asthma in childhood. Since the last revision of the 1999 Canadian Asthma Consensus Report, important new studies, particularly in children, have highlighted the need to incorporate new information into the asthma guidelines. The objectives of this article are to review the literature on asthma published between January 2000 and June 2003 and to evaluate the influence of new evidence on the recommendations made in the 1999 Canadian Asthma Consensus Report and its 2001 update, with a major focus on pediatric issues. Methods The diagnosis of asthma in young children and prevention strategies, pharmacotherapy, inhalation devices, immunotherapy, and asthma education were selected for review by small expert resource groups. The reviews were discussed in June 2003 at a meeting under the auspices of the Canadian Network For Asthma Care and the Canadian Thoracic Society. Data published through December 2004 were subsequently reviewed by the individual expert resource groups. Results This report evaluates early-life prevention strategies and focuses on treatment of asthma in children, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis and preventive therapy, the benefits of additional therapy, and the essential role of asthma education. Conclusion We generally support previous recommendations and focus on new issues, particularly those relevant to children and their families. This document is a guide for asthma management based on the best available published data and the opinion of health care professionals, including asthma experts and educators.",

    "abstract": "Objective/purpose The airway epithelium serves as a physical defense barrier to the external environment for the underlying tissue and suffers frequent injury. The response to injury is inflammation followed by debris clearance and repair. Although IL-13 is known to be a key cytokine in mediating inflammatory and remodeling responses via signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and early growth response protein 1 (Egr1), our laboratory has demonstrated that IL-13 is critical to airway epithelial repair via the release of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) and activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). IL-13 signals through two receptors, IL-13Ra1/IL-4R and IL-13Ra2. IL-13Ra2 has previously been thought to act exclusively as a decoy receptor, however our findings show that IL13Ra2 can act as a signaling receptor and is involved in mediating airway epithelial repair. Differential signaling via IL-13Ra1 or IL-13Ra2 may determine a remodeling versus repair response to injury in airway epithelium.",

    "abstract": "Patients with common variable immune deficiency and X-linked agammaglobulinemia are unable to produce their own antibodies thus leading to a higher incidence of recurrent infections, particularly those involving the sinuses and lungs. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy aims to reduce the incidence of infections; however, as serum IgG approaches its trough during the third and fourth week after infusion, we hypothesized that the rate of infection would be higher during this time period.Patients with a diagnosis of either common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) or X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) were analyzed in a prospective cohort study. Data was obtained as to the timing of symptom onset post infusion, the type of infection, as well as timing of the initiation of antibiotics. Descriptive analyses were conducted to explore the patterns of the data at each month and then over the course of the study year.Twenty-three patients with a diagnosis of either CVID (n = 22), or XLA (n = 1) were enrolled with a mean follow duration of 11.3 months. The mean number of days to infection after IVIg infusion, the primary endpoint, was 17.0 days with the most common infections reported as sinusitis and upper respiratory tract infections. There was no statistically significant difference (p = 0.70) in the rates of infection when considering the weeks post-infusion.We believe that this pilot study is the first reported prospective study to examine the timing of infections after IVIg infusion in individuals with CVID and XLA. Further multi-centered research with a larger sample size is required into the comparison of infection rates in primary immunodeficiency patients treated with IVIg versus subcutaneous immunoglobulin therapy, where serum IgG levels remain at steady state.",

    "abstract": "Sensitization to ash pollen is underestimated in various regions. The prevalence in Germany is about 10%. However, allergy to ash pollen is widely overlooked by allergists, since the pollination period of ash and birch in central Europe closely overlap and rhinoconjunctival symptoms during April/May are often assigned to birch pollen. Component resolved analysis of the different ash allergens is not routinely available. Therefore, we would like to question the usefulness of component resolved diagnostic via olive components, as ash and olive are both part of the Oleaceae family. 113 patients with nasal provocation and skin prick test to ash were retrospectively compared regarding their specific immunoglobulin E antibody profiles with response to native ash extract, rOle e 1, nOle e 7 and rOle e 9. In nasal provocation testing 58% of 113 patients sensitized to ash were allergic, 42% were only sensitized without showing symptoms. Skin prick testing and serology against native ash extract detected most patients sensitized to ash pollen, whereas rOle e 1 was less sensitive. However, the value of measurements of skin prick test, serology to native ash extract and rOle e 1 did not allow a differentiation between an allergy and clinically silent sensitization. Specific antibodies to nOle e 7 and rOle e 9 were only seen in individual patients and were all positive for native ash extract and rOle e 1. Skin prick testing and serology to native extract of ash pollen are the most reliable tools to diagnose a sensitization to ash pollen for patients living in Germany. Component resolved diagnostic to the major allergen rOle e 1 as representative of the Oleaceae family is possible but was less sensitive. Diagnostic of nOle e 7 and rOle e 9 did not show any additional benefit. Regarding differentiation between allergy and clinically silent sensitization to ash pollen, provocation is the leading diagnostic tool. Concluding, in routine clinical practice the standard methods—skin prick test, serology to native ash extract and provocation testing—remain crucial in the diagnosis and differentiation of ash sensitization and allergy.",

    "abstract": "Hereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency (C1-INH-HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant disease characterized by episodes of acute subcutaneous swelling, and/or recurrent severe abdominal pain. The disease is potentially fatal if the upper-airway is involved. Iatrogenic harm can occur if HAE is not considered in the differential diagnosis, the specialists are not aware of the natural history, diagnosis and treatment of HAE, or as a result of unnecessary surgical and other iatrogenic interventions.We present the case of a 72-year-old man who began suffering recurrent abdominal pain at the age of 8 years. The pain led to frequent emergency department visits, three emergency surgical interventions, and 5 endoscopies before C1-INH-HAE was diagnosed at the age of 70. Infrequent subcutaneous swellings were attributed to unknown allergic reactions that were not related to the primary diagnosis of abdominal pain. Family history was positive for recurrent abdominal pain and angioedema but was ignored until the propositus' grandson developed recurrent severe oro-facial edema attacks. The boy's mother searched the worldwide web and found educational materials on a patient association website. She suggested complement C4 and C1-INH testing that led to the appropriate diagnosis of C1-INH-HAE type 1 in her son and his grandfather.This report emphasizes the importance of accurately evaluating personal and family history in patients with a long history of recurrent, acute, severe but medically unexplained abdominal pain and cutaneous swellings. Here, the diagnosis of HAE was overlooked for 62 years and the focus on abdominal complaints led to numerous surgical interventions without consideration of the full differential diagnosis. Screening family members from all generations for unrecognized angioedema, abdominal pain, and measurement of C1-INH and C4 are essential for accurate and timely diagnosis of HAE.",

During this co-infection, it is not known whether this parasitic interaction induces synergistic or antagonistic cytokine response among humans. This study determined prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum malaria among Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense HAT and plasma cytokine profile levels associated with HAT and/or malaria infections. Participants were recruited at Lwala hospital in north eastern Uganda: healthy controls (30), malaria (28), HAT (17), HAT and malaria (15) diagnosed by microscopy and PCR was carried out for parasite species identification. Plasma cytokine levels of Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10 and Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-β) were measured by sandwich Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay and data statistically analysed using Graphpad Prism 6.0. The prevalence of P. falciparum malaria among T. rhodesiense HAT cases was high (46.8%). Malaria and/or HAT cases presented significant higher plasma cytokine levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10 and TGF-β than healthy controls (P < 0.05). Levels of IFN-γ, IL-6 and IL-10 were significantly elevated in HAT over malaria (P < 0.05) but no significant difference in TNF-α and TGF-β between HAT and malaria (P > 0.05). Co-infection expressed significantly higher plasma IFN-γ, IL-6, and IL-10 levels than malaria (P < 0.05) but no significant difference with HAT mono-infection (P > 0.05). The TNF-α level was significantly elevated in co-infection over HAT or malaria mono-infections (P < 0.05) unlike TGF-β level. Significant positive correlations were identified between IFN-γ verses TNF-α and IL-6 verses IL-10 in co-infection (Spearman's P < 0.05). The T. b. rhodesiense significantly induced the cytokine response more than P. falciparum infections. Co-infection led to synergistic stimulation of pro-inflammatory (IFN-γ, TNF-α), and anti-inflammatory (IL-6, and IL-10) cytokine responses relative to malaria mono-infection. Level of TNF-α partially indicates the effect induced by T. b. rhodesiense and P. falciparum mono-infections or a synergistic interaction of co-infections which may have adverse effects on pathogenesis, prognosis and resolution of the infections.Trial registration VCD-IRC/021, 26/08/2011; HS 1089, 16/01/2012.",

It is characterized by severe asthma, chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and intolerance towards nonsteroidal analgesics (NSAR). Arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites play an important role in the pathogenesis of AERD. It is still unknown, whether metabolism of AA is comparable between the upper and lower airways as well as between patients with and without NSAR intolerance.We sought to analyze differences in the expression of cyclooxygenases type 1 and 2 (COX-1, COX-2), arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) and cysteinyl leukotriene receptor type 2 ( CysLT2 ) in nasal polyps and the bronchial mucosa of patients with aspirin intolerant asthma (AIA, n=23 ) as compared to patients with aspirin tolerant asthma (ATA, n=17 ) and a control group with nasal polyps, but without asthma (NPwA, n=15 ).Tissue biopsies from nasal polyps and bronchial mucosa were obtained during surgical treatment of nasal polyps by endonasal functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) under general anesthesia from intubated patients. Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze the expression of COX-1, COX-2, 5-LOX and CysLT2 in nasal and bronchial mucosa. Categorization into the different patient groups was performed according to the patient history, clinical and laboratory data, pulmonary function and provocation tests, as well as allergy testing.We observed a stronger expression of 5-LOX and CysLT2 in submucosal glands of nasal and bronchial tissue compared to epithelial expression. The expression of COX-1 and COX-2 was stronger in epithelia compared to submucosal glands. There was a similar expression of the enzymes and CysLT2 between upper and lower airways in all patient groups. We did not detect any significant differences between the patient groups.The AA-metabolizing enzymes and the CysLT2 were expressed in a very similar way in different microscopic structures in samples of the upper and lower airways of individual patients. We did not detect differences between the patient groups indicating the pathogenetic role of AA metabolism in these disorders is independent of the presence of NSAR-intolerance.",

Methods and materials:The validation assessments for the assays successfully fulfilled requirements for critical parameters including accuracy, precision, range of quantitation, selectivity, dilution linearity, hook effect, ruggedness and robustness, and analyte stability.The crossover SAHARA study had two treatment periods (TP) 1 and 2 of 14 weeks each; the patients were randomized into three of the treatment groups A/B, B/A and A/A for the two periods with A being 200 IU C1-INH and B being Placebo.The seventeen PD time-points were 1a, 8a, 16a, 24a, 27/28a, 27/28a 48 h (in TP1) 1b, 8b, 16b, 24b, 28b, 28b 24 h, 28b 48 h, 28b 72 h, 28b 96r (in TP2), 1 week Post and 1 month Post.The PD samples collected from 15 consented patients (out of total 75) were used in this assessment.Results: Both ELISAs offered a better dynamic range of detection compared to the choromogenic method.A significant correlation was observed between the results from three fC1-INH methods when 219 individual PD data points were correlated; the Pearson 'R' was 0.94, 0.92, and 0.89 for C1s binding vs. Chromogenic, FXIIa binding vs. Chromogenic, and C1s binding vs. FXIIa binding methods, respectively.When the fC1-INH PD profiles from three methods of these 15 patients who underwent different treatment regimen in the cross over study were superimposed, the profiles matched for individual patients with an average CV (Coefficient of Variation) of 25% across time-points.Conclusion: In summary, the results generated in parallel from HAE plasma using three different fC1-INH methods are comparable in spite of various principles followed in each of the assays.Since the ELISA results showed a significant correlation to the results from the conventional method, the in-house built ELISAs could serve as good alternates for measuring fC1-INH in HAE plasma with a better dynamic range of detection.",

Current mouse model research has identified the early life gut microbiota as a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of asthma and atopic diseases [2-4]. We hypothesize that the early life gut microbiota could play a similar preventative role against atopic disease development in humans. Methods 1262 children enrolled in the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) Study with complete skin prick test and wheeze data at one year were grouped into four clinically relevant phenotypes: atopy + wheeze, atopy only, wheeze only, and control. Bacterial 16S rDNA from 3-month and 1-year stool samples of 319 children in these four phenotypes was extracted, amplified, and subjected to high throughput Illumina sequencing. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) analysis were also conducted on 44 children in the two extreme phenotypes (atopy + wheeze vs. control). Results 16S sequence analysis of our sample cohort (319 subjects) identified bacterial populations that differed in abundance in the atopy + wheeze group at 3-months of age but not at 1-year of age. Additionally, significant changes in the abundance of certain bacterial genera were found in the atopy + wheeze group when compared to controls by qPCR at 3-months of age only. Changes in stool short chain fatty acid production between the atopy + wheeze group and the control group were also observed at 3months of age only. Conclusions Shifts in the relative abundance of certain gut bacterial populations and differences in the levels of stool SCFAs before 3-months of age are associated with atopy and wheeze at one year of age.",

    "abstract": "Basophils are important effectors cells in allergic rhinitis (AR) since they are involved in immunoglobulin (Ig) E - mediated inflammation and in the release of pro-inflammatory mediators. Specific subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) provides clear immunologic modulation in some immune cells, however its systemic effects on basophils are not well known.Peripheral blood (PB) samples from 43 patients with allergic rhinitis mono-sensitized to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dpt) [33 of them under SCIT with allergoid Dpt extract, in maintenance dose (SCIT), with evaluation just before SCIT injection (SCIT-T0) and 4 hours later (SCIT-T4) and the other 10 Dpt allergic patients never having, in the past, undergone specific immunotherapy treatment (NSIT)], and 15 healthy age- and gender-matched controls (HG), were analyzed. For each sample, the total (t-IgE) and specific IgE (s-IgE) was performed, as well as, the relative frequency and absolute number of PB basophils and receptor-bound IgE and IgG expression were evaluated by flow cytometry and the Histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT) and tryptase α/β1 (TPSAB1) gene expression was assessed by real-time PCR.Higher levels of receptor-bound IgE were observed in SCIT patients, which are correlated with the levels of serum t-IgE and s-IgE, whereas no significant differences were observed for receptor-bound IgG. Regarding HNMT mRNA expression, significantly lower expression levels were detected in AR patients compared to HG, independently of type of therapy. Moreover a negative correlation was found between HNMT gene expression and time under SCIT. Conversely, tryptase gene expression was significantly up-regulated in NSIT when compared to HG; however in SCIT patients, tryptase gene expression was significantly decreased than in NSIT patients. No differences were found for any parameter between SCIT-T0 and SCIT-T4 with exception of a transient increased expression of tryptase in SCIT-T4.PB basophils from patients with AR show altered functional features, which seems to be influenced by SCIT, suggesting that these cells could be useful to clarify the SCIT triggered mechanisms at a systemic level.",

    "abstract": "Beta-hemolytic Group A Streptococcus invasive disease (iGASd) has been subject to intense research since its re-emergence in the late 1980s. In Quebec, an increase in the number of severe iGASd cases has recently been observed. Because of the inter-individual variability in the severity of iGASd, a hereditary predisposition to invasive disease can be suspected. Given that iGASd occurs in MyD88- and IRAK4-deficient patients, although rarely, the increasing frequency of iGASd in the population of French-Canadian children may be associated with a deficiency in the host’s innate immune response. In this report, we assessed the influence of: (i) bacterial genotype and virulence factors, (ii) immune-cellular features, and (iii) Myd88/IRAK4-dependent response to GAS in vitro on the susceptibility to iGASd in a paediatric cohort of 16 children: 11 French-Canadian and 5 from diverse origin. GAS virulence factors and genotype are not implicated in the susceptibility toward iGASd, and cellular and MyD88/IRAK4 deficiencies are excluded in our patients. Although it has been shown that the MyD88/IRAK4-dependent signal is involved in the response to invasive GAS, our data indicates that a MyD88/IRAK4-mediated signalling defect is not the main factor responsible for the susceptibility to severe iGASd in a paediatric population from the province of Quebec.",

The recent introduction of peanut oral immunotherapy (peanut OIT; Palforzia [Peanut ( Arachis hypogaea) Allergen Powder-dnfp]) for peanut allergy addresses a significant unmet need but also highlights the requirement for consideration of several factors by both prescribers and patients. Objective To provide guidance for prescribers of licenced peanut OIT to facilitate treatment delivery and improve outcomes. Methods Clinicians with experience of licenced peanut OIT (United States n = 6, United Kingdom n = 1) participated in a series of interviews and group discussions designed to elicit tips for successful implementation. Results Clinicians identified 8 tips that were considered the most relevant, practical, and impactful for prescribers of Peanut (Arachis hypogaea) Allergen Powder-dnfp: (1) preparing to provide treatment, (2) assessing the medical indication for treatment and (3) shared decision making, (4) staff education, (5) establishing office processes, (6) managing patient expectations and using anticipatory guidance, (7) optimising adherence and (8) maintaining flexibility throughout the treatment process. In addition, a range of supporting materials (e.g., checklists and action plans) are provided. Conclusion The introduction of a novel therapy often requires healthcare providers to modify or adopt practices to effectively employ the treatment. The provision of guidance based upon early real-world experiences of licenced peanut OIT may help inform clinical practice and improve treatment outcomes.",

Demographics, clinical features, and airway inflammation type determined by sputum cytometry were compared between CFTR carriers and non-carriers. Multiple linear regression was used to identify clinical predictors of CFTR carrier status. Response to nebulized hypertonic saline was assessed by comparing the number of infective exacerbations before and after its initiation.75 patients underwent CFTR mutation testing. Of these, 13 (17%) were CFTR carriers. The most common mutation was [Formula: see text]F508. CFTR carriers were older (adjusted odds ratio 1.06 (CI 95% 1.01, 1.13)) and had more frequent flares requiring hospitalization (4.19 (1.34, 24.74)). Neutrophilic airway inflammation was the most common inflammatory subtype in CFTR carriers, though 8/13 also had eosinophilic bronchitis. Nebulized hypertonic saline was well tolerated by most and reduced the frequency of infective exacerbations.The prevalence of CFTR heterozygosity in this cohort with recurrent neutrophilic bronchitis is higher than in the general population. Respiratory disease in CFTR carriers is associated with older age and may cause significant morbidity. Airway neutrophilia is the most common inflammatory subtype, but > 50% had eosinophilic bronchitis requiring treatment. Hypertonic saline appears to be well tolerated and effective in reducing the number of infective exacerbations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background One of the main barriers to vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is the fear of developing hypersensitivity reactions to any of its components. Although these reactions are very rare, it is necessary to establish an effective protocol to detect patients at risk of developing them. The aim of this study was to evaluate hypersensitivity reactions in vaccinated patients in order to allow or not to complete the vaccination protocol. Methods Descriptive and cross-sectional study in which patients with suspected hypersensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were evaluated. All patients underwent skin prick test (SPT) and/or intradermal test (IDT) with the vaccines and their excipients. In patients with positive IDT with the vaccine, a histopathological and immunohistochemical study was performed by skin biopsy. A basophil activation test (BAT) and a lymphoblastic transformation test (LTT) were also performed. Results Sixteen patients with suspected hypersensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (12 received Comirnaty ® , 3 received Vaxzevria ® , and 1 received Spikevax ® ) were evaluated. Half had immediate hypersensitivity reactions and half had delayed reactions. All SPTs to excipients and vaccines were negative. IDTs with all excipients were negative. IDTs with vaccines were positive in 11 patients and negative in 5. The histological and immunohistochemical study of the two selected patients with positive IDT with vaccine showed T-lymphocyte involvement. BAT and LTT were negative in both cases. The vaccination protocol could be completed in 7 of 16 patients (44%) studied. The remaining 9 patients did not receive the second dose: 5 because vaccination was not required and 4 because they refused to be vaccinated. Conclusions Thanks to the allergological and immunohistochemical study, the vaccination protocol could be completed in about half of the patients who presented suspected hypersensitivity reactions to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. IDTs with vaccines could be a valuable method for assessing the immunogenicity of the vaccines.",

However, little is known about the roles of KIF2A as well as the possible underlying mechanisms in asthma. Methods House dust mite (HDM) extract was administered to establish a murine model of asthma. The expression of KIF2A, IL-33 and the autophagy pathways were detected. The plasmid pCMV-KIF2A was used to overexpress KIF2A in the airway epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo. IL-4, IL-5, IL-33 and other cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissues homogenates were measured. Results In response to the challenge of house dust mite (HDM) in vitro and in vivo, airway epithelial cells displayed decreased production of KIF2A. Meanwhile, autophagy and IL-33 were increased in HMD-treated epithelial cells. Mechanistically, KIF2A decreased autophagy via suppressing mTORC1 pathway in HDM-treated epithelial cells, which contributed to the reduced production of IL-33. Moreover, in vivo KIF2A transfection reduced IL-33 and autophagy in the lung, leading to the attenuation of allergic asthma. Conclusion KIF2A suppressed mTORC1-mediated autophagy and decreased the production of epithelial-derived cytokine IL-33 in allergic airway inflammation. These data indicate that KIF2A may be a novel target in allergic asthma.",

Methods Adults in northern China with self-reported rhinitis symptoms triggered or worsened by airborne pollution were randomized to budesonide 256 µg/day or placebo for 10 days in pollution season (October 2019 to February 2020). The primary endpoint was the mean change from baseline in 24-h reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) averaged over 10 days. The secondary endpoints were subject-assessed Global Impression of Change (SGIC), mean change from baseline in individual nasal symptom severity, and mean change from baseline in individual non-nasal symptoms of cough and postnasal drip severity. One-sided P &lt; 0.0125 was considered statistically significant. Results After an interruption by COVID-19, an interim analysis showed that the study could be ended for efficacy with n = 206 participants (103/group) since the primary efficacy endpoint demonstrated significant results. The final efficacy results showed that the 10-day-averaged rTNSS change in the budesonide group was greater than with placebo (− 2.20 vs − 1.72, P = 0.0107). Budesonide also significantly improved 10-day-averaged itching/sneezing change (− 0.75 vs − 0.51, P = 0.0009). Results for SGIC and all other individual symptoms did not show significant differences between the two groups. Conclusions Intranasal budesonide 256 µg once daily improved the total nasal symptoms and itching/sneezing over 10 days in adults with rhinitis triggered/worsened by airborne pollution.",

    "abstract": "Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is the only treatment that has modified the natural history of allergic diseases. However, since its overall effect on the immune system has not been elucidated, AIT is either absolutely or relatively contraindicated in patients with rheumatic autoimmune diseases (RADs). Therefore, there have been no long-term observations of patients with RADs receiving AIT; thus, the effectiveness and safety of AIT in these patients remain unclear.This was a single-center retrospective observational study. RAD patients receiving AIT for allergic rhinitis at our institution were selected. Changes in the activity of RAD patients were investigated for 2 years from baseline, including those who discontinued AIT. The effectiveness of AIT was also investigated using the Japan Allergic Rhinitis Standard Quality of Life Questionnaire.Thirteen patients with RADs were enrolled in the study. All patients received sublingual immunotherapy, of which four discontinued AIT owing to adverse events. Among all patients, the symptoms of RADs in three patients worsened during the observation period; however, none of them were causally related to AIT. Most of the adverse events associated with AIT were mild, in which only one patient required drug intervention due to worsening rhinitis symptoms. In the nine patients who were able to continue AIT, their eye and nasal symptom scores showed a significant improvement from 1.67 (1.5-2.0) at baseline to 0.67 (0-1.17) in the 2nd year of treatment (p = 0.0141).AIT is a safe and effective treatment modality for patients with allergic rhinitis complicated by RADs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare, autosomal disorder that manifests with unpredictable episodes of severe swelling of the skin and mucous membranes. These attacks can be highly disfiguring and range in severity from mild to—in cases of airway swelling—life-threatening. Fluctuations in female sex hormones—such as the changes that occur during puberty, menses, contraceptive use, pregnancy, and menopause—can all affect the frequency and severity of HAE attacks. Disease management decisions for women of childbearing age may be more complex and require additional considerations since they could develop complications related to contraception, pregnancy, labor, delivery, and lactation. In addition, some HAE treatment options are contraindicated during pregnancy. Discussions about medications used to treat HAE should include a risk–benefit assessment of the woman’s health status, her preferences, and other factors that are relevant to the choice of therapy. Planning prophylactic therapies that are effective and safe before, during, and after pregnancy can prevent gaps in treatment, ensure continuity of care, and reduce both disease burden and risk of adverse fetal outcomes. The 2020 US Hereditary Angioedema Association (HAEA) Medical Advisory Board and 2021 World Allergy Organization/European Academy of Allergy and Immunology (WAO/EAACI) Guidelines outline key considerations for managing HAE in females of childbearing age (15–45 years), with the goal of improving treatment efficacy and safety for this cohort of patients. Treatment decisions made in a collaborative manner involving the patient, HAE specialist and obstetric/gynecologic specialist, is the best approach to ensure optimal HAE management and safety in this patient population.",

Next, the expression levels of miR-3934 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 50 asthma patients and 50 healthy volunteers were examined by RT-qPCR methods. The basophils were then treated with AGEs and transfected with miR-3934 mimics. The apoptosis levels were examined by flow cytometry assay; and the expression levels of cytokines were detected using the ELISA kits. Finally, the Western blot was performed to examined the expression of key molecules in the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway.miR-3934 was down-regulated in the basophils of asthmatic patients. The expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and IL-33 was enhanced in basophils from asthmatic patients, and this effect was partially reversed by transfection of miR-3934 mimics. Furthermore, receiver operating characteristics analysis showed that miR-3934 levels can be used to distinguish asthma patients from healthy individuals. miR-3934 partially inhibited advanced glycation end products-induced increases in basophil apoptosis by suppressing expression of RAGE.Our results indicate that miR-3934 acts to mitigate the pathogenesis of asthma by targeting RAGE and suppressing TGF-β/Smad signaling.",

Among otologic manifestation, middle ear effusion (MEE) is less recognized but a problematic condition as it may progress to hearing impairment when left untreated. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics, risk factors and clinical outcomes of MEE in EGPA patients.This is a case-control study of patients who were diagnosed and treated for EGPA from January 1995 to November 2018. Patients with ear symptoms (ear fullness, ear discharge, tinnitus or hearing loss) were assessed by otologists and were included in the case group (n = 23) if clinically relevant. The other patients without MEE were included in the control group (n = 52). Risk of MEE was calculated using the Cox proportional-hazard model.During median follow-up of 9.9 years, 23 (30.7%) out of 75 patients had MEE. In MEE group, 12 (52.2%) patients had hearing loss; conductive type in 10 (10/12, 83.3%) and mixed type in two (2/12, 16.7%). In multivariable regression analysis, major organ involvement at diagnosis (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 65.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.50-2838.39; P = 0.030] , early onset of ear symptom after systemic therapy (< 6 months) (aHR 40.0; 95% CI, 1.35-1183.43; P = 0.033) and continuing the maintenance steroid without cessation (aHR 8.59; 95% CI, 1.13-65.42; P = 0.038) were independently associated with a risk of MEE. To control MEE, 16 (69.6%) patients had to increase maintenance steroid dose and 9 (39.1%) patients experienced recurrent MEE whenever maintenance dose was tapered.MEE is a common but frequently neglected condition in EGPA which is often intractable. The maintenance steroid dose should be adequately adjusted to control MEE and to prevent from progressive hearing loss. Novel biologic agents possibly have a role in controlling MEE in EGPA.",

Objective To present our scoping review protocol, that will inform a forthcoming living scoping review in which we will investigate the peer-reviewed and grey literature on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and allergic disease and/or allergic reactions following a COVID-19 vaccine. Methods Informed by Arksey and O’Malley framework for methodological review, we have developed a search strategy with content and methodological experts, and which has undergone Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies review. A search of four scientific databases, as well as gray literature, will be performed without restriction to articles by type of COVID-19 vaccine, or country of study, and will include publications in the ten languages our team can handle. Bi-monthly search alerts based on the search strategy will be generated. Results The first search will result in a stand alone peer reviewed scoping review. Bi-monthly updates will be posted on a pre-print server. Depending on the volume of literature, these updates will be synthesized and submitted for peer-review at 6 and/or 12 months. Conclusion COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy amongst individuals with allergy persists, despite very low risk of serious adverse reactions. Our living scoping review, which includes multiple forms of knowledge translation, will be a rigorous way to address hesitancy.",

HSR to folinic acid (FA), used particularly for the treatment of digestive carcinoma along with oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil, are rare. Only seven publications report HSR to FA, mainly confirmed by the disappearance of symptoms after the withdrawal of FA from chemotherapy. Only two papers describe allergy testing. Due to the difficult diagnosis, patients usually receive several further cycles of chemotherapy with progressively more intense symptoms before the withdrawal of FA.Here we document two cases of HSR to FA, initially misattributed to oxaliplatin. The first patient described successive cycles with first back muscle pain, then chills and facial oedema and finally diffuse erythema with labial edema despite premedication. The allergy assessment highlighted high acute tryptase levels and intradermal tests positive for FA, pointing to an immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated mechanism. The second patient also had lower back muscle pain and chills in addition to tachycardia and desaturation during the administration of FA. Skin tests were negative and tryptase levels normal. After withdrawing FA, the symptoms did not recur, thus allowing the patient to continue chemotherapy. The mechanism of FA hypersensitivity is still unclear. The chronology of symptoms suggests an IgE-mediated mechanism that was not documented in the allergy assessment. A non-IgE-mediated mast cell/basophil activation could be involved, through complement activation or through Mas-related G protein-coupled receptors X2 (MRGPRX2) particularly.These two cases of anaphylaxis to FA document the clinical manifestations associated with two different mechanisms of HSR. This paper provided the opportunity to review the limited literature on HSR to FA. Through these cases, we hope to draw the practitioner's attention to FA as a potential agent of severe hypersensitivity, especially if symptoms remain after withdrawing the most suspected chemotherapeutic agents. We want also to stress the importance of allergy testing.",

Sleep-onset time was ~ 40 min later in the difficult-to-treat group ( p = 0.019). Discussion Broadly, we observed no difference in accelerometer-derived sleep-metrics between mild and difficult-to-treat asthma. This is the largest analysis of accelerometer-derived sleep parameters in asthma and the first comparing groups by asthma severity. Sleep-onset initiation may be delayed in difficult-to-treat asthma but a dedicated study is needed to confirm.",

We have shown an association between PAR-2 expression in peripheral blood monocytes and asthma severity as well as blood PAR-2 mRNA level and lung function. Since F2RL1 (the gene encoding PAR-2) polymorphisms affect PAR-2 expression, we hypothesize they may affect asthma severity. Methods We recruited 76 subjects with asthma of varying severity and collected clinical (FEV 1 [% predicted], FEV 1 /FVC, IgE) and immunological (PAR-2 mRNA, blood eosinophils) disease parameters. We also genotyped these individuals for 3 F2RL1 SNPs (-45C/T, -149C/G, c.621C/T). Results We found that the F2RL1 SNP “C” allele of -45C/T (rs1529505) was associated with PAR-2 mRNA and blood eosinophils. F2RL1 SNP c.621C/T (rs631465) was associated with PAR-2 mRNA. The F2RL1 SNP -149C/G (rs2242991) had no association with any of the parameters studied.

These labels can lead to reduced use of first-line beta-lactam antibiotics and worse outcomes. We measured the impact of a previously performed inpatient proactive systematic penicillin allergy de-labelling program on subsequent antibiotic use.

In the 6-months following admission, beta-lactams were prescribed more frequently in the intervention groups vs. the non-intervention groups for all patients (28 [16.1%] vs.15 [7.7%], p = 0.04) and were prescribed more frequently amongst those who received at least one antibiotic (28/46 [60.9%] vs.15/40 [37.5%], p = 0.097). In a multivariate regression analysis, the intervention groups were found to be associated with an increased odds of beta-lactam prescribing in all patients (OR 2.49, 95%CI 1.29-5.02) and in those prescribed at least one antibiotic (OR 2.44, 95%CI 1.00-6.15). No drug-related adverse events were reported. Proactive penicillin allergy de-labelling for inpatients was associated with a reduction in penicillin allergy labels and increased utilization of beta-lactams in the subsequent 6-months.",

    "abstract": "The poly-sensitization to Hymenoptera venom makes it difficult to select genuine allergens for immunotherapy and increases patients' costs. The objective of this study was to determine the culprit allergen in dual or triple-sensitized patients to three Hymenoptera venoms through molecular diagnosis and evaluating the results of incorporating the molecular diagnosis with skin tests. Thirty-two patients with anaphylactic reactions and dual or triple-sensitization to Hymenoptera venoms in skin tests entered this study. IgE-sensitization to whole extracts and molecules of Apis mellifera (Api m), Vespula vulgaris (Ves v), and Polistes dominulus (Pol d) was evaluated utilizing ALEX or ImmunoCAP. Twenty-nine patients (90.6%) were male. IgE-sensitization to at least one of the allergenic molecules related to Apis mellifera, Vespula vulgaris, and Polistes dominulus was seen in 59.4, 53.1, and 21.9%, respectively. Among 32 patients, 14 (43.8) and 8 (25%), were mono-sensitized to Api m and Ves v components in ALEX, respectively. Double sensitization to Hymenoptera was identified in 18.8% of patients in ALEX. Api m 1+/Api m 2-/Api m 10- and Ves v 1+/Ves v 5+ demonstrated the most prevalent sensitizations patterns in our patients. The molecular diagnosis of IgE-sensitization to Hymenoptera venoms can be valuable, especially in patients who show dual or triple-sensitization in skin tests, as the ALEX results revealed mono and double-sensitization to Hymenoptera venoms in 22 and 6 patients, respectively. Regarding the high cost and adverse reactions of venom immunotherapy, especially for two or three venoms, incorporating the molecular diagnosis alongside skin tests for accurate diagnosis of the culprit venom could help decrease costs for patients.",

To gain a better understanding of the current standards of care and treatment patterns of patients, the CASCADE practice reflective program was established to conduct a real-world analysis of severe asthma management among specialists in Canada with a goal of identifying areas of opportunity to enhance patient management and outcomes. Methods The CASCADE program was a two-part practice reflective and assessment program delivered through an on-line portal for selected specialists (Respirologists and Allergists) in Canada. The program consisted of a one-time overview survey of physician practice to establish overall practice parameters, followed by a review of at least 5 severe asthma patients to establish the current landscape of severe asthma management. Results The program collected practice overview surveys from 78 specialists (52 Respirologists, 24 Allergists, and 2 General practice physicians with an interest in respiratory disease) in 8 provinces. Practices included a variety of types in both large metropolitan centres and smaller regional settings. There were 503 patients reviewed and included in the program. Most (65%) patients were currently using a biologic treatment, 30% were biologic naive, and 5% had used a biologic treatment in the past. Most patients (53%) were reported to have mixed allergic and eosinophilic phenotypes, despite a perception that allergic, eosinophilic and mixed phenotypes were evenly balanced in the physician practice. Overall, patients currently treated with biologic agents had parameters suggesting higher control and were more satisfied with treatment. However, there was less than optimal treatment satisfaction for more than half of all patients, particularly for those patients not treated with a biologic agent. Conclusions Phenotyping is hampered by poor availability for several assessments, and the full range of treatments are not currently fully utilized, partly due to physician familiarity with the agents and partly due to prescribing restrictions. Even when treated with biologic agents, patient satisfaction can still be improved.",

Recent studies show a worldwide incidence between 50 and 112 occurrences per 100,000 person-years. The most identified triggers are food, medications, and insect venoms. We aimed to analyze triggers and clinical symptoms of patients presenting to a Swiss university emergency department for adults. Methods Six-year retrospective analysis (01/2013 to 12/2018) of all patients (&gt; 16 years of age) admitted with moderate or severe anaphylaxis (classification of Ring and Messmer ≥ 2) to the emergency department. Patient and clinical data were extracted from the electronic medical database of the emergency department. Results Of the 531 includes patients, 53.3% were female, the median age was 38 [IQR 26–51] years. The most common suspected triggers were medications (31.8%), food (25.6%), and insect stings (17.1%). Organ manifestations varied among the different suspected triggers: for medications, 90.5% of the patients had skin symptoms, followed by respiratory (62.7%), cardiovascular (44.4%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (33.7%); for food, gastrointestinal symptoms (39.7%) were more frequent than cardiovascular symptoms (36.8%) and for insect stings cardiovascular symptoms were apparent in 63.8% of the cases. Conclusions Average annual incidence of moderate to severe anaphylaxis during the 6-year period in subjects &gt; 16 years of age was 10.67 per 100,000 inhabitants. Medications (antibiotics, NSAID and radiocontrast agents) were the most frequently suspected triggers. Anaphylaxis due to insect stings was more frequently than in other studies. Regarding clinical symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms need to be better considered, especially that initial treatment with epinephrine is not delayed.",

Hence, this study aimed to assess the association between psoriasis and the co-occurrence of asthma, rhinitis, and eczema in adolescents. Methods This school-based cross-sectional study enrolled adolescents ( n = 3,864) aged 11–14 years. Parents completed a questionnaire on doctor-diagnosed psoriasis as well as symptoms and clinical history of asthma, rhinitis, and eczema. Eight nonoverlapping groups comprising single and co-occurring current (past 12 months) asthma, rhinitis, and eczema were identified. A multinomial logistic regression model was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results In the analytical sample ( n = 3,710; 1,641 male and 2,069 female participants), 3.5% reported doctor-diagnosed psoriasis, and 15.7%, 15.0%, and 10.3% had current asthma, rhinitis, and eczema symptoms, respectively. Doctor-diagnosed psoriasis was associated with “asthma only” (aOR = 2.11, 95% CI: 1.15–3.89), “eczema only” (6.65, 4.11–10.74), “asthma + eczema” (5.25, 2.36–11.65), “rhinitis + eczema” (3.60, 1.07–12.15), and “asthma + rhinitis + eczema” (7.38, 2.93–18.58). Doctor-diagnosed psoriasis was not statistically significantly associated with “rhinitis only” (1.42, 0.71-–2.84) and “asthma + rhinitis” (1.78, 0.69–4.56). Conclusion Our findings indicate that psoriasis is associated with the co-occurrence of allergic diseases among adolescents. However, further studies are required to investigate which biological mechanisms may be shared between psoriasis and allergic diseases.",

The effect of OIT on the quality of life in adults, however, has been studied to a much lesser degree. Methods Patients with food allergy aged ≥ 18 years who underwent OIT at Shamir Medical Center completed the Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire-Adult Form (FAQLQ-AF) before and at the end of treatment. Adults with FA not undergoing OIT who completed the FAQLQ-AF at 2 time points, served as controls. Results A total of 44 adults, median age 23.4 years, who underwent OIT for milk (n = 19), egg (n = 2), peanut (n = 9), sesame (n = 6), and tree nuts (n = 8), and 11 controls were studied. The median OIT starting dose was 23.8 mg protein. 33 patients (75%) reached full desensitization within a median of 10.3 months. The FAQLQ-AF baseline scores were comparable between the study and control groups for all items except for Food Allergy related Health (FAH) item in which the study group had a significantly better score (p = 0.02). At the second time point, the study group had significantly better scores in all items (Allergen Avoidance and Dietary Restrictions (AADR), p = 0.02; and Emotional Impact (EI), Risk of Allergen Exposure (RAE), FAH and the Total Score, p &lt; 0.01).

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Penicillin allergy adversely impacts patient care, yet most cases do not have true allergies. Clinicians require efficient, reliable clinical tools to identify low risk patients who can be safely de-labeled. Our center implemented the FIRSTLINE electronic point-of-care decision support tool to help non-allergist practitioners risk stratify patients with penicillin allergy. We sought to explore the reliability and validity of this tool in relation to allergist assessment and actual patient outcomes. We additionally compared it with two other published stratification tools, JAMA and PENFAST, to assess ability to accurately identify low risk patients appropriate for direct oral challenge. Methods In this single-center, retrospective, observational study, 181 pregnant females with self-reported penicillin allergy between July 2019 to June 2021 at BC Women’s Hospital, Vancouver, Canada were used to assess the reliability and validity of all three tools. Physician-guided history of penicillin use and symptoms were used for scoring. Results and recommendations were compared to actual patient outcomes after clinician decision for direct oral challenge or intradermal tests. We compared the performance of JAMA, PENFAST and FIRSTLINE. Results 181 patients were assessed. 176/181 (97.2%) patients were deemed not allergic. Each risk stratification tool labelled majority of patients as low risk with 88.4% of patients PENFAST 0–2, 60.2% of patients JAMA low risk, 86.7% of patients FIRSTLINE very low risk. Conclusion We demonstrate that our point-of-care electronic algorithm is reliable in identifying low risk pregnant patients, as compared to an allergist assessment. To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide direct comparison between multiple decision support tools using the same population, minimizing participant bias. Providing clinical algorithms to risk stratify patients, can enable healthcare professionals to safely identify individuals who may be candidates for direct penicillin oral challenges versus needing referral to specialists. This increases the generalizability and efficiency of penicillin allergy de-labeling.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Oral food challenge (OFC) is the gold standard for diagnosing food allergies (FAs) but carries the risk of anaphylactic reaction. Stepwise OFC, starting with a low dose of allergen and progressing to medium and full doses, is effective in determining a tolerable dose. We retrospectively evaluated the results of a stepwise OFC for hen’s egg (HE) to demonstrate its safety and efficacy. We discuss whether early low-dose administration of HE induces early immune tolerance in HE allergy. Methods We included 2,058 children (median, 2.6 years) who underwent HE-OFC between 2017 and 2021 at two institutes in Japan. The target challenge dose of OFC was classified as low (less than 1/8 of a cooked egg), medium (1/8 or more but less than 1/2), or full (1/2 or more). If the low-dose OFC was negative, subjects were allowed to consume the same dose of HE and underwent medium-dose OFC within 12 months. Even if positive, individuals were recommended to consume previously-tolerated amounts of HE and repeat OFC at the same dose within 12 months. We evaluated the correlation between their OFC results and response. Results A total of 526 (25.6%) children presented positive reactions. There were no cases of anaphylactic shock. Higher serum egg white (EW)- (P &lt; 0.001) and ovomucoid (OVM)- specific IgE (P &lt; 0.001) (sIgE) levels were associated with positive OFC. The low-dose OFC group had more positive reactions ( P &lt; 0.001), younger children ( P &lt; 0.001), higher EW-sIgE ( P &lt; 0.001) and OVM-sIgE ( P &lt; 0.001), and more histories of anaphylaxis ( P = 0.014). OFC-positive children were younger than OFC-negative children, particularly in low-dose OFC ( P = 0.010). OFC results between complete and partial elimination of HE groups across all EW- or OVM-sIgE classes were similar ( P &gt; 0.05). Conclusions Stepwise OFC is safe and effective in diagnosing HE allergy and facilitates the earlier introduction of HE in children. This study suggests the limited potential of early consumption of lower doses of HE to induce earlier immune tolerance, such that other strategies to induce earlier tolerance in infants with HE allergy should be considered.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases (EGIDs) are chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disorders characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms and eosinophilic inflammation in specific regions of the gastrointestinal tract. “Eosinophilic gastritis” (EoG) refers to the condition in which the stomach is involved. In patients with EoG, approved treatment options are restricted despite the high mortality associated with the condition. Dupilumab is a human monoclonal antibody directed against the interleukin (IL)-4 receptor α subunit and inhibits the signaling pathways of both IL-4 and IL-13. The real-world data on the effectiveness of dupilumab for EoG are limited. We present the case of a patient with EoG and accompanying severe asthma who demonstrated improvement with dupilumab administration. Case presentation A 35-year-old woman who had been treated for asthma complained of worsening intermittent upper abdominal pain. Her dyspnea aggravated and she was admitted to our hospital for asthma exacerbation. Despite the improvement in her asthma symptoms with systemic corticosteroids, her abdominal pain persisted. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopic mucosal biopsy revealed eosinophilic cell infiltration; therefore, the patient was diagnosed with EoG. Dupilumab administration was initiated for asthma, while improvement of secondary EoG was expected. Following dupilumab administration, both EoG and asthma symptoms, disease control, laboratory findings, endoscopic findings, and pathological findings improved. No adverse events have been reported after the dupilumab treatment. Conclusion This case report supports that dupilumab could be an effective treatment option for EoG and accompanying severe asthma.",

    "abstract": "Food allergy typically begins early in life and persists as a lifelong condition. Delayed introduction of allergenic foods followed by years of hesitancy to introduce these foods early may have contributed to the increase in food allergy prevalence in recent decades. Most infant feeding guidelines focus on the importance of early introduction of allergenic foods in infants at around age 4-6 months. However, regular, ongoing ingestion of allergenic foods is also critical for the primary prevention of food allergy. Similarly, intermittent exposure to cow's milk formula (CMF) in early infancy increases the risk of cow's milk allergy (CMA), while regular exposure (if it is introduced) prevents it. Families hesitant to introduce allergenic foods to their infant at home (despite education) should be offered introduction in a primary care clinic. Infants who have failed primary prevention should be referred to an allergist for consideration of early infant oral immunotherapy (OIT).",

    "abstract": "The nature of the relationship between the mind and the body has preoccupied philosophers and physicians for centuries. In current discussions of health and disease, this subject and its implications for well-being are frequently pointed out in the media and are of great interest to the public. For example, contemporary thinking concerning the increasing prevalence of chronic inflammatory diseases (such as allergic asthma) bases itself on the assumption that psychological stress, via neuroendocrine and immunologic networks and changes in homeostasis, can influence lung function and thus expression of disease. There is indeed evidence that stress can induce attacks of asthma and may also cause asthma to develop. Unfortunately, the literature in these fields is large, complex, and often confusing.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, we are quickly gaining a broader understanding of some of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate environmental perturbations, through stress, to cause dysregulated physiologic responses, eventuating in chronic inflammatory diseases such as allergies. Stressful stimuli early in life can have long-lasting impacts on mind-body pathways, and physiologic and pathophysiologic responses, later in life. Recent discoveries have shown that stress-related epigenetic changes and associated alterations in gene expression in early (even fetal) life can lead to long-lasting impacts on adult health and disease; such studies may identify novel therapeutic pathways and targets for control of many chronic diseases. It is becoming clear that a more thorough understanding of the nature and extent of mind-body pathways is essential if we are to develop novel and effective management strategies for allergic and other chronic diseases.\r\n\r\nAs part of a rigorous participatory process to identify fundamental gaps in our knowledge and to develop a strategic research plan, AllerGen NCE Inc., a recently funded Canadian Network of Centres of Excellence, held a workshop on the mind-body of allergic diseases in Hamilton, Ontario, on February 14, 2007, which brought together over 25 clinicians, scientists, and trainees to learn about this exciting and rapidly advancing field and to initiate discussions that would lead to development of a strategic research plan on mind-body issues in allergic diseases. Outstanding invited speakers provided state-of-the-art presentations at the workshop, which are highlighted in this issue of the journal.\r\n\r\nDr. Rosalind Wright provides a most informative summary and assessment of the relationship of stress to the risk of development of childhood asthma. Dr. Firdaus Dhabhar contributes a scholarly review of the often opposing effects of acute and chronic stress on the immune system and on host defences and immunopathology. Dr. Glenda MacQueen and her colleague Dr. Ryan van Lieshout provide a comprehensive review of the role of psychological factors, including cognitive function and depressive disorders, in the expression of asthma, discussing the implications of these findings for psychological and other therapeutic interventions. Dr. Moshe Szyf and his colleague Dr. Michael Meaney supply a cutting-edge update on epigenetics and early-life events that can influence behaviour and health and disease later in life.\r\n\r\nWe are most enthusiastic about the excellence of these written reviews and are pleased that the journal is making these internationally available to practicing allergists, scientists, and others. The contributions by the speakers at the workshop were instrumental in fostering the beginnings of programmatic research activities in the mind-body field for AllerGen NCE Inc. Moreover, the reviews provide important information, a tool for reflection, and a stimulus for research and development that in the future will greatly benefit those with allergic and other inflammatory diseases.",

Although no treatment guidelines exist, C1 esterase inhibitor concentrate (C1-INH) is used on an off label basis for management of ACEI acquired angioedema (ACEI AAE). Objective To evaluate the efficacy of C1-INH in management of ACEI AAE at our local centers. Results Nine patients, from 3 academic sites, were identified through Allergy Service consultation data and records from Diagnostic Services Manitoba, Canada from 2010–2020. The majority of the patients (n = 8/9) required endotracheal intubation prior to the initiation of C1-INH. Overall, approximately 56% of patients (n = 5/9) had resolution of angioedema ranging between 12 and 17 h, with a median time of 13.5 h, and no recurrence after the administration of C1-INH concentrate. One patient had transient symptom resolution in 14 h, however, recurrence of angioedema required re-intubation. The remainder of patients (n = 4/9), had resolution of angioedema between 22 and 72 h, with a median time of 33.75 h. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate continued ambivalence of the efficacy and role of C1-INH concentrate in the treatment of ACEI AAE, secondary to multiple uncontrolled confounding factors. Further research into characterizing a subgroup of intubated patients in our study that responded to C1-INH concentrate needs to be completed.",

Immediate hypersensitivity (HS) reactions to cefaclor have continuously been reported and are expected to increase with its greater use. This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and risk factors of immediate HS to cefaclor over the most recent 5 years. Methods This retrospective study investigated 521 adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to cefaclor at pharmacovigilance centers at two tertiary hospitals from January 2014 to December 2018. In total, 459 patients with immediate HS to cefaclor were reviewed. Results A total of 459 cases of cefaclor immediate HS were included among 521 cefaclor ADRs, and anaphylaxis was recorded in 61.2%.

This study aimed to classify asthma into four endotypes according to the allergic and eosinophilic characteristics and explore the phenotypes (clinical characteristics, pulmonary functions, and fractional expired nitric oxide (FeNO)) of each endotype. Methods This retrospective study included non-acute asthma patients treated at the First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University (05/2016–01/2018). The patients were classified into the eosinophilic allergic, eosinophilic non-allergic, non-eosinophilic allergic, and non-eosinophilic non-allergic asthma endotypes. Serum sIgE, lung function, FeNO, and induced sputum cytology were tested and compared among groups. Results Of the 171 included patients, 22 had eosinophilic allergic asthma, 17 had eosinophilic non-allergic asthma, 66 had non-eosinophilic allergic asthma, and 66 had non-eosinophilic non-allergic asthma. Lung function measurements (FEV1%, FEF25%, FEF50%, FEF75%, and FEF25–75%) showed that airway dysfunction was worse in eosinophilic non-allergic asthma than in the other three endotypes (all P &lt; 0.001). In allergic asthma patients, eosinophilic asthma had worse airway dysfunction than non-eosinophilic asthma (all P &lt; 0.05). Similar results were found in non-allergic asthma (all P &lt; 0.01). The FeNO levels in eosinophilic allergic asthma were higher than in eosinophilic non-allergic and non-eosinophilic non-allergic asthma (both P = 0.001). Conclusions FeNO can objectively reflect eosinophilic airway inflammation in asthma. Endotypic classification of asthma patients regarding the allergic and eosinophilic characteristics is conducive to the effective management of patients with asthma.",

The clinical course and outcome of COVID 19 infection with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and GLILD is not well known. Case presentation Our patient met the clinical features of CVID secondary to low IgG/IgA, recurrent infections, and failure to respond to pneumococcal vaccination. He was treated with monthly maintenance IVIG therapy. Our patient also was diagnosed with co-existing GLILD that despite IVIG treatment was progressing. The patient needed to be started on Rituxan and Mycophenolate mofetil to achieve control but unfortunately became infected with COVID19 delaying his treatment for GLILD. Our patient only suffered from mild COVID 19 infection and was able to make antibodies to this. We believe severe infection was avoided as his CVID was well controlled with IVIG therapy despite progression of his granulomatous interstitial lung disease. Conclusion In conclusion, our patient with CVID with co-existing biopsy proven granulomatous interstitial lung disease despite being very high risk for severe COVID 19 infections only had mild infection. This was believed to be due to well controlled CVID with IVIG therapy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background A significant portion of COVID-19 sufferers have asthma. The impacts of asthma on COVID-19 progression are still unclear but a modifying effect is plausible as respiratory viruses are acknowledged to be an important trigger for asthma exacerbations and a different, potentially type-2 biased, immune response might occur. In this study, we compared the blood circulating cytokine response to COVID-19 infection in patients with and without asthma. Methods Plasma samples and clinical information were collected from 80 patients with mild (25), severe (36) or critical (19) COVID-19 and 29 healthy subjects at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK. The concentrations of 51 circulating proteins in the plasma samples were measured with Luminex and compared between groups. Results Total 16 pre-existing asthma patients were found (3 in mild, 10 in severe, and 3 in critical COVID-19). The prevalence of asthma in COVID-19 severity groups did not suggest a clear correlation between asthma and COVID-19 severity. Within the same COVID-19 severity group, no differences were observed between patients with or without asthma on oxygen saturation, CRP, neutrophil counts, and length of hospital stay. The mortality in the COVID-19 patients with asthma (12.5%) was not higher than that in patients without asthma (17.2%). No significant difference was found between asthmatic and non-asthmatic in circulating cytokine response in different COVID-19 severity groups, including the cytokines strongly implicated in COVID-19 such as CXCL10, IL-6, CCL2, and IL-8. Conclusions Pre-existing asthma was not associated with an enhanced cytokine response after COVID-19 infection, disease severity or mortality.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction to medication. While a relatively rare phenomenon, early identification and discontinuation of the offending agent is pivotal to patient management. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of probable atorvastatin induced DRESS syndrome without rash. Case presentation An adult female presented with 4 days of persistent fevers, abdominal and flank pain, malaise, and generalized muscle weakness without any cutaneous reaction following 20 days of therapy with atorvastatin. She was febrile (38.5 °C), at presentation with a heart rate of 72, and blood pressure of 93/51 mmHg. Her laboratory investigations at their peak demonstrated an Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) of 792 U/L, Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 265 U/L, gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) of 236 U/L, total bilirubin at 21 mg/dL, eosinophils 3100 cells/µL, leukocytes 20.2 K/µL, hemoglobin of 12.5 gm/dL. During her admission she had normal creatinine and troponin. Her serology for Hepatitis A, B and C were negative. Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr viral serologies were negative. Antinuclear Antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), mitochondrial antibody, and smooth muscle antibody were negative. The patient was initially diagnosed as having pyelonephritis due to nonspecific bilateral flank pain but given ongoing fevers and lack of clinical and laboratory improvement with antibiotics, a diagnosis of atorvastatin induced DRESS syndrome was considered probable, and atorvastatin was discontinued. The patients’ clinical status improved gradually without any further therapy and her liver enzymes and eosinophils normalized over the course of a month. Conclusion In patients who present with systemic organ involvement and eosinophilia, even without cutaneous manifestations, clinicians should apply the RegiSCAR criteria for DRESS syndrome. This can then help guide treatment with discontinuation of offending agent, or treatment with systemic corticosteroids.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The Global Initiative for Asthma has only recently added tiotropium bromide as adjunct controller therapy in severe asthma (Step 4 or 5) in adults (2015) and children (2019). Although not yet approved for pediatric use by Health Canada, it has been occasionally offered by asthma specialists as a therapeutic trial in children with troublesome asthma or treatment for adverse effects. The objective of this study was to describe the indications and real-life clinical experience in initiating tiotropium in children with asthma. Methods We designed a retrospective mixed-method case series study of children aged 1–17 years who initiated tiotropium in our tertiary-care centre between 2013 and 2020. Clinical information was extracted from electronic medical records and tiotropium dispensing, from drug claims. Parents/children and physicians independently completed a questionnaire about treatment goals, perceived efficacy, safety, satisfaction, and lessons learned. Results The 34 (11 females; 23 males) children had a median (range) age of 9.1 (1.4–17.8) years. Children were primarily on Step 4 (85%) or 5 (6%) prior to tiotropium initiation, yet most (84%) did not increase their treatment step after tiotropium initiation. The physicians’ treatment goals were to improve asthma control, alleviate adverse effects of current therapy, and/or improve lung function. The most improved symptoms were coughing/moist cough, difficulty breathing, whistling breath, and bronchial secretions/mucus. Although most parents and physicians reported a significant benefit with tiotropium bromide, physicians particularly remarked, as their “lesson learned’, on the improvement in chronic symptoms in asthmatic children, particularly those with prominent moist cough and in lung function, in those with seemingly none (or incompletely) reversible obstruction as well as the ability to decrease the ICS and/or LABA dose to lessen adverse effects. A few physicians raised caution on the risk of lower adherence with an additional inhaler. Conclusion In children with severe asthma on Step 4 or 5, tiotropium bromide was primarily used as substitute, rather than additional, adjunct therapy to improve asthma control, alleviate adverse effects, and/or to improve lung function. The latter two indications, combined with its perceived effectiveness in children with prominent moist cough, also suggest additional indications of tiotropium to be formally explored.",

We report efficacy/ safety findings from a 3-month MF/F study in subjects with severe asthma. Materials and methods This was a 3-month, randomized, double-blind, parallelgroup, multicenter study with a 2-3-week open-label, run-in period of mometasone furoate (MF) 400 μg twice-daily (BID). Subjects (≥12 years) were randomized to MF/F (200/10 μg or 400/10 μg BID) or MF (400 μg BID). The primary endpoint was the area under the curve (AUC) of the change in serial FEV1 (0-12 hours) for MF/F 400/10 μg vs MF 400 μg from baseline to Week 12. Adverse events (AEs) and other clinical safety measures were recorded. Results A total of 728 subjects (mean: age = 47.9 y, asthma duration = 14.0 y, FEV1 % predicted = 66.3, reversibility = 22.9%, Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ] score = 1.93) were randomized. Improvements in mean changes from baseline in FEV1 AUC0-12 h (L ×h ) at Week 12 were MF/F 200/10 μg = 3.59, MF/F 400/10 μg = 4.19, and MF 400 μg = 2.04, with both MF/F doses significantly better than MF (p < 0.001). These FEV1s correspond to average hourly increases of 0.30, 0.35, and 0.17 L, respectively. MF/F was associated with rapid (<5 min) and sustained improvement in lung function. The percentage of subjects experiencing asthma deterioration (ie, severe asthma exacerbation) was 12.4% (MF/F 200/10 μg), 12.2% (MF/F 400/10 μg), and 18.3% (MF 400 μg). There were no notable differences in AEs between the groups. Conclusions Both medium- and high-dose MF/F combination therapy led to significantly greater improvements in lung function compared with high-dose MF monotherapy in severe asthmatics.",

We describe a cohort of patients with recurrent angioedema whose clinical features and response to medications are distinct from the causes above. Patients were accrued retrospectively from an academic allergy practice between 2007 and 2014. After institutional research ethics board approval, patients' charts were reviewed and demographic, clinical and laboratory data were extracted. A total of 11 patients were recruited. The mean age at presentation was 54.9 years (range 19–70 years) and 6 of 11 were male. The mean number of episodes per year was 18.7 (range 2–60) and mean duration of episodes was 22.4 h (range 4–96). About half of episodes (52%) began overnight. Areas of involvement were lips (73%), tongue (64%), eyelids (18%), feet (36%) and hands (27%). None of the patients had low C3, C4, or CH50; none had significantly positive ANA; C1 esterase inhibitor level and function and C1q were normal in all patients tested. In these 11 patients, complete suppression of recurrences by the combination of cetirizine 20 mg daily and montelukast 10 mg daily was reported by 9 (82%) of patients; whereas 2 (18%) of patients had a partial response to this combination of medications. Herein, we report a form of angioedema without urticaria, mediated by a combination of histamine and leukotrienes. Clinical, demographic and therapeutic characteristics differentiate this from other recognized causes of angioedema.",

The study includes 4 recruitment sites across Canada (Vancouver, Edmonton, Manitoba, and Toronto). Women enrolled while pregnant will be followed, along with their child for 5 years. Home assessments were done at 3 months, clinical assessments at 1, 3, and 5 years of age, and questionnaires are administered every 6 months. If a study participant withdraws, staff completes a one page questionnaire to determine reasons for withdrawal. The checklist incudes: no reason given, father not interested, family lacks time, family concern regarding privacy, expense to family, inconvenient to travel, complicated family situation, testing difficult, enrolled in another study, too many questionnaires, separation, personal health issue and others. Maternal factors included: history of asthma or food allergy, marital status, socioeconomic status (post secondary education, income), ethnic/ cultural group, being born in Canada, age, and stress measured by a Perceived Stress Scale. Results CHILD recruited 3628 participants at 4 sites (Vancouver 816, Edmonton 840, Manitoba 1107, and Toronto 865). Of the 316 participants withdrawn from the study, 149 were not eligible due to birth issues and 167 withdrew).

Several hours after the initial exposure, some individuals exhibit a chronic late phase (dual responders, DRs) whereas others do not (early responders, ERs). The purpose of this study is to determine changes in Th17 and regulatory T (Treg) cell numbers and their associated gene expression profiles in whole blood between allergen-induced ERs and DRs. Methods 14 participants with mild, atopic asthma (8 ERs and 6 DRs) underwent a cat allergen inhalation challenge as part of the AllerGen Clinical Investigator Collaborative. Whole blood was collected immediately prior to challenge (pre) and 2 hours post-challenge. DNA methylation analysis was used to measure the frequency of Th17, Treg, B and T cells (Epiontis, Germany). Whole blood transcriptome profiling was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip ® Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays. Statistical analysis was performed using R. Results Sum of the T cell and B cell frequencies obtained using the methylation assays strongly correlated (r = 0.95) with the lymphocyte frequency obtained using a hematolyzer. Allergen inhalation did not significantly (p>0.05) change Th17, Treg, B and T cell counts between ERs and DRs. However, the Th17/Treg ratio was significantly (p=0.03) different between ERs and DRs post challenge. 199 genes positively correlated with Th17 cells at an FDR of 5%. 463 genes positively correlated with Treg cells at an FDR of 5%. Th17 genes were inversely correlated with Treg genes. Conclusions Th17/Treg ratio derived using DNA methylation analysis discriminates allergen-induced early from dual asthmatic responses. The inverse correlation between Th17 genes and Treg genes may be indicative of the inflammatory or suppressive phenotypes of these cells.",

    "abstract": "Allergic rhinitis affects 10–30 % of the global population and this number is likely to increase in the forthcoming years. Moreover, it commonly co-exists with allergic asthma as a chronic allergic respiratory syndrome. While the involvement of Th2 cells in allergy is well understood, alterations of pro-inflammatory Th17 responses remain poorly characterized. The aim of our study was to determine whether natural seasonal allergen exposure causes changes in T cell subset characteristics in patients with allergic rhinitis and asthma. Sixteen patients with allergic rhinitis/atopic asthma (9M, 7F; age 31.8 ± 12.1) and 16 healthy controls were recruited into the study (9M, 7F; age 31.2 ± 5.3). Blood samples were collected from the patients 1–3 months before pollen season (visit 1), within 7 days of the appearance of pollen/initiation of allergic symptoms (visit 2) and 2 weeks after visit 2 following the introduction of symptomatic treatment with antihistamines (visit 3). Flow cytometry was used to assess major T cell subsets (naïve, central memory, effector memory and CD45RA+ effector) and key T cell cytokine production (IFNγ, IL-17A, TNF and IL-4) using intracellular staining. Data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA and paired t test. As expected, an increase in the percentage of IL‐4+ CD4+ cells was observed during natural pollen exposure in patients with allergic respiratory syndrome. No significant changes were observed in the production of other cytokines, including Th17 cells, which tended to be lower than in the control population but unchanged during pollen exposure. Introduction of antihistamine treatment led to only moderate changes in cytokine production from CD4 and CD8 T cells. Selective changes in CD8+ T cells were observed during natural pollen exposure including a decrease in transient cells (with features of CD45RA+ and CD45RO+ cells) and a decrease in the percentage of central memory cells in the peripheral circulation. Within the CD4 cell group the total percentage of CD45RA positive CD4 cells was increased during pollen exposure. Th1 and Th17 responses are not altered during pollen season but allergen exposure affects T cell activation and memory cell status in patients with allergic respiratory syndrome.",

This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of SPT with fresh milk compared to CE (cow's milk and casein) for evaluation of cow's milk allergy (CMA).This study summarized the medical records of children, diagnosed with CMA. The data include demographics, skin tests and oral food challenge results, as well as atopic comorbidities.Records of 698 patients with the diagnosis of CMA were reviewed, 388 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Overall, 134 patients (34.54%) had an additional atopic disease. The SPT wheal size with fresh milk was significantly larger than with CE (cow's milk and casein) at first evaluation or before oral food challenge (OFC). Combination of SPT results (CE and FF) gave the maximal odds ratio for reaction during OFC and SPT with fresh milk alone gave the minimal OR (34.18 and 4.74, respectively).SPT with CE for CMA evaluation is more reliable than SPT performed with fresh milk. In patients suspected of having IgE-mediated CMA, before deciding on performing OFC, it is advised to perform SPT with at least two different extracts, and always include casein. Fresh milk can serve as a backup if commercial extracts are not available. In cases that the SPT with fresh milk is 3 mm or less, there is 93.3% chance that the OFC will pass without reaction.

The relationship between these methods has not been previously investigated.We aimed to measure the correlation between FEV1, max and AUC during the early asthmatic response (EAR) and the late asthmatic response (LAR), and to determine if the EAR recovery period for HDM would be longer than other allergens (cat, grass, horse, and ragweed).We retrospectively calculated the AUC and correlation between FEV1, max and AUC during the EAR(0-2 h) and LAR(3-7 h) for each allergen. We compared EAR(0-3 h) and LAR(3-7 h) FEV1, max, AUC and absolute difference in FEV1, max to the most recovered FEV1 (FEV1, min). We performed pairwise comparisons of correlation and slope values using Fischer's r to z transformation and t-tests, respectively. AUC and absolute differences in FEV1, max and FEV1, min were compared using a one-way ANOVA test, followed by a post-hoc Scheffe test.Correlation between the FEV1, max and AUC during the EAR(0-2 h) (n = 221) was 0.807, and was 0.798 during the LAR(3-7 h) (n = 157 of 221), (difference p = 0.408). The EAR(0-3 h) AUC and FEV1, max did differ between allergens (both p < 0.0001) but the LAR(3-7 h) AUC and FEV1, max did not (p = 0.548 and 0.824, respectively). HDM did not have a larger AUC or FEV1, max, than all other allergens during the EAR(0-3 h) or the LAR(3-7 h). The absolute difference between the FEV1, max and FEV1, min during the EAR(0-3 h) did not differ between allergens (p = 0.180).The FEV1, max and AUC for both the EAR(0-2 h) and LAR(3-7 h) had excellent correlation, with no significant difference. Thus, significant bronchoconstriction will likely result in a longer recovery period. There was no evidence of delayed EAR(0-3 h) recovery following HDM challenges, so HDM did not induce a larger response compared to all the other allergens examined.Not registered. This is not a clinical trial. (This study is a retrospective analysis of data collected during several registered trials.).",

    "abstract": "Allergic asthma occurs worldwide and is particularly prevalent in westernized countries characterized by chronic airway inflammation resulting in airway hyperresponsiveness. The house dust mites (HDM) including Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus are major sources of sensitization and triggering allergic symptoms in asthmatic patients. The Der p 2 is a major allergen and the predominant source of causative respiratory disorders which induce airway inflammation and bronchial constriction in mite-allergic patients. Few studies evaluate the ameliorating effects of modified Liu-Wei-Di-Huang-Wan (modified LWDHW) on allergic asthma. This study aimed to investigate the immunological mechanisms of modified LWDHW on the reductions of airway inflammation, signal transduction, inflammatory cytokine production, Th2 cell proliferation, and bronchial obstruction in Der p 2-induced asthmatic mice. At least ten active ingredients were contained in the formula of modified LWDHW- 1217A and 1217B. Results showed that the immunoglobulin generations (Der p 2 specific- IgE and IgG1), inflammatory cytokine productions (IL-5 and IL-13) in the Sera and BALF could be down-regulated, and the Th1-cytokine productions (IL-12 and IFN-γ) be increased after immunotherapy with modified LWDHW of 1217A or 1217B. The inflammatory cell infiltrations (macrophages, eosinophils, and neutrophils) in the airway and the expressions of TH2-related genes (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13), TH2-related transcription factor (GATA-3), and neutrophil chemotactic chemokine (IL-8) in the lung tissue of asthmatic mice were significantly decreased after the immunotherapy. The Th1/Th2 polarization had been identified that the IL-4+/CD4+ T cells were downregulated and IFN-γ+/CD4+ T cells were increased. The airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine inhalation of Penh values was significantly decreased in the treated groups. There were significant improvements in the bronchus histopathology after immunotherapy with 1217A or 1217B which were evaluated by tracheal thickness, inflammatory cell count, and tracheal rupture of mouse lung. It revealed that 1217A or 1217B could regulate the immune responses and improve pulmonary function. Data suggests that modified LWDHW of 1217A or 1217B have the potential for use as a therapeutic intervention for the treatment of mite allergen Der p 2-induced allergic asthma.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a chronic disease with high prevalence. There are currently many treatments available. However, despite an often good therapeutic response, many patients still report impairment in quality of life (QoL) during the pollen season. A skewed T helper (Th)2 polarization is a well-acknowledged pathologic feature of AR. In animal models, local notch signaling in peripheral tissue seems crucial for Th2 cell differentiation and the development of AR. However, the involvement of Notch signaling in Th2 cell differentiation and the development of AR in humans remains unknown. Hence, the present study investigated the human expression of Notch receptors on CD4 + T-cells in nasal mucosa and blood. Correspondingly Notch ligand expression was assessed on nasal epithelial cells and neutrophils. Methodology Nasal brush and blood samples from 18 patients with pollen-induced AR and 22 healthy controls were collected outside the pollen season. Notch 1–4 and Jagged-1,2 and Delta-like ligand 1,3–4 was analyzed using flow cytometry. Results The fraction of CD4 + Notch1 + and CD4 + Notch4 + T-cells was higher in AR patients than in healthy control patients. Further, the expression levels of the Notch ligands JAG-1 and DLL-1 were increased in nasal epithelial cells from AR patients compared to healthy control patients. In addition, AR patients displayed higher expression of JAG-1 on neutrophils both in the nasal mucosa and in peripheral blood. Conclusion The present study is the first to demonstrate increased activity in the Notch1/4 - JAG-1/DLL-1 pathways among allergic individuals. Further propagating the importance of Notch signalling in AR and blocking JAG-1 and DLL-1-induced Notch signalling by nasal epithelial cells and Neutrophils are potential targets to reduce allergic airway inflammation.",

Waitlists for specialists are long, and many referred patients have already received prior allergic assessment, either by a certified Allergist, Primary Care Provider, or other Specialist. It is important to understand the prevalence and motivating factors for multiple-opinion referrals, to deliver timely assessment for patients with allergic disease. Methods A retrospective chart review of demographic information, number of previous consultations, and motivation for new consults and multiple-opinion referrals, of pediatric patients aged 8 months–17 years to BC Children’s Hospital Allergy Clinic from September 1, 2016–August 31, 2017, was performed. Referral data including reason for referral or multiple-opinion, primary allergic concerns, and others, from referral forms and consult notes were accessed through local Electronic Medical Records and subsequently analyzed for trends in categorical variables to assess the rationale for and impact of multiple-opinion referrals to our clinic. Results Of 1029 new referrals received, 210 (20.4%) were multiple-opinion referrals. Food allergy was the predominant allergic concern prompting further opinion (75.7%). The main rationale for seeking further opinions was wanting an assessment by a certified allergist in cases where prior consultation was performed by non-allergist specialist, primary care provider, or alternative health care provider. Of second-opinion referrals generated, 70 (33.3%) initial consultations were performed by an Allergist, whereas 140 (66.7%) were performed by a non-allergist. Conclusions Many new consults at the BCCH Allergy Clinic are multiple-opinion assessments, contributing to long waitlists. Advocacy at the systems level through standardized referral guidelines, centralized triaging systems, and stronger support for Primary Care Providers is needed to provide better access in Canada for children needing a specialized Allergist.

    "abstract": "Approximately 6-7% of Canadian children have food allergy. These families face substantial burdens due to the additional costs incurred purchasing allergy-friendly products necessary for management compared to families without food allergies. In the year prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, these costs were equivalent to an average of $200 monthly compared to families without food allergy. As food prices continue to rise, rates of food insecurity also increase, disproportionately affecting households with food allergy who have limited choices at food banks. Families living or working in Winnipeg, Canada with an annual net income of about $70,000 or less the year prior to recruitment and a child under the age of 6 years old with a physician diagnosed milk allergy were recruited between January and February 2022. Participating families received bi-weekly home deliveries for six months, from March to August 2022, of subsidy kits containing ~$50 worth of milk allergy-friendly products. Semi-structured interviews, completed ± 2 weeks from the final delivery, were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed thematically. Eight interviews, averaging 32 min (range 22-54 min), were completed with mothers from all different families. On average, mothers were 29.88 ± 4.39 years old and children were 2.06 ± 1.32 years old. All children reported allergies in addition to milk. Based on the data from these interviews, we identified 3 themes: food allergy causes substantial burden for families, \"I have to get his allergy-friendly food first before getting to my basic needs\", and perceived emotional and financial benefits of a milk allergy-friendly food subsidy program. This study, along with previous research, suggests that there is a need for assistance for families managing milk allergies. It also provides important information to inform development of programs which can address these financial challenges. Our in-kind food subsidy was perceived as having a positive impact on food costs and stress associated with food allergy management, however, parents identified a need for more variety in the food packages. Future programs should strive to incorporate a greater variety of products to address this limitation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Inborn errors of immunity (IEIs) are considered significant challenges for children with IEIs, their families, and their medical providers. Infections are the most common complication of IEIs and children can acquire coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) even when protective measures are taken. Objectives To estimate the incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in children with IEIs and analyse the demographic parameters, clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes in children with IEIs with COVID-19 illness. Methods For this systematic review, we searched ProQuest, Medline, Embase, PubMed, CINAHL, Wiley online library, Scopus and Nature through the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) guideline for studies on the development of COVID-19 in children with IEIs, published from December 1, 2019 to February 28, 2023, with English language restriction. Results Of the 1095 papers that were identified, 116 articles were included in the systematic review (73 case report, 38 cohort 4 case-series and 1 case–control studies). Studies involving 710 children with IEIs with confirmed COVID-19 were analyzed. Among all 710 IEIs pediatric cases who acquired SARS-CoV-2, some children were documented to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (n = 119, 16.8%), intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation (n = 87, 12.2%), suffered acute respiratory distress syndrome (n = 98, 13.8%) or died (n = 60, 8.4%). Overall, COVID-19 in children with different IEIs patents resulted in no or low severity of disease in more than 76% of all included cases (COVID-19 severity: asymptomatic = 105, mild = 351, or moderate = 88). The majority of children with IEIs received treatment for COVID-19 (n = 579, 81.5%). Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) due to COVID-19 in children with IEIs occurred in 103 (14.5%). Fatality in children with IEIs with COVID-19 was reported in any of the included IEIs categories for cellular and humoral immunodeficiencies (n = 19, 18.6%), immune dysregulatory diseases (n = 17, 17.9%), innate immunodeficiencies (n = 5, 10%), bone marrow failure (n = 1, 14.3%), complement deficiencies (n = 1, 9.1%), combined immunodeficiencies with associated or syndromic features (n = 7, 5.5%), phagocytic diseases (n = 3, 5.5%), autoinflammatory diseases (n = 2, 3%) and predominantly antibody deficiencies (n = 5, 2.5%). Mortality was COVID-19-related in a considerable number of children with IEIs (29/60, 48.3%). The highest ICU admission and fatality rates were observed in cases belonging to cellular and humoral immunodeficiencies (26.5% and 18.6%) and immune dysregulatory diseases (35.8% and 17.9%) groups, especially in children infected with SARS-CoV-2 who suffered severe combined immunodeficiency (28.6% and 23.8%), combined immunodeficiency (25% and 15%), familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (40% and 20%), X-linked lymphoproliferative diseases-1 (75% and 75%) and X-linked lymphoproliferative diseases-2 (50% and 50%) compared to the other IEIs cases. Conclusion Children with IEIs infected with SARS-CoV-2 may experience higher rates of ICU admission and mortality in comparison with the immunocompetent pediatric populations. Underlying immune defects does seem to be independent risk factors for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in children with IEIs, a number of children with SCID and CID were reported to have prolonged infections–though the number of patients is small–but especially immune dysregulation diseases (XLP1 and XLP2) and innate immunodeficiencies impairing type I interferon signalling (IFNAR1, IFNAR2 and TBK1).",

The main aim was to study the humoral and cellular immune response after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with IMIDs treated with immunosuppressants. The secondary aim was to describe the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infections after vaccination in these patients.This is an observational study including 86 patients with IMIDs. All patients were treated with biologic or targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs [b/tsDMARDs: TNF inhibitors (TNFi), rituximab, anti-interleukin 6 receptor (anti-IL6R) or JAK inhibitors (JAKi)]. Demographic and clinical information were collected. After 4-6 weeks of 2nd and 3rd vaccine doses, humoral response was assessed using the Thermo Scientific ELiA SARS-CoV-2-Sp1 IgG Test. Also, in patients with serum SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels under 100UI/ml, cellular response was analyzed using the QuantiFERON SARS-CoV-2 Starter Pack.A total of 86 patients under b/tsDMARDs and 38 healthy controls were included. Most patients received TNFi (45 with TNFi, 31 with rituximab, 5 with anti-IL6R and 5 with JAKi). SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Ab) were present in an 86% of patients with IMIDs and in 100% healthy controls (p = 0.017). However, 12 (14%) patients had undetectable SARS-CoV-2 Ab levels, all treated with rituximab. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 Ab (IU/ml) were statistically lower in patients (Mdn (IQR): 59.5 (17-163) in patients vs 625 (405-932) in controls, p < 0.001). Patients treated with rituximab had lower Ab levels than those treated with TNFi and controls (p < 0.001). The cellular response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was evaluated in 30 patients. Eleven patients had a positive cellular response, being more frequent in patients treated with rituximab (p = 0.03). SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported in 43% of patients and 34% of controls after vaccination. Only 6 (7%) patients required hospitalization, most of whom treated with rituximab (67%).SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels were lower in patients than in controls, especially in patients treated with rituximab. A cellular response can be detected despite having a poor humoral response. Severe infections in vaccinated patients with IMIDs are rare, and are observed mainly in patients treated with rituximab.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic airway inflammatory disease that affects millions of Canadians and often contributes to higher levels of anxiety among patients. Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was a time of increased anxiety and fear among the Canadian population, it was thought that those with asthma may experience heightened anxiety levels due to uncertain access to care, the potential to misinterpret asthma symptoms for symptoms of COVID-19 (or vice versa), and the concern about being treated differently by those around them when experiencing asthma symptoms. Therefore, this study sought to perform a cross-sectional analysis of the asthma-anxiety relationship in adults with and without asthma in the unique context of the COVID-19 pandemic from a Canadian perspective. This study employed the COVID-19 Associated Anxiety in Allergic Rhinitis and Asthma patients Experiencing Symptoms (CAAARES) survey, consisting of COVID-19-specific questions, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7 (GAD-7) and the Asthma Control Questionnaire-6 (ACQ-6). Data collection occurred through the Qualtrics XM platform and data analyses were conducted with the IBM SPSS Statistics 28 software. A total of 741 valid responses were collected (asthma group, n = 244; control group, n = 497). 31.6% and 26.2% of respondents in the asthma and control groups, respectively, met the diagnostic criteria for GAD. There was no significant difference (p = .067) in mean GAD-7 scores between the two groups. A Hierarchal Multiple Regression (HMR) model was developed, and neither asthma status nor ACQ-6 score had a significant predictive effect on the GAD-7 score. There was a statistically significant (p < .001) weak positive correlation (r = .22) between GAD-7 and ACQ-6 scores. In a simple mediation (SMM) model, perceived COVID-19 stress of others was not identified as a significant mediator of the relationship between ACQ-6 and GAD-7 (indirect effect β = 0.014). Our study of a Canadian cohort demonstrates elevated levels of anxiety overall, amongst both asthma and control groups. While AR status was significantly greater in the asthma group, it was not a significant predictive variable of GAD-7 score. Our data suggests that COVID-19-specific factors appear to have a greater contribution to anxiety than asthma status or control.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy protein 5 (ATG5) regulates airway epithelial cell autophagy, immune response, and inflammation, which is involved in asthma progression. This study aimed to evaluate ATG5 levels and its clinical roles in adult asthma patients.Totally, 200 adult asthma patients and 100 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this case-control study. Subsequently, serum ATG5 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.ATG5 was increased in asthma patients compared with HCs [median (interquartile range): 44.2 (31.7-77.8) vs. 23.2 (16.7-39.2) ng/mL] (P < 0.001). In asthma patients, ATG5 was positively related to male gender (P = 0.022), a family history of asthma (P = 0.035), eosinophil count (P < 0.001), and immune globulin E (P < 0.001), while it was negatively correlated with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (P < 0.001) and FEV1 (Predicted) (P < 0.001). Meanwhile, ATG5 was inversely associated with T helper (Th) 1 cells (P = 0.008), while it was positively linked with Th2 cells (P < 0.001), Th2/Th1 ratio (P < 0.001), interleukin (IL)-4 (P = 0.002), and IL-4/interferon-γ ratio (P = 0.015). Additionally, ATG5 was positively correlated with tumor necrosis factor-α (P < 0.001), IL-1β (P = 0.001), IL-6 (P = 0.003), and IL-17 (P = 0.029). Notably, ATG5 was elevated in asthma patients at exacerbation compared to those at remission [median (interquartile range): 53.6 (37.6-90.0) vs. 35.6 (28.2-51.5) ng/mL] (P < 0.001). It was also noteworthy that ATG5 was positively linked with exacerbation severity in asthma patients (P = 0.005).Serum ATG5 is related to increased Th2/Th1 ratio, inflammation, exacerbation risk and severity in adult asthma patients, which serves as a candidate marker for the management of asthma. However, further validation is still needed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Idiopathic Anaphylaxis (IA) is the most common anaphylactic syndrome in adults. Mental health problems associated with IA are not well recognised. We aimed to assess if patients diagnosed with IA were more likely to experience mental health problems compared to a normative Australian population. We additionally hypothesised that the number of anaphylactic episodes would correlate with symptoms of anxiety. Methods A total of 34 patients with at least one episode of IA were recruited from an adult immunology clinic. Patients were recruited as part of a separate study evaluating alternative aetiologies in IA. Mental health problems were measured using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). An extension of the survey included questions specifically focused on the psychological impact of IA. Results Compared to population norms, those with IA had significantly higher levels of mental health problems. Statistically significant DASS-21 scores were identified for depression 4.24 vs. 2.57 (p &lt; 0.001), anxiety 4.76 vs. 1.74 (p &lt; 0.012), stress 7.35 vs. 3.95 (p &lt; 0.001) and total score 16.35 vs. 8.00 (p &lt; 0.001). There was no association between two or more episodes of anaphylaxis and increased anxiety levels (β = 0.52, CI -2.59–3.62, p = 0.74). Conclusions This is the first paper to demonstrate that patients living with idiopathic anaphylaxis are more symptomatic for mental illness than those in the community. Screening for mental illness and referral for psychological support should be undertaken in people with IA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Most asthma diagnoses and patient care take place in primary care settings. Electronic medical records (EMRs) offer an opportunity to utilize technology to improve asthma diagnosis and care. The purpose of this study was to create and validate separate case definitions for suspected and confirmed asthma in primary care EMRs, to enable surveillance, benchmarking, and quality improvement in primary care settings. The objective of this study was to develop a case definition for suspected and confirmed asthma for use in a primary care sentinel surveillance system. Methods A single chart abstractor conducted a manual audit of 776 randomly selected patient charts from an academic primary care practice EMR in Kingston, Ontario. Following the single chart abstractor classification, a consensus on chart classification as “not asthma”, “suspected asthma”, or “confirmed asthma” was achieved between the abstractor, a family physician, and a respirologist using Canadian Thoracic Society (CTS) criteria. Case definition algorithms based on billing codes, clinical data elements and medications were applied to the site’s Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) data for the same charts and compared to abstractor classifications to determine each algorithm’s measurement properties. Results The prevalence of suspected and confirmed asthma were 7.3% (n = 54) and 2.4% (n = 18), respectively. None of the proposed case definitions could differentiate between suspected and confirmed asthma. One algorithm consisting of billing, clinical, and medication elements had the highest Youden’s Index for either suspected or confirmed asthma. The algorithm had a sensitivity of 81%, a specificity of 96%, positive predictive value of 71%, negative predictive value of 98%, and a Youden’s Index of 0.77 for combined suspected or confirmed asthma cases. Conclusion An EMR case definition for suspected or confirmed adult asthma has been validated for use in CPCSSN. Implementation of this case definition will enable the development of a surveillance electronic tool (eTool) for adult asthma that can foster quality improvement.",

However, the effects of HPE on the functionality of mast cells, a critical cell type in allergic diseases, have not been reported. Methods To investigate the effects of HPE on the regulation of allergy with respect to the biological functions of mast cells, the mast cell line C57 or HMC-1 cells were treated with HPE followed by the assessment of cell proliferation, apoptosis, activation, chemotaxis and phagocytosis. Mouse peritoneal mast cells were also investigated for their responses to induction of apoptosis by HPE in vivo. Furthermore, the effect of HPE on mast cell degranulation was confirmed using the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) assay, an acute allergy model. Results HPE was capable of suppressing mast cell proliferation and inducing mast cell apoptosis. Mast cell degranulation in response to compound 48/80- or anti-DNP IgE and DNP-mediated activation was suppressed. In addition, treatment with HPE compromised the production of cytokines by mast cells and cell chemotaxis. These observations were consistent with the dampened passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) assay following treatment with HPE. Conclusion This study revealed a suppressive effect of HPE on overall mast cell activities, suggesting a potential regulatory role of HPE on the alleviation of allergic diseases through mast cells.",

IL-9 has been demonstrated to be a potent stimulus for the production and secretion of mucus from airway epithelial cells via induction of a calcium-activated chloride channel, hCLCA1. The objective of this study was to investigate the expression of IL-9 and hCLCA1 following allergen challenge in the nasal mucosa of allergic rhinitis patients. Nasal biopsies were obtained from allergic rhinitis patients out of allergen season both before (baseline) and after local antigen challenge with either ragweed or diluent (control). Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization were used to assess IL-9 protein and hCLCA1 messenger ribonucleic acid. Eosinophils and T cells were detected using immunohistochemistry. IL-9 and hCLCA1 were very low at baseline, and expression was significantly up-regulated following ragweed challenge. Whereas the number of eosinophils increased after allergen challenge, T-cell counts did not change significantly. The results of this study demonstrate the relationship between specific allergen challenge and expression of both IL-9 and hCLCA1, suggesting a possible mechanism for the increased production of mucus from airway epithelial cells in allergic rhinitis.",

Previous study demonstrated that enhanced circulating ILC2s in cat-allergic patient after experimental allergen challenge, whereas the effects of natural allergen exposure on peripheral ILC2s are still unclear. We therefore examined the variations in circulating ILC2s among asthmatic patients sensitized to different allergens in- and outside- pollen season.10 patients sensitized to mugwort, 10 patients sensitized to house dust mites (HDM) and 12 healthy controls were recruited into this study. Blood samples were collected from the patients in- and outside- pollens season, 2-3 months apart. ILC2s (Lin-CD127+ CRTH2+) were enumerated by flow cytometry, as well as intracellular IL-5 and IL-13 expression. The levels of IL-5 and IL-13 in supernatants of Lineage- and Lineage+ cells stimulated with IL-25 and/or IL-33 in the presence of IL-2 were measured using a Milliplex human cytokine array kit.An obvious seasonal increases in percentages of total and IL-13+ ILC2s were observed in patients with mugwort sensitization during natural pollen exposure, however, the percentages of peripheral ILC2s in HDM-allergic patients were not affected significantly. A positive correlation between FeNO and IL-13+ILC2s was found in patients sensitized to mugwort. A mixture of IL-33 and IL-25 induced a significant production of IL-13 and IL-5 from Lineage- cells of both mugwort-allergic and HDM-allergic asthmatics. Stimulation with IL-33 alone induced a significantly greater quantity of IL-13 by Lineage-cells from mugwort-allergic asthmatic compared with that from HDM-allergic asthmatics, whereas IL-25 induced a significantly greater amount of IL-5 by the Lineage-cells from mugwort-allergic asthmatic compared with that from HDM-allergic asthmatics.Within pollen season the frequencies and function profiles of circulating ILC2s among asthmatic children are altered dynamically, which may be closely related to the sensitized type of allergens.",

Prompt treatment is vital during acute attacks; plasma-derived C1-INH (Berinert®) is one treatment currently licensed for the intravenous treatment of acute HAE attacks in adults, adolescents and children. A new, volume-reduced formulation, of C1-INH is currently available which aims to reduce the time to treatment, and provide greater convenience to patients and healthcare professionals. Here we compare the clinical experience of the reduced volume 1500 IU vial with multiple 500 IU vials.HAE patients treated with C1-INH at the Royal London Hospital were selected to take part in this assessment. Included patients were aged 10-65 with moderate to severe HAE requiring high doses of C1-INH. The practicalities of the reduced 1500 IU vial compared with multiple 500 IU vials were assessed, including preparation and administration time, training to self-administer time and several quality of life aspects.Twenty-three patients participated in this study. Twenty-one patients were previously treated with C1-INH (Berinert®) 500 IU for 1-14 years prior to switching to the 1500 IU vial format, two patients were naïve to C1-INH (Berinert®). Preparation and administration of C1-INH (Berinert®) 1500 IU was faster than an equivalent dose with multiple 500 IU vials (11 and 17 min, respectively) and also required less time to train to self-administer (45 and 55 min, respectively). Overall, patients rated the 1500 IU vial format higher in all assessed aspects than the 500 IU format, including preparation, administration, training, travel and storage. Nonetheless, reconstitution of the 1500 IU vial was noted more difficult, requiring gentle mixing to fully dissolve prior to intravenous injection. Patients remained stable on C1-INH (Berinert®) 1500 IU; two patients switched back to multiple 500 IU vials due to headaches and preference for a larger volume.The volume-reduced C1-INH concentrate (Berinert®) 1500 IU is a practical and convenient alternative to multiple 500 IU vials for the treatment of HAE, which provides patients with more control and independence over their disease owing to a simpler to administer treatment.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps has recently increased in Japan and other East Asian countries, and this disease is called eosinophilic chronic sinusitis (ECRS) in Japan. ECRS usually occurs in adults and is frequently accompanied by refractory bronchial asthma. However, its occurrence in children under 10 years of age is rare. Here, we present an unusual case of ECRS complicated by intractable asthma in an 8-year-old boy.Oral administration of prednisolone (10 mg/day) initially relieved the ECRS and bronchial asthma, but both returned during prednisolone dose reduction. Because nasal cavity-opening surgery was ineffective, oral administration prednisolone at 10 mg/day was continued. Pancytopenia was observed 16 months after the start of treatment, and the patient was admitted to our hospital. He was diagnosed with refractory cytopenia in childhood, but gradually improved after cyclosporine treatment. Although the dose of cyclosporine was therapeutic for asthma, it did not alleviate the asthma attacks, and the patient's quality of life markedly decreased. We administered omalizumab even though its use was contraindicated by negative results in an inhalable antigen test. After the third administration of omalizumab, the asthma was better controlled and respiratory function improved; however, the nasal symptoms of ECRS persisted. Attempts to relieve these symptoms by increasing the therapeutic dose of omalizumab were only partially successful. We replaced omalizumab with mepolizumab; doing so slightly improved the sinusitis symptoms, but quality of life remained unsatisfactory. We repeated the nasal cavity-opening surgery. After surgery, the asthma and sinusitis were unchanged.Omalizumab effectively treated the severe combined asthma in a young patient, but its effect on sinusitis was insufficient. More cases and long-term follow-up data are needed to better evaluate the effectiveness of mepolizumab for treatment of ECRS.",

This study aims to assess the clinical relevance of serum inhibitory activity for IgE by the method of enzyme-linked immunosorbent facilitated antigen binding (ELIFAB) during SCIT for Artemisia-sensitized AR patients.19 AR patients were studied who had undergone Artemisia-specific SCIT for more than 8 months (19.68 months on average, ranging from 9 to 33 months). Peripheral bloods were collected before and after treatment. The serum inhibitory activity for IgE was tested by ELIFAB and the level of Artemisia-specific IgG4 (Artemisia-sIgG4) was determined by ELISA. Clinical improvement was evaluated based on the symptom scores and rescue medication use (SMS). The 2-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the Spearman rank test (two-tailed) were used to analyze data by using SPSS 20.0, with P values of less than 0.05 considered as significant.The SMS decreased significantly after SCIT (before: 12.79 ± 4.250, after: 6.11 ± 3.828, P = 0.000 < 0.01), the treatment was remarkably effective for 6 patients, effective for 10 and ineffective for 3, along with a total effective rate 84.21%. The serum inhibitory activity for IgE increased significantly after SCIT (P < 0.05) and was correlated with the levels of Artemisia-sIgG4 (r = - 0.501, P = 0.002 < 0.01). The levels of Artemisia-sIgG4 elevated dramatically after treatment (P < 0.01) and were related with the duration of treatment (r = 0.558, P = 0.000 < 0.01). But there was no relationship between clinical improvements and the serum inhibitory activity for IgE.The serum inhibitory activity for IgE increased significantly after SCIT, however, there was no correlation between it and clinical improvements by statistics analysis. So whether the serum inhibitory activity for IgE can act as biomarker of efficacy for SCIT or not needs to be studied further.",

Evaluating the beliefs about asthma medication, cognitive and emotional perceptions may help to identify patients with poor adherence to treatment in clinical practice which need additional attention in order to increase the likelihood of them taking their asthma medication according to the prescribed treatment protocol. The purpose of this study is to assess whether beliefs about asthma medication, cognitive and emotional factors are related to poor treatment adherence of asthma medication in a sample of asthma patients in Latvia.Study subjects were asthma patients attending outpatient pulmonologist consultations in Latvia during September 2013 to December 2015. Beliefs about asthma medicine, cognitive and emotional factors related to asthma were determined in a cross-sectional, self-administered survey. The validated Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ) and the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (brief IPQ) were used. Treatment adherence was assessed using 5-item version of the Medication Adherence Reporting Scale (MARS). The total sample size was 352 patients. Logistic regression models were used to predict poor adherence to asthma treatment. The validity of each logistic regression model was assessed by the Hosmer/Lemeshow test. The main outcome measure was self-reported adherence to treatment.The more the patients agreed with the statement \"My future health depends on my asthma medication\" the lower the possibility of poor adherence to asthma treatment (OR 0.42; 95% CI 0.24-0.74). The more concerned the patients were in regard to long-term effects of their medication (OR 2; 95% CI 1.22-3.27), the higher the probability of poor treatment adherence.Screening asthma patients using the BMQ may help to identify those to benefit from interventions targeting their concerns and medication beliefs in order to improve adherence to asthma medication.",

    "abstract": "Background Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SIT) injections for aeroallergens are often utilized in patients. SIT should be injected into the subcutaneous space in the mid-posterolateral upper arm. If the injections are given intramuscularly (IM), there may be an increased risk of anaphylaxis. In our allergy clinic, SIT is given with BD Safety Glide™ Allergy syringes with needle length 13mm. There is a risk of the SIT being injected IM if patients have a skin to muscle depth (STMD) less than 13mm. Methods Charts were reviewed in an allergy clinic for patients on SIT where an ultrasound of the left posterolateral arm was done to measure STMD. Baseline characteristics of the two groups of patients with STMD greater than, and less than or equal to 13mm were compared. The proportions of patients with STMD greater than 4mm, 6mm, 8mm, and 10mm were calculated. Multivariable logistic regression was performed with age, sex, BMI and race. Results Ultrasounds had been completed on 186 patients on SIT. There were 149 (80%) with STMD less than 13mm. Baseline characteristics including age, sex and BMI differed among the two groups (p < 0.05). Based on the logistic regression analysis, BMI was significantly associated with STMD. There were 168 (90%) patients with more than 4mm STMD. Conclusions With standard allergy syringes, most patients on SIT are at risk of receiving the injections IM. A needle length of 4mm would significantly decrease the risk of SIT being given IM.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Erdosteine is used as a mucolytic agent and has a low incidence of adverse drug reactions, most of which are gastrointestinal and mild. Moreover, drug antigens rarely induce multiple simultaneous immunologic reactions. Only one previous case report has demonstrated hypersensitivity reaction induced by erdosteine. Here, we report a case of fixed drug eruption and anaphylaxis, which were concurrently induced by erdosteine. The association between the symptoms and erdosteine was proven by a drug provocation test. Case presentation A 35-year-old woman presented with recurrent angioedema and pruritic rash on the hands, which developed within 2 h following the administration of drugs, including erdosteine, for acute upper respiratory infection. Her rash was characterized by well-defined erythematous plaques, which recurred at the same site following the administration of the medications. She also experienced angioedema of the lips. Fixed drug eruption was considered after excluding other possible causes for the presented skin lesions. A drug provocation test confirmed that fixed drug eruption on both hands had occurred after administration of erdosteine, suggesting that erdosteine was the cause of the allergic reaction. However, she also experienced angioedema, isolated wheal, and laryngeal edema; thus, IgE-mediated type I hypersensitivity could also be concurrently occurring with the fixed drug eruption. Conclusions We report about a patient who was diagnosed with two different hypersensitivity reactions concurrently induced by erdosteine. We also demonstrate that patients may exhibit multiple simultaneous symptoms that usually arise from overlapping of different hypersensitivity mechanisms. Physicians should be aware of the possibility that some patients who are allergic to certain drugs could exhibit several symptoms caused by different mechanisms of hypersensitivity reactions simultaneously.",

Methods Primary objective was to analyse the health-economic consequences of SLIT for grass pollen allergy in Sweden vs reference group waiting for subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT). A questionnaire was mailed to two groups of AR patients. Results The questionnaire was distributed to 548 patients, 307 with SLIT and 241 in reference group (waiting for SCIT). Response rate was 53.8%. Mean annual costs were higher for reference patients than SLIT group; € 3907 (SD 4268) vs € 2084 (SD 1623) p &lt; 0.001. Mean annual direct cost was higher for SLIT-patients, € 1191 (SD 465) than for reference, € 751 (SD 589) p &lt; 0.001.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Exercise-induced anaphylaxis (EIA) is a rare and potentially life-threatening disorder that can develop independently without food ingestion. Cold drinks can also trigger symptoms in some patients with cold-induced anaphylaxis. We present a case of a patient with EIA that was diagnosed on the basis of positive exercise loading test with hyperleukotrieneuria. Case presentation A 12-year-old girl presented with acute flushing, cyanosis, swollen eyelids, and dyspnea after an endurance run in winter or swimming in a cold-water pool. She also developed dyspnea after having a cold drink. She had no history of food allergies, atopy, or asthma. No association was noted between anaphylaxis and food intake in her history. On the first day, she ingested 200 mL of 5 °C cold water in 30 s, which did not trigger symptomatic responses, but her urinary leukotriene E4 (LTE4) level increased (pre-challenge test: 295 pg/mg-creatinine (cr), post-challenge test: 400 pg/mg-cr). On the second day, she underwent the exercise loading test according to the Bruce protocol by using an ergometer to increase the power of exercise every 2 min. She had been fasting for &gt; 15 h and did not have breakfast. Just after the exercise loading test, the plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline increased. At 15 min after the exercise loading test, her plasma adrenaline and histamine (pre-challenge test: 0.7 ng/mL, 15 min post-challenge test: 81 ng/mL) rose sharply with anaphylaxis symptoms accompanied by increasing urinary LTE4 (pre-challenge test: 579 pg/mg-cr, post-challenge test: 846 pg/mg-cr). After she was discharged, she was restricted from strenuous exercise especially in cold environments and prescribed an adrenaline autoinjector. Conclusion Cold stimulation can become a co-effector of EIA. Measurements of urinary LTE4 levels during challenge testing are useful for diagnosing EIA and capture the pre-anaphylaxis stage.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Peanut and soybean allergies are listed as contraindication in the package leaflet of isotretinoin, a widely used treatment of acne vulgaris. Cross-reactivity between PR10-proteins in peanut, tree nuts, and soybean is particularly common in patients with birch pollinosis and may lead to anaphylactic reactions in sensitized patients after intake of soybean oil containing isotretinoin capsules. Case presentation Here, we describe a young man with hazelnut and birch pollen allergy, who experienced exercise-induced anaphylaxis after isotretinoin intake on the third day of treatment. A complete allergy work-up was carried out, and sensitization to both peanut and soybean PR10-proteins was confirmed. However, oral provocation with isotretinoin remained negative in the absence of intense physical activity and longterm treatment was well tolerated. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first report of an exercise-induced anaphylaxis due to isotretinoin therapy. Our literature review to assess tolerability of isotretinoin in patients allergic to peanut, tree nuts or soybean revealed only one other case of anaphylaxis in a cashew-nut allergic patient sensitized to soybean PR10-protein Gly m 4. While there are no reports on soybean allergic patients treated with isotretinoin, the vast majority of peanut or tree nut allergic patients tolerated isotretinoin. Therefore, we conclude that sensitization to soybean, peanut or tree nuts should not preclude isotretinoin therapy. Particular caution is however warranted in patients with soybean sensitization. Pre-treatment oral challenges with isotretinoin may be recommended and physicians should be aware of the potential role of cofactors.",

    "abstract": "The determination of systemic inflammatory markers is one of the important directions to study the pathogenesis of asthma and improve the diagnosis of asthma. Current studies have found that the 14-3-3 protein family subtypes interact with target proteins to participate in the pathogenesis of a variety of immune inflammatory diseases. However, studies on serum tyrosine3-monooxygenase/tryptophan5-monooxygenase activation protein β (14-3-3β) in asthma are scarce. This study aimed to assess the clinical significance of 14-3-3β in asthmatic patients. We recruited 54 asthmatic patients with acute exacerbation and 50 asthmatic patients with chronic persistent. The normal control group included 54 healthy individuals. Clinical characteristics, clinical indicators [fractional expiratory nitric oxide (FeNO), eosinophil count, forced vital capacity (FVC), percent of predicted FVC (FVC% predicted), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), percent of predicted FEV1 (FEV1% predicted), the ratio of forced expiratory volume in one second to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) and serum 14-3-3β levels were measured to compare among each group. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the correlation between 14-3-3β and clinical indicators. Finally, Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis was used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of 14-3-3β. Our results showed that median (interquartile range) of serum 14-3-3β concentration (ng/mL) in acute exacerbation group of asthma (41.18 [33.06-51.76]) was much higher than that in normal control group (24.99 [17.43-29.91]; P < 0.001) and chronic persistent group of asthma (25.88 [21.03-34.55]; P < 0.001). Spearman's correlation coefficient shows that the serum 14-3-3β level was positively correlated with FeNO (r = - 0.292, P = 0.032) and peripheral blood eosinophil count (r = 0.328, P = 0.016), and was negatively related to FEV1/FVC (r = - 0.293, P = 0.031) in the acute exacerbation group of asthma. At the same time, the serum 14-3-3β level was also negatively associated with FEV1 (r = - 0.297, P = 0.036) in the chronic persistent group of asthma. ROC curve analysis comparing acute exacerbation group of asthma with normal control group demonstrated a significant (P < 0.001) AUC of 0.90 (95% CI 0.85-0.96). The serum 14-3-3β protein may become a potential biomarker in asthmatic patients with acute exacerbation.",

    "abstract": "Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP) both display peripheral eosinophilia as well as pulmonary infiltration, together described as pulmonary eosinophilia, and differentiation is sometimes problematic. This study therefore examined the distinctions between ABPA with and without CEP-like shadows.This retrospective cohort study from a single center included 25 outpatients (median age, 65 years) with ABPA diagnosed between April 2015 and March 2019, using criteria proposed by the International Society of Human and Animal Mycology (ISHAM), which focuses on positive specific IgE for Aspergillus fumigatus. Patients were assigned to either the eosinophilic pneumonia (EP) group or Non-EP group, defined according to findings on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). The EP group included patients with HRCT findings compatible with CEP; i.e., the presence of peripheral consolidation (p-consolidation) or ground-glass opacities (GGO), with no evidence of high-attenuation mucus. The Non-EP group comprised the remaining patients, who showed classical findings of ABPA such as mucoid impaction. Differences between the groups were analyzed.Baseline characteristics, frequency of a history of CEP (EP, 50% vs. Non-EP, 26%) and tentative diagnosis of CEP before diagnosis of ABPA (67% vs. 16%) did not differ significantly between groups. Although elevated absolute eosinophil count and Aspergillus-specific immunoglobulin E titers did not differ significantly between groups, the Non-EP group showed a strong positive correlation between these values (R = 0.7878, p = 0.0003). The Non-EP group displayed significantly higher levels of the fungal marker beta-D glucan (median, 11.7 pg/ml; interquartile range, 6.7-18.4 pg/ml) than the EP group (median, 6.6 pg/ml; interquartile range, 5.2-9.3 pg/ml). Both groups exhibited frequent recurrence of shadows on X-rays but no cases in the EP group had progressed to the Non-EP group at the time of relapse.The ABPA subgroup with imaging findings resembling CEP experienced frequent recurrences, as in typical ABPA. In pulmonary eosinophilia, even if there are no shadows indicating apparent mucous change, the Aspergillus-specific immunoglobulin E level is important in obtaining an accurate diagnosis and in the selection of appropriate therapies for this type of ABPA.",

A total of 12,471 HCHS/SOL participants with baseline data on self-reported physician-diagnosed asthma, and antibodies anti-H. pylori and anti-HAV were included in this cross-sectional analysis. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the overall associations of seropositivity to each agent with asthma. Analyses were also stratified by Hispanic/Latino background. Effect modification by smoking status and nativity were tested. An analysis restricted to individuals with spirometry-defined chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was also considered. The weighted overall prevalence of asthma was 16.6%. The weighted seroprevalence of H. pylori was 56.6% and of HAV was 76.6%, and they significantly differed by Hispanic/Latino background.

The aim of this study was to investigate potential factors, especially comorbidities, that may affect the induction of angioedema without urticaria in patients over 60 years of age. This was an observational, retrospective study of 242 patients with a diagnosis of AWU and 263 controls. The inclusion criteria were as follows: at least one episode of confirmed AWU based on the ICD-10 code (T78.3) that required treatment in the last 15 years (2004-2019); age above 60 years; detailed medical history of comorbidities; and details regarding the use of drugs at that time. Serum functional and quantitative C1 inhibitor assays were performed, and serum C4 was measured. Comorbidities were grouped into the following panels: autoimmune, cancer, cardiac, metabolic, respiratory and allergic, liver failure and renal failure. Individual diseases were checked according to ICD code and treatment. In 1 (0.4%) patient, hereditary angioedema was confirmed. Decreased levels of C1INH were observed in 4 (1.65%) patients, dysfunction of C1INH was observed in 5 (1.76%) patients, and low levels of C4 were observed in 9 (3.71%) patients in the study group.

Descriptive data were collected from the OTN administrative database and from electronic medical records at a single academic centre during 2014 to 2019. The potential distance travelled and time saved by telemedicine visits were calculated using postal codes.A total of 1298 telemedicine visits was conducted over OTN, with an average of 216 visits per year. Only 11% of the allergists/immunologists used telemedicine to provide care before the COVID-19 pandemic. In the single centre that provided the majority of the telemedicine care, 66% patients were female and the overall mean age was 46. The most common diagnosis was immunodeficiency (40%), followed by asthma (13%) and urticaria (11%). Most patients required at least one follow-up via telemedicine. The average potential two-way distance travelled per visit was 718 km and the average potential time travelled in total was 6.6 h.Telemedicine was not widely used by allergists/immunologists in Ontario, Canada before the COVID-19 pandemic. It could offer a unique opportunity to connect patients who live in remote communities and allergists/immunologists who practice in urban centres in Canada. Independent of the current pandemic, our study further highlights the need for more physicians to adopt and continue telemedicine use as well as for healthcare agencies to support its use as a strategic priority once the pandemic is over.",

    "abstract": "The Icatibant Outcome Survey (IOS) is an international registry monitoring the use of icatibant, a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist indicated for the acute treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks. Our goal was to assess disease characteristics and icatibant treatment outcomes in patients with HAE due to C1 inhibitor deficiency (HAE type 1 or 2 (HAE-1/2)) from Spain relative to other countries participating in IOS.Descriptive retrospective analyses of data are reported from 10 centers in Spain vs 51 centers in 12 other participating countries (July 2009 to January 2019).No meaningful differences were identified between patients in Spain (n = 119) and patients across other countries (n = 907) regarding median age at symptom onset (15.0 vs 12.0 years) or diagnosis (22.3 vs 20.5 years). Overall HAE attack rates (total attacks/total years of follow-up) were 2.66 in Spain and 1.46 across other countries. Patients in Spain reported fewer severe/very severe HAE attacks before treatment (41.0% vs 45.9%; P < 0.0001) and, for icatibant-treated attacks, longer median time to treatment (2.9 vs 1.0 h), time to attack resolution (18.0 vs 5.5 h), and total attack duration (24.6 vs 8.0 h). Use of androgens for long-term prophylaxis was higher in Spain (51.2% vs 26.7%).Patients with HAE-1/2 in Spain reported fewer severe/very severe attacks, administered icatibant later, and had longer-lasting attacks than did patients across other countries in IOS. These differences may indicate varying disease management practices (e.g., delayed icatibant treatment) and reporting. Efforts to raise awareness on the benefits of early on-demand treatment may be warranted.NCT01034969.",

Despite the almost ubiquitous use of CD34 as a HSC marker, little is known about its cellular function. Our lab was the first to show that CD34 is also highly expressed on mature murine mast cells, and we and other groups have found it to be expressed on eosinophils and dendritic cells. We found that mast cells derived from Cd34 -/- mice exhibit a marked increase in cell-cell aggregation. Moreover, when Cd34 -/- mice were challenged in a mouse model of asthma, immune cell accumulation in the lung was drastically reduced, while the number of immune cells in the lung at baseline was similar to that of their wild-type counterparts. We have since found that deletion of the Cd34 gene in mice renders these animals resistant to a wide range of other mucosal inflammatory diseases, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), ulcerative colitis, salmonella infection and intestinal tumor development. Our objectives are to examine the specific role of CD34 in cellular function and to see whether or not CD34 is a viable therapeutic target to treat mucosal inflammatory diseases.",

Parental-reported data included wheeze (ever, current [past year], or during various activities) as per International Study of Allergies and Asthma in Children (ISSAC) questionnaire, and demographic data. Bangalore Cohort: Gestational period at birth and birth weight were measured. SGA babies were classified as per World Health Organization’s SGA guidelines. At 2-7 years, presence of wheeze was ascertained via physician assessment/prescription record and ISAAC questionnaire. Asthma status was not assessed. All data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and x tests. Results In Manitoba, 725 children (56.0% boys) were assessed. Mean gestational period was 39.5 ± 2.12 weeks (non-significant [NS] differences by gender). Mean birth weight was 3.38 ± 0.64 kg; girls were significantly smaller than boys (p < 0.006). 114 (16.1%) children (54.4% boys) were SGA.

    "abstract": "AllerGen NCE Inc., the Allergy, Genes and Environment Network, is a national, multi-disciplinary, multi-sectoral network for research and discovery, knowledge translation and capacity building. AllerGen is dedicated to improving the quality of life for allergy asthma and related immune disease sufferers by supporting research that leads to new diagnostic tests, better medications, more effective public policies and an increase in the number of medical professionals researching and practicing in this area. The Networks of Centres of Excellence (NCE) program, of which AllerGen is a part, is a strategic initiative aligned with Canada’s Science and Technology strategy. The NCE program aims to close the ‘development-to-delivery’ gap, and accelerate the rate at which research results contribute to new, evidence-based, cost-effective policies, products and services that generate social and economic benefits for Canadians.\r\n\r\nThe burden of allergy, asthma and related immune disease is significant and growing world-wide, and while the underlying causes of these diseases are actively being studied, the origins of these diseases are still not well understood. According to the results of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) Study, Phase III (2003) results, 47% of Canadian children have suffered from allergic rhinitis; 39% have experienced wheezing; 22.4% have been diagnosed with asthma; and, 19% have experienced atopic eczema [1]. According to Health Canada, non-food allergies are now the most common chronic condition in Canadians 12 years of age and older [2].\r\n\r\nThe economic impact of these diseases in Canada is in excess of $15 billion annually, when one includes the cost of ambulatory care, in-patient stays, emergency department visits, physician and facility payments, prescribed medications and productivity losses at school, work and at home as a direct result of these diseases [3]. This annual cost is comparable to the economic impact of arthritis and other chronic conditions. Ontario data show that 14% of all asthma-related emergency department visits occur in children between birth and 4 years of age, and that 21% of asthma prevalent cases were children and adolescents up to 19 years of age [4]. However, hospital admissions for asthma have decreased for both children and adults since 1996, and asthma as a cause of death is relatively uncommon and decreasing among all age groups in the developed world.\r\n\r\nGlobally, asthma is more prevalent among the developed countries and in major city centres [5]. Among the countries with somewhat lower prevalence rates, such as India and China, which represent 37% of the global population, recent research suggests that as these countries industrialize, allergy, asthma and related immune disease prevalence rates are rising rapidly, mirroring the experience of more developed countries.\r\n\r\nGiven the Canadian Institutes of Health Research’s strategic vision to position Canada as a world leader in the creation and use of knowledge derived from health research that benefits Canadians and the global community, Canadian researchers and their international partners have a significant opportunity to work in collaborative networks to accelerate the translation of research into practice, and knowledge to action, to improve allergic disease and asthma awareness, education, management and control.\r\n\r\nA recent analysis by Teresa To, from The Hospital for Sick Children [6], reveals that for Ontarians, the lifetime risk of developing chronic asthma is 1 in 3 - the same as the risk of developing cancer and diabetes. However, unlike cancer and diabetes, the substantial lifetime risk of asthma begins at an early stage in life and persists throughout the life span, triggering heightened disease burden, potential productivity loss and other economic costs.\r\n\r\nBuilding upon the work done in 2004 by a team led by Rejean Landry, AllerGen developed a publicly available KT planning tool called Knowledge Translation Planning Tools for Allergic Disease Researchers. This tool provides a guide for researchers, their stakeholders and partners to collaboratively develop translational strategies and tactics that will help accelerate the rate of dissemination, uptake and application of allergy, asthma and related immune disease research to improve the quality of life for patients, facilitate optimal care by health providers and reduce the economic drag resulting from the burden of these diseases [7]. Working with national and international partners, such as the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, AllerGen is committed to facilitating efforts to improve allergic disease and asthma management and control, discover the root causes of these diseases and accelerate the application of research findings and KT activities for social and economic benefits nationally and globally.",

A 30-year-old woman presented to the emergency room with severe angioedema followed by urticaria, hypotension and tachycardia. She recovered after treatment with antihistamines, corticosteroids, nebulized adrenaline and intravenous fluids. Food induced anaphylaxis was excluded by allergological investigations. After repeated thorough history, the patient mentioned having bitten into a castor bean just before the reaction. Cutaneous test (prick-to-prick) and specific IgE for castor bean were highly positive. We report the second case of a severe anaphylactic reaction to castor beans, confirmed by IgE testing, reported in the literature. It underlines the importance of a meticulous history in allergology and highlights the fact, that castor beans may cause potentially fatal anaphylaxis.",

Most patients are asymptomatic with gradually increasing alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and mildly elevated transaminase enzymes over the years. We report the first case of fatal liver mass rupture in a CVID patient with probable NRH.A 24-year-old man was diagnosed with CVID at the age of 1.25 years. Genetic testing revealed a transmembrane activator and calcium-modulator and cyclophilin-ligand interactor (TACI) mutation. He had been receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) replacement therapy ever since then. The trough level of serum IgG ranged between 750-1200 mg/dL. However, he still had occasional episodes of lower respiratory tract infection until bronchiectasis developed. At 22 years old, computed tomography (CT) chest and abdomen as an investigation for lung infection revealed incidental findings of numerous nodular arterial-enhancing lesions in the liver and mild splenomegaly suggestive of NRH with portal hypertension. Seven months later, he developed sudden hypotension and tense bloody ascites. Emergency CT angiography of the abdomen showed NRH with intrahepatic hemorrhage and hemoperitoneum. Despite successful gel foam embolization, the patient died from prolonged shock and multiple organ failure.Although CVID patients with NRH are generally asymptomatic, late complications including portal hypertension, hepatic failure, and hepatic rupture could occur. Therefore, an evaluation of liver function should be included in the regular follow-up of CVID patients.",

We also assessed the severity of the reactions. Oral food challenges occurred in the hospital day unit with the majority of patients having IV access in place. Despite a clear history of FPIES with lethargy and the requirement for re-hydration of the challenged population, 21/24 (88%) of the FPIES OFCs were successful.

However, the prevalence of these allergic diseases can vary in different regions within a country and in the world. Methods The objective of the study was to estimate the prevalence of asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema in schoolchildren in the Kandy and Anuradhapura districts of Sri Lanka. This was a multicentre cross sectional study carried out among children of age 6–7 years and 13–14 years attending state schools fulfilling the entry criteria of the Global Asthma Network Phase 1 study methodology. Results A total of 3673 children of 6–7 years and 4658 children of 13–14 years were recruited.

The reported prevalence rates of the disease conditions were 9.9% (CI 8.72–11.22), 10.1% (CI 8.90–11.44) and 5.9% (CI 4.98–6.98) among 6–7 years age group and 14.9% (CI 13.67–16.22), 22.5% (CI 21.04–24.03) and 1.8% (CI 1.38–2.34) in the 13–14 years age group in Anuradhapura district. When comparing these prevalence rates, there is relatively a higher prevalence of childhood allergic diseases in Kandy district. This difference is statistically significant in all three allergic disease conditions (P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion Prevalence of allergic diseases in Anuradhapura is closer to reported data in the previous studies. There is relatively higher prevalence of childhood allergic diseases among children in Kandy district.",

The aim of this study was to determine the association between FC levels and Eosinophilic colitis (EC) before and after treatment in pediatrics.In this cross-sectional study, 330 patients with rectorrhagia and FC levels > 200 μg/g were included in the study. Patients were then subjected to colonoscopy, and if 30 or more eosinophils were observed in the pathology of at least two parts of the colon, EC was diagnosed. Of the 330 patients included in the study, 14 patients were diagnosed as EC. Treatment included seven food elimination diet (food allergens) for 3 months. After 3 months, FC levels were repeated and colonoscopy was performed.The mean age of the children was 5.9 years. After the elimination diet, the number of eosinophils in all segments of colon significantly decreased (P < 0.001) and according to the pathology report, the number of eosinophils improved in 42.9% of patients. Also, the mean number of segments involved in the colon of patients was significantly decreased (P < 0.001). Mean FC levels were significantly decreased after 3 months (P < 0.001). The cut-off point of 114 μg/g of FC had sensitivity (75%), specificity (67%), positive predictive value (75%), negative predictive value (67%), accuracy (71.4%), and area under the ROC curve (0.708) acceptable in predicting EC.This study showed that FC levels can be elevated in patients with EC, which is easily corrected with a targeted elimination of food allergens.",

Our objective was to describe two cases of DIOSD with alterations in eotaxin-2 and interleukin (IL)-8 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression on the ocular surface. Case presentation In the ocular surface test, specimens were collected from the patient's ocular surface, and eotaxin-2 and IL-8 mRNA levels in the specimens were measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The clinical score of ocular surface findings was quantified using a 5-5-5 exacerbation grading scale for allergic conjunctivitis. The first case was of a 27-year-old man who developed DIOSD 3 months after starting treatment with dupilumab injection for atopic dermatitis. After 5 weeks of topical instillation of tacrolimus ophthalmic suspension, the clinical score of ocular surface findings improved and IL-8 and eotaxin-2 mRNA expression levels gradually decreased. The second patient was a 55-year-old man who developed DIOSD 11 weeks after the start of treatment with dupilumab injection for atopic dermatitis. Four weeks after starting ophthalmological treatment with tacrolimus ophthalmic suspension, his clinical scores on ocular surface findings improved and IL-8 mRNA expression levels decreased. The ocular surface test in this case revealed increased expression levels of IL-8 mRNA on the ocular surface at the onset of DIOSD, which decreased with the improvement of objective findings. Conclusions DIOSD, which has been successfully treated with tacrolimus ophthalmic suspension, may involve IL-8-related inflammation in addition to type 2 inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The effects of a delayed diagnosis of asthma on lung function in children have not been well investigated. Therefore, a retrospective cohort study was conducted in a children’s hospital to analyse the effect of delayed diagnosis time on lung function in children with asthma. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study in Jinan Children's Hospital from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2020. All children were divided into different groups according to the presence or absence of rhinitis, age at first onset (first coughing and wheezing attack) and delayed diagnosis duration (≤ 3 months, 3–12 months, 1–3 years, 3–5 years and &gt; 5 years). Results A total of 1,014 children with asthma were included in this study. The median (quartile) delay in asthma diagnosis among all participants was 11 (2, 26) months. The shortest delay in diagnosis time was on the same day of onset, and the longest delay in diagnosis time was 10 years. The median (quartile) duration of delayed diagnosis was 10 (2, 26) months in 307 asthmatic children without rhinitis and 11 (2, 26) months in 707 children with asthma and rhinitis ( P &lt; 0.05). The delayed diagnosis time was shorter among female children than among male children ( P &lt; 0.05), and the first %predicted forced volume capacity (FVC%pred) results for females were higher than those for males ( P = 0.036). The children whose age at first asthma onset was ≤ 3 years had a longer delayed diagnosis duration than those whose age at first onset was &gt; 3 years ( P &lt; 0.05). The FVC%pred and %predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1%pred) in the first and second pulmonary function tests were significantly lower in the five delayed diagnosis groups (all P &lt; 0.05). After standardised treatment for 3–6 months, FVC%pred showed a significant difference in the third test among the 5 groups ( P &lt; 0.05), but the other pulmonary function indices showed no significant difference. Logistic regression analysis showed that longer delay and young age of onset were associated with lower lung function ( P &lt; 0.05), whereas sex, rhinitis and eczema had no significant effects (all P &gt; 0.05) on FVC%pred and FEV1%pred. Conclusion Although delayed asthma diagnosis can lead to lung function impairment in children with asthma, lung function can be improved quickly after standardised treatment. Therefore, early asthma diagnosis and standardised treatment are very important.",

However, little is known about the mechanism by which BT improves exertional dyspnea without significantly changing the resting pulmonary function in asthmatics. To understand the mechanism, cardiopulmonary variables were investigated using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) in a patient with severe asthma before and after BT. A 57-year-old Japanese man visited our hospital for consultation of the intractable asthma, which we managed with three treatment sessions of BT. Comparison of the findings pre-BT and at 1 year after BT demonstrated that (1) the resting tests for respiration showed no improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 s, but the forced oscillation technique showed decreases in both inhalation and exhalation respiratory resistance values, and (2) the CPET results showed (i) improvement in exertional dyspnea, exercise endurance, and arterial oxygen saturation at the end of exercise; (ii) that the expiratory tidal volume exceeded the inspiratory tidal volume during exercise, which implied that a sufficient exhalation enabled longer inspiratory time and adequate oxygen absorption; and (iii) that an increase in respiratory frequency could be prevented throughout exercise. This case report described a novel mechanism of BT in improving exertional dyspnea and exercise duration, which was brought about by ventilatory improvements related to the breathing pattern of inspiration to expiration.",

    "abstract": "X-linked lymphoproliferative disease type 1 (XLP1) is a rare primary immune deficiency, which is caused by SH2D1A gene mutations. XLP1 is commonly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, hypogammaglobulinemia, and/or lymphoma. The only curative treatment for XLP1 is allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. However, published data detailing the clinical course of, and indications for, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in asymptomatic patients with XLP1 is lacking. Although relevant family history could be useful in identifying patients with XLP1 before disease onset, no guidelines have been established on the management of asymptomatic patients with XLP1. Therefore, clinicians and families face dilemmas in balancing between the risk of waiting for the disease onset, and the risk of transplant-related mortality associated with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, which is often performed at a very young age. We first describe the detailed clinical course of an asymptomatic patient with XLP1 who successfully underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation.A boy was born at 39 weeks of gestation, weighing 3016 g at birth. He appeared fine, but he underwent genetic testing because his maternal cousin had XLP1. He was found to have a novel c.207_208insC (p.Pro70ProfsX4) mutation in exon 3 of SH2D1A, which was also found in his cousin. There was no HLA-identical donor in his family. Immunoglobulin was administered monthly to prevent EBV infection while searching for an alternative donor. He underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from an allele HLA 8/8 fully matched, unrelated donor with a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen consisting of fludarabine, melphalan, and low-dose total body irradiation (TBI) at 20 months of age. The patient has been doing well for 2 years post transplantation and maintaining complete donor chimerism without any evidence of chronic graft versus host disease.We describe a case of an asymptomatic patient with XLP1, who successfully underwent unrelated BMT with RIC regimen consisting of fludarabine, melphalan, and 3 Gy TBI. That was well tolerated and successfully generated complete chimerism in every subpopulation. This case delineates the option of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation even in asymptomatic patients with XLP1.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is often accompanied by peripheral eosinophilia and eosinophilic airway inflammation. This article explores the relationship between asthma and short-term pulmonary infiltrate with eosinophilia, which results from irregular asthma treatment. We report five unique cases of asthma-induced short-term eosinophilic pneumonia encountered at our pulmonary and critical care centre in Hunan, China, from January 1, 2014, to August 31, 2018. The 5 asthma patients were women with persistent dyspnoea symptoms, an increased peripheral eosinophil count and a high level of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO). Chest CT revealed multiple infiltrates and ground-glass opacities in both lung fields in all 5 patients. Four of the 5 patients had increased eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Three were positive for reversibility in lung function testing, and two had eosinophil infiltration as revealed by lung biopsy. No antibiotic treatment was given, and after a short period of glucocorticoid therapy and inhaled corticosteroid plus long-acting β2-agonist (ICS + LABA) treatment, the symptoms of all of the patients disappeared. In addition, their blood eosinophils returned to normal, and their lung lesions were quickly absorbed and improved. These cases show a unique association between short-term eosinophilic pneumonia and asthma. The occurrence of eosinophilic pneumonia can prove fatal during a serious asthma attack. Additionally, the presence of peripheral eosinophilia with lung infiltrates poses a diagnostic challenge for clinicians by creating suspicion of pulmonary infiltrate with eosinophilia when present in asthmatic patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background There are numerous biologics for treating patients with severe asthma. A cost-effective method for selecting the most appropriate biologic therapy for a patient is thus important. Bronchoscopy-guided bronchial epithelium sampling may provide information for determining the type of inflammation in the airways of severe asthma patients through immunochemical analysis and thus help clinicians select the correct biologics. Case presentation We report the case of a female with severe asthma and eosinophilia who initially responded to omalizumab treatment. She developed an allergic reaction after four injections of omalizumab. Omalizumab desensitization was successfully conducted. To select an appropriate biologic agent after this hypersensitivity episode, we performed bronchoscopy-guided bronchial epithelium sampling. Omalizumab treatment was resumed based on the findings of immunohistochemical staining after a successful desensitization procedure, leading to long-term control of her severe asthma. Conclusions Selecting an adequate biologic agent for severe, uncontrolled asthma is a challenge in clinical medical practice. Although phenotypes, blood eosinophils, and serum IgE levels have been proposed for use as a reference, there is a dissociation between the blood immune-cell level and the airway epithelium immune reaction, as confirmed in previous studies. Airway epithelium immunohistochemistry staining for targeted immune cells has been used to determine various types of airway inflammation; however, this technique is rarely used in a clinical setting. Previous studies have revealed the relative safety of performing bronchoscopy biopsies for patients with severe asthma. Among the sampling techniques used for tissue diagnosis, including nasal biopsies, nasal or bronchial brushing, and bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchoscopy-guided bronchial epithelium sampling provides more accurate information about the epithelial and inflammatory cells in the tissue context. It is thus a powerful tool for selecting the most suitable biologics in difficult clinical conditions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Allergen inhalation tests are a valuable research tool. The allergen dose producing an early asthmatic response (EAR) can be predicted from methacholine responsiveness and allergen skin test endpoint (STE). The Wright ® jet nebulizer, which is both inefficient and increasingly difficult to obtain, has been used historically. We assessed the Solo ® vibrating mesh nebulizer as an alternative for allergen and methacholine challenges. Methods Eighteen mild atopic asthmatics completed the study. Doubling concentration allergen prick skin tests were performed to determine the STE in allergen units/mL. The Wright ® protocol was used to measure the methacholine provocation dose causing a 20% forced expired volume in one second (FEV 1 ) fall (PD 20 ) (μg) and the allergen PD 20 (units). The Solo ® protocol (0.5 mL nebulized to completion, tidal breathing inhalation) was used to determine both methacholine PD 20 and allergen PD 20 . The nebulizer order was randomized and separated by ≥ 2 weeks. Results All data were log transformed. The allergen PD 20 , predicted from the methacholine PD 20 and the STE, was within 2 doubling doses of the PD 20 measured with the Wright ® and 2.64 doubling doses of that measured with Solo ® . The Wright ® allergen PD 20 correlated with the Wright ® methacholine PD 20 (r = 0.74) and the STE (r = 0.78) and more strongly with the product of the two (Wright ® methacholine PD 20 × STE, r = 0.91, p &lt; 0.00001). The Solo ® allergen PD 20 showed similar relationships with the Solo ® methacholine PD 20 (r = 0.61), the STE (r = 0.75) and the product of the two (Solo ® methacholine PD 20 × STE, r = 0.83, p &lt; 0.00002). The Wright ® and the Solo ® methacholine geometric mean PD 20 s were not significantly different (49.3 and 54.5 μg respectively, p = 0.62). The Wright ® allergen PD 20 was slightly but significantly lower than the Solo ® allergen PD 20 (geometric means 6.7 and 10.5 units respectively, p = 0.003). Conclusion The Solo ® allergen PD 20 showed the same relationship with methacholine responsiveness and STE as did the Wright ® . The Solo ® allergen PD 20 was slightly but significantly higher than the Wright ® allergen PD 20 . The Solo ® vibrating mesh nebulizer was well tolerated and is an acceptable alternative for allergen challenge. Trial registration clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03491358",

Results Efficacy data from 1486 patients were analysed: 585 received placebo, 682 rupatadine 10 mg, and 219 rupatadine 20 mg.

Symptom improvements and responder proportions were higher in the rupatadine 20 mg group vs the 10 mg group. The time to response was shorter in the rupatadine 20 mg group vs the 10 mg group for T4NSS (16 and 9 days for the 50% and 75% responses, respectively) and for T5SS (13 and 8 days for the 50% and 75% responses, respectively). Conclusions Rupatadine was efficacious in reducing allergic rhinitis symptoms, showing high responder proportions. The faster and stronger effect of rupatadine 20 mg may suggest its use in patients with severe PAR or not responding to the standard dose.",

    "abstract": "Indian jujube (Ziziphus Mauritiana Lam) is a sweet fruit from a tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and India. A few case reports have implicated Indian jujube to cause latex-fruit syndrome. We present the first case of an anaphylactic reaction to this fruit in a patient with no latex allergy.A 55-year-old male was referred to the Outpatient Allergy Clinic at Queen's University for evaluation of anaphylaxis caused by ingestion of Indian jujube. He presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with scalp pruritus, dyspnea and generalized urticaria, which occurred two hours after he had consumed a homemade candied fruit cocktail consisting of Indian jujube, water, Thai and Indian sweetener. In the ED, he was treated with epinephrine, intravenous diphenhydramine and steroids. He did not have any previous history of environmental or food allergies but had consumed this fruit frequently since childhood. In clinic, he underwent skin-prick testing with a saline slurry of candied jujube, which resulted in a positive wheal and flare response with appropriate controls. On subsequent visit, skin-prick tests were performed with saline slurries of the Thai and Indian sweetener used to make the cocktail. Both tests were negative when applied to a healthy volunteer. Skin-prick testing to latex allergen and latex specific IgE were both negative. He was diagnosed with an IgE-mediated anaphylactic reaction to the Indian jujube fruit. He was advised to avoid consumption of Indian jujubes and carry an epinephrine autoinjector.Anaphylaxis secondary to Indian jujube ingestion is an extremely rare phenomenon in patients without a latex allergy. A possible allergy to Indian jujube should be taken into consideration when working up anaphylaxis, especially in patient of Asian and Indian descent who have ceased regular consumption of the fruit.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Primary immunodeficiencies (PID) constitute a heterogeneous group of more than 350 monogenetic diseases. PID patients with antibody impairment require lifelong administration of immunoglobulin G replacement therapy, administered either intravenously (IVIG) or subcutaneously (SCIG). Although the effectiveness of weekly and biweekly (every other week) SCIG administration has been shown in several trials, data on the viability of these two regimens in pediatric PID patients are sparse. Methods Data on the pediatric subsets of PID patients enrolled in SHIFT (weekly) and IBIS (biweekly) studies were pooled and analyzed to indirectly compare two different 20%-concentrated SCIG (Hizentra ® ) regimens. The primary endpoints were to evaluate trough IgG levels and cumulative monthly doses; the secondary endpoint was to analyze incidence of infections. Results Fifteen and 13 children from the SHIFT and IBIS studies were included, respectively. Cumulative 20%-concentrated SCIG monthly dose was slight lower for the biweekly regimen (Δ = − 2.04, 90% CI − 8.3 to 4.23). However, the trough IgG levels were similar between the two groups (Δ = 0.28, 90% CI − 0.51 to 1.07) and constantly above the threshold of 5 g/L. After adjusting for potential confounders, the annualized rate of infections was similar between SHIFT and IBIS patients (incidence rate ratio = 1.09, 90% CI 0.72–1.67); only 1 serious bacterial infection was experienced by a patient in the IBIS group. Conclusion In pediatric PID patients, weekly and biweekly Hizentra ® administrations appeared equally effective treatment options.",

    "abstract": "Case A 41-year-old male presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea, weakness, and shock. He was diagnosed with cardiac tamponade, underwent pericardial drainage and initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient had a recent admission with bilateral pleural effusions, with negative infectious and malignancy workup. Macrocytic anemia, increased white blood cells, incidental abdominal abscess and splenic infarcts were found during this admission. Investigations again demonstrated elevated white blood cells (53.8% neutrophils, 12.1% lymphocytes, 29.7% monocytes) and anemia. Autoimmune workup was unremarkable except for presence of atypical ANCA and lupus inhibitor. Bone marrow biopsy was non-specific. He had low IgM and IgG levels suggesting a diagnosis of Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID). He received intravenous Solumedrol after his respiratory status deteriorated. He improved and was transitioned to prednisone, but a pathogen was never found. His positive response to steroids with worsening symptoms with prednisone taper initiation suggested that this was an autoimmune process. He was started on Hydroxychloroquine and intravenous immunoglobulin by Rheumatology. However he was subsequently diagnosed with Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) based on cytogenetic studies by Hematology. Current treatment includes hydroxyurea and prednisone. Discussion This patient demonstrates the challenge of diagnosing autoimmunity in a patient with low levels of immunoglobulins such as in CVID. How to interpret autoimmune antibody titres in autoimmune conditions is unknown. Most literature describes immunodeficiency being diagnosed after the autoimmune condition [1] and often after immunosuppressant use. Studies on systemic lupus erythematosus and CVID have shown low levels of autoantibodies after immunodeficiency diagnosis.",

The wheal and flare reaction was measured after the SPT and subjects reported the intensity of pruritus following EC/placebo using a validated pruritus questionnaire (indexes 1-3) and a visual analog scale (VAS).Significant improvement in pruritus was reported following treatment with EC compared with placebo for all four studied parameters. Index 1 in EC 3.7 ± 2.3 versus 5 ± 3.5 (p = 0.007) in placebo, index 2 in EC 2.6 ± 2.1 versus 3.8 ± 2.8 (p = 0.002) in placebo, index 3 of EC 6.3 ± 3.8 versus 8.8 ± 5.8 (p = 0.03) and VAS in EC 3.7 ± 1.9 versus 4.4 ± 2.3 (p = 0.003). There were no significant differences between EC and placebo in terms of the wheal and flare indurations area.Ethyl-chloride has an effective antipruritic agent, when given before histamine SPT. Its use did not change the wheal and flare reaction, making it ideal for prevention of pruritus, secondary to allergy skin test, without masking the results.",

    "abstract": "T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire development is an integral part of the adaptive immune response. T-cell activation requires recognition of appropriately processed antigens by the TCR. Development of a diverse repertoire of TCRs is therefore essential to ensure adequate protection from potential threats. The majority of T-cells in peripheral blood have TCRs composed of an alpha and a beta chain. At the DNA level, the TCR genes are formed through directed recombination from germline sequences—the so-called VDJ recombination [variable (V) joining (J) diversity (D) gene segments] which results in variations in the repertoire. The most variable part of TCRs is the Vβ region (VβTCR), which has multiple V segment families that can be quantitatively measured. However, only sparse data exists on the normal levels of the VβTCR repertoire in healthy children. We aimed to establish normal values for the VβTCR repertoire in atopic children without immunodeficiency. Fifty-three children were recruited from food allergy, drug allergy, chronic urticaria and anaphylaxis registries and were divided into groups based on age: >0–2 years, 3–6 years, and 6–18 years. We used commercially available and fluorescently labeled antibodies against 21 human class-specific V segments of the TCRβ chain (Vβ) to study in peripheral blood the quantitative pattern of Vβ variation by flow cytometry. Children of all ages exhibited a similar pattern of TCR Vβ expression. Vβ 2 was the most commonly expressed family in all three age groups [9.5 % (95 % CI, 8.9, 10 %), 8.8 % (95 % CI, 7.4, 10.2 %) and 7.6 % (7.0, 8.3 %) respectively]. However, the percentage of Vβ 2 decreased in older children and the percentage of Vβ 1 was higher in males. TCR Vβ expression in our sample of atopic children did not differ substantially from previously published levels in non-atopic cohorts. TCR Vβ diversity follows a predictable and comparable pattern in atopic and healthy non-atopic children. Establishing normal levels for healthy children with and without atopy will contribute to a better definition of Vβ receptor deviation in children with primary immunodeficiency and/or immunodysregulation conditions.",

    "abstract": "Background Medication errors are common and can lead to substantial morbidity. Similarly, inaccurate medication allergy lists can result in increased costs to the system, unnecessary allergy testing, prescription of inappropriate antibiotics, and allergic reactions. We hypothesized that most inpatients tested for penicillin allergy were not allergic and this information was not documented in the EMR or communicated to general practitioners. Methods We retrospectively reviewed charts of all inpatients seen at a teaching hospital by a consultant allergist in 2012. Data collected included basic demographics, penicillin allergy test results, current allergy status in the EMR, readmission rates, prescribed antibiotics, and discharge summary contents. Results 146 patients were tested for penicillin allergy and 144 (98.6%) were not allergic. Although orders were written in 145 (99.3%) charts to update the allergy status after testing, 32 (22.23%) patients with negative tests were still listed as allergic to penicillin in the EMR. Only 19 (15.2%) discharge summaries notified family physicians of the allergy testing results and discharge summaries were missing for 25 (20%) patients. Further assessment of half the charts revealed that in 41% of cases the negative allergy test resulted in a change of antibiotic to penicillin or its derivative. Of the 60 readmitted patients, 20 (33%) were still listed as allergic to penicillin in the EMR (only one patient tested positive) and 14 (70%) of the 20 patients required antibiotics. 12 of these 14 patients (86%) were prescribed antibiotics in the penicillin family despite their positive allergy status. Conclusions A significant proportion of health records were not amended following antibiotic allergy testing and the new allergy status was not communicated to most general practitioners in the discharge summary. A more efficient and reliable system needs to be implemented to ensure allergy status changes are communicated to all members of the healthcare team.",

    "abstract": "Evaluations of delivered care have consistently demonstrated gaps between existing medical knowledge and current practice. Studies examining the quality of care across disciplines and jurisdictions have estimated that 30% to 45% of patients are not offered evidence-based best care, and 20% to 30% receive contraindicated and potentially harmful care [1,2].\r\n\r\nRespiratory disease care gaps are equally alarming, with only 48% of recommended care delivered to patients with asthma exacerbations, and only 46% of routine recommended care delivered to patients with COPD [3]. Knowledge translation (KT) is a methodological approach developed specifically to address these care gaps. Because the most prevalent conditions are managed predominantly in primary care, there has been a great deal of interest in developing KT interventions targeting the primary care environment. A meta-analysis of randomized trials of guideline implementation interventions has demonstrated only modest effects on care across a wide range of disciplines, care settings, recommendation types and intervention types [4].\r\n\r\nHowever, few of these studies employed behavioral theories to inform intervention design, and this lack of an appropriate theoretical underpinning may be partly responsible for their limited success [5]. A multi-step approach to KT intervention design might improve success. Knowledge implementers should start by investigating the theory-based factors that underlie existing clinical practice, in order to identify the theoretical constructs that should be targeted by an intervention. Once these factors are known, one can design interventions to enhance the processes supporting change in these specific constructs [6].\r\n\r\nWhen targeting individual behaviour change, relevant theoretical categories include motivational theories (which explain how individuals wish, intend and ultimately decide to change behaviour), action theories (which explain how individuals move from intention to actual behaviour change), and stage theories (which describe an orderly progression through discrete stages toward behaviour change) [6]. Concepts of behavioural intention and self-efficacy are among the best predictors of subsequent health behaviour and are found in virtually all social cognitive models of health behaviour. Baseline factors influencing current behaviour can be identified directly through previous literature, or through direct measurement via interviews, questionnaires or group methods. An alternative approach is to analyze practice variation with respect to its determinants. With this technique, determinants identified predominantly in practices which adhere to or do not adhere to behaviour can be characterized as facilitators or barriers, respectively. Finally, researchers can analyze previously effective KT interventions to retrospectively ascertain which factors were likely influencing behaviour [7].\r\n\r\nAfter having thus identified the relevant components of a behavior that should be targeted, an appropriate intervention can be developed based on approaches previously shown to be effective in other settings. General categories of interventions include educational interventions, which can be passive or interactive; audit-and-feedback; provision of “just-in-time” information, including reminders and clinical decision support systems; organizational changes such as role revisions or financial incentives; and patient-directed interventions such as pre-consultation questionnaires. Electronic tools are emerging as a modality to facilitate a wide range of these interventions and require further study.",

Those who completed both surveys comprised the primary analysis group. Results 550 subjects completed the ragweed season survey, 516 subjects completed the EEU survey, and 270 completed both. Symptoms generated by EEU exposure were similar to those elicited during ragweed season, with the exception of cough (68% vs. 27%, respectively, p <0.01). Subjects reported that symptoms were more severe in the EEU than those experienced on a typical ragweed season day, but less severe than those during peak ragweed season days. Conclusion Allergic upper respiratory tract symptoms produced during controlled ragweed pollen exposure in the EEU were similar in nature and degree to those experienced during ragweed season, supporting evidence that the EEU is a valid model for studying SAR. *This study was self-funded.",

    "abstract": "Asthma prevalence has increased dramatically in western countries in the last 25 years, and it has been estimated that allergies and asthma affect 30 to 35% of the Canadian population.It has been generally estimated that there are approximately 714,000 Canadians diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but it is also estimated that 50% of affected individuals remain undiagnosed, suggesting that there are over 1.4 million Canadians suffering from COPD.The literature has shown that asthma, associated allergies and COPD present tremendous social and health impacts for both individuals and communities; however, a recently piloted community-based asthma education program underscores how difficult it is to increase patient awareness and knowledge about asthma, associated allergies and COPD, improve early detection of these diseases, and therefore improve quality of life and overall chronic disease management.Quantitative surveys, along with asthma, allergy and COPD assessments (peak flow testing) were undertaken to ascertain participants' levels of asthma/COPD, knowledge of these diseases, and disease management strategies.Additional findings from a follow-up survey helped to confirm these findings.Overall, preliminary findings reveal that the pilot's success was limited.Barriers and facilitators to community-based asthma, allergy and COPD education and awareness, peak flow screening, and strategies to encourage proper chronic disease prevention and management, are discussed in this presentation.",

    "abstract": "Mast cell activation in response to food allergens can result in symptoms such as anaphylaxis. It is unclear how this activation impacts on the immune response to other foods that are present. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated mast cell activation in the regulation of oral tolerance to a food antigen using a mouse model.\r\n\r\nOral tolerance to common food allergens – egg protein (OVA) or peanut - was established in C57Bl/6 mice. Mice were then immunized and challenged with the relevant food antigen. One group had mast cells activated via IgE/antigen at the site of immunization to food antigen. Antibody responses to food antigen were compared between groups. This was repeated with OVA in mast cell-deficient (kitw-sh/w-sh) mice.\r\n\r\nOral tolerance was successfully induced by OVA-feeding as assessed by specific IgE, IgA, IgG1, and IgG2a antibody responses. Tolerance was not maintained in the IgG1 and IgG2a subclasses when mast cells were activated at the site of immunization in OVA-fed animals. OVA-feeding also induced tolerance in mast cell-deficient animals, but IgE/antigen treatment did not modulate OVA-specific antibody production. Feeding peanut butter reduced the anti-peanut IgE response to peanut immunization, but this tolerance was not maintained if mast cells were activated at the site of immunization in peanut-fed animals.\r\n\r\nThese findings suggest that mast cell activation may reduce the effective tolerance to food antigens. This research highlights a possible role for mast cell activation in the development of multiple food allergies that could aid in the design of novel preventative strategies.\r\n\r\nThis work was supported by AllerGen NCE Inc. and by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council.",

    "abstract": "Passive dissemination of guidelines to health care professionals is insufficient to change practice. Three weeks after the mailing of national Asthma Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines to New Zealand general practitioners, only 46% of survey responders were able to locate the received guidelines, 12% had read them in detail, and only 20% indicated that it would change their practice [1]. In the face of information overload and guideline burnout among physicians [2], there is evidence that active dissemination with a simple actionable message may be more effective [3]. The Knowledge-to-Action cycle (see Figure ​Figure11 below) promoted by Graham and colleagues and strongly endorsed by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, provides a framework for effective active dissemination [4]. It can be conceptualised in four main steps - namely planning, assessing, tailoring and learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1\r\n\r\n(from Ref. [4])\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe planning phase involves 1) selecting one or a few key messages as priorities for implementation from the list of guideline recommendations (e.g., long-term daily controller medication for children with asthma); 2) identifying the target population of health care professionals (e.g., general practitioners) and settings (e.g.,, community practice); 3) adapting the message to the target audience (e.g., prescribing by physicians; verifying adherence by pharmacists; and patient understanding of the role, safety and side effects of asthma medications by educators); and 4) selecting the action(s) to be taken and the outcomes to be measured to document adherence to the target implementation priority and its health impact.\r\n\r\nThe assessment phase includes: 1) assessing the baseline status of implementation of the selected priority(ies) preferably using objective, rather than reported, uptake by the target audience (for example, reviews of medical charts or prescriptions are superior to reported actions, which are influenced by the social desirability bias); the objective assessment of implementation may be done pre- and post-intervention or in an iterative fashion, sometimes by interrupted time series analysis, to document not only the impact of an intervention but also the sustainability of the implementation intervention. 2) Secondly, the intention to implement the specific action is an important guide to predict action. Indeed, in a large systematic review, by simply asking the target audience Sheehan discovered that 97% of those who did not intend to implement a specific action never did, while only 53% of those who intended to take the action actually did [5]. This is important as the barriers are different for intenders and non-intenders. According to the Cabana taxonomy [6,7], non-intenders face seven internal barriers related to beliefs, knowledge and attitudes and three external barriers affecting health care professionals’ ability to conform, namely barriers related to patient, guideline and environmental factors. For intenders, the intention-behaviour gap results from two main problems that can be addressed, failing to get started and getting derailed. It is critical to assess the barriers and facilitators faced by the target audience as well as the potential solutions proposed ideally by the target audience, in order to tailor the KT intervention. The omission of the assessment step is believed to explain the low success rate of a variety of KT interventions, which hovers around 10% [8].\r\n\r\nTailoring the KT intervention, by selecting both the KT strategy and change theory9 that best fit the target audience, is thus critical. The Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care Review Group is an outstanding source of reference to select KT interventions, displaying summary estimates for various interventions tested by randomized controlled trials [8-11]. Unfortunately, it is far easier to change intention than it is to change behaviour [12]. The use of action theories to bridge the intention-behaviour gap has been well described [13]. For example, implementation intentions also called the “if-then plan” has been shown to significantly improve goal attainment [12]. It consists of four steps: identifying the self-regulatory problem Y (seeing a patient with poorly controlled asthma); identifying a cognitive/behavioural response X that would help resolve the problem (write a prescription of inhaled corticosteroids); identifying a good opportunity to instigate the response, serving as a cue (asthma quiz score of two or more filled in the clinic setting) [14]; and making a plan by generating in writing a contingency plan - if it is a situation Y, then I will do X (if I see a patient with poorly controlled asthma, that is, with an asthma quiz score of two or more, I will write a prescription for the inhaled corticosteroids) [14].\r\n\r\nFinally, both uptake and outcome measures should be monitored for sustainability. We should learn from successes and failures as the knowledge to action cycle implies improvement through iterative rotation around the cycle. Ideally, the intervention should be tested in the context of a randomized controlled trial to best assess the impact of the intervention; because of the likelihood of contamination between health care professionals working in the same setting (clinic, hospital, etc.), cluster randomisation may be ideal to address this issue [15]. Whenever possible, having a third arm to examine barriers and facilitators to the uptake of the intervention is useful to better learn from our endeavour. Alternatively, such qualitative analysis of barriers and facilitators can be done after a successful or failed intervention to understand the mechanistic pathway.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the Knowledge-to-Action cycle provides the framework for designing and testing effective intervention strategies to improve implementation of guidelines by any audience, including health care professionals. The key decision remains to select a simple actionable message.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis (APD) is a rare skin condition caused by sensitivity to high levels of progesterone secreted during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. This may be due to various pathophysiological mechanisms including a Type I and Type IV hypersensitivity reaction. Here we present the case of a patient with APD whose episodic flares were controlled by the addition of omalizumab, after a bilateral oophorectomy failed to resolve her symptoms. Case Presentation A 34-year-old female presented to our Endocrine clinic with marked Cushingoid features secondary to high-dose oral prednisone prescribed for APD diagnosed 6 years earlier. She first developed a pruritic maculopapular rash on her arms and legs just after the birth of her second child in 2009. The rash was also associated with headaches and diffuse angioedema. Symptoms occurred for 1–2 weeks, in a cyclical fashion, during the luteal phase of each menstrual cycle and subsided within a few days after menses. The severity of symptoms increased as time went on, and flare-ups began to also include dyspnea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Her symptoms improved with administration of oral prednisone, but she continued to experience breakthrough symptoms. After multiple failed treatment modalities, she elected bilateral oophorectomy in 2018. However, her symptoms of APD persisted and she still required high-dose oral prednisone. Her condition was further complicated by vasomotor menopausal symptoms and progressive iatrogenic Cushing’s syndrome. She eventually was started on Omalizumab, which suppressed further recurrences of APD symptoms and allowed her to wean off prednisone. Vasomotor menopausal symptoms responded well to the addition of conjugated estrogens with bazedoxifene. However, her symptoms of diffuse bony pain and arthralgias which started whilst on prednisone have persisted in spite of discontinuing prednisone. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is only the third case of APD which was successfully treated with Omalizumab and the first case where a bilateral oophorectomy failed to resolve symptoms of APD in the literature. This case also demonstrates the complications of vasomotor menopausal symptoms secondary to a bilateral oophorectomy, as well as the adverse effects of long-term glucocorticoid therapy.",

An analysis of the available database would establish clinical characteristics, diagnoses and outcome including microbiologic pattern. Studying the demography allows us to document the occurrence of CGD amongst multiethnic groups and its geographical distribution for Malaysia. Methods Data from the Malaysia Primary Immunodeficiency Network (MyPIN) with cases of CGD diagnosed from 1991 until 2016 were collated and analysed. Results Twenty patients were diagnosed as CGD. Males (N = 13, 65%) outnumber females (N = 7, 35%). CGD is commonest amongst the Malays (65%) followed by the Chinese (15.0%), Indians (10.0%) and natives of Borneo (10.0%), reflecting the ethnic composition of the country. The mean age of diagnosis was 3.7 years. There was a positive family history in 40% of the cases. Abscess was the main presenting feature in 16 patients (80%) with one involving the brain. Pneumonia occurred in 10 (50%) and one with complicated bronchiectasis. Catalase-positive bacteria were the most commonly isolated pathogen with Chromobacterium violaceum predominating (N = 5, 25%) with consequent high mortality (N = 4, 80%). All CGD patients with C. violaceum infection displayed CD4 + (T helper cells) lymphopenia. Conclusion This study has shown CGD occurs in the major ethnic groups of Malaysia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and the largest series of chronic granulomatous disease in South East Asia which may be reflective of similar clinical pattern in the region. C. violaceum infection is associated with a higher mortality in CGD patients in Malaysia. All the CGD patients with C. violaceum infection in this patient series displayed CD4 + (T helper) lymphopenia. We recorded rare clinical manifestation of CGD viz. brain abscess and bronchiectasis.",

Methods A CMA was deemed appropriate and was based on the assumption that the SQ Tree SLIT-tablets have comparable efficacy to Tree Pollen SCIT. A societal perspective was adopted in the model, including relevant costs of medications, costs of health care services, and productivity losses. The time horizon in the model was three years, which corresponds to a minimal treatment course of allergy immunotherapy. Resource use and costs were based on published sources, where available, and validated by Canadian specialist clinicians (allergists) in active practice in Ontario and in Quebec, where applicable. A discount rate of 1.5% was applied in accordance with the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) guidelines. To assess the robustness of the results, scenario analyses were performed by testing alternative assumptions for selected parameters (e.g., Tree Pollen SCIT resource use, discount rates, number of injections, annual SCIT dosing with maintenance injections, and nurse time support), to evaluate their impact on the results of the analysis. Results The direct costs, including the drug costs, and physician services costs, for three years of treatment, were similar for both SQ Tree SLIT-tablets vs. Tree Pollen SCIT in both Ontario and Quebec ($2799.01 and $2838.70 vs. $2233.76 and $2266.05 respectively). However, when the indirect costs (including patient’s travel expenses and lost working hours) are included in the model, total savings for the treatment with SQ Tree SLIT-tablets of $1111.79 for Ontario and $1199.87 for Quebec were observed. Scenario analyses were conducted and showed that changes in assumptions continue to result in the savings of SQ Tree SLIT- tablets over Tree Pollen SCIT. Conclusions The CMA indicates that SQ Tree SLIT-tablets are a cost-minimizing alternative to Tree Pollen SCIT when considered from a societal perspective in Ontario and Quebec.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Allergen extracts used in subcutaneous immunotherapy can be standardized or non-standardized. Standardized extracts are available in specific biological potencies, presumably making their biological activity more consistent. The majority of allergen extracts are non-standardized and may have less consistent potencies. Non-standardized extracts are labeled as weight per volume or protein nitrogen units (PNUs). Neither method provides direct information regarding the extract’s biologic potency. The purpose of this study was to compare weight per volume versus PNU concentrations for 4 non-standardized allergen extracts prepared by two allergen manufacturers. The potencies were compared to current North American practice recommendations. Methods The weight per volume and PNU values were provided for 4 non-standardized extracts—birch, short ragweed, dog hair and Alternaria—from HollisterStier and Stallergenes Greer. Weight per volume and PNU concentrations were compared for each of these extracts from both manufacturers. From the raw data, we calculated the corresponding PNU values for a weight per volume of 1:100 and 1:200 for each extract. Similarly, we calculated the corresponding weight per volume including a range of PNU values, for 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 and 5000 PNU/ml. Results Birch extract has low PNU concentration, below 5000, for a weight per volume of 1:200 for both HollisterStier and Stallergenes Greer. In contrast, for both HollisterStier and Stallergenes Greer ragweed extract, a weight per volume of 1:200 corresponds to a PNU concentration greater than 5000. Dog extract for a weight per volume of 1:200, and even for 1:100, corresponds to very low PNUs for both companies. For Alternaria, corresponding PNU concentrations for HollisterStier is low at only 500 while over 5000 for Stallergenes Greer. Conclusions Our results show variability when comparing weight per volume and PNU concentrations for both Hollister-Stier and Stallergenes Greer products. We suggest selecting a PNU dose that corresponds to a weight per volume of 1:200 as this may improve patient safety. Our recommendations for starting PNU dose for the four non-standardized extracts are 1500 for birch, 5000 for ragweed, 25 for dog, and 500 for Alternaria when using HollisterStier products; 2300 for birch, 5000 for ragweed, 1200 for dog, and 5000 for Alternaria when using Stallergenes Greer products. If the starting PNU concentration is considerably below 5000 for a weight per volume of 1:200 slow up-titration is advised. Conversely, for PNU concentrations above 5000 for weight per volume of 1:200 we suggest a maintenance dose of 5000 PNU.",

    "abstract": "Worldwide, allergy affects more than one billion people, with particularly rising prevalence in industrialised areas. Specifically, young adults appear to be predominantly targeted for an allergy diagnosis. Allergic diseases in pregnancy are mainly pre-existing but could also occur de novo. The immunological changes while pregnant, with increased Th2 lymphocyte activity, can facilitate allergen sensitisation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the pattern of specific IgE (sIgE) sensitisation to common inhalant and food allergens in pregnancy, and assess its relationship to self-reported allergic disease. We assessed 200 pregnant women, aged 20-38 years (mean age = 29 years), participant of ELMA (Epigenetic Hallmark of Maternal Atopy and Diet) study, living in a metropolitan area, with no pregnancy associated metabolic complications, for total IgE and allergen specific IgE to 20 allergens. 48% of pregnant women were sensitised to at least one allergen, at a cut-off point of 0.35 kU/L and they were assigned as atopic. However 42% in atopic group were not reporting any allergic disease. The most common inhalant allergens were: pollen (24.5%) and animal dander (23.5%). The most common food allergens were: cow's milk (5.5%) and apples (4.5%). 7.5% of women reported asthma, 21.5% allergic rhinitis, 11.5% atopic dermatitis and 18.5% food allergy. 8.5% of were taking medication for asthma or allergies. Atopic dermatitis had the highest tendency to become more severe during pregnancy. Total IgE values were significantly higher in atopic women. Allergic sensitisation is a common phenomenon in pregnancy. Some sensitisations could be asymptomatic. Further studies should investigate if sensitisation in mothers confers risks for immune alterations in their children.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Jellyfish stings are known to induce allergic skin reactions; however, case reports of anaphylaxis after jellyfish ingestion have been increasing, especially in Asian countries. Some cases of anaphylaxis after jellyfish ingestion have been reported in patients with a previous history of frequent jellyfish stings. Herein, we report a pediatric patient with anaphylaxis after jellyfish ingestion with no history of jellyfish stings. Case presentation A 14-year-old girl developed two episodes of anaphylaxis, and her diet diaries revealed that edible jellyfish was common to the meals in both the anaphylaxis events. A skin prick test using five types of edible jellyfish products revealed a positive reaction to some jellyfish, and anaphylaxis was observed after the ingestion of jellyfish in an oral food challenge test. She had no history of jellyfish stings or frequent swimming in the ocean. The basophil activation test showed positive results on stimulation with extracts from various types of edible jellyfish. We observed serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) reactivity to purified jellyfish collagen and jellyfish acid-soluble extracts. Moreover, immunoblotting analysis showed IgE reactivity to two bands at approximately 40 and 70 kDa using purified jellyfish collagen, which may be a causative antigen. Conclusions Edible salted jellyfish can be one of the causative foods of anaphylaxis. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of anaphylactic reactions due to jellyfish ingestion even without a history of jellyfish stings.",

The current study was aimed to study the association of IgE and different variants of Interleukin-4 ( IL-4) , and Interleukin-13 ( IL-13 ) genes with different kind of allergies. Methods A pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect all the dietary, life style and clinical details by a trained staff. A blood sample of 2 ml each was collected in coagulated and anti-coagulated vials. DNA and serum samples were extracted and stored until further use. Serum IgE were estimated by ELISA while as the genotypic analysis was done by PCR–RFLP methods. Results S tatistically a significant difference of serum IgE levels were observed among cases and controls ( P &lt; 0.05). The observed significant difference of serum IgE levels were retained among subjects who also harboured variant genotypes of IL-4 and IL-13 genes ( P &lt; 0.05). Additionally, the above genetic variants significantly modified the risk of allergy when stratification was done based on various clinical characteristics. Conclusion Our study suggests that increased IgE levels and in association with variant forms of IL-4 and IL-13 genes are significantly associated with different types of allergies in study population.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Sublingual immunotherapy tablets (SLIT-T) are an effective treatment for allergic rhinitis (AR), but some patients experience local allergic reactions (LAR) in the first few weeks of treatment that can lead to treatment discontinuation. Although oral antihistamines are recommended for the treatment and pretreatment of LAR associated with SLIT-T, there are no clinical trial data to support this recommendation. Rupatadine is an H1 antihistamine that also inhibits platelet activating factor activity. The objective of this case series is to describe real-world clinical situations in which rupatadine was used to treat or mitigate SLIT-T–related LAR. Case presentations Five cases are presented by the managing allergist and off-label use of rupatadine is their expert opinion only. Patients in all 5 cases were treated with a SLIT-T (e.g. ragweed, tree, grass, or house dust mites) for the management of allergic rhinitis and experienced bothersome LAR with the first SLIT-T administration. In 3 cases, rupatadine 10 mg was administered for the immediate treatment of LAR (either in-office with the first SLIT-T dose or for subsequent LAR experienced at home) and the symptoms resolved. In 3 cases, pretreatment with other second-generation H1 antihistamines was unable to prevent LAR and the patients discontinued the SLIT-T. In these 3 cases, switching to pretreatment with rupatadine allowed the patients to restart and tolerate SLIT-T treatment with minimal or no LAR. In these patients with an established history of LAR, proactive pretreatment with rupatadine in subsequent seasons or with initiation of a different SLIT-T mitigated the previously experienced LARs. Conclusions In the cases presented, treatment with rupatadine resolved LAR associated with SLIT-T treatment and rupatadine pretreatment appeared to mitigate subsequent LAR. Rupatadine may be an option to treat or improve the tolerability of the SLIT-T, potentially improving early treatment persistence.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Post hoc analyses of randomized placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated efficacy and tolerability of the ragweed sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT)-tablet in Canadian adults with ragweed pollen-induced allergic rhinitis/conjunctivitis (AR/C). This post hoc analysis evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of the ragweed SLIT-tablet in the subpopulation of Canadian children and adolescents with AR/C in a previously described randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Methods The trial (NCT02478398) was conducted in North American and European children/adolescents ages 5–17 years with ragweed pollen-induced AR/C with or without asthma (FEV 1 ≥ 80% predicted). Participants were randomized to daily ragweed SLIT-tablet (12 Amb a 1-U) or placebo for up to 28 weeks. The primary endpoint was the average total combined score (TCS; sum of rhinoconjunctivitis daily symptom score [DSS] and daily medication score [DMS]) during peak ragweed pollen season (RPS). Key secondary endpoints were TCS during the entire RPS, and DSS and DMS during peak RPS. Post hoc analyses of the primary and key secondary endpoints were conducted in the subpopulation of Canadian participants. Results Of the 1025 randomized participants, 246 (SLIT-tablet, n = 116; placebo, n = 130) were in the Canadian subpopulation. In the total study population, relative TCS (95% CI) improvement with ragweed SLIT-tablet versus placebo was − 38.3% (− 46.0%, − 29.7%; least square [LS] mean difference, − 2.73; P &lt; 0.001) during peak RPS. In the Canadian subpopulation, relative TCS improvements with ragweed SLIT-tablet versus placebo were − 40.8% (− 54.5%, − 20.2%; LS mean difference, − 1.59; P = 0.001) during peak RPS and − 36.6% (− 50.2%, − 16.5%; LS mean difference, − 1.36; P = 0.002) during the entire RPS. DSS and DMS during peak RPS in the Canadian subpopulation improved with SLIT-tablet versus placebo by − 30.6% (− 45.2%, − 7.7%; LS mean difference, − 0.94; P = 0.010) and − 77.2% (− 97.5%, − 44.2%; LS mean difference, − 0.66; P = 0.003), respectively. No events of anaphylaxis, airway compromise, intramuscular epinephrine administration, eosinophilic esophagitis, or severe treatment-related systemic allergic reactions were reported in the overall population or Canadian subpopulation. Conclusion Efficacy and safety of the ragweed SLIT-tablet in Canadian children/adolescents with ragweed pollen-induced AR/C was consistent with the total study population. The ragweed SLIT-tablet resulted in clinically meaningful improvement in symptoms, decreased symptom-relieving medication use, and was well tolerated in Canadian children/adolescents.

However, saline induces bronchoconstriction in some patients despite pre-medication with Salbutamol. Our objectives were to investigate the predictors of failure of Salbutamol to protect against saline-induced-bronchoconstriction in patients with asthma and COPD and to evaluate implications for asthma therapy.Retrospective survey on a database of 3565 patients with obstructive airway diseases who had sputum induced with hypertonic saline. The effect of baseline FEV1, bronchitis and concomitant medication on saline-induced-bronchoconstriction (≥ 15% drop in FEV1) were examined by logistic regression analysis. A subgroup had this re-examined 8-12 weeks after decreasing long-acting-beta-2-agonist dose or after adding Montelukast, which included an assessment of mast cell activity in sputum.222 (6.2%) patients had saline-induced-bronchoconstriction despite pre-treatment with inhaled Salbutamol. Baseline airflow obstruction (FEV1% predicted < 60% OR 3.29, p < 0.001) and long-acting-beta-agonist use (OR 2.02, p = 0.001), but not bronchitis, were predictors of saline-induced-bronchoconstriction, which decreased when long-acting-beta-agonist dose was decreased. Refractoriness to subsequent bronchodilation was associated with mast cell activity and was attenuated by Montelukast.Sputum induction with saline provides information on bronchitis and additional physiological data on tolerance to beta-agonists and mast cell activity that may have implications for clinical therapy.",

    "abstract": "In methacholine challenge testing (MCT), skipping a methacholine dose is suggested if FEV1 falls by < 5%. Using a larger threshold may further shorten test duration, but data supporting this hypothesis is lacking. We evaluated the safety and consequences of using a 10% FEV1 fall as threshold to skip the next dose of methacholine in patients undergoing MCT.We reviewed MCTs performed in our center in 2017-2018. A ≤ 10% FEV1 fall allowed the omission of the next methacholine dose. Patients of interest were those in which a dose was skipped after a previous FEV1 fall outside the usual range (5-10%, termed \"skip5-10%\"). Adverse events [AE; mild: > 1 nebulized salbutamol dose (2.5 mg) to reach basal FEV1, palpitations; severe: hypoxemia and/or need for medical attention or intervention] were compared in the skip5-10% group and others. Regression analysis was used to identify predictors of AE.208 MCTs were analysed (135 males, age 52 ± 15 years). Skip5-10% occurred 111 times in 90 tests. Prevalence of AE was 5% and all were mild. Patients who developed AEs had lower FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC ratio, and higher lung volume values (all p < 0.05), but similar prevalence of skip5-10% (36 vs. 44%, p = 0.64). Overall, MCTs in which at least one skip5-10% occurred had a lower mean number of doses (3.1 ± 0.6 vs. 3.5 ± 1.3 doses, p = 0.007). Baseline residual volume was independently related to the development of AEs (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.10, p = 0.01), but not the presence of a skip5-10%, even when the skipped dose directly led to the reaching of PC20 (OR 5.40, 95% CI 0.73-39.22, p = 0.10).Omitting a methacholine dose based on a ≤ 10% fall in FEV1 occurs frequently and has the potential to shorten test duration. AE are rare, but patients with worse baseline lung function and gas trapping are at increased risk of mild side effects.",

    "abstract": ": Anticholinergics, or specific antimuscarinic agents, by inhibition of muscarinic receptors cause bronchodilatation, which might correlate with activation of these receptors by the muscarinic agonist methacholine. The aim of this study was to determine whether a positive bronchodilator response to the anticholinergic ipratropium bromide could predict airway hyperresponsiveness in patients with persistent allergic asthma. The study comprised 40 patients with mild and moderate persistent allergic asthma. Diagnosis was established by clinical and functional follow-up (skin-prick test, spirometry, bronchodilator tests with salbutamol and ipratropium bromide, and methacholine challenge testing). The bronchodilator response was positive to both bronchodilator drugs in all patients. After salbutamol inhalation, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) increased by 18.39 +/- 6.18%, p < .01, whereas after ipratropium bromide, FEV1 increased by 19.14 +/- 6.74%, p < .01. The mean value of FEV1 decreased by 25.75 +/- 5.16%, p < .01 after methacholine (PC20 FEV1 [provocative concentration of methacholine that results in a 20% fall in FEV1] from 0.026 to 1.914 mg/mL). Using linear regression, between methacholine challenge testing and bronchodilator response to salbutamol, a positive, weak, and stastistically significant correlation for FEV1 was found (p < .05). Correlations between methacholine challenge testing and the bronchodilator response to ipratropium bromide were positive and weak but not statistically significant. The positive bronchodilator response to ipratropium bromide could not predict airway hyperresponsiveness.",

Her skin reactions resolved once TPN was stopped. Following a literature review, we postulated that the reactions could be due to the high osmolality of her TPN. Consequently, lowering her TPN from 2785 to 1928 mOsm/kg and premedicating with cetirizine resulted in resolution of her urticaria.When looking at patients who have hypersensitivity reactions to TPN, one must consider that their reactions may be due to factors other than allergens. More studies are needed to clarify the relationship between high osmolality TPN infusions and non-IgE mediated hypersensitivity reactions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The National Review of Asthma Deaths UK highlighted that 46% of deaths could be avoided and recommended that all sufferers receive a structured asthma annual review which assess asthma control. In primary care this is commonly achieved using symptom-based questionnaires such as the Asthma Control Test (ACT). A newer method of assessing asthma control is Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) testing, which is currently recommended for the diagnosis of asthma, but not for monitoring of asthma control. The study aim was to assess the correlation between self-reported symptoms as measured by the ACT and FeNO testing and the subsequent impact of FeNO testing on prescribing of asthma medication. Methods A retrospective review of 65 patients who had received both ACT and FeNO testing as part of their asthma annual review. A spearman correlation was used to estimate the correlation between ACT scores and FENO levels. A χ 2 test was used to compare prompting frequency of the measures and Kendalls τ statistic was made to estimate their concordance and influence on subsequent ICS medication prescription. Results The mean age of the participants was 41 years (4–93 years). There was no statistically significant correlation between ACT and FeNO (ρ = 0.195, p = 0.120). The median FeNO was 26 ppb (range 8–279 ppb), and the ACT score 20 (range 5 to 25 points). Furthermore, FeNO more frequently prompts a change in medication than ACT, 66% versus 42% (p = 0.005). A low concordance between the measures was found (Kendall’s τ statistic − 0.321). Conclusion FeNO should be considered for monitoring of control in asthma. To balance the cost of implementing this technology into primary care a risk stratified approach could be applied to testing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Rare tonsillar granulomas may be caused for example by infections, malignancies or sarcoidosis. Granulomas also occur in inborn errors of immunity (IEI) such as common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) with B cell maturation defects and hypogammaglobulinemia. CVID shares various features with sarcoidosis and drug-induced secondary hypogammaglobulinemia; careful consideration of differential diagnosis between these conditions is warranted. Case presentation A 29-year-old female with epilepsy developed dysphagia, dyspnea and impaired exercise tolerance. Obstruction caused by swollen lingual tonsil and edema in the epiglottis and arytenoid mucosa were found. Lingual tonsil and epiglottis biopsies displayed non-necrotizing granulomas. There was no evidence of viral, bacterial, mycobacterial or fungal infections. Chest X-ray, computerized tomography of chest and ultrasound of neck and abdomen remained unremarkable. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) showed laryngeal enhancement. Empiric antimicrobials combined with prednisolone were insufficient to control her disease. In immunological evaluation, the patient had normal counts of B and T cells. Proportions of CD27 + memory B cells (30.3%) and IgD − IgM − CD27 + switched memory B cells (7.2%; normal range 6.5–29.2%) were normal. Percentage of activated CD21 low B cells was high (6.6%; normal range 0.6–3.5%). IgG (3.5 g/L; normal range 6.77–15.0 g/l) and all IgG subclass concentrations were low. Anti-polysaccharide responses were impaired, with 3/10 serotypes reaching a level of 0.35 µg/ml after immunization with Pneumovax ® . The findings were consistent with hypogammaglobulinemia resembling CVID, possibly secondary to antiepileptic medication. Her dyspnea and dysphagia responded favorably to subcutaneous IgG and rituximab. Conclusions Tonsillar granulomas can be the presenting and only clinical feature of B cell deficiency, highlighting the diversity of symptoms and findings in primary or secondary immunodeficiencies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) reflects hypersensitivity and an exaggerated immune response to Aspergillus fumigatus . ABPA typically occurs in individuals with airway diseases such as asthma or cystic fibrosis and is associated with worse outcomes for individuals with these conditions. Each year, physicians across the province of British Columbia submit over 2600 diagnostic testing requests to a centralized location in Vancouver, requiring specimen collection, storage, and shipment from different clinics across the province. Timely and reliable testing of Aspergillus precipitins is critical to optimizing diagnosis and management of ABPA. At our centre, we analyzed sample stability in varying storage conditions to provide guidance to those using this routine diagnostic test. Methods To determine temperature and time stability, 31 serum specimens positive for Aspergillus fumigatus precipitins from routine clinical testing were each aliquoted and incubated at 4 and 37 °C. Samples were repeatedly assayed for precipitins to Aspergillus fumigatus via agarose gel double immunodiffusion (AGID) at 7, 14, and 28 days post-incubation. To determine freeze–thaw stability, 39 serum specimens submitted for routine clinical testing for Aspergillus precipitins were randomly selected. Each specimen was aliquoted and stored at 4 or −20 °C. 4 °C samples were maintained at 4 °C while −20 °C samples were split into three groups corresponding to one, two, or three freeze–thaw cycles. −20 °C samples were thawed at room temperature in the morning and then immediately frozen overnight for up to a total of three freeze–thaw cycles. Results Regarding temperature and time stability, median stability time was 47 and 34 days at 4 and 37 °C, respectively. The log-rank model indicates no statistically significant difference between the two temperature storage conditions (p = 0.14) with a hazard ratio of 0.61 (95% CI, 0.31–1.2). In terms of freeze–thaw stability, no indication of serum degradation with regards to Aspergillus fumigatus precipitins was found with repeated freeze–thaw cycles as compared to refrigerated storage. Conclusions The stability of serum precipitins to Aspergillus fumigatus was found to be dependent on time, but not temperature and freeze–thaw cycles. Specimens for Aspergillus fumigatus precipitins testing should be shipped at ambient temperature and tested within 2 weeks from collection.",

    "abstract": "This is a retrospective review of the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority's (WRHA) angioedema patients who were dispensed icatibant in hospital. Icatibant is a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist indicated for Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) types I and II and is used off-label for HAE with normal C1INH (HAE-nC1INH) and ACE-inhibitor induced angioedema (ACEIIAE). The WRHA's use of icatibant is regulated by the Allergist on call. We characterized icatibant's use and the timeline from patient presentation, compared the real-world experience with the FAST-3 trial and hypothesized the factors which may affect response to icatibant. Background data were collected on patients. Angioedema attack-related data included administered medications, performed investigations and the timeline to endpoints such as onset of symptom relief. Data was analyzed in R with the package \"survival.\" Time-to-event data was analyzed using the Peto-Peto Prentice method or Mann-Whitney U-test. Data was also compared with published clinical trial data using the Sign Test. Fisher's Exact Test was used to produce descriptive statistics. Overall, 21 patients accounted for 23 angioedema attacks treated with icatibant. Approximately half the patients had a diagnosis of HAE-nC1IHN and half of ACEIIAE. Of those presenting with angioedema, 65% were first treated with conventional medication. Patients without a prior angioedema diagnosis were evaluated only 40-50% of the time for C4 levels or C1INH function or level. The median time from patients' arrival to the emergency department until the Allergy consultant's response was 1.77 h. Patients with HAE-nC1IHN had median times to onset of symptom relief and final clinical outcome (1.13 h, p = 0.34; 3.50 h, p = 0.11) similar to those reported in FAST-3 for HAE I/II. Patients with ACEIIAE had longer median times to onset of symptom relief (4.86 h, p = 0.01) than predicted. HAE-nC1INH may be an appropriate indication for treatment with icatibant. Conversely, the results of this study do not support the use of icatibant for the treatment of ACEIIAE, concordant with a growing body of literature. Patients should be stratified into groups of more- or less-likely icatibant-responders through history and laboratory investigations in order to prevent potential delays.",

We reported a rare case of hypersensitivity reactions which caused bilateral peripheral corneal infiltrates after femtosecond laser small incision lenticule (SMILE) surgery in a man with a history of fruits allergy. Case presentation Here we report the case of a young man who developed white, ring-shaped bilateral peripheral infiltrates that appeared 1 day after an uneventful SMILE surgery. The overlying corneal epithelium was intact; the infiltrate was negative for bacterial culture, but high titers of immunoglobulin E was demonstrated in the blood. Symptomatically, a clinical diagnosis of sterile corneal infiltrates was made, and the patient was treated with topical and systemic steroids. The infiltrates were immunogenic in origin, which may be caused by the contact lenses used for suction duration in surgery. It resolved without corneal scarring in the subsequent months following steroid treatment. The patient’s visual acuity improved. Conclusions When patients with a history of allergy who aim to perform corneal refractive surgery, surgeons must consider possible hypersensitivity reactions after treatment. More studies are needed to clarify the relationship between contact glass used in femtosecond laser corneal refractive surgery and IgE mediated hypersensitivity reactions.",

The introduced preventive measures and differential diagnostics, including oral food challenges, are the gold standard for determining further treatment planning. Case presentation We present a case of an 18-year-old girl with a cow’s milk allergy who underwent an oral food challenge (double blind oral food challenge). Such a challenge may be confounded by inducing a response from other systems and organs, which provides theoretical grounds for the use of other methods of assessing the body’s response to food allergens (response demonstrated by the upper respiratory tract). Based on this idea, in order to assess the degree of mucosal response, we used optical rhinometry as an objective method for nasal patency evaluation, as well as identification of tryptase level in nasal lavage fluid and exfoliative cytology of nasal mucosa. The results of these tests confirmed positive reaction of the nasal mucosa in the course of the oral allergen challenge. Conclusions The observed increase in the nasal mucosal reactivity that accompanies oral food challenges may suggest a potential for using food allergens in nasal allergen provocation testing in order to diagnose food allergies.",

The knowledge about the molecular pathogenesis of HAE has derived mainly from investigating blood samples. However, limited data are available on the role of the molecular mechanisms in the affected tissues during HAE attack. Objective The aim of our study was to explore the histological changes occurring in HAE attacks. Methods Post mortem macro-, microscopic and immunohistological assessment of upper airway tissues of a patient with HAE due to C1 inhibitor deficiency (C1-INH-HAE) type 2 who died from laryngeal HAE attack was compared with a non-HAE patient who died from other condition without any signs of angioedema. Results Compared to the control patient, we demonstrated stronger T cell/monocyte infiltration and a more intense C1-INH staining in the C1-INH-HAE patient. The expression of both bradykinin receptors (B1/B2) was observed with a slightly lower level in the C1-INH-HAE patient than in the control patient. PAR1 expression was strongly reduced in the C1-INH-HAE patient suggesting overactivation of this hyperpermeability inducing receptor. Conclusion Our unique case and novel results correspond to the knowledge about C1-INH and BDKRs observed in plasma; however, it revealed new information about the pathomechanism of HAE attack focusing on the potential involvement of PAR1 in edema formation. This observation, if it is verified by subcutaneous biopsy studies, may designate a new therapeutic target in HAE.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Our recent observational study showed that regular consumption of cow’s milk (CM) formula during early infancy (3–6 months old) was associated with a reduced risk of CM allergy (CMA) at 12 months old. However, the long-term association is unclear. The present study was aimed to examine how long this inverse association persists after 12 months old. Methods This study used the dataset of an ongoing nationwide prospective cohort, the Japan Environment and Children’s Study, in which participants were registered between January 2011 and March 2014. We analyzed 65,568 children followed-up until 36 months old. The exposure factors were the consumption statuses of formula milk from 0–3, 3–6, and 6–12 months old. The primary outcome was the prevalence of CMA at 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months old. CMA was defined as an allergic reaction and sensitization to CM protein in an individual with no or limited intake of this protein at the evaluation time, combined with physician-diagnosed food allergy. Multivariable regression models were used to estimate the association between the periods of formula consumption and the prevalence of CMA. Results The prevalence of CMA increased with a peak of 1.51% at 18 months old and then declined to 0.79% at 36 months old. Formula milk from 3–6 months old was associated with a reduced risk of CMA throughout the first 3 years of life, although the extent of the reduction was mitigated with age (adjusted relative risk: [95% confidence interval]: 0.19 [0.10–0.34] at 12 months old, 0.23 [0.16–0.33] at 18 months old, 0.41 [0.26–0.64] at 24 months old, and 0.47 [0.26–0.80] at 36 months old). The association between early formula and CMA were observed in both children with and without eczema, but more prominent and long-lasting in the former than the latter. Conclusions Regular exposure to CM protein during infancy was associated with a reduced prevalence of CMA during early childhood. At present, however, this observational study does not necessarily encourage formula feeding, and randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm the findings and their significance.",

Few population-based studies are available for data on allergies and sensitization. However, as these studies are expensive and time-consuming, novel approaches are searched for. Objectives A large monocentric IgE dataset was used to analyse quantitative sensitization data in different age and gender groups and compared the results to available epidemiological data. Methods A total of 14,370 patients who sought medical care at the Department for Dermatology and Allergology at the Technical University of Munich, Germany was analysed. Total IgE and sensitization measured in specific IgE levels to common food allergens and aeroallergens were compared between females and males, age groups, and the year of testing (2003–2021). Results 8283 females (57.6%) and 6087 males (42.4%) were tested. The average number of specific IgE tests per patient was 12.3 ± 11.4. Total IgE increased after birth with age and reached a peak between 4–6 years in males and 10–12 years in females. Males had higher specific IgE for all common aeroallergens (house dust mite, birch, mugwort and timothy grass pollen) and food allergens (milk protein, chicken egg white, peanut, wheat flour, cod) except for cat epithelia. Data closely reflected results of population-based studies in the literature. Conclusion This study shows that, despite potential patient and test selection bias, the results of the quantitative IgE-dataset analysis closely reflect results of population-based data. Thus, as large cohorts can be examined with a minute amount of effort, this surrogate method appears promising to supplement epidemiology research.",

The sensitization results were Der p (57.85%), Der f (55.09%), German cockroach (18.02%), American cockroach (17.01%), cat (11.77%), Acacia (3.49%), Bermuda grass (3.34%), molds (3.05%), Timothy (2.33%), dog (1.89%), and careless weed (1.60%). Der p, Der f, and German cockroach were required to detect at least 95% of sensitized children. If the SPT panel added Acacia, cat, American cockroach, Bermuda grass, and careless weed, sensitization was detected in 99-100% of cases.Indoor allergens (Der p, cockroach, and cat) were common causes of sensitization in Thai children with allergic respiratory diseases. Eight allergens were sufficient for sensitization identification in Thai children with asthma or allergic rhinitis or both in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is an inherited disease characterized by recurrent angioedema without urticaria or pruritus. The most common types of HAE are caused by deficiency or dysfunction in C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH-HAE). The association between C1-INH-HAE and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is known; however, variations in the underlying pathophysiology, disease course, and treatment in this population remain incompletely understood.A 31-year-old Japanese woman with a prior diagnosis of HAE type 1 based on the episodes of recurrent angioedema, low C1 inhibitor antigen levels and function, and family history presented with new complaints of malar rash, alopecia, and arthralgias in her hands and elbows. She later developed fever, oral ulcers, lupus retinopathy, a discoid rash localized to her chest, and malar rash. Investigations revealed positive antinuclear antibody, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hypocomplementemia, and nephritis. Based on these findings, she was diagnosed with SLE according to the 2019 European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology classification criteria. There did not appear to be a correlation between HAE disease activity and the timing of presentation with SLE, because HAE disease activity had been stable. The patient was able to achieve and maintain remission with immunosuppressive therapy including prednisolone, hydroxychloroquine, and tacrolimus.Our patient presented with a variety of symptoms, including fever and cytopenia in addition to mucocutaneous, joint, ocular, and renal lesions. It is important to better characterize the clinical characteristics of SLE in patients with C1-INH-HAE, and to clarify the mechanisms of SLE in this population.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted disparities in healthcare, particularly in the United States, even though disparities have existed since the organization of the modern healthcare system. Recruitment of patients from racial and ethnic minority groups is often minimal in phase 3 clinical trials, and is further exacerbated in the case of trials for rare diseases such as hereditary angioedema (HAE). This can lead to a gap in the understanding of minority patients' experiences with these diseases and their response to potential treatment options.We reviewed data from phase 3 double-blind (HELP) and open-label extension (HELP OLE) trials of lanadelumab, a monoclonal antibody developed for long-term prophylaxis against attacks of HAE. Efficacy (attack rate reduction) and safety (adverse events) results from White patients were compared descriptively to those from Hispanic/Latino patients, Black/African Americans, and other minority Americans.Not surprisingly, few minorities were recruited across both studies: 9.5% Black, 2.4% Asian, and 7.1% Hispanic/Latino versus 88.1% White and 91.7% non-Hispanic/non-Latino received lanadelumab in HELP, and 4.7% Black, 0.9% Asian, 0.9% other, and 6.1% Hispanic/Latino versus 93.4% White and 93.4% non-Hispanic/non-Latino were enrolled in HELP OLE. Although these studies were conducted in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Jordan, all minorities were from the United States. Despite the number of minority patients being far less than expected for the population, there was no evidence that either efficacy or adverse event profiles differed between ethnic or racial groups.The HELP and HELP OLE studies described herein recruited far fewer minorities than would be ideal to represent these populations. However, evidence suggests that the effectiveness and tolerance of lanadelumab are similar between the groups. Nonetheless, the disparity in recruitment into research for minorities has significant room for improvement.

This article describes the development and validation of a questionnaire to assess treatment needs and benefits in children and adolescents, the PBI-AR-K, in a sample of patients receiving grass pollen sublingual immunotherapy. Patients and methods The PBI-AR-K was developed based on an open survey including children and adolescents and expert consensus between methodologists, patients, and physicians. The PBI-AR-K assesses patient needs before the treatment and perceived benefit during or at the end of a treatment. A weighted benefit score can be calculated ranging from 0 to 4 (4 = highest possible benefit). The validation was conducted in children (5–12 years) and adolescents (13–17 years) receiving sublingual immunotherapy. Subscales were developed based on factor analysis. Psychometric properties of items and scales were assessed with descriptive statistics, internal consistency, and convergent validity. Results The final PBI-AR-K consists of 19 items. For validation, data from 345 patients (mean age 11.1; 60.9% male; n = 223 children; n = 122 adolescents) was analysed. Factor analyses resulted in four subscales for children and three subscales for adolescents. The items with the highest importance ratings were about choice of leisure activities (mean value in children: 3.5) and about being free of AR symptoms (adolescents: 3.3). The weighted PBI-AR-K scores reflected considerable patient-reported benefit (2.08–2.82) in both children and adolescents. Internal consistency of all scales was good or acceptable. In the children’s sample, the global scale and three of four subscales were quite consistently correlated with convergent variables, while the subscale ‘treatment burden’ was significantly correlated only with change in average impairments due to rhinitis symptoms. The adolescents’ sample showed more inconsistent results with only change in rhinitis severity being significantly associate with all subscales. Conclusion The newly developed PBI-AR-K is a reliable and valid questionnaire for use in children; for the use in adolescents, it should be further elaborated.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background To date, little consideration has been given to access to allergy-related care, despite the fact that food allergy affects a considerable proportion of children. As such, the current study aimed to describe access to food allergy-related services in Canada and the United States (US). Methods Participants were recruited via social media from March-July 2021 and were asked to complete an online survey focused on food allergy-related medical care. Participants were Canadian and US residents who live with a child &lt; 18 years old, with ≥ 1 food allergy. A series of logistic regressions were used to assess the associations between country of residence and type of allergy testing utilized during diagnosis. Results Fifty-nine participants were included in the analysis (Canadian: 32/59; 54.2%; US residents: 27/59; 45.8%). Relative to Canadian participants, US respondents were less likely to be diagnosed using an oral food challenge (OFC; OR 0.16; 95% CI 0.04; 0.75: p &lt; 0.05). Compared to children diagnosed by age 2 years, those diagnosed at age 3 years and older were less likely to have been diagnosed using an OFC (OR 0.12; 95% CI 0.01; 1.01; p = 0.05). Conclusions Access to food allergy-related services, varies between Canada and the US. We speculate that this variation may reflect differences in clinical practice and types of insurance coverage. Findings also underscore the need for more research centered on food allergy-related health care, specifically diagnostic testing, among larger and more diverse samples.",

    "abstract": "Background Education is required to effectively manage food allergy. In young children, parents are the primary managers. Once children enter school, a sh ift should begin towards a shared care model with children beginning to take on more responsibility. We previously developed a food allergy education program for parents of pre-school children and now have developed a new program for school age children and their parents building on our experience with the pre-school program. Method Development steps included: synthesizing knowledge gained from expert advice, a literature review and parents; creation of program objectives, content, teaching tools and facilitator notes; sharing a program draft with experts for feedback; piloting the revised program; making further revisions during the pilot. Results The pilot phase included 6 groups and 22 families (37 parents, 23 children). Children liked the activity-based sessions and benefited from meeting with peers. Parents appreciated the learning opportunity for children. Some parents suggested a less structured format for the adult sessions. Many parents highly valued the peer-to-peer discussions. Parents were interested in the practical aspects of dealing with other people, educating their child, avoiding risk and recognizing and treating reactions. Conclusions In our experience, finding the right approach to food allergy education for school age parents is more complex than for parents of young children or even asthma education for school age parents. Most school age parents have lived with food allergy for a few years and have basic knowledge. However, at this stage their child’s expanding world and relationships present new issues for which many parents value practical advice from others living with the experience. Health care providers should consider the importance of both professional and peer input into education for this population to ensure parents have correct current knowledge and practical skills to help them support and educate their child.",

RATIONALE: There are little data on the role of tryptase in the diagnosis of anaphylaxis. We aimed to determine if total tryptase levels are elevated (>11.5 ng/mL) at the time of anaphylaxis and to identify factors associated with elevated tryptase levels. METHODS: Children presenting with anaphylaxis to the Montreal Children’s Hospital Emergency Department (ED) between April 2011 and April 2012 were recruited. The treating physician documented symptoms, triggers, and management of the anaphylactic reactions. Total tryptase levels were measured 30-120 minutes following onset of symptoms. Charts of all ED patients were reviewed to identify cases that were missed in prospective recruitment. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the association between an elevated tryptase level and age, gender, reaction trigger, reaction severity, and history of atopy. RESULTS: Of 180 anaphylaxis cases (90 of whom were recruited prospectively), 32 children had serum tryptase levels measured. The median age of these 32 children was 6.0 years (IQR 1.2, 11.5), 62.5% [95% CI, 43.8%, 78.3%]weremale, 68.8% (49.9%, 83.3%) identified food as the potential anaphylactic trigger, and 9.4% (2.5%, 26.2%) experienced a severe reaction. Age, gender, anaphylactic trigger, and severity of reaction were comparable between cases with and without tryptase measurements. The mean tryptase level was 6.2 ng/mL (4.5, 8.0). Only 3 patients [9.4% (2.5%, 26.2%)] had elevated levels. Older age (odds ratio (OR) 1.0, 1.01, 1.03) and severe reactions [1.7, (1.3, 2.3)] were associated with higher levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support the use of total typtase as a diagnostic tool in children with anaphylaxis.",

    "abstract": "Background Chronic trauma in childhood can program an abnormal stress reaction in affected children, resulting in lifelong difficulties with stress management and poor health outcomes linked to changes in the immune system. At the same time, maternal stress during pregnancy and the postpartum period has been linked to a number of diseases in childhood, including wheeze and asthma. Given the potential for her own maltreatment in childhood to shape a mother’s later response to stress during pregnancy, it seems plausible that children may demonstrate inheritance of their mother’s childhood trauma through their own health issues. We hypothesize that preschool children are more likely to have a wheeze or allergic disorder if their mother has a history of childhood abuse, independent of her distress during pregnancy and postnatally. Methods The Community Perinatal Care (CPC) Study of Calgary provides extensive data on 791 medically low risk mothers, of whom 61 (7.7%) and 77 (9.7%) had children with a wheezing disorder and allergies, respectively, at age 3. In order to investigate how past maternal maltreatment might be associated with wheeze and asthma in young children, a number of validated questionnaires within the CPC study were used to measure and categorize past maternal trauma .

    "abstract": "Background Structural changes of the airway, collectively referred to as airway remodeling are believed to be the underlying cause of the airway hyperresponsiveness that is characteristic of asthma. Airway remodeling is characterized by thickening of the subepithelial membrane, goblet cell hyperplasia, angiogenesis, increased smooth muscle mass, and epithelial fragility. Thickening of the subepithelial membrane, due to increased deposition of matrix proteins by fibroblasts/myofibroblasts, has been observed in children even prior to the formal diagnosis of asthma. Recent data have shown that young children who experience episodes of human rhinovirus (HRV)-induced wheezing in early childhood are at increased risk of subsequently developing asthma. The primary site of infection of HRV is the airway epithelium. Recent evidence suggests that the molecular reprogramming of epithelial cells through a process called epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) may contribute to increases in fibroblast/myofibroblast in the asthmatic airway. Therefore, we hypothesize that HRV infection plays a role in early airway remodeling by triggering EMT to produce fibroblasts/myofibroblasts that cause thickening of the subepithelial membrane by depositing matrix proteins. Methods The BEAS-2B human bronchial epithelial cell line was grown in 6-well plates in bronchial epithelial growth medium (BEGM). Prior to experiments, cells were grown for 24 h in BEGM from which hydrocortisone was removed. Cells were exposed to medium (control), or purified HRV-16 alone or in the presence of various growth factors for 120 hours with media and growth factor replacement at 48 and 96 hours. Cell lysates were collected and then analyzed by western blot for protein expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers. Results BEAS-2B cells that were infected with HRV in the presence of epidermal growth factor (EGF) showed decreased expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin, and increased expression of the mesenchymal marker vimentin.",

[1] Management of AR encompasses allergen avoidance, use of symptomatic medications, and allergen immunotherapy for patients unresponsive to other pharmacotherapy. [2,3] This study was conducted to characterize patients receiving subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) and the SCIT administration process in Canada and the United States; Canadian results are presented. Methods A multi-center, prospective, observational study was conducted at 5 allergy clinics in Quebec and Ontario and 1 primary care clinic in Quebec from March-September 2012. Patients ≥6 years who were scheduled for SCIT on study days were invited to participate in the study. Patients enrolled in a clinical trial, receiving sublingual immunotherapy or allergic only to insect venom, latex, food, or drugs were excluded. Site and patient-specific information were captured via direct observation, questionnaires, and medical chart review. Costs were estimated from time and supply observation and query. Results A total of 294 patients were enrolled with a mean age of 44 years (4% <18 years and 9% ≥65 years). Of these, 59% were female, 81% Caucasian, 57% employed full-time and 30% reported household income ≥$100,000. Concomitant allergy medications were reported by 66% of patients; 25% used asthma medications .T wo-thirds of patients reported initiating SCIT because they desired a cure “once and for all” for their allergies. Primary symptoms at initiation of SCIT were nasal congestion (62%), rhinorrhea (59%), sneezing (35%) and itchy eyes (32%). Chart data indicated that patients received treatment for several different antigens (mean: 4; SD: 3); those most commonly noted were ragweed (82%), house dust mites (55%), grass (48%) and tree (48%). Sites reported a SCIT build-up phase requiring one injection/week over 12-52 weeks. The SCIT maintenance phase was reported as one injection/month over 4-5 years. Site-specific means (SDs) for total patient time in the clinic for SCIT ranged from 32 (11) to 49 (10) minutes, including a 30-minute required post-injection observation at all but one site. Average patient travel time to the office for SCIT was 20 (SD: 14) minutes. Mean time missed from work in the previous week was 0.7 hours. The direct costs of an injection ranged from $14 to $41 by site, with extract preparation or acquisition and administrative tasks the largest components. Conclusions",

    "abstract": "Background Studies suggest that rates of anaphylaxis, the most severe form of an allergic reaction, are increasing in Pediatric Emergency Departments (PED). Significant gaps still exist regarding the prevalence, triggers and temporal trends of anaphylaxis in Canada. The Cross-Canada Anaphylaxis Registry (C-CARE) was created with the primary goal of determining the societal burden of anaphylaxis in Canada; our aim was to use C-CARE to examine temporal trends in anaphylaxis rates. Methods Over a 2-year period (April 2011 to April 2013), children presenting to the Montreal Children’ sH ospital PED with anaphylaxis were recruited. The treating physician documented characteristics and triggers of anaphylactic reactions using a standardized data entry form. Charts of all PED patients were reviewed to identify anaphylactic cases that were missed in prospective recruitment. Results Among 81,677 PED visits in Year 1, 168 anaphylaxis cases were identified (0.21%) versus 218 anaphylaxis cases among 78,650 PED visits in Year 2 (0.27%), yielding a difference of 0.06% (95% CI, 0.02%, 0.12%) between the two years. The median age of anaphylaxis was 4.8 years (IQR: 2.3-10.1) in Year 1 and 5.9 years (IQR 2.1-11.1) in Year 2. There was a slightly higher male predominance in cases of anaphylaxis in both Year 1 (51.8%; 95% CI, 44%, 59.5%) and Year 2 (61%; 95% CI, 54.2%, 67.4%). The major triggers in both years were food allergens (87.5% and 80.6% respectively) with peanut being the most predominant (29.5% and 20.6%) followed by tree nuts (15.5% and 14.8%). Severe anaphylaxis (hypoxia, cyanosis, circulatory collapse, incontinence or neurological symptoms) was found in 7.1% (95% CI, 3.9%, 12.4%) of patients from Year 1 versus 3.7% (95% CI, 1.7%, 7.4%) in Year 2. Conclusions There was a greater rate of anaphylaxis in the second year of the C-CARE study. In both years, food allergens were found to be the most common trigger with peanuts being the most common food. These results are comparable to the increasing rates of anaphylaxis seen in other westernized countries. Future studies in the Montreal Children’s Hospital as well as in other centers are required to establish temporal trends in anaphylaxis rates, triggers and reaction characteristics.",

Patients with shrimp allergy may exhibit life threatening anaphylactic reactions. Tropomyosin is a known important allergen in shrimp. The IgE-binding epitope in shrimp tropomyosin, cross-reacts with other allergenic invertebrate tropomyosins in house dust mites (Der p 10, Der f 10) and cockroaches (Per a 7). Objective This study was undertaken to evaluate the results of immunotherapy to Mites upon allergic reactions to shrimp allergen in a 40 years old female suffering from combined allergy to mites and shrimp. The patient had a 10 years history of severe allergic reactions after eating shrimp; for which she was hospitalized several times to receive intravenous steroids and antihistamines. Despite avoiding consumption of shrimp for several years she continued to have allergic rhinitis symptoms. The last episode of allergic reactions to shrimp occurred while cooking shrimp not eating it. Materials and methods Allergy skin prick testing against a panel of 30 common allergens including Mites and shrimp ( Omega, Montreal, Canada) revealed a strong positive wheal and erythema reaction to both shrimp and D. farinae (13mm, 9 mm for wheal and 2.5 cm, 2.3 cm for erythema respectively). Allergen specific serum IgE testing also revealed elevated serum specific IgE to both allergens. The patient started subcutaneous allergen specific immunotherapy (ASIT) against D. farinae using Omega labs allergy shots. Six months after ASIT there was a significant reduction in the size of the wheal and erythema and also significant decrease of serum specific IgE values for both allergens. Conclusion",

There is published evidence that airway remodeling is present in pre-school children, often before the diagnosis of asthma is established [1]. It is thought that this increased risk relates to the fact that HRV infections facilitate airway remodeling in asthma [2]. A feature of airway remodeling is the proximity of airway smooth muscle (ASM) to the subepithelial region among other pathological changes [3]. Smooth muscle is also known to exist in two distinct phenotypes: secretory and contractile [4]. We have recently shown that HRV infection of Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells (HBEC), both in vitro and in vivo, results in the up-regulation of a number of airway remodeling mediators [5]. We now sought to determine which ASM phenotype (contractile or secretory) results in migration to supernatants from HRV infected HBE cells.",

Overnight stimulation of PB CD34 + cells with IL-3 (10ng/ mL) and TNFa (50pg/mL) enhanced surface expression of TSLPR to comparable levels post TSLP/IL-3-stimulation. Moreover, pre-stimulating CD34 + cells with IL-3/ TNFa prior to culturing in methylcellulose cultures resulted in enhanced sensitivity to TSLP-mediated Eo/B colony formation at lower concentrations of TSLP. Conclusions We have previously shown that stimulation of human PB CD34+ cells with TSLP promotes Eo/B differentiation through upregulation of IL-3Ra and TSLPR. Our current study demonstrates that TSLP can modulate Eo/ B lineage commitment, by inducing PB CD34 + cells to actively secrete chemokines and cytokines (key among which is TNFa), which, together with IL-3, induce the upregulation of TSLPR, leading to the subsequent amplification of Eo/B CFU. The novel role of TSLPinduced Eo/B differentiation points to the importance of the epithelium, and its responses to environmental stimuli, in the development of allergic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Background\r\n Exposure to tobacco smoke increases the risk for several adverse health effects in children including wheeze, asthma, and asthma exacerbation. Accurately assessing tobacco smoke exposure is important for understanding and preventing these health effects. Questionnaires are a flexible and relatively inexpensive method of assessing exposure, but biomarkers of tobacco smoke exposure are considered more accurate. We developed questionnaire-based exposure models predicting urinary levels of biomarkers cotinine and trans-3’-hydroxycotinine (3HC) (metabolites of nicotine) in 3-month old infants using parent-reported questionnaire responses about tobacco smoke exposure from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) Study.\r\n Methods\r\n We used a manual model building process to build multiple linear regression models predicting urinary concentrations of cotinine, 3HC, and the sum of cotinine and 3HC on a molar basis (Cot+3HC) for 987, 1003, and 983 infants, respectively. Questions were included on the infant’s exposure assessed at 3 months of age and tobacco smoke odour in the home. We also included questions on maternal smoking status and history, passive exposure, and family socio-economic status assessed during pregnancy, as potential indirect measures of the infant’s exposure at 3 months. Adjusted R2 values were maximized in the final models.\r\n Results\r\n During pregnancy, the prevalence of maternal smoking was 2.4 %, and 115 (11.4 %) mothers reported smoking by at least 1 person at home. Of the 144 (14.3 %) infants whose mothers reported that smoking occurred at home when their child was 3 months, 129 (89.6%) and 136 (94.4%) had cotinine and 3HC levels above the detection limit (0.03 ng/mL), respectively. Of the 811 infants who had no parent-reported exposure at 3 months, 538 (66.3%) and 715 (88.2%) had detectable cotinine and 3HC levels, respectively. After correcting for urine dilution, the geometric mean levels were 0.085 ng/mL for cotinine, 0.20 ng/mL for 3HC, and 1.62 picomole/mL for Cot+3HC. The final questionnaire models explained 43.4%, 41.0%, and 42.9% of the variance in cotinine, 3HC, and Cot+3HC levels, respectively.\r\n Conclusions\r\n Our results indicate that exposure of these infants to tobacco smoke is not completely captured by questionnaires, suggesting that exposure assessment could be improved by using a combination of biomarker and questionnaire methods. Though more detectable, the inclusion of 3HC did not increase the ability of the questionnaires to explain variance in metabolite levels, but 3HC may be important since the ratio of 3HC to cotinine can be used to quantify the rate of nicotine metabolism and variation within populations",

Numerous barriers were identified in literature from inadequate training to resource access. OFC utilization patterns using billing data have not been previously studied. Objective The objective of this study is to explore the geographic differences in utilization of OFCs across Ontario and Québec using anonymized billing data from 2013 to 2017. Methods Anonymized OFC billing data were obtained between 2013 and 2017 from Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) and Régie de l'Assurance Maladie du Québec (RAMQ). The number of OFCs was extracted by location, billings, and physician demographics for clinic and hospital-based challenges. Results Over the period studied, the number of OFCs increased by 92% and 85% in Ontario clinics and Québec hospitals, respectively. For Ontario hospitals, the number of OFCs increased by 194%. While Québec performed exclusively hospital-based OFCs, after controlling for the population, the number of OFCs per 100,000 residents annually were similar to Ontario at 50 and 49 OFCs, respectively. The number of OFCs varied across the regions studied with an annual rate reaching up to 156 OFCs per 100,000 residents in urban regions and as low as 0.1 in regions furthest from city centers. Conclusion OFC utilization has steadily increased over the last decade. There has been marked geographical discrepancies in OFC utilization which could be driven by the location of allergists and heterogeneity in their practices. More research is needed to identify barriers and propose solutions to them.",

A cost minimization analysis evaluated the economic implications of the use of the ragweed SLIT-tablet vs SCIT in Canadian children with ragweed ARC.A cost minimization analysis was conducted comparing the short ragweed SLIT-tablet, 12 Amb a 1-U, preseasonally with preseasonal ragweed SCIT, annual ragweed SCIT, or MRPATA. The analysis was conducted over a time horizon of 3 years from a public payer perspective in Ontario and Quebec. Resources and costs associated with medication and services of healthcare professionals were considered for each treatment. The resource and cost input values for the model were obtained from published literature and validated by Canadian clinical experts in active allergy practice. A discount rate of 1.5% was applied. Several scenario analyses were conducted to determine the impact of many of the key base case assumptions on the outcomes.Over the total 3-year time horizon, the ragweed SLIT-tablet had a potential cost savings of $900.14 in Ontario and $1023.14 in Quebec when compared with preseasonal ragweed SCIT, of $6613.22 in Ontario and $8750.64 in Quebec when compared with annual ragweed SCIT, and $79.62 in Ontario and $429.49 in Quebec when compared with MRPATA. The ragweed SLIT-tablet had higher drug costs compared with the other AIT options, but lower costs for healthcare professional services. The lower costs for healthcare professional services with the ragweed SLIT-tablet were driven by the need for fewer office visits than SCIT. Scenario analysis indicated that costs were most impacted by including societal costs (e.g., costs associated with patient/caregiver travel and time lost). The potential cost savings of the ragweed SLIT-tablet versus SCIT and MRPATA was maintained in most scenarios.In this cost minimization analysis, the ragweed SLIT-tablet provided estimated cost savings from a public payer perspective for the treatment of ragweed ARC in Canadian children compared with SCIT or MRPATA.",

As chromatin regulators (CRs) influence the progression of multiple diseases through epigenetic mechanisms, we aimed to study the role of CRs in patients with severe asthma. Transcriptome data (GSE143303) from 47 patients with severe asthma and 13 healthy participants was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Enrichment analysis was performed to investigate the functions of differentially expressed CRs between the groups. We identified 80 differentially expressed CRs; they were mainly enriched in histone modification, chromatin organization, and lysine degradation. A protein-protein interaction network was then constructed. The analyzed immune scores were different between sick and healthy individuals. Thus, CRs with a high correlation in the immune analysis, SMARCC1, SETD2, KMT2B, and CHD8, were used to construct a nomogram model. Finally, using online prediction tools, we determined that lanatoside C, cefepime, and methapyrilene may be potentially effective drugs in the treatment of severe asthma. The nomogram constructed using the four CRs, SMARCC1, SETD2, KMT2B, and CHD8, may be a useful tool for predicting the prognosis of patients with severe asthma. This study provided new insights into the role of CRs in severe asthma.",

Yet, teachers have variable food allergy-related knowledge. Objective We aimed to identify how Winnipeg-based elementary school teachers manage food allergy and prevent food-triggered allergic reactions in their classrooms and schools. Methods Kindergarten-Grade 6 public and private school teachers, from Winnipeg, Canada, were interviewed virtually upon providing written informed consent. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. The study followed a pragmatic framework. Data were analysed via thematic analysis by multiple researchers. Results We interviewed 16 teachers, who primarily identified as female (87.5%). Most teachers worked in public schools (87.5%) and, on average, had 5.8 years of teaching experience. We identified four themes within the data. Most teachers (68.9%) had direct or indirect experience with food allergy. Theme 1 described the minimal standardization and inconsistent enforcement of food allergy policies between and within schools. Teachers also had varied food allergy knowledge. Theme 2 reflected teachers’ variable confidence/perceived knowledge towards food allergy management, including feeling of stress and anxiety. Theme 3 captured the lack of standardized food allergy education for teachers, and concerns about the adequacy of the current provincial program. Theme 4 described how teachers spoke of relying on other school staff, families and students to have effective communication. Conclusion Teachers’ food allergy management was informed by their knowledge and lived experience, guided by their school policies and individualized students’ needs. Teachers identified gaps in knowledge and communication, and desired more training and resources.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Allergy to chicken egg protein is a common form of food allergy. The most common clinical presentation includes gastrointestinal, skin, and respiratory symptoms. Differential diagnosis, including provocative tests, is critical in diagnosis. Case description We present a case of a 21-year-old patient with egg allergy, who underwent a double-blind food provocation test with placebo (evaluating subjective complaints from the gastrointestinal tract) and a titrated nasal provocation test using dry chicken egg content. We assessed the response of the nasal mucosa in the provocation test using the visual analogue scale (VAS), acoustic and optical rhinometry, as well as measurements of nitric oxide concentration in the exhaled air. During the provocation test, we measured the changes in the transverse section of the nasal passages, which were accompanied by subjective complaints measured with the VAS scale, using objective techniques. In the nasal provocation test with a dose of 20 µg of chicken egg protein, we observed an increase in the reactivity of the nasal mucosa and a decrease in the level of nitric oxide in the exhaled air from the upper airways (920 ppb before the provocation test and up to 867 ppb during the early stage of the allergic reaction). During the provocation tests, we recorded typical symptoms associated with the early stage of the allergic reaction; including nasal obstruction (1.2 cm), leakage of watery discharge (0.8 cm) in the food test, and itchy nose (1.1 cm) in the food test vs. the nasal test: 4.6, 2.8, and 3.5 cm, respectively. Conclusions The nasal mucosa provides convenient conditions for evaluation of the severity of allergy to common food allergens, including chicken egg allergens.",

    "abstract": "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the most commonly used classes of medications, and are among the leading causes of drug hypersensitivity. NSAIDs hypersensitivity reactions are classified by symptom involvement and NSAIDs subclass cross-reactivity. Reactions varying from cutaneous involvement to respiratory symptoms can be triggered by multiple NSAIDs subclasses. Anaphylaxis, while rare, can be induced by a single NSAID, with tolerability of other structurally unrelated subclasses. Reactions that fall outside of these traditional categories are deemed \"blended reactions\". We report a unique case of possible anaphylaxis to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and ibuprofen, two structurally dissimilar NSAIDs, indicating a severe blended reaction outside of the typical NSAIDs hypersensitivity reaction categories.An otherwise healthy 45 year old woman was referred to the Allergy and Immunology clinic after developing acute onset dyspnea, lip swelling, and generalized urticaria with ibuprofen use requiring treatment with intramuscular epinephrine in the emergency department. She previously tolerated ibuprofen, naproxen, and acetaminophen and had no history of urticaria, angioedema, asthma, or nasal polyps. She underwent an oral challenge to ASA whereby she developed urticaria and throat irritation with rebound symptoms requiring 2 doses of intramuscular epinephrine. On subsequent visits she passed treatment dose acetaminophen and celecoxib challenges. She was counseled to avoid all other NSAIDs and ASA desensitization was offered should this medication be clinically indicated in the future.NSAIDs hypersensitivity reactions can be triggered by individual NSAIDs with tolerance of other subclasses or by multiple structurally unrelated NSAIDs due to COX-1 inhibition. Determining the type of reaction (NERD, NECD, NIUA, SNIUAA, or SNIDHR) allows for appropriate oral challenges and safe alternative therapy recommendations. However, not all clinical reactions fit perfectly into these categories. Patients may also develop blended reactions. Our case highlights a severe blended reaction to multiple unrelated NSAIDs, including likely anaphylaxis to ASA. We note the utility of drug provocation tests (DPTs) to identify safe alternative medication options, as well as the importance of performing DPTs in settings properly equipped to assess and manage severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis.",

APDS1 has a spectrum of clinical manifestations. Recurrent respiratory infections, lymphoproliferation, hepatosplenomegaly, hyper-IgM syndrome and autoimmunity are the common symptoms of this disease. Case Presentation Patient 1 presented with recurrent respiratory infections, hepatosplenomegaly and hyper-IgM syndrome. Patient 2 developed early onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like disease with resistant thrombocytopenia. c.3061 G &gt; A and c.2314G &gt; A variants in the PIK3CD gene were detected by whole exome sequencing in two patients respectively. c.2314G &gt; A variant in PIK3CD gene of patient 2 is a newly report. After genetic diagnosis, two patients received sirolimus treatment and sirolimus alleviated clinical manifestations, including hepatosplenomegaly in patient 1 and thrombocytopenia in patient 2. Conclusion Genetics diagnosis should be considered in patients with complicated clinical manifestations with no or insufficient response to the conventional therapies. If whole exome sequencing suggests a variant in PIK3CD gene, sirolimus may relieve hepatosplenomegaly and resistant thrombocytopenia. This is the first report of c.2314G &gt; A variant in PIK3CD gene.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Although numerous studies have suggested a negative correlation between Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori ) infection and allergies, there has been limited research on the relationship between H. pylori infections and atopic dermatitis (AD). The present study aimed to investigate the effects of H. pylori infection in an AD mouse model and identify potential mechanisms related to type 2 immunity, skin barrier defects, and pruritus. Methods A model of AD-like symptoms was established with 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) after infection of the gastric cavity with H. pylori . Analysis of the expression of key inflammatory cytokines and serum levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE) was based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of filaggrin (FLG) and loricrin (LOR) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry staining. The evaluation of STAT1, STAT3, phosphorylated STAT1 (phospho-STAT1), and phosphorylated STAT3 (phospho-STAT1) expression levels in skin lesions was performed using western blot. Results The present study showed that the H. pylori -positive AD group (HP+AD+) exhibited milder skin lesions, including erythema, erosion, swelling, and scaling, than the H. pylori -negative AD group (HP−AD+). Additionally, HP+AD+ displayed lower levels of IgE in serum, and downregulated expression of interleukins 4 and 31 (IL-4 and IL-31) in serum. Furthermore, HP+AD+ demonstrated higher expression of filaggrin and loricrin than HP−AD+. Notably, H. pylori significantly reduced the amount of phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT3. Conclusion Helicobacter pylori infection negatively regulates the inflammatory response by affecting inflammatory factors in the immune response, and repairs the defective epidermal barrier function. In addition, H. pylori infection may reduce IL-31, thereby alleviating pruritus. These effects may be associated with the inhibition of JAK–STAT signaling activation.",

    "abstract": "Background A custom digital imagery method for real time identification and counting of pollen was qualitatively evaluated in the Environmental Exposure Unit (EEU). Methods Airborne grass pollen was collected in the EEU via a Rotorod ® impact sampler. The pollen grains on each sampling rod were counted using both traditional and headsup microscopy. The heads-up technique incorporated a microscope camera to create an on-screen image of the sampling rod. Firstly, unique images were created by manually advancing the stage, without duplicating previously captured pollen grains. Well-defined, sharp images were obtained by fine focus and zoom combinations to enhance certainty and recognition speed. Secondly, using a custom application, each pollen grain was identified and counted on-screen by “point and click” or “screen touch”, simultaneously counting and permanently anchoring opaque dots to the pollen grain locations. Counts were stored in real time on a central database. Results Increased clarity of the polle ng rains resulted in higher counting accuracy. Duplicate counting of pollen grains was eliminated by digitally labelling counted grains. Additional need for manual counting devices, commonly associated with mechanical and human errors, was eliminated. Error free counts can be obtained with increased speed, therefore, improving the overall efficiency of the process and the EEU system as a whole. Conclusions This validated heads-up counting technique will allow for an increased response time to changes in the EEU pollen levels. This advancement could also enhance pollen counting processes followed by others using direct microscopy pollen counting techniques.",

The medical history should indicate whether a patient's asthma began during a work period and whether the asthma worsens during work periods or improves on days when the patient is off work or on holidays. A suspicion of sensitizer-induced occupational asthma will increase if the patient was exposed to a recognized respiratory sensitizer in the workplace at the time of the onset of symptoms or if the patient had associated symptoms of allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis. A history of accidental high respiratory irritant exposure shortly before the initial onset of symptoms would raise the possibility of irritant-induced occupational asthma. Although such features of the history are sensitive indicators of occupational asthma, they are not specific and should therefore be followed by further investigations to confirm the diagnosis of asthma and its relation to the workplace exposure. The earlier the diagnosis is suspected and investigated, the better the outcome is likely to be for the patient.",

We investigated the association between any secondhand smoke exposure in early life and childhood asthma development. Methods In the Toronto Child Health Evaluation Questionnaire, parents of 5619 grades 1-2 students reported age of physician-diagnosed asthma development, exposure to maternal and household second-hand smoke during pregnancy and the first year of life, socio-demographic factors, and other early-life exposures such as mold and cockroach. Using Cox proportional hazard models, we evaluated the longitudinal associations between second-hand smoke exposure and age of asthma development. Results Household second-hand smoke exposure prevalence was 8.3% during pregnancy and 10.6% in the first year of life; 15.5% of children developed asthma. After adjusting for sex, prematurity, being born in Canada and maternal asthma, children exposed to home second-hand smoke during pregnancy were more likely to develop asthma and developed asthma sooner [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.09, 1.70], even after excluding children whose mothers smoked in pregnancy (HR 1.53, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.14). The association strengthened (HR 1.88, 95% CI: 1.16, 3.02) after adjusting for home second-hand smoke exposure in the first year. Conclusions Home second-hand smoke exposure during pregnancy is associated with an increased hazard of childhood asthma development, even if the mother is not a smoker.

The lowered wheal size persisted in some subjects up to 72 hrs. Even though the HPC did not appear to be suppressed at some times following antihistamine due to the cutoffs chosen, some allergens that were positive before antihistamines were clearly suppressed and scored a negative result even with positive HPC.

Despite the health impacts of peanut-induced anaphylaxis (PIA), relatively little is known about immune mechanisms underlying the disease. Using a mouse model of PIA, we evaluated mice with deletions in four distinct immune molecules (IL7Rα, L-selectin, CD34, CD103), for perturbed responses. Methods PIA was induced by intragastric sensitization with peanut antigen and cholera toxin adjuvant, followed by intraperitoneal challenge with crude peanut extract (CPE). Disease outcome was assessed by monitoring body temperature, clinical symptoms, and serum histamine levels. Resistant mice were evaluated for total and antigen specific serum IgE, as well as susceptibility to passive systemic anaphylaxis. Results PIA responses were dramatically reduced in IL7Rα −/− and L-selectin −/− mice, despite normal peanut-specific IgE production and susceptibility to passive systemic anaphylaxis. In contrast, CD34 −/− and CD103 −/− mice exhibited robust PIA responses, indistinguishable from wild type controls. Conclusions Loss of L-selectin or IL7Rα function is sufficient to impair PIA, while CD34 or CD103 ablation has no effect on disease severity. More broadly, our findings suggest that future food allergy interventions should focus on disrupting sensitization to food allergens and limiting antigen-specific late-phase responses. Conversely, therapies targeting immune cell migration following antigen challenge are unlikely to have significant benefits, particularly considering the rapid kinetics of PIA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Little is known about the distribution of lymphocyte phenotypes in young children and the association specific phenotypes may have with respiratory illnesses. The objective of this study was to describe lymphocyte distributions in children at approximately 2 years of age and to test for associations with the frequency of respiratory illness during the first 2 years of life. We hypothesized that an increased frequency of illness would be associated with those phenotypes that reflect previous antigen exposure and/or immune activation. Seventy-three children were followed during their first 2 years of life with daily symptom diaries and twice-monthly telephone calls to ascertain the incidence of respiratory illness. After the children reached 2 years of age, the phenotypes of circulating blood lymphocytes were measured by flow cytometry. Associations between illness and phenotypes were adjusted for education level of parents; hours per week in day care; hours per week exposed to environmental tobacco smoke, mould, or water damage in bedroom; and parental history of allergy and asthma. The resulting median lymphocyte count was 4.0 × 10 9 per litre (standard deviation, 1.3) with a CD4/CD8 count of 2.28, consistent with published values. Illness rates were positively associated with the percentage of CD8+ CD38+ T cells (unadjusted p = .03, adjusted p = .014), CD8+ CD45RO+ T cells (unadjusted p = .06, adjusted p = .036), and CD4+ CD45RO+ T cells (unadjusted p = .01, adjusted p = .005). Our conclusions is that there is an association between the distribution of lymphocyte phenotypes and the incidence of respiratory illness early in life. Future research is recommended to determine the directionality of this association.",

We analyze the effect of prenatal exposure to stress during late gestation in mice. Materials and methods BALB/c mice were exposed to sound stress during late gestation. Maternal serum and placentas were analyzed. Fetal development was scored. Allergic asthma was induced in the offspring by using an ovalbumin protocol. We analyzed immune cells in lungs, bronchioalveolar fluid (BAL) and lung-draining lymph nodes as well as cytokine concentrations in the BAL. Further, stress-challenged pregnant females were treated with a progesterone derivative, followed by fetal analyses and evaluation of the vulnerability towards asthma in the offspring. Results Stress challenge resulted in decreased serum levels of maternal progesterone and testosterone, and increased serum levels of estradiol associated with placental endocrine dysfunction, such as low expression of proliferin. Fetal development was impaired upon stress challenge, especially in females. Prenatally stressed female adult offspring revealed an increased susceptibility toward asthma, mirrored by an increased airway response, influx of inflammatory cells and increased T helper 2 cytokines in the BAL. Further, we observed decreased frequencies of regulatory T cells (CD3 + CD4 + CD25 + foxP3 +) . Progesterone supplementation abrogated the impaired intrauterine development as well as the susceptibility toward asthma. Conclusions Our study revealed that prenatal stress severely interferes with the intrauterine development, resulting in offspring with an increased vulnerability toward asthma-like symptoms. Supplementation of progesterone during stress-challenged pregnancies abrogates gender-dependently the increased susceptibility toward asthma.",

    "abstract": "Background Herditary Angioedema (HAE) is a rare disorder (1:10,000 – 1:50,000) characterized by episodic, localized edema of skin or mucosa of airway, genitourinary tract or gastrointestinal tract. It is due to inherited deficiency of the serpin known as C1 Inhibitor leading to unopposed kallikrein, producing excess bradykinin which binds to G-protein coupled receptors known as B1 and B2 receptors. Icatabant, a ten amino acid peptide analogue of bradykinin is an effective blocker of the B2 receptor and has been shown to provide rapid and complete relief of symptoms compared to Tranexamic acid (Fast1) or placebo (Fast-2). Rapid relief of laryngeal edema was confirmed in the open label arm. A new trial (Fast3) has begun. Primary Objective are to compare icatibant vs placebo on the time to symptom relief using a 3 symptom Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score during moderate to very severe acute cutaneous and/or abdominal attacks in patients with type I or type II hereditary angioedema (HAE). Secondary Objectives are to compare the global outcome following treatment with icatibant vs placebo using patient-reported (single symptom and 8 symptom composite score) and physician-reported outcome measures at 4 and 8 hours; to compare the time to almost complete symptom relief following treatment with icatibant vs placebo during moderate to very severe acute cutaneous and/or abdominal attacks; to assess safety and tolerability of icatibant vs placebo; and to assess the efficacy and safety of open-label icatibant treatment in patients experiencing laryngeal edema attacks. 88 patients, aged 18 or older, with an attack of at least moderate severity os skin, abdomen or larynx/ pharynx will be randomized to double-blind treatment with either 30 mg of Icatabant SC or placebo.",

    "abstract": "Objective/purpose Asthma is the most common chronic respiratory disease in children. Asthma exacerbation occurs when the airways acutely become obstructed, usually the result of airway inflammation. The Inflammation is caused by a unique mix of cells, and includes eosinophils. The majority of asthma exacerbations occur after a viral infection such as a common cold. Why asthmatic children develop such severe reactions to viruses is unclear. Our previous work suggests asthmatic patients develop severe airway obstruction because they have too many eosinophils in their airways before virus infection. The virus triggers these eosinophils to release harmful mediators and cause airway damage. We believe that in humans, it may be the mere presence of virus antigen that stimulates memory cells to activate the eosinophils. We hypothesize that memory T cell proliferation and eosinophil activation will occur in response to any airway virus for which immune memory exists, and that removal of the eosinophils will prevent airway hyperreactivity (AHR). In addition, we believe that this model is representative of virus-induced asthma exacerbation. As part of our project to develop non-invasive diagnostics using the metabolomic profile of urine through Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we are saving the urine samples from these animals. We hypothesize that there will be relevant differences between the urine profiles of each animal group, which will be applicable to humans.",

    "abstract": "Objective/purpose Pediatric asthma has risen over recent decades in developed countries, affecting almost 10% of children. Canada ranks near the top of the list of countries with high rates of asthma and allergic diseases. Predicting which children will develop asthma remains a challenge, but both higher weight and stress may play a role. An association between obesity and asthma has been reported in previous studies among adolescents and school-age children; this connection is more apparent in girls. Children exposed to maternal stress in early life are more likely to develop asthma. If the stress exposure becomes chronic and the body is unable to respond appropriately, allostatic load/overload (AL) can develop. AL is defined as the physical price paid by the body under chronic stress. To our knowledge, the impact of AL on the development of asthma in pre-adolescents has not been investigated. The overall aim of this research is to determine the influence of AL on the development of asthma. We hypothesize that (1) exposure to AL increases the risk of developing asthma in pre-adolescence, and (2) the contribution of each AL measure is not equal in predicting the development of asthma.",

Ambient particles and ozone are major constituents of urban air pollution and contribute to asthma exacerbations. However, the mechanisms underlying the exacerbation of allergic airways disease by air pollution remain to be elucidated. There is evidence that arginase expression is augmented in cigarette smoking asthmatics.

    "abstract": "Mediators pre-stored in neutrophil azurophilic granules are central to the acute inflammatory response and tissue degradation and damage through their proteolytic activity. Different granule populations mobilize and release their content via distinct and hierarchical molecular mechanisms. The molecular mechanisms by which mediators pre-stored in azurophilic granules are mobilized and released to the extracellular space remain largely unknown. We used a number of complementary techniques including; confocal laser scanning microscopy, subcellular fractionation, flow cytometric analyses, Western blot analyses and electron microscopy to examine the ultrastructural and molecular nature of mediator release in neutrophil azurophilic granules. We found that following IL-8 activation, neutrophil azurophilic granules undergo piecemeal degranulation (selective mediator release) leading to altered granule content. Piecemeal degranulation of azurophilic granules is characterized by budding of small secretory vesicles and consequent reduction in granule density. Furthermore, budding of small secretory vesicles and selective mediator mobilization and release from azurophilic granules is associated with reduced localization of CD63, Hck and b-arrestin-1 to granule membranes and also cell surface upregulation of these molecules. Our study is first to identify piecemeal degranulation as a potential underlying mechanism of mediator release from neutrophil azurophilic granules and supports the involvement of CD63, Hck, and b-arrestin-1 in this process.",

    "abstract": "Eight to 10% of children in Sweden have asthma. The majority of these children are followed and treated in primary health care centers (PHCs). Many studies show poor compliance to written guidelines [1,2]. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether or not the method of interactive case-based education [3] combined with audit/feedback [4], leads to a better quality of care for children with asthma, according to quality indicators from Local Practice Guidelines (LPG) [5]. We collected data from children aged 6 months to 16 years with asthma, obstructive bronchitis or cough, attending 14 PHCs in northern Stockholm. Medical records of 20 children diagnosed with asthma were randomly selected in each PHC. Medical records of 20 children diagnosed with obstructive bronchitis or cough were also included to evaluate if these children fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of asthma. A questionnaire was addressed to general practitioners (GPs) and nurses regarding knowledge and competence in asthma management, educational needs and interest, and current equipment and routines at their PHC. The 14 PHCs were matched by pairs. Seven PHCs received the educational intervention, while 7 PHCs had this intervention only after completion of the study. Medical records were scrutinized in order to identify the following quality indicators: diagnosis on the basis of the criteria delineated in the LPGs: performance of spirometry, assessing exposure to tobacco smoke, prescription of inhaled corticosteroids, patient education and routine follow-up. The second evaluation of the medical records and questionnaire were scheduled six months after the intervention, to allow time to change behaviour. GPs and nurses from the intervention group participated in three interactive educational meetings [3] led by an allergologist and a nurse. The first two meetings used case-based learning approaches, focusing on the specific needs of each PHC and the third meeting was based on audit/ feedback [4] to discuss the results obtained and address the problems identified in the first analysis of data from the participating PHCs. Preliminary baseline data reveals that 50% of children with asthma from school age are treated with inhaled corticosteroids, prescribed by the GPs. Few patients had a spirometry test and few had received asthma education. Exposure to tobacco smoke was rarely discussed. Most children had only one visit to the PHC. Fifty per cent of the children had a planned follow-up, usually by referral to the local paediatric outpatient clinic. Twenty per cent of the preschool children had under-diagnosed asthma. This initial analysis shows that there are many care gaps in children’s asthma management, and that educational interventions have the potential to help address these gaps.",

    "abstract": "Low doses of inhaled corticosteroids control more asthma outcomes to a greater extent than any other asthma therapy in the vast majority of patients and all international guidelines now recommend inhaled corticosteroids as first line treatment in all children who require regular controller therapy for asthma. This paradigm shift in asthma management is based on solid evidence from several controlled trials. Whenever these guideline recommendations are implemented and followed health-care statistics improve markedly in the society. However, several studies have found that often the guideline recommendations are not being followed. There are several reasons for this, including concerns about the safety of long-term use of these agents, particularly in children. These concerns mainly stem from the findings in short-term studies assessing the effects of inhaled corticosteroids on lower leg growth rate or the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis or markers of bone formation and degradation. However, the clinical relevance of findings in such studies for long-term treatment is unknown and uncertainty exists regarding the predictive value of changes in cortisol levels and clinically relevant changes in long-term growth or bone density.\r\n\r\nA recent review on the long-term safety of ICS found that there was some evidence of a small decrease in statural growth rate during the beginning of inhaled corticosteroid therapy. This effect was more marked at daily doses above 200 µg and did not apply to all treatment regimens. Studies examining final attained adult height found no difference between patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids and those receives non-steroidal therapy. None of the studies investigating effects on bone mineral density found any adverse effects of inhaled corticosteroid therapy. Finally, recommended doses of inhaled corticosteroids generally had little or no effect on plasma or urine cortisol levels versus non-steroidal therapy. In contrast, use of short courses of oral steroids (which is common practice in many countries) has been found to increase the risk of fracture in children. The review concluded that recommended doses of inhaled corticosteroids can be administered to children for the long-term management of asthma with minimal risk of clinically relevant adverse effects. This conclusion is supported findings in a study on peak bone mineral density and risk of fracture in 275 ICS treated patients and 161 healthy siblings. The asthma patients had been treated with ICS for 2-22 years (mean 13.7 years) at a mean daily dose of 350 µg ICS. In adulthood there was no statistically significant difference between BMD Z-score in ICS treated children (mean Z-score 0.29) and the z-score of their healthy siblings (mean Z-score = 0.34). Moreover, in the asthma group no statistically significant difference was seen between BMD Z –score at study entry (-0.10) and in adulthood (+0.04).",

This report describes a 3-year old boy who developed a serum sickness-like reaction after receiving a course of meropenem. Materials and methods Laboratory investigations supporting a diagnosis of serum sickness-like reaction were performed. Results A 3 year old with a history of prematurity was treated with intravenous meropenem and vancomycin for a ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection and brain abscess. He developed fever, bilateral knee swelling and an erythematous maculopapular rash to his trunk and extremities on day 14 of meropenem and day 27 of vancomycin. During this time, he had elevated creatinine and C reactive protein, as well as eosinophilia and hematuria. Septic workup was negative, as were tests for autoimmunity. He also developed transient coagulopathy and pancytopenia, felt to be adverse effects of the antibiotics. He was eventually treated with 3 days of intravenous methylprednisolone, and his symptoms improved soon after. The total duration of serum sickness-like symptoms was about 2 weeks. Conclusions",

According to the guidelines of the Global Initiative for Asthma, omalizumab is an add-on drug at treatment step 5 that is used for severe asthma patients who are allergic to perennial allergens. The effects of omalizumab for severe asthma therapy have been validated in multiple clinical studies. However, the long-term effects of omalizumab on IgE production and possibility of resetting of administration dose of omalizumab remain unknown.The serum total and free IgE levels were measured over time in a 63-year-old female patient with allergic asthma who was administered 375 mg omalizumab biweekly for 36 months. Her symptoms did not worsen and clinical course remained favorable after reducing the dose to 375 mg per month. The serum free IgE levels temporarily increased following a dose reduction of omalizumab. The serum free IgE trough level temporarily increased at 4 weeks after capable to reduce the dosage; however, thereafter, the serum free IgE level decreased to desired levels (below 30 ng/mL).The present case shows the possibility of reducing the dose following the long-term use of omalizumab. Considering the high medical cost of omalizumab, the dose reduction may be a viable option. It may be useful to measure the serum free IgE level to appropriately identify patients in whom the dose can be reduced, and to carefully monitor the clinical course.",

A structured educational intervention for patients with insect sting allergy has not been implemented so far. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of a structured 90-min educational intervention for patients with insect sting allergy. Methods Patients with an insect venom allergy were offered to participate in a structured 90-min group education (intervention group (IG)) or to attend a control group (CG). The patients’ subjective self-assurance in using the emergency medication, the willingness to always carry the emergency medication, the mental health status, absolute one-time willingness-to-pay (WTP) for complete cure, a disease knowledge assessment and a simulation test to examine the ability to manage an acute sting reaction were estimated at baseline (t0) and at follow-up (t1) as outcome parameters. Results 55 patients participated in the IG (n = 25, 52.0% female, mean age 55.9 years) or the CG (n = 30, 56.7% female, mean age 52.0 years). Both arms showed a significant gain in self-assurance in using the emergency medication (IG: 6.1 at t0 vs. 8.6 at t1, p &lt; 0.0001 and CG: 7.1 vs. 8.0, p = 0.0062) and ability to manage an acute sting reaction (IG: 6.7 vs. 11.4, p &lt; 0.0001 and CG: 9.0 vs. 10.5, p = 0.0002) at t1. However, trained participants showed a significantly higher gain in the respective parameters. There were no significant changes regarding the remaining examined outcome parameters. Conclusions Patients who are willing to invest 90 min in a patient education intervention benefit significantly by an increased subjective and objective empowerment to manage an acute sting reaction.",

This study was performed in subjects with mild persistent asthma, aiming to find predictors for developing EIBa. Methods In 20 subjects with mild asthma, measurements of baseline functional respiratory parameters and airways responsiveness by a methacholine challenge were obtained on the first day. A maximal, symptom-limited incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPExT) was performed the day after, with subsequent, repeated maneuvers of maximal full forced expiration to monitor the FEV 1 change at 1,3,5,7,10 and 15 min after the end of the exercise. Results 19 subjects completed the two-days protocol. No functional parameters both at rest and during effort were useful to predict EIBa after stopping exercise. In asthmatics with EIBa, mean Inspiratory Capacity (IC) did not increase with increasing ventilatory requirements during CPExT because 6 of them (50%) displayed dynamic pulmonary hyperinflation (DH), as documented by their progressive increase of end-expiratory lung volume. This subgroup, showing earlier post-exercise FEV 1 fall, had significantly lower forced mean expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of forced vital capacity (FEF 25-75% ) at rest (p &lt; 0.05) and higher airways responsiveness, expressed as PD 20 FEV 1 (p &lt; 0.05) as compared with other asthmatics with EIBa. Conclusions No functional respiratory parameters seem to predict EIBa in mild asthmatics. However, in those with EIBa, a subgroup developed DH during exercise, and this was associated with a baseline reduced forced expiratory flow rates at lower lung volumes and higher airway hyperresponsiveness, suggesting a prominent small airways impairment.",

The aim of this study was to identify cohorts of patients with HAE-1/2 by evaluating structured and unstructured data in a US ambulatory electronic medical record (EMR) database. Methods A retrospective feasibility study was performed using the GE Centricity EMR Database (2006–2017). Patients with ≥ 1 diagnosis code for HAE-1/2 (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification 277.6 or International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification D84.1) and/or ≥ 1 physician note regarding HAE-1/2 and ≥ 6 months’ data before and after the earliest code or note (index date) were included. Two mutually exclusive cohorts were created: probable HAE (≥ 2 codes or ≥ 2 notes on separate days) and suspected HAE (only 1 code or note). The impact of manually reviewing physician notes on cohort formation was assessed, and demographic and clinical characteristics of the 2 final cohorts were described. Results Initially, 1691 patients were identified: 190 and 1501 in the probable and suspected HAE cohorts, respectively. After physician note review, the confirmed HAE cohort comprised 254 patients and the suspected HAE cohort decreased to 1299 patients; 138 patients were determined not to have HAE and were excluded. The overall false-positive rate for the initial algorithms was 8.2%. Across final cohorts, the median age was 50 years and &gt; 60% of patients were female. HAE-specific prescriptions were identified for 31% and 2% of the confirmed and suspected HAE cohorts, respectively. Conclusions Unstructured EMR data can provide valuable information for identifying patients with HAE-1/2. Further research is needed to develop algorithms for more representative HAE cohorts in retrospective studies.",

Multivariable logistic regression models were used to test predictors of prescription primary adherence. Results Of 13,220 prescriptions for obstructive airway disease, 75.9% (N = 10,038) were filled. In multivariate analysis, depression, certain age groups (18–44 years), higher income quartile were associated with reduced prescription adherence. However, 1–2 ER visits in the previous year (compared to no ER visits), number of ambulatory visits in the previous year, and number of hospitalizations in the previous year, did not increase the likelihood of prescription adherence.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Lymphocytic esophagitis is a newly recognized entity of unknown origin. Dysphagia is defined as difficulty swallowing and represents a common symptom in the general population with a prevalence of approximately 20%. Chronic inflammation of the esophageal wall may manifest itself clinically and endoscopically, mimicking inflammation of another origin. However, little is known about the pathogenesis of the disease, as patients are seldom suspected and rarely diagnosed with lymphocytic esophagitis. Case presentation Here, we present a rare case of lymphocytic esophagitis in a patient with multiple allergies and suspected eosinophilic esophagitis. A 28-year-old woman with polyvalent sensitization to food and inhalant allergens presented with intermittent dysphagia, a sensation of a foreign body in the throat, itchiness of the oral cavity after ingesting certain foods, heartburn, and prolonged chewing time. A skin prick test showed positive results for birch-tree, alder, hazel, and rye pollen, as well as house dust mites. Apart from obesity (BMI 30 kg/m 2 ), multiple pustules and excoriations on the skin, her physical examination was insignificant. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed revealing full-length but discrete trachealization of the esophagus. A barium swallow test showed slowing of esophageal peristalsis in the recumbent position. No esophageal pathology was observed. A histopathological analysis of mucosal samples revealed slight hyperplasia of the basal layer of the esophagus, and the stomach showed changes typical of chronic gastritis. Conclusions In summary, this clinical case illustrates that lymphocytic esophagitis, as a newly recognized entity, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chronic dysphagia. Additionally, when treating allergic patients, clinicians should be aware that lymphocytic esophagitis, distinct from eosinophilic esophagitis, should be considered in the diagnosis of patients with atopy and upper gastrointestinal symptoms.",

Histobulin™ is a histamine/immunoglobulin complex that has been approved for allergic rhinitis, bronchial asthma and chronic urticaria in some countries. Not only has the immunoglobulin/histamine complex been reported to be effective in allergic diseases, including chronic urticaria, but recently, the possibility of remission induction in chronic urticaria by the immunoglobulin/histamine complex has been reported.Histobulin™ was administered until remission was induced instead of fixing the number of administrations in four cases of chronic urticaria. Two patients showed an early response and finished treatment with 12 injections of Histobulin™, and the other two patients showed a late response and were injected 43 and 46 times. Remission was induced successfully in all four cases.Histobulin™ is not only effective but also induces remission in CSU. The Histobulin™ therapy protocol in CSU may be better if the treatment is continued until remission is achieved. Based on the responses of the patients, early responders and late responders were present. The progression of the disease during treatment consisted of a slow improvement phase and a rapid improvement phase. Uniquely, the appropriate allergy laboratory results, including blood eosinophil fraction, total IgE and eosinophil cationic protein level, were normal in all 4 cases. Further studies concerning the mechanisms of Histobulin™ may be needed.",

If C1-INH and/or C4 are significant acute phase reactants, their levels may be falsely \"normal\" in patients with HAE when measured during times of infection or inflammation resulting in missed or delayed diagnosis.We present a case series of four HAE patients who had C4, C1-INH, c-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin measured at baseline and again during a self-reported upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) or flu-like illness. We did not identify any HAE patients who had a significant change in their C1-INH functional level in the context of a mild infection.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Periplaneta americana and Blattella germanica cockroaches are widespread, and risk of sensitization increases in urban environments where these roaches thrive as household pests. There are no prior reports of Blaptica dubia cockroach allergy, though human exposure to B. dubia is increasing through commercial breeding as feeder insects. Case presentation A 50-year-old B. dubia cockroach breeder presented with progressively worsening upper and lower respiratory symptoms in recent years. Symptoms were worse with exposure to her B. dubia roach colony. Skin prick testing (SPT) to B. dubia cast skin, internal organs, and feces was performed in both the subject and a human control. Testing for P. americana and B. germanica sensitization was also performed in the subject . SDS–Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), immunoblots, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) studies were performed using the subject and control serums to explore for specific IgE binding to B. dubia as well as P. americana. Our results showed SPT was positive to B. dubia internal organs in the subject and negative in the control. In the subject, SPT was negative to P. americana though intradermal (ID) testing was positive and serum specific IgE (sIgE) testing was negative to B. germanica . Immunoblotting of the subject's serum to B. dubia internal organ extract showed several distinct bands of IgE binding at 47 kilodaltons (kD), 68 kD, 74 kD, 83 kD, and 118 kD. The strongest band was at 118 kD on B. dubia immunoblotting, which was absent in P. americana on SDS-PAGE. ELISA studies showed an increased IgE response to both B. dubia and P. americana in the subject versus the control. Conclusions This case confirmed the first reported allergy to B. dubia cockroaches. There may be cross-reactivity between B. dubia and P. americana , though our case suggests SPT and sIgE testing using P. americana and B. germanica extract has potential to miss a B. dubia cockroach allergy. This allergy is likely underreported, and further study is needed to explore the natural history of B. dubia cockroach allergy.",

    "abstract": ": Work-related asthma is asthma that is caused or exacerbated by exposures at work. It is the most common form of occupational lung disease in developed countries. It has important impacts on the health and well-being of the affected individual, as well as consequences for society because of unemployment issues and workers' compensation claims. With ongoing exposure, occupational asthma can result in persistent airway hyperresponsiveness and, possibly, permanent disability for the individual. Thus, it is important for the clinician to be able to diagnose this disorder as quickly and accurately as possible. The evaluation of a patient with work-related asthma can be extensive. It includes obtaining a consistent history, identifying the cause in the workplace, and confirming the diagnosis with objective tests. After a diagnosis has been made, treatment must sometimes go beyond the medications used for nonoccupational asthma and include interventions to minimize or completely remove the individual from exposure to the causal agent if he or she has sensitizer-induced occupational asthma. In addition, once an individual has been identified with occupational asthma, steps should be taken to prevent the development of this disorder in other workers. The purpose of this article is to review the current literature and provide the clinician with a stepwise approach to the diagnosis and management of a patient with work-related asthma.",

We describe the first case of Transplant Acquired Food Allergy (TAFA) to cow milk in an adult following LT from a donor dead because of anaphylactic shock. A 67-year-old woman with primary biliary cirrhosis was referred to the Transplant Center of our hospital because of an acute-on-chronic liver failure. The donor was a 15-year-old girl deceased for anoxic encephalopathy due to food induced anaphylaxis after eating a biscuit. In the donor’s history food allergies to cow milk and eggs were present. This case emphasizes the need for a standardized assessment of both solid-organ donors and recipients including donor allergy history in order to detect recipients at risk for anaphylaxis due to passive IgE transfer. Despite several reports of TAFA after solid organ, especially liver, an appropriate protocol to avoid risk for the recipient doesn’t exist at the moment. The SPT (skin prick test) or specific IgE level are not enough to ensure a correct management in these cases and a correct education of the patients and the medical staff involved is absolutely necessary. It is the first case of milk allergy sensitization after solid organ transplant by passive transfer of IgE.",

However, there is no consensus regarding the direct or inverse relationship between autoimmune and atopic diseases. Objective The aim of this scoping review was to examine the knowledge gap about the possibility of coexistence of asthma and type 1 diabetes and determine the prevalence of this association. Methods A scoping review was conducted, following the proposal of the Joanna Briggs Institute. The Population, Concept, and Context strategy was used to formulate the guiding question. The proposed question was: “What is the prevalence of asthma in people with T1DM?” After excluding duplicate articles, analyzing titles and abstracts, and excluding articles that did not answer the guiding question, 17 articles remained and were included in this review. Results Most of the articles selected conformed to the Th1/Th2 hypothesis, as the prevalence of asthma was lower in individuals with T1DM. However, similar or higher prevalence of asthma was found between cases and controls in few articles. Conclusion The prevalence of asthma in people with T1DM ranged from 1.7% to 23.1%. Maybe the mechanisms that characterizes the Th1/Th2 paradigm aren’t as simple as just the interaction of certain cytokines, since Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases and Th2- mediated atopy can coexist.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background A significant update was made to both the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) in 2019 and the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) asthma guidelines in 2020 for mild asthma. These groups no longer recommend short-acting beta-agonists (SABA) as monotherapy for mild (GINA) or mild-persistent (NHLBI) asthma. With the lag that can occur between guideline or evidence updates and changes in practice, this study sought to evaluate whether guideline adoption had occurred. Methods In this retrospective chart review, patient electronic medical records from a large healthcare system were evaluated from July 1 of 2021 to July 1 of 2022 to determine how many patients with mild asthma were prescribed as needed or daily inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in addition to as needed SABA. The secondary outcome was to evaluate the incidence of exacerbations in patients with mild asthma, comparing those on guideline-directed therapy or not. In addition, we evaluated other patient factors increasing exacerbation risk in mild asthma. Results For the primary outcome, of the 1,107 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 284 patients (26%) did not have documentation of guideline-directed therapy for mild asthma during the study period, while 823 (74%) were on guideline-directed therapy (Diff:48.7%; 95% CI:45.1 to 52.3%, p &lt; 0.001). For the secondary objective, 161 patients had an exacerbation (12% on guideline-directed therapy, 15.4% not on guideline-directed therapy). This difference in incidence of exacerbation between the two treatment groups was not statistically significant (Diff: -3.4%; 95% CI: -8 to 1.1%; p = 0.133). In addition, being female, having GERD, and being obese were all statistically significant factors associated with having asthma exacerbations among our patient population. Conclusions Nearly one-fourth of patients with mild persistent asthma were not on guideline-directed therapy, despite updates in asthma guidelines (GINA 2019, NHLBI 2020). Factors such as being female, having GERD, and being obese were all statistically significant factors associated with having asthma exacerbations among patients with mild persistent asthma.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs), also referred to as inborn errors of immunity, constitute a group of genetic conditions that affect the immune system. The current standard of care for patients with PIDs is lifelong immunoglobulin replacement therapy, delivered by intravenous (IVIG) or subcutaneous (SCIG) infusion. Immune globulin subcutaneous (human) 20% solution stabilized with glycine (Ig20Gly) is indicated as a replacement therapy for PIDs in adults and children of any age in Europe and in patients aged 2 years and above in the USA. Typically, Ig20Gly is administered using an infusion pump; however, delivery of Ig20Gly by manual administration has recently been approved in Europe. Practical recommendations on the use of Ig20Gly manual administration are lacking; this review therefore aims to provide guidance for use of this method of administration. Additionally, we summarize the infusion parameters, safety, patient-reported outcomes, and economic benefits associated with Ig20Gly manual administration. Manual administration of Ig20Gly was shown to permit faster rates of infusion than administration via infusion pump. Patients typically infused at two or fewer infusion sites with manual administration of Ig20Gly. Safety and tolerability profiles were similar for Ig20Gly manual administration and administration by infusion pump. Overall, there were comparable levels of patient satisfaction with manual administration and infusion pump, with patient preference deemed to be a key determinator of success for either method of administration. Economic studies identified cost savings for the healthcare system through manual administration compared with IVIG or SCIG infusion by infusion pump because of the reduced equipment costs and nurse support. For infusion of Ig20Gly by manual administration, a syringe and butterfly needle are used; patients are advised to start infusion at 1–2 mL/min to prevent discomfort. Overall, manual administration of Ig20Gly offers an effective and well-tolerated alternative to administration by infusion pump.",

This study assessed blood eosinophil count testing prevalence in patients with asthma by exacerbation frequency and healthcare provider (HCP) type. Methods This was a retrospective, longitudinal, real-world study (GSK ID: 214470) utilizing the Merative Explorys ® Universe electronic health records database. Eligible patients had ≥ 2 asthma diagnostic codes (January 2016–December 2018) (Index date: first asthma diagnosis). Outcomes included patient demographics and clinical characteristics (12 months pre-index [baseline]), and prevalence of blood eosinophil count testing, stratified by exacerbation frequency (infrequent exacerbations [&lt; 2]) or frequent exacerbations [≥ 2] or primary HCP (Allergist/Pulmonologist, a primary care physician [PCP] or other HCP) during the 12 months post-index (follow-up). Results Of 400,254 patients included (mean age: 51.2 years; 70.8% female), the most common provider type at baseline was a PCP (76.8%). A higher proportion of patients with frequent exacerbations had blood eosinophil count tests at baseline (55.4–69.5%) and follow-up (67.9–75.1%), compared with patients with infrequent exacerbations (55.5–63.7%, 62.4–67.3%). Significantly more patients in the Allergist/Pulmonologist subgroup had ≥ 1 blood eosinophil count test result compared with patients in the PCP subgroup at both baseline (59.9% vs. 50.7%; p &lt; 0.001) and follow-up (59.0% vs. 56.2%; p &lt; 0.001). In the total population, the mean (SD) number of tests ordered was 3.4 (5.3) and 4.1 (6.4) during the baseline and follow-up periods, respectively. A greater mean number of tests were ordered for patients with frequent exacerbations, most apparently in the Allergist/Pulmonologist subgroup during baseline and follow-up (7.4 vs. 4.9). For patients with frequent exacerbations and blood eosinophil count test results, the mean (SD) number of tests ranged from 3.1 (4.6) to 5.8 (8.3) at baseline and 5.1 (8.5) to 7.4 (10.6) during follow-up. Conclusions The prevalence of blood eosinophil count testing in patients with asthma remains suboptimal. Routine blood eosinophil count testing should be considered by HCPs for patients with asthma to increase identification of the eosinophilic asthma phenotype, which may inform the decision to advance to targeted biologic therapy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Peanut allergy is a common food allergy with potentially life-threatening implications. Early oral immunotherapy for peanut allergy (P-EOIT) has been shown to be effective and safe in research and specialty clinic settings. Provision of P-EOIT in primary care would make it available to more patients. We sought to assess the safety of P-EOIT in a primary care setting by documenting the rates of peanut-related allergic reactions leading to emergency department (ED) visits and use of epinephrine. We also examined adherence by assessing the percentage of patients reaching maintenance phase and continuing ingestion after one year of P-EOIT. Methods This retrospective study included all patients aged less than 36 months who started P-EOIT at a primary care allergy clinic in New Brunswick, Canada, from 2016 to 2020. The population included patients who (1) had a history of an allergic reaction to peanuts with a positive skin prick test or positive peanut specific IgE level (ps-IgE) or (2) no history of ingestion and a baseline ps-IgE ≥5 kU/L. Patients had biweekly clinic visits with graded increases in peanut protein up to a maintenance dose of 300 mg of peanut protein daily. A blinded retrospective review of paper charts and electronic medical records was conducted along with phone interviews regarding ED visits and epinephrine use. Results All 69 consented patients reached maintenance dose over a median of 29 weeks, and 66 patients (95.7%) were still regularly consuming peanut protein after 1 year of maintenance. One patient had a peanut ingestion-related ED visit requiring epinephrine during the escalation phase of peanut protein dosing (1.4%). During the first year of maintenance phase, no patients had peanut ingestion-related ED visits nor required epinephrine. Conclusion Early oral immunotherapy for peanut allergy in a primary care setting appears to be safe and our findings suggest that it does not lead to an increased burden of emergency department visits. Our population had high adherence rates, with the majority achieving maintenance dose and staying on this dose for one year.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Many clinicians feel uncomfortable with de-labelling penicillin allergies despite ample safety data. Point of care tools effectively support providers with de-labelling. This study’s objective was to increase the number of providers intending to pursue a penicillin oral challenge by 15% by February 2023. Methods A validated de-labelling algorithm was translated into an electronic point of care tool and disseminated to eight healthcare institutions. Applying the Model for Improvement Framework, three PDSA cycles were conducted, where collected data and completed surveys were analysed to implement changes. Number of providers intending to pursue an oral challenge, tool usage as well as number of clinicians who felt satisfied with the tool and felt confident in its ability to risk-stratify patients was collected. Results 50.4% of providers intended to give an oral challenge of penicillin with version 1, which improved to 65.5% with version 2, representing a 15.1% increase. With version 1 of the tool, there was an average of 61.3 counts of tool usage per month. 73.1% of providers felt satisfied with the tool and 76.9% felt confident in its ability to risk-stratify patients. With version 2 of the tool, after implementing changes through three PDSA cycles, monthly usage counts increased to an average of 98.6. Furthermore, 100.0% of providers felt satisfied with the tool and 98.1% felt confident with the tool’s ability to risk-stratify patients. Conclusion Our quality improvement approach demonstrated improvement in the percentage of providers that intended to pursue an oral challenge and felt satisfied and confident in the risk-stratification capabilities of penicillin allergy de-labelling tool. Electronic tools should be further incorporated into institutional penicillin de-labelling protocols.",

    "abstract": "Both B-lymphoblastoid cell lines and tonsillar B lymphocytes express receptors for platelet-activating factor (PAF). In lymph node germinal centres, B lymphocytes interact with follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), which present antigen-containing immune complexes to B lymphocytes. FDCs have phenotypic features that are similar to those of stromal cells and monocytes and may therefore be a source of lipid mediators. In this study, we evaluated the effects of the PAF antagonist WEB 2170 on the activation of tonsillar B lymphocytes by FDCs. FDCs were isolated from tonsils by Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) gradient centrifugation. After being cultured for 6 to 10 days, they were incubated with freshly isolated B cells in the presence or absence of the specific PAF receptor antagonist WEB 2170. B-lymphocyte proliferation was assessed by [3H]-thymidine incorporation, and immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM secretion was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). WEB 2170 (10-6 to 10-8 M) inhibited [3H]-thymidine incorporation by up to 35% +/- 3%. Moreover, the secretion of IgG and IgM was inhibited by up to 50% by WEB 2170 concentrations ranging from 10-6 to 10-8 M. There was no evidence of toxicity by trypan blue staining, and the addition of WEB 2170 to B cells in the absence of FDCs did not inhibit the spontaneous production of IgG or IgM. The effect of the PAF antagonist is primarily on B lymphocytes, as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction detected little PAF receptor messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) from FDCs. These data suggest that endogenous production of PAF may be important in the interaction of B lymphocytes with FDCs.",

    "abstract": "Numerous recombinant therapies are being investigated for the treatment of asthma. This report reviews the current status of several of these novel agents. Anti-immunoglobulin (Ig)E (omalizumab, Xolair) markedly inhibits all aspects of the allergen challenge in subjects who have reduction of free serum IgE to undetectable levels. Several clinical studies in atopic asthma have demonstrated benefit by improved symptoms and lung function and a reduction in corticosteroid requirements. Early use in atopic asthmatics may be even more effective. Several approaches target interleukin (IL)-4. Soluble IL-4 receptor has been shown to effectively replace inhaled corticosteroid; further studies are under way. Recombinant anti-IL-5 and recombinant IL-12 inhibit blood and sputum eosinophils and allergen-induced eosinophilia without any effect on airway responsiveness, allergen-induced airway responses, or allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. Efalizumab, a recombinant antibody that inhibits lymphocyte trafficking, is effective in psoriasis. A bronchoprovocation study showed a reduction in allergen-induced late asthmatic response and allergen-induced eosinophilia, which suggests that it should be effective in clinical asthma. These exciting novel therapies provide not only promise of new therapies for asthma but also valuable tools for investigation of asthma mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background To evaluate the effects of fluticasone furoate on the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenocortical axis, and the safety and tolerability of fluticasone furoate treatment in children with asthma. Methods This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, stratified, parallel-group, non-inferiority study of fluticasone furoate 50 µg inhalation powder administered once daily. The study enrolled children (aged 5–11 years inclusive) with a documented diagnosis of asthma for ≥ 6 months and a Childhood Asthma Control Test score of &gt; 19. After a 7–14-day run-in period, eligible subjects were stratified by age and randomized to fluticasone furoate 50 µg once daily or placebo once daily via ELLIPTA for 6 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline (expressed as a ratio) in 0–24-h weighted mean serum cortisol at the end of the treatment period. Results Fifty-six randomized subjects received fluticasone furoate 50 µg once daily and 55 received placebo. The primary analysis was performed in the serum cortisol population (n = 104) and demonstrated that fluticasone furoate 50 µg once daily was non-inferior to placebo (ratio = 0.93; 95% confidence interval 0.8096, 1.0620), as the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the geometric mean treatment ratio of fluticasone furoate 50 µg once daily versus placebo was greater than 0.80. Findings from the intent-to-treat population (n = 111) were similar. Conclusions Six weeks of treatment with inhaled fluticasone furoate 50 µg once daily had no clinically relevant effect on the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenocortical axis function of children, as measured by 24-h serum cortisol profiles. The primary analysis showed that fluticasone furoate 50 µg once daily was non-inferior to placebo. Fluticasone furoate 50 µg once daily was well tolerated and no new safety concerns emerged during the study. Trial registration This study is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02483975).

    "abstract": "Peanut allergy affects 3% of Australian children and has a higher risk of anaphylaxis than most food allergies. Predicting who is likely to develop anaphylaxis is still an inexact science. The fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) shows promise as a biomarker involved in peanut allergy, as nitric oxide plays a role in inhibiting mast cell degranulation which is relevant in anaphylaxis, where mast cell degranulation plays a mediator role. The aim of this study was to assess the change in FeNO in children during peanut challenge. Thirty-six children aged from 5 to 17 years were recruited for open-labelled peanut challenge. Participants had skin prick test to peanut performed, and serum collected for Ara h2 specific IgE and peanut specific IgE. FeNO was measured by portable device (NIOX VERO) prior to and throughout the peanut challenge. When grouped according to reaction type at peanut challenge (anaphylaxis, clinical allergy not anaphylaxis and tolerant), there were significant differences in the mean change in FeNO measurement between the anaphylaxis group and the clinical allergy, not anaphylaxis group (p = 0.005), and between the anaphylaxis group and tolerant group (p < 0.0001). FeNO decreased more significantly in those who subsequently developed anaphylaxis than in those with clinical allergy, not anaphylaxis or negative peanut challenge (tolerance). As a bedside test that can be used in children, it has potential for further research into mechanisms of anaphylaxis in food allergy and potentially assists in predicting an imminent anaphylactic reaction in some patients.Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov: PEAnut Anaphylaxis Predictors (PEAAP) NCT02424136.",

    "abstract": "Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis mainly affecting small-sized arteries. Involvement of medium-sized vessels is very rare in EGPA. Here we present the case of a patient with EGPA who showed multiple hepatic aneurysms and distal gangrene.A known EGPA patient visited to the emergency room (ER) with abrupt squeezing abdominal pain. She had suffered from gangrene in the fingertips of both hands for 1 year because of arterial thrombosis associated with hypereosinophilia. However, her absolute eosinophil count in the ER was 1120 cells/µL. An abdomen-pelvis CT demonstrated subcapsular hematoma in the right hepatic lobe. A celiac angiogram demonstrated multiple sized aneurysms in both hepatic lobes and some aneurysms in S7 and S8 were huge, more than 1 cm in size. The shape of the small aneurysms resembled a string of beads, as in polyarteritis nodosa. Given the clinical situation, emergency embolization was performed. Before this patient visited to the ER, she had been treated with a high dose of systemic corticosteroid, azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide. After addition of mepolizumab, the eosinophil count remained stable state with a near zero percentage of total white blood cell count.Aneurysm and gangrene resulting from the involvement of medium-sized vessels can occur in EGPA. Destruction of vessels might occur even if eosinophil count is below 1500 cells/µL. If involvement of medium-sized arteries is suspected, thorough investigation to identify the involved organs and prompt management are needed to prevent fatal complications.",

Currently, there is no established 1-day drug desensitization protocol for patients with olaparib type-1 hypersensitivity reactions despite well documented IgE-mediated adverse reactions occurring with olaparib. Case presentation We report a 58-year-old female with immediate, reproducible IgE-mediated adverse reactions to olaparib tablets with implementation of a 1-day novel desensitization protocol to olaparib. Following desensitization, the patient was successfully transitioned from olaparib capsules to tablets with no loss of tolerance. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of successful olaparib desensitization using a novel 1-day desensitization protocol, and will contribute to drug allergy knowledge, in an area where robust data is lacking. This case demonstrates the important role for drug desensitization in patients with immediate hypersensitivity reactions to chemotherapeutic agents. Furthermore, as olaparib capsules are being phased out in favour of olaparib tablets, we provide a clear case that transitioning from capsule to tablet form did not cause a loss of tolerance.",

This study describes attitudes and practices regarding vaccination among physicians who care for patients with mild/moderate B cell or mild/moderate combined immunodeficiencies (CID) and vaccination completeness among patients diagnosed with IEIs. Canadian physicians caring for children with IEI were surveyed about attitudes and practices regarding vaccination in mild/moderate IEI. Following informed consent, immunization records of pediatric patients with IEI evaluated before 7 years of age were reviewed. Vaccine completeness was defined at age 2 years as 4 doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTaP), 3 doses pneumococcal conjugate (PCV), and 1 dose measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccines. At 7 years 5 doses of DTP and 2 doses MMR were required. Forty-five physicians from 8 provinces completed the survey. Most recommended inactivated vaccines for B cell deficiency: (84% (38/45) and CID (73% (33/45). Fewer recommended live attenuated vaccines (B cell: 53% (24/45), CID 31% (14/45)). Of 96 patients with IEI recruited across 7 centers, vaccination completeness at age 2 was 25/43 (58%) for predominantly antibody, 3/13 (23%) for CID, 7/35 (20%) for CID with syndromic features, and 4/4 (100%) for innate/phagocyte defects. Completeness at age 7 was 15%, 17%, 5%, and 33%, respectively. Most physicians surveyed recommended inactivated vaccines in children with mild to moderate IEI. Vaccine completeness for all IEI was low, particularly at age 7. Further studies should address the reasons for low vaccine uptake among children with IEI and whether those with mild-moderate IEI, where vaccination is recommended, eventually receive all indicated vaccines.",

We aimed to elucidate the longitudinal association between oropharyngeal symptoms without systemic reactions (OSw/oS) and tolerance to food allergens.We included all patients diagnosed with single food allergy to egg (n = 121), milk (n = 55), and wheat (n = 41) using the oral food challenge test (OFC) from 2014 to 2017. These patients received oral immunotherapy at home and/or in the hospital after diagnosis by OFC. We compared the incidence proportion of tolerance within 2 years by OSw/oS and other variables for 217 patients with food allergy. We defined OSw/oS as isolated symptoms of oropharyngeal discomfort that occurred after ingestion of a safe dose of the allergenic food determined by the OFC in the first 6 months.Of the 217 patients (median age 37.5 months, male 64.5%), 53 developed OSw/oS (24.4%), and 151 (egg, 85 milk, 36 and wheat, 30) attained tolerance in 2 years. Patients without OSw/oS showed a significantly higher incidence of tolerance than those with the symptoms (crude hazard ratio [HR] 5.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.58-8.82, p < 0.001). The association was consistently significant in the multivariable model (adjusted HR 9.50, 95% CI 5.25-17.20, p < 0.001) independent of other risk factors for intolerance, such as concomitant bronchial asthma (adjusted HR 3.33), history of anaphylaxis (adjusted HR 2.16), milk allergy (adjusted HR 2.02), and allergic symptoms with low dose OFC (adjusted HR 1.52).Our results suggest that OSw/oS may be a risk factor for intolerance to food allergens.

Workup included negative anti-mycoplasma antibody titers, hypogammaglobulinemia, and negative anti-pneumococcal antibody titers despite prior vaccination, solidifying the diagnosis of CVID. The patient was discharged on antibiotic and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and now follows allergy and immunology long-term for treatment.Her diagnostic history underscores the importance of considering the various criteria of CVID for diagnosis, and her unique presentation of M. pneumoniae skin abscesses highlights the broad sequelae patients with CVID can manifest.",

    "abstract": "Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD) is an uncommon disorder with increased susceptibility to less virulent mycobacteria including bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). Fibrosing mediastinitis (FM) is also a rare condition defined by excessive fibrotic reactions in the mediastinum. So far, some infectious organisms and autoimmune diseases have been introduced as possible etiologies of FM. However, no study has ever discussed the possible association of BCG infection and FM.In this study, we report a 3-year-old female presenting with persistent fever, weakness, and bloody diarrhea in addition to mediastinal lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and pleural and pericardial effusion. Further examinations established a diagnosis of MSMD based on her clinical condition, immunologic data, positive tests for mycobacterial species, positive family history, and genetic study (IL12RB1 gene, c.G1193C, p.W398S). A year and a half later, she was referred with submandibular lymphadenitis and underwent immunologic work-up which revealed high inflammatory indices, a slight reduction in numbers of CD3 + and CD4 + cells as well as elevated CD16/56 + cell count and hyperimmunoglobulinemia. Purified protein derivative (PPD), QuantiFERON, and gastric washing test were all negative. Her chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed suspicious para-aortic soft tissue and her echocardiography was indicative of strictures in superior vena cava and pulmonary veins. She further underwent chest CT angiography which confirmed FM development. Meanwhile, she has been treated with anti-mycobacterial agents and subcutaneous IFN-γ.In summary, we described a novel case of MSMD in a child presenting with granulomatous FM possibly following BCG infection. This is the first report introducing aberrant BCG infection as the underlying cause of FM. This result could assist physicians in identifying early-onset FM in suspicious cases with MSMD. However, more studies are required to support this matter.",

Additionally, we assessed whether well-controlled asthma is an additional risk for severe reactions. A retrospective analysis of 107 children with sensitization to Ara h 2-specific IgE (> 0.35 kU/l) undergoing open peanut challenges during 2012-2018 in the Tampere University Hospital Allergy Centre, Finland. Of the 107 challenges, 82 (77%) were positive. Serum levels of Ara h 2 -sIgE were higher in subjects with a positive challenge than in those who remained negative (median 32.9 (IQR 6.7-99.8) vs. 2.1 (IQR 1.0-4.9) kU/l), p < 0.001) but were not significantly different between subjects with and without anaphylaxis. No correlation was observed between the serum level of Ara h 2-sIgE and reaction severity grading. Well-controlled asthma did not affect the challenge outcome. Elevated levels of Ara h 2-specific IgE are associated with a positive outcome in peanut challenges but not a reliable predictor of reaction severity. Additionally, well-controlled asthma is not a risk factor for severe reactions in peanut challenges in children with sensitization to Ara h 2.",

However, little is known about the role of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of pediatric allergic asthma. Methods High-throughput sequencing analysis was performed to identify differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 3 children with allergic asthma and 3 matched healthy controls. Bioinformatics analysis was used to select candidate lncRNAs and mRNAs that may be involved in the pathogenesis of asthma. Candidate lncRNAs were validated in a larger size of asthma patients and healthy controls. Finally, lncRNAs and molecular pathways associated with the pathogenesis of allergic asthma were identified by competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) analysis. Results Five differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified after high-throughput sequencing and verified by real-time PCR. LncRNAs ENST0000631797, TCONS_00004989 and ENST00000499459 were verified to be differentially expressed in allergic asthma.

Prior studies showed a substantial decrease in ED visits for asthma in the decade preceding 2010, followed by a stabilization. This was attributed to improvements in the pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments for asthma during that period followed by a balance between epidemiologic drivers and protective factors in the population. Methods We assessed whether this trend continued in Alberta from 2010 to 2022 using population level data for the volume of daily ED visits, acuity of asthma exacerbations in the ED, and hospitalization rate. Results The mean number of ED visits decreased from 4.5 to 2.2 per million persons per day, but the acuity of exacerbations and the proportion requiring hospitalization increased. The number of patients presenting with the highest level of acuity increased by over 300%, and the percentage of patients requiring hospitalization increased from 6.8 to 11.3%. Conclusion Total ED visits for asthma exacerbations continues to decline in Alberta. The reasons for an increase in more severe exacerbations requires further attention.",

This study aimed to better understand the mitochondrial genome profile with AR and to investigate the associations between AR in China and the mitochondrial genome at a single variant and gene level. Mitochondrial sequencing was conducted on a total of 134 unrelated individual subjects (68 patients with AR, 66 healthy controls) at discovery stage. Heteroplasmy was analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Sequence kernel association tests (SKAT) were conducted to study the association between mitochondrial genes and AR. Single-variant analysis was performed using logistic regression analysis and further validated in 120 subjects (69 patients with AR, 51 healthy controls). Candidate genes were further explored based on differences in mRNA and protein abundance in nasal mucosal tissue. In the discovery stage, 886 variants, including 836 SNV and 50 indels, were identified with mitochondrial sequencing. No statistically significant differences were identified for the mitochondrial heteroplasmy or SKAT analysis between these two groups after applying a Boferroni correction. One nonsynonymous variants, rs3135028 (MT8584.G/A) in ATP6, was related to a reduced risk of AR in both the discovery and validation cohorts. Furthermore, mRNA levels of MT-ATP6 in nasal mucosal tissue were significantly lower in AR individuals than in controls (P < 0.05). In a two-stage analysis of associations between AR and mtDNA variations, mitochondrial gene maps of Chinese patients with AR indicated that the ATP6 gene was probably associated with AR at the single-variant level.",

    "abstract": "Asthma exacerbations are a leading cause of pediatric hospitalizations despite multiple efforts to educate patients and families on disease course and medication management. Asthma education in the pediatric emergency department (ED) is challenging, and although the use of written action plans has been associated with reduction in hospitalizations and ED visits, written tools may not be useful for individuals with low health literacy. Moreover, asthmatic children should participate in their asthma education. In this prospective randomized study of 53 families presenting to a pediatric ED with a child experiencing an asthma exacerbation, education on asthma was presented via an interactive mobile-based video-game versus a standard-of-care asthma education video (SAV). Median age was 10 years; 64% were males. Many patients had moderate-to-severe asthma, with 57% experiencing ≥ 2 asthma-related ED visits in the last year, 58% requiring hospitalization and 32% reporting a critical care admission. In this cohort, the mobile-based video-game was found to be a feasible, acceptable educational tool; 86% of parents and 96% of children liked the game, while 96% of parents and 76% of children preferred playing the game over watching a SAV. Despite a history of persistent asthma, only 34% of children used an inhaled corticosteroid while 70% required rescue inhaler use in the prior week. Basic asthma knowledge was sub-optimal with only 60% of parents and 43% of children correctly recognizing symptoms that should prompt immediate medical care. This reflects a major gap in asthma knowledge that coexists with parental misconceptions regarding optimal asthma management.",

Results It was found that the numbers of sneezing and nose rubbing were remarkably reduced in rhIL-1Ra and budesonide-treated guinea pigs. Besides, rhIL-1Ra distinctly alleviated IgE levels in serum and IL-1β levels in nasal mucus, together with decreased exfoliation of epithelial cells, eosinophilic infiltration, tissue edema and vascular dilatation.

Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study of children aged 1–17 years presenting with asthma to the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) ED between September 1, 2014 – August 31, 2015. EDPS was defined as provision of education on trigger avoidance and medication technique plus documentation of an asthma action plan, a prescription for an inhaled controller medication or referral to a specialist. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with receipt of EDPS. We further compared the odds of repeat presentation to the ED within the following year among children who had received EDPS versus those who had not. Results 1301 patients were included, and the mean age of those who received EDPS was 5.0 years (SD = 3.7). Those with a moderate (OR = 3.67, 95% CI: 2.49, 5.52) to severe (OR = 3.69, 95% CI: 2.50, 5.45) asthma presentation were most likely to receive EDPS. Receiving EDPS did not significantly reduce the adjusted odds of repeat ED visits, (OR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.56, 1.18, p = 0.28). Conclusions Patients with higher severity asthma presentations to the ED were more likely to receive EDPS, but this did not appear to significantly decrease the proportion with a repeat asthma ED visit. These findings suggest that receipt of EDPS in the ED may not be sufficient to prevent repeat asthma ED visits in all children.",

Food allergies are a significant public health concern, and the misdiagnosis of food allergies remains a prevalent concern, made worse by the ongoing use of panel food testing. The practice of screening patients for multiple food allergens, regardless of clinical relevance, is commonly referred to as “panel food testing.” Fundamentally, a panel food test is not simply a single test; a panel food test is a series of several distinct tests for multiple foods, each with its own variable predictive value. These tests have not been adequately validated as screening tests and carry a considerable false positive rate. The resulting false diagnoses lead to unnecessary dietary restrictions, increased healthcare costs, and significant psychosocial distress for patients and their families.",

Physician office visits were stratified into two groups based on the literature: air pollution-sensitive (acute respiratory infections, allergic rhinitis, asthma, bronchiolitis, diabetes, otitis media) and air pollution-insensitive (gastroenteritis, injuries). Claims data were obtained for every month in 2010 from health administrative databases for children 0-14 years of age.

Spatial Poisson regression models were used to analyze the relationship between PM2.5 and physician office visits, with temperature as a covariate. Results Crude rates of physician office visits are presented in Table 1. As expected, fine particulate was significantly associated with monthly rates of physician office visits for air pollution-sensitive conditions, and not for insensitive conditions. Fitted SMRs for air pollution-sensitive conditions are presented in Figure 1. SMRs for sensitive and insensitive conditions were strongly positively correlated (r = 0.53), and data were spatially autocorrelated. This suggests an underlying spatial process that influences physician office visit rates for common childhood conditions, both for air pollution-sensitive and -insensitive conditions.",

RATIONALE: In patients with symptomatic asthma receiving ICS or ICS+LABA, Phase III studies have demonstrated improved lung function with tiotropium Respimat , a once-daily long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilator. The efficacy of some treatments (e.g. ICS and omalizumab) appears higher in TH2-high phenotypes, but no specific treatments are available that work equally well in both TH2-high and TH2-low phenotypes. We explored whether TH2 biomarker status influenced responses to tiotropium in patients with moderate symptomatic asthma. METHODS: In two replicate Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials (NCT01172808/NCT01172821), patients with moderate symptomatic asthma, using medium-dose ICS (400-800 mg budesonide equivalent), were administered once-daily tiotropium Respimat 5 mg or 2.5 mg, placebo, or salmeterol (active comparator without inferential analysis). Co-primary endpoints included peak and trough FEV1 response (difference from baseline) at 24 weeks. Pre-planned analyses (pooled population) were performed in TH2-low and TH2-high subgroups defined at baseline as total serum IgE 430 mg/L or blood eosinophils 0.6310/L. RESULTS: Of 1545 patients in the full analysis set who received tiotropium or placebo, 915/1455 were reported with IgE >430 mg/L and 300/1461 with an eosinophil count of >0.6310/L. Peak FEV1 improved with tiotropium versus placebo, independent of IgE (p<0.0001 both doses) and eosinophil count (p<0.0001 both doses). Trough FEV1 also improved with tiotropium versus placebo, independent of IgE (p<0.0001 both doses) and eosinophil count (p<0.005 both doses). CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily tiotropium Respimat as add-on to ICS reduces airflow obstruction in patients withmoderate symptomatic asthma, independent of TH2 phenotype, and thus may potentially provide an important therapeutic option.",

This leads to complement and contact system activation and excess bradykinin resulting in angioedema. Therefore, an invasive procedure or surgery can trigger an HAE attack; this in turn can cause further medical complications and pose an added danger to the post-procedure patient. C1 inhibitor, Berinert, was approved in the US and Canada in 2009 and 2010, respectively, for the treatment of acute attacks. In April 2013, Berinert was approved in Europe for short-term prophylaxis prior to medical, dental, or surgical procedures to prevent HAE attacks. Currently, Berinert is not approved in Canada or the US for prophylaxis. We aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of C1 esterase inhibitor, Berinert, as a prophylactic treatment for HAE patients undergoing invasive procedures.",

In order to conduct future mRNA expression analysis, examining the differential expression of AR mediators such as IL33, TSLPR, HPGDS ,a ndCRTH2 at baseline and 6 hours following Nasal Allergen Challenge (NAC) in allergic individuals, this study aims to optimize the RNA isolation, reverse transcription (RT), and qPCR protocols used for the study of nasal mucosal samples. Methods Several RNA isolation and RT kits were evaluated using nasal scrapings from healthy individuals, similar to those collected from allergic participants. These kits were evaluated based on the yield and purity of RNA and cDNA, assessed using spectrophotometry, qPCR amplification, and gel electrophoresis. Reference gene analysis using cDNA isolated from allergic participants was conducted using qPCR and the statistical software GenEx (MultID). Primer design and evaluation of primers for the targets of interest—IL33, TSLPR, HPGDS ,a nd CRTH2—was also pursued. Results RNA isolation and RT kit optimization determined that the Life Technologies-Qiagen (LT-Q) kit combination produced cDNA with maximal purity and qPCR efficiency compared with the other kit combinations evaluated. Reference gene analysis demonstrated that expression of ubiquitin C (UBC) showed limited variability among the differing conditions (time point and study) of nasal sample collection. Primer evaluation yielded inconsistent results. Conclusions Future processing of nasal scraping samples should use the optimal LT-Q kit combination. Following successful primer evaluation, the expression levels of the targets of interest in the allergic nasal mucosal cDNA samples at both baseline and 6h post-NAC will be conducted via the optimized qPCR reaction, using UBC as a reference gene.",

Recently, literature has emerged describing anti-IgE monoclonal antibody as a potential therapy for CRS. However, its effectiveness and safety are not well known. The purpose of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness and safety of anti-IgE therapy and to identify evidence gaps that will guide future research for the management of CRS. Methodology was registered with PROSPERO (No. CRD42014007600). A comprehensive search was performed of standard bibliographic databases, Google Scholar, and clinical trials registries. Only randomized controlled trials assessing anti-IgE therapy in adult patients for the treatment of CRS were included. Two independent reviewers extracted data using a pre-defined extraction form and performed quality assessment using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the GRADE framework. Two studies met our inclusion criteria. When comparing anti-IgE therapy to placebo, there was a significant difference in Lund-McKay score (p = 0.04) while no difference was seen for percent opacification on computed tomography (CT). At 16 weeks, treatment led to a decrease in clinical polyp score. No significant difference was seen with regard to quality of life (Total Nasal Symptom Severity (TNSS), p < 0.21; Sinonasal Outcome Test 20 (SNOT-20), p < 0.60), and no serious complications were reported in either trial. Based on the quality assessment, studies were deemed to be of moderate risk of bias and a low overall quality of evidence. There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of anti-IgE monoclonal antibody therapy for the treatment of CRS.",

    "abstract": "Background We sought to optimize the Nasal Allergen Challenge (NAC) model to ensure reliability and repeatability of results by modifying the qualifying criteria and allergen concentration during the challenge. Methods 20 Allergic Rhinitis (AR) participants underwent NAC to determine the concentration at which a Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) of 10/12 OR a Peak Nasal Inspiratory Flow (PNIF) reduction of 50 % was achieved. 4-fold increases in allergen concentration were administered every 15 minutes until qualification criteria were met. The Qualifying Allergen Concentration (QAC) reached was used as a single challenge dose at the subsequent NAC visit. 10 additional ragweed allergic and 4 non-allergic participants were qualified at a TNSS of 8/12 AND a PNIF reduction of 50%. Cumulative Allergen Concentration (CAC) of all incremental doses was used during the subsequent NAC visit. Participants recorded TNSS and PNIF at baseline, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour and hourly afterwards up to 12 hours post-challenge during the NAC visit. Results QAC study participants qualifying only based on PNIF reduction had significantly lower TNSS scores than those qualifying on TNSS only or TNSS+PNIF (p<0.01). Participants in both studies’ NAC visit reached peak TNSS at 15 minutes post-challenge followed by a gradual symptom decline, while the “PNIF only” group had significantly lower TNSS compared to others. All 3 groups experienced a decline in peak TNSS following NAC compared to screening, although groups qualifying on TNSS and TNSS+PNIF maintained their PNIF scores. Conclusion The NAC model is well-suited to study AR symptoms. TNSS and PNIF are complementary and must be integrated in the qualifying criteria. Further protocol modifications, such as with multiple allergen challenges during the NAC visit, may produce even more repeatable results. Through optimizing the NAC protocol, the model achieves reproducible results and becomes more reliable; suitable for testing new medications in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Background Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a condition, lasting at least 6 months, where patients experience frequent episodes of red, itchy hives and/or angioedema with no apparent external trigger. For approximately 30-50% of patients this condition can resolve spontaneously but has been known to persist for years. CSU can have a major impact on a patient’s quality of life as it can affect daily activities, sleep, emotional wellbeing and social interactions. In March 2014, omalizumab was approved in Europe and eight other countries for the treatment of CSU in patients with inadequate response to H1-antihistamines at approved doses. However, as yet there is no approved indication for its use in CSU in Canada and the US. We report on the effectiveness of omalizumab as a treatment option for difficult-to-treat CSU in our clinic.",

In the EU, omalizumab has been approved for children (age 6 – 11 years) since 2009. The pediatric population within Canada and the United States has very few treatment options available for severe asthma. Current treatments options can lead to other health concerns such as adrenal insufficiency and osteoporosis. These cases demonstrate that early treatment of moderate to severe asthma with omalizumab is an effective treatment and can help to prevent or reverse damage done by long-term use of other treatment options. Methods A retrospective chart review of our database was performed and patients ≤ 17 years of age receiving omalizumab treatment were evaluated. Data was collected on FEV1, inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and oral corticosteroid (OCS) use. Results 12 patients were identified as 17 years old or younger at the start of treatment with omalizumab. After the first 6 months of treatment, all 12 patients showed an increase in FEV1 results and a decrease in ICS dose.

Current guidelines recommend skin testing only when there is a reaction to a food in that specific patient. When there is a family history of food allergy, parents frequently ask their physicians for food testing of their children prior to introduction of specific foods. We conducted this study to determine whether allergy skin testing reduces anxiety levels in parents thereby leading to food introduction. Methods The parents of 50 children with a family history of food allergy completed a Visual Analog Score (VAS) to estimate their anxiety to give their children the specific food of concern. Previously, the children had not eaten the food. The VAS scores were recorded pre- and post-skin testing on a scale from 0 to 10. The likelihood of food introduction pre- and post-skin testing was estimated. Results The mean age of the children was 3.6 years; the majority were males (62%). Approximately 58% of patients’ parents, 38% siblings and 4% other relatives had food allergy.

    "abstract": "Background An autoimmune basis is believed to be responsible for about half of all cases of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) with specific IgG antibodies directed at the high affinity receptor sites for IgE on the mast cell. The autologous serum skin test (ASST) is used to identify this autoimmune form of CSU. Currently, basophil histamine release assay and basophil activation test (BAT) have been used as an alternative to the ASST. These tests are not widely available and are limited in that they only provide evidence that the patient’s serum is capable of inducing basophil degranulation. We have developed an indirect immunofluorescence method to demonstrate the presence of anti-mast cell antibodies using skin sections from a patient with severe bullous mastocytosis. Methods Sections were cut from paraffin embedded blocks from skin biopsied infant with bullous mastocytosis. An EDTA buffer solution for heat-induced epitope retrieval was used. Serum from 69 patients with CSU was used, and fluorescein conjugated human IgG was used to label fixed antibody. An ASST had been previously performed on 66 of the patients with severe urticaria and was found to be positive in 45.45%. 27 of these patients were receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or had received in the past. Results A positive indirect immunofluorescence was found in half the patients. It was positive in 22.73% of the patients with a positive ASST, but was also positive in 25.76% with a negative ASST. The sensitivity and specificity of ASST were calculated to be 46.88% and 52.94%, respectively. We considered the possibility that the use of IVIG might interfere with indirect immunofluorescence, and this subset was omitted giving a sensitivity and specificity of 34.62% and 77.27%, respectively. Conclusion Positive indirect immunofluorescence was found in half the patients with CSU. When IVIG treated patient were excluded the ASST was associated with is a high specificity but with low sensitivity. Indirect immunofluorescence should be considered as better indicator of the autoimmune form of urticaria.",

C2 factor deficiency is the most common complement deficiency. The presentation can vary from being asymptomatic to developing recurrent infections. Thus empiric vaccinations have been recommended, despite the lack of substantial evidence to support this practice. Recently, Jonnson and colleagues revisited this controversial topic and demonstrated the importance of vaccinations in this patient population. They further established that C2 deficient patients can mount an immune response to vaccination, undergo class-switching and develop a ‘more efficient’ phagocytosis. C2 deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Homozygotes generally present with increased severity of disease as compared to heterozygotes. Alper and colleagues state that 25% of C2-deficient homozygotes have increased susceptibility to severe bacterial infections. Furthermore, they found that these C2-deficient patients had significantly lower mean levels of IgG4 and IgA than those patients that did not demonstrate an increased susceptibility for recurrent infections.",

    "abstract": "Background The prevalence of allergic asthma has increased dramatically over the last 20 years. Environmental allergens such as house dust mites (HDM), cockroach, fungi and pollens are major asthma triggers. Recent studies indicate that the serine proteinase activity of these allergens is an important factor contributing to their ability to induce airway inflammation. Allergen serine proteinases can activate Proteinase Activated Receptor -2 (PAR-2), a G protein coupled receptor, which is upregulated on the airway epithelium of asthmatics. PAR-2 activation is pro-inflammatory in many biological systems. PAR-2 polymorphisms are associated with the development of atopy. We have shown that allergic sensitization and inflammation in mouse models of asthma is PAR-2 dependent. We have proposed that PAR-2 on the airway epithelium is a sensor for environmental allergens and leads to allergic inflammation. However, the regulation of PAR-2 expression on airway epithelium is poorly studied. As asthmatic airways are under various types of cellular stress, we hypothesized that cellular stress regulates PAR-2 on airway epithelium. Methods",

Human rhinovirus (HRV) infections are the most common causes of exacerbations in individuals with chronic airways diseases such as asthma and COPD. Moreover, bacterial colonization is commonly found in the airways of patients experiencing exacerbations of these chronic airways diseases and linked to increased severity and duration of these exacerbations. The mechanisms underlying the increased prevalence of secondary bacterial infections and the association with more severe outcomes following viral infections is not known. It has been suggested that viral infection of the airways cause dysregulation of innate host defense mechanisms, such as, impaired antimicrobial peptide expression of the airways. Antimicrobial peptides are key components of the innate immune response after infection and are important in efficient clearance of microbial colonization to prevent infection.

The passive transfer of food specific IgE was suspected and he was advised to carry an epinephrine auto-injector and avoid all vertebrate fish. Specific IgE to salmon by ImmunoCAP was positive. Follow-up was arranged to follow his specific IgE to salmon with the expectation that his allergy would resolve. One week after his anaphylactic episode to fish, he developed an allergic reaction to peanuts. He ate a chocolate peanut butter cup and within 10 minutes he vomited, developed angioedema of the lip and experienced lethargy. Previously, he routinely ate peanuts without any symptoms. Skin prick testing showed positive results to peanut, salmon, mixed fish, and tree nut mix. He had a positive ImmunoCAP to peanut. Approximately 6 months later, he had undetectable ImmunoCAP results to both salmon and peanut. He resumed consumption of salmon and peanuts with no reaction. As part of the adverse event investigation by Canadian Blood Services all donors associated with the reaction were contacted and one donor stated that they have a severe allergy to peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, and all fish including salmon.

    "abstract": "Background Low neighbourhood walkability has been associated with chronic conditions such as obesity and diabetes, but the relationship between neighbourhood walkability and incident childhood asthma has not been determined. Methods We evaluated the association between neighbourhood walkability and incident childhood asthma using prospectively-collected administrative data at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences. Among the 1997-2003 birth cohorts of children living in Toronto, neighbourhood quintile of walkability was reported using a validated walkability index with 4 dimensions: population density, dwelling density, access to services and street connectivity. Incident asthma was defined by the time of entry into the Ontario Asthma Surveillance Information System (OASIS) database, requiring 2 outpatient visits for asthma within 2 consecutive years or any hospitalization for asthma. Sex and neighbourhood income quintile were obtained from the Registered Person’s Database. Histories of preterm delivery, obesity and other atopic conditions were obtained from Ontario Health Insurance Plan records. We calculated the associations between incident childhood asthma and the two lowest versus the two highest neighbourhood walkability quintiles using Cox proportional and discretetime hazard models. Results Twenty-one percent of the 326 383 children met the OASIS criteria for asthma. After adjusting for sex, preterm delivery, obesity, atopic conditions and neighbourhood income quintile, children with low home neighbourhood walkability at birth were at increased risk of asthma development [hazard ratio (HR) 1.11; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.08-1.14], and the association did not change for children with healthcare visits for asthma in the past year (HR 1.10; 95% CI, 1.04-1.16). When walkability in each year of the child’s life was considered, low neighbourhood walkability was associated with increased odds of incident childhood asthma (odds ratio 1.12; 95% CI, 1.09-1.15). These associations were not substantially affected by year of birth within the cohort. Conclusions Children living in neighbourhoods with low walkability are at increased risk of incident childhood asthma after adjusting for neighbourhood and individual characteristics. The association persists for children with visits for asthma within the past year. Possible mechanisms of this association include more physical activity, fewer weight problems and decreased exposure to traffic-related air pollution in more walkable neighbourhoods. Our findings suggest that promotion of neighbourhood walkability may offer as trategy for primary asthma prevention. Walkability of existing neighbourhoods may be improved by encouraging greater placement of services such as banks and grocery stores within walking distance of residential neighbourhoods and adding pedestrian paths between roads to improve street connectivity.",

Young children who experience human rhinovirus (HRV)-associated wheezing illness within the first three years of life are at increased risk for the subsequent development of asthma. This association, together with evidence that HRVinfected epithelial cells release a number of growth factors and cytokines, has led to the hypothesis that HRV infection may be involved in the pathogenesis of airway remodeling. Thickening of the lamina reticularis found below the true basement membrane in the human airway is a characteristic feature of airway remodeling in asthma. The human bronchial fibroblast (HBF) is believed to contribute to this thickening by moving closer to the laminar reticularis and producing matrix proteins. We hypothesized that HRV infection of human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells induces production of chemoattractants that can induce HBF migration.",

    "abstract": "The Canadian Society of Allergy & Clinical Immunology, founded in 1945, published its first Journal in 1996, as the Canadian Journal of Allergy & Clinical Immunology, under the Editorship of Dr Gordon Sussman. It was a hard copy journal containing mostly solicited manuscripts and its circulation was limited primarily to Society members. In 2004, Allergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology (AACI) was founded, and was published by BC Decker from that year until 2009. In 2009, a decision was made to change to an electronic format and the Journal joined BioMed Central.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that a number of our most accessed papers were originally submitted to the hard copy version of the Journal produced by BC Decker (see Table 1). These articles became generally available because of Open Access with BioMed Central. This demonstrates the importance of the Open Access system for the dissemination of medical and scientific information, for at its peak, the hard copy of AACI never had more than a few hundred subscribers, compared to the 20,000 to 35,000 accesses to the articles when they transferred to an electronic format.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1\r\n\r\nHighly accessed articles (retrieved July 2014) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince joining BioMed Central, under the Editorships of Drs. Warrington, Kim & Watson, Allergy Asthma & Clinical Immunology has been indexed on PubMed, PubMed Central, Science Citation Index Expanded, Current Contents, & Scopus. AACI has been tracked by Thompson-Reuters for an Impact Factor since early 2014, and had an unofficial 2013 impact factor of 1.57. The Scopus Journal Rank (SJR) has increased progressively since 2009 from 0.1 to 0.5-0.6 in 2013 and the Source Normalized Impact per paper (SNIP) has increased from 0.8.\r\n\r\nThe number of manuscript publications has also increased progressively since 2010 from 33 in that year to 50 in 2013, the number in 2014 was at 40 as of July 2014.\r\n\r\nRegarding the Country of origin of the manuscripts published in the Journal (Table 2), the majority are from Canada, perhaps not surprisingly, with USA the second highest contributing country. It is rather striking how few submissions and publications are from the UK. This area probably needs more attention. Perhaps this reflects the small number of Allergy & Clinical Immunology training programs in the UK and the fact they have their own journal, Clinical & Experimental Allergy. The UK is still third on the list of page visits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 2\r\n\r\nCountry of origin of publication since 2009 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCitations have also increased since joining BioMed Central, from <10 in 2009 to 240 in 2013, an indication of the growing interest in articles published in the Journal.\r\n\r\nIn terms of citations, it appears that guidelines are more frequently cited than other manuscripts, although we do not have information on the citation of our Primer on Allergy & Immunology which was published as a supplement. Articles in that supplement are among our most highly accessed.\r\n\r\nWhen we compare highly accessed articles all time with those accessed in the last month (Table 3), there is a significant change in the article types, with a much higher proportion of manuscripts that are research articles being highly accessed, rather than reviews or guidelines, which is probably to be expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 3\r\n\r\nHighly accessed articles in last month \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAACI has also been successful in its publication of supplements. In addition to the yearly supplement containing abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Canadian Society of Allergy & Clinical Immunology, we also publish abstracts from the Allergen NCE Inc. Annual Meeting, recently held in conjunction with the CSACI Meeting. This extremely valuable collaboration enhances and expands the basic science interest in the Annual Meeting and facilitates interactions between basic scientists, clinician scientists and clinicians.\r\n\r\nA second successful contribution by AACI has been in the form of an educational supplement providing review articles on Allergy & Clinical Immunology topics suitable for Medical School teaching and the education of non-specialist physicians. The articles in this supplement have also been among the most accessed publications in AACI. This emphasizes the strong educational value of the open access system particularly as the cost of textbooks in Allergy & Immunology increases progressively.\r\n\r\nA third successful source of information in AACI is in the form of guidelines for the treatment and management of allergic and immunologic disease. Some frequently accessed examples of these guidelines are provided in Table 1.\r\n\r\nReviewing data from Google Analytics, the number of page views per month has increased progressively to 34,660 in the month of July. Of these, 15,112 were unique visitors, while new visitors are typically about 20% of all visits. Of these, the majority are from the United States, followed by Canada, India and the United Kingdom. The number of new visitors is encouraging with regard to the increasing visibility of the Journal and interest in its content. Approximately 12,000 sessions originate from Google searches, compared to 189 from Bing and 143 from Yahoo. Two thousand one hundred and twenty visits were direct and 668 were from BioMed Central. The latter had the greatest number of page session, at 5.15, compared to 1.66 from Google and 1.59 from PubMed. Direct visits, most likely from return visitors, viewed 2.48 pages per session. These data are interesting in terms of the methods of access to the journal, with a greater number of visitors from search engines, who view only a limited number of pages, compared to visitors who come direct to the Journal or through BioMed Central.\r\n\r\nIn this, our 10th year of publication, we would like to thank the Co-editors of AACI, the Editorial Board, who have worked hard to make the Journal a success, and the many reviewers who have contributed their time and expertise.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we thank the Canadian Society of Allergy & Clinical Immunology, the Executive and Board and Management team without whose support, both financial and by their contributions to the Journal; we would not have achieved this success.\r\n\r\nFinally, we must thank the many staff at BioMed Central that have contributed to our success. A special thanks to Lisa Hussey and Holly Young, who have guided the Journal through the last several years successfully.\r\n\r\nWhen AACI first began publishing in 2004, our goal was to publish high quality research and review manuscripts, with the aim of eventually achieving indexing in PubMed, Current Contents etc. Our manuscripts were then by invitation only. Since joining BioMed Central, we have achieved the aim of indexing, including now Science Citation Index Expanded, and are awaiting our first official Impact Factor from Thompson Reuters. What we wish to achieve in the next 10 years is a steady increase in the number and quality of submissions, so that we can enhance the international reputation of our journal and Society. This can be achieved by taking advantage of the tremendous advances in our understanding of allergic and immunologic diseases and the new treatments that have become available. This knowledge can be widely disseminated by the important medium of Open Access.\r\n\r\nRichard Warrington, Editor-in-Chief, Allergy Asthma & Clinical Immunology\r\n\r\nPaul Keith, President, Canadian Society of Allergy & Clinical Immunology",

We conducted regular in-service training to ensure all members of the study team were informed and educated in understanding the importance of collecting the blood sample and dealing with pediatric populations at different developmental stages. Training also addressed parental anxiety related to the procedure and strategies to establish rapport and trust were shared. Finally, we developed a repertoire of comfort and distraction techniques to support the child, the parent, and the phlebotomist. We used quantitative and qualitative approaches to assess outcomes, including the number of blood samples successfully collected at the 1 and 5 year clinic visits and analysis of responses to our parent satisfaction survey evaluating perceptions of the venipuncture procedure.",

The barriers include lack of awareness of HAE, communication difficulties, diagnostic testing limitations, and broad differential diagnoses for symptoms of HAE. Consequently, there has been no definitive study on the age of onset of symptoms of HAE in children. This lack of awareness can result in reduced quality of life due to suboptimal treatment of symptoms, significant delay in diagnosis, and/or misdiagnosis, which can result in unnecessary tests, treatments, and procedures. Current literature suggests that the mean age of onset is in the second decade of life, which is worsened by puberty, estrogen containing contraception, or estrogen hormone replacement therapy, but symptoms can also be present under one year.

    "abstract": "Background: Asthma is the most prevalent chronic disease among children and affects 235 million people worldwide [1].Although the incidence of asthma in South America is among the highest worldwide, underlying causes and disease phenotypes are poorly defined and may differ to developed countries.Recent evidence in mice [2] and human [3] has identified a 'critical window' early in life where the effects of gut microbial changes (dysbiosis) are most influential in immune development and experimental asthma.Given the differences in gut microbiota between North and South American populations, we aimed to validate our previous work in a microbially-different human population.Methods: We compared the gut microbiota of 97 infants from the coastal community Las Esmeraldas, Ecuador at 3 months of age by 16S sequencing (V4 region) Illumina MiSeq.Subjects were grouped into atopic-wheezers (n = 27) and controls (n = 70) based on a skin prick test and wheezing history at 1 year of age.An exact logistic regression model was developed to evaluate the risk associated with the AW group according to specific clinical and epidemiological metadata.Metagenomes were predicted from 16S rRNA OTU data using PIC-RUSt, and categorized by function using KEGG Orthology.The concentration of fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFA) was determined by gas chromatography.Results: Atopy and wheezing at 1 year of age was significantly associated with asthma diagnosis at 5 years (OR 17.8), birth by C-section (OR 3.1), potable water at home (OR 2.7) and in utero exposure to antibiotics (OR 2.9).This phenotype was also significantly associated with eosinophil concentration at 2 and 5 years (p < 0.05), number of episodes of respiratory infections (p < 0.01), maternal load with Trichuris trichiura during pregnancy (p < 0.05), and inversely associated with the number of diarrheal episodes by 1 year of age (p < 0.05).Similar to what we had previously found in Canadian babies, atopic-wheezing Ecuadorian babies also exhibit gut microbial dysbiosis at 3 months of age.However, the microbial alterations were different and more pronounced in Ecuadorian babies.Predicted metagenomic analysis showed significant differences in genes involved in carbohydrate and taurine metabolism.Fecal acetate was significantly reduced in atopic wheezers.Ongoing experiments will determine if differences in eukaryome are also associated with asthma risk in this population. Conclusions:This study further supports the importance of the microbiota during the first 100 days of life, although the characteristics of the microbial dysbiosis and epidemiological associations depend on geographical location.Reduced fecal acetate as a common feature in both populations suggests that different microbial alterations may have similar metabolic outcomes.",

Proper negative regulation of this pathway is integral in order to restrict overactive immune responses. Negative regulation of PI3K is predominantly controlled by the lipid phosphatases PTEN and SHIP-1. Inpp5d (Ship1) deficient mice develop spontaneous airway inflammation and have enhanced sensitivity to allergen induced airway inflammation. We hypothesized that deleting Ship1 expression specifically in lineages known to be crucial for adaptive Th2 responses would uncover more subtle effects that could either positively or negatively regulate disease severity in a mouse model of allergic airway inflammation (AAI).",

    "abstract": "Background PAR-2, a G-coupled receptor activated by serine proteinases, is widely expressed in the human body and is involved in inflammation. We have shown that PAR-2 activation in the airways plays a pathogenetic role in mouse models of asthma. PAR-2 expression is increased in the epithelium of asthmatic subjects, but its expression on immune and inflammatory cells of asthmatic individuals has not been. Severe asthma has different phenotypic characteristics from mild-moderate disease. In this study we compared PAR-2 expression on immune cells between subjects with mild/moderate and severe asthma. Methods A total of 36 asthma subjects (24 mild/moderate; 12 severe by ATS guidelines) were recruited at the University of Alberta Hospital and peripheral blood obtained. PAR-2 expression was analyzed by flow cytometry and qRT-PCR in whole blood. Results There were no differences in the % of eosinophils, neutrophils or CD4+ T cells expressing PAR-2 between severe and mild/moderate asthmatics. CD14 high monocytes were classified as classical (CD14++CD16-) or intermediate (CD14++CD16+). No difference in total numbers of either monocyte sub-population was noted between the two asthma groups. More intermediate monocytes from patients with severe asthma (33.6 ±5.1%) expressed PAR-2 compared to patients with mild/moderate asthma (22.4±4.0%, p=0.039), but there was no difference between asthma phenotypes in the percent of classical monocytes expressing PAR-2 (11.7±2.8% vs. 12.5±2.9%). PAR-2 mRNA expression was not different between severe and mild/moderate asthmatics, however, PAR-2 mRNA correlated with total dose of inhaled steroids and inversely correlated with % predicted FEV1. Conclusions PAR-2 expression is increased on intermediate monocytes in subjects with severe asthma. Intermediate monocytes are pro-inflammatory and their numbers are increased in inflammatory diseases. Our data suggest that PAR-2-mediated activation of intermediate monocytes may play ar ole in the pathogenesis of severe asthma, although the effects of PAR-2-mediated activation of these cells are not known.",

We aimed to evaluate the association between low vitamin D levels and sensitization to 59 aeroallergens in Korean adults. Methods We retrospectively reviewed serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) measurements of participants (n = 57,467) in a healthcare center between May 2003 and June 2020. Serum 25(OH)D levels were categorized as follows: severe deficiency (&lt; 10 ng/mL), deficiency (10 to &lt; 20 ng/mL), insufficiency (20 to &lt; 30 ng/mL), and sufficiency (≥ 30 ng/mL). Among all subjects, 1277 simultaneously underwent the multiple allergen simultaneous test. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were used to estimate coefficients and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association between serum vitamin D deficiency and aeroallergen sensitization after adjustment for potential confounders. Subgroup analyses were conducted for the types of aeroallergen (house dust mites, pollens, animal dander, foods, cockroach, and fungus). Results Vitamin D deficiency, defined as serum 25(OH)D level &lt; 20 ng/mL, was noted in 56.4% of participants. There were significant differences in serum 25(OH)D levels according to sex, age, season, and bone mineral density (all P &lt; 0.001). In multiple linear regression analyses, serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly lower in young subjects (adjusted coefficient [95% CI], 0.188 [0.101, 0.275]) and during winter (− 4.114 [− 6.528, − 1.699]). However, no significant association was observed between serum 25(OH)D levels and allergen sensitization (adjusted coefficients [95% CI], − 0.211 [− 1.989, 1.567], P = 0.816). In multivariate logistic regression analyses, male sex, young age, and winter season were significant risk factors for vitamin D deficiency. However, allergen sensitization showed no significant association with 25(OD)D levels after adjusting for confounders (adjusted OR [95% CI], 1.037 [0.642, 1.674] in insufficiency; 0.910 [0.573, 1.445] in deficiency; 0.869 [0.298, 2.539] in severe deficiency groups, P for trend = 0.334). There were consistent findings across subgroups regarding type of aeroallergen sensitized. Conclusion Vitamin D deficiency was prevalent but was not significantly associated with aeroallergen sensitization in Korean adults. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study to evaluate the association between vitamin D deficiency and sensitization to 59 different aeroallergens.",

We explored parent-perceived symptoms of food allergy via breastfeeding and the association with future tolerance. Methods Subjects identified from the Chicago Food Allergy Study (2005–2011) were categorized by parent-reported reactions to maternally ingested foods via breastfeeding (50/898 peanut-allergic, 69/620 egg-allergic, and 153/589 milk-allergic). The primary outcome was tolerance [passed oral food challenge (OFC) or consumption of previously implicated food]. Secondary outcomes included severe reactions (anaphylaxis and/or cardiovascular/respiratory symptoms) and additional concomitant food allergies. Univariate chi-square analyses were performed to assess for association between variables, followed by logistic regression models. Results Of the 50 subjects with parent-reported peanut-associated symptoms with breastfeeding, none gained tolerance. There were no significant associations between parent-reported breastfeeding symptoms and development of tolerance for egg and milk (egg: OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.21–1.01, p = 0.053; milk: OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.70–1.81, p = 0.614). All egg-allergic subjects with parent-perceived symptoms while breastfeeding also reported multiple food allergies (n = 69), but milk- and peanut-allergic subjects were not more likely to have multiple allergies (milk: OR 1.89, 95% CI 0.88–4.02, p = 0.10; peanut: OR 2.36, 95% CI 0.72–7.76, p = 0.16). There were no significant associations between parent-reported breastfeeding symptoms and subsequent reaction severity. Conclusions A significant proportion of parents perceive symptoms of food allergy attributable to indirect breastfeeding exposures. Our exploratory analysis suggests that infants with parent-perceived clinical reactivity to peanut via breastmilk may be less likely to gain tolerance. Infants with parent-reported reactivity to egg via breastmilk exposure were more likely to report multiple food allergies. Further rigorous prospective studies are needed to clarify the true prevalence of IgE-mediated food allergy symptoms attributable to indirect breastfeeding exposures and the association with development of tolerance.",

    "abstract": "True allergy to metronidazole, a common anti-infective in clinical practice, is rarely reported in the literature. In the case of Trichomonas, there are few alternatives to the nitrimidazole class of drugs, and the alternatives that do exist are associated with worse clinical outcomes. Accordingly, for the rare patients with Type 1 hypersensitivity reactions to metronidazole but compelling need, desensitization protocols have been adapted previously. Reactions during these protocols appear common. Patients in previous regimens have required higher level care for observation, which is costly and resource-intensive.We report here on a successful outpatient two-day regimen for metronidazole desensitization. Our patient had compelling indication for metronidazole, but reacted after receiving the very first dose of a previously described desensitization protocol. Accordingly, the protocol was adapted further. Despite this, she went on to develop objective hives prior to reaching the full intended dose. With appropriate symptom management and pre-medication on the second day in clinic, she was successfully desensitized and able to complete a week of full-dose metronidazole. No acute care resources were needed.We propose this two-day desensitization regimen for patients who react during the previously described desensitization protocols. This regimen was effective and safe, and did not necessitate the use of acute-care resources. Two-day desensitization protocols while relatively uncommon, can be successful.",

    "abstract": "Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a syndrome of refractory vasculitis involving the upper respiratory tract, lungs, kidneys, and systemic small and medium-sized arteries that affects all age groups. No pediatric case with a bloody pericardial effusion resulting in cardiac tamponade and co-existing hematochezia has been reported.A 14-year-old boy was referred for evaluation of prolonged fever, chest pain, and intermittent hematochezia. Diagnostic imaging showed a prominent pericardial effusion. Immediately after admission, his systolic blood pressure decreased. Emergent pericardiocentesis resulted in aspiration of a massive amount of bloody pericardial fluid. This was diagnosed as cardiac tamponade because his blood pressure recovered immediately after the drainage. The patient had an elevated serine proteinase 3-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (PR3-ANCA) level on serological examination. Head MRI showed thickening of nasal and sinusoidal mucosa and a cystic mass in the left sphenoid sinus. After ruling out malignancy based on the cytology of the effusion, chest MRI, and gallium scintigraphy, total colonoscopy showed multiple irregular-shaped aphthae from the right transverse colon to the cecum on the contralateral side of the mesenteric attachments. Biopsy specimens of aphthous lesions confirmed necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. A diagnosis of GPA was made based on these findings, and oral prednisolone (PSL) and azathioprine were started. The hematochezia disappeared rapidly, and no recurrence of pericardial effusion was seen after PSL tapering was completed. The PR3-ANCA level decreased into the normal range immediately after the initial therapy.Pericarditis is a common cardiac complication of GPA, but there have been no reports of resultant cardiac tamponade. This is the first case of pediatric GPA with cardiac and gastrointestinal complications preceding the common symptoms such as respiratory or renal symptoms. A case of pediatric GPA with hematochezia is also extremely rare. In conclusion, serial measurement of ANCA levels is important in patients with persistent fever and bloody stool, such as in inflammatory bowel disease, to make the diagnosis of a vasculitic syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Two cases of patients with food and exercise-induced anaphylaxis (FEIA) with confirmed allergies to oral allergy syndrome are herein presented. Patient A had food anaphylaxis to fresh coriander and tomato and Patient B to fresh celery. These food allergens have structural antigenic similarity to that of birch and/or grass. Both patients’ allergies were confirmed by fresh prick-to-prick tests. In both cases, strenuous exercise before the reaction was the only cofactor and the patients had absolutely no symptoms with the offending foods outside of exercise. The exercise had likely lowered the threshold for their reactions. The current literature propose that in FEIA, there is increased GI permeability, leading to enhanced allergen absorption [1]. However, van Nieuvenhoven et al found that intestinal permeability actually decreases with exercise [2]. In fact, Bi and Triadafilopoulos noted in their review that strenuous exercise delays gastric emptying of liquids and solids and inhibits gastric acid production [3]. These studies have led us to propose of a novel paradigm for the mechanism of FEIA. The general inhibitory effects of exercise on the GI tract decrease the digestion of oral allergens, thus leaving the allergens more structurally intact and thereby allowing continued systemic absorption of the allergen. This mechanism is supported by Untersmayr and Jensen-Jarolim’s findings on the increased risk of labile food allergy induction with the use of antacid medications [4]. We propose the decrease in gastric acid in exercise as a more biologically plausible hypothesis of the mechanism of FEIA to oral allergens foods.",

Maternal asthma and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) are two of the bestknown triggers for the perinatal programming of asthma, while the potential role of maternal diabetes has not been widely studied. The goal of this study was to determine if maternal diabetes contributes to the perinatal programming of asthma, and if so, whether its effect is additive or synergistic with respect to ETS exposure and maternal asthma. Methods We studied 3,574 Canadian children, aged 7-8 yr, enrolled in a population-based birth cohort. Standardized questionnaires were completed by the children’s parents, and data were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression. Results Asthma was reported in 442 children (12.4%). Asthmatic children were more likely to have mothers, but not fathers, with diabetes. In children without maternal history of diabetes, ETS exposure increased the risk of child asthma by 1.4-fold (adjusted odds ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-1.73), while maternal asthma increased risk by 3.6-fold (3.59; 2.71-4.76). In children born to diabetic mothers, these effects were amplified to 5.7-fold (5.68; 1.18-27.37) and 11.3-fold (11.30; 2.2656.38), respectively. There was no independent effect of maternal diabetes after adjusting for maternal asthma and ETS exposure (OR 0.65, 95%CI 0.16-2.56).

    "abstract": "Background A number of common aeroallergens have serine proteinase activity, which is important for allergic sensitization. House dust mite (HDM), and other allergens with serine proteinase activity activate Protease-Activated Receptor-2 (PAR-2). We have shown that PAR-2 activation in the airways leads to allergic sensitization to concomitantly inhaled antigens, implicating PAR-2 in the pathogenesis of asthma. We hypothesized that PAR-2 activation in the airways by HDM allergens is important for the development of allergic sensitization. Methods HDM extract was administered to mice intranasally for 5 consecutive days to induce allergic sensitization. One group of mice received a blocking anti-PAR-2 antibody intranasally before each HDM administration. Results Administration of the PAR-2 blocking antibody decreased IL-4, IL13 and IL-33 mRNA as well as IL-4, IL-5 and MIP1A protein levels in the lung tissue, suggesting decreased allergic airway sensitization. Mice sensitized in the presence of the PAR-2 blocking antibody or isotype control were then challenged intranasally with HDM extract for 4 consecutive days. Mucosal exposure to HDM extract induced AHR and airway eosinophilic inflammation. Administration of the anti-PAR-2 blocking antibody during the sensitization phase completely inhibited the development of AHR and airway inflammation in response to HDM challenge. Conclusions These results indicate that HDM extract induces PAR-2dependent allergic sensitization in mice and lead to PAR-2-dependet allergic airway inflammation. These results will allow us to better define the mechanisms of allergic sensitization to allergens with serine proteinase activity.",

There are now a variety of Ancient grains that were previously not used in foodstuff in the Western diet. Kamutâ (khorasan wheat) flour is an ancient grain that was introduced in North America in the late nineties. It is commonly found in multigrain products.\r\n\r\nOur patient is a 24-year-old female with a past medical history of well-controlled asthma. She describes oral itch and throat itch lasting 30 minutes with eating various types of multigrain products over several years. She eats whole wheat and white bread products without difficulty. After ingesting two pieces of pizza made with Kamutâ flour she developed chest tightness, back pain, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, and continued itch in her throat. Her symptoms resolved within an hour of taking an antihistamine. She underwent skin prick testing to the multiple bread products that she had reacted to in the past, as well as Kamutâ flour. Kamutâ flour had a 5mm and 7mm wheal with 22mm and 20mm flare respectively on two independent skin tests. Tests to the other multigrain products were also positive. After review of ingredient lists of the multigrain products she underwent further testing to a number of less commonly used flours and had positive tests to tritecare, quinoa and amaranth flours. She now carries an epinephrine injector and avoids multigrain and ancient grain products, including Kamutâ. To our knowledge this is the first case of anaphylaxis to Kamutâ flour.",

Objective To determine if an online anaphylaxis training program is effective for improving school personnel’ sk nowledge of anaphylaxis and required skills to recognize and respond to an anaphylactic reaction. Methods Setting and Participants: A sample of volunteer personnel using the Toronto District School Board’s learning management system representing the key roles/positions employed within the Board. 72 participants will be recruited, comprised of 60 school-based staff (20 secondary school staff, 40 elementary school staff) and 12 administrative staff (e.g. vice-principals). Design :P rospective pretest/immediate post-test/delayed post-test educational research effectiveness study. Intervention: A 45 minute online training program on anaphylaxis, based on the second edition of the handbook, Anaphylaxis in Schools and Other Settings (2005-2009, CSACI) and training materials from Anaphylaxis Canada, and adapted for e-learning using best practices in multimedia training. Primary Outcomes: In addition to self-report of learning satisfaction and self-efficacy, knowledge acquisition and retention will be assessed via pretest, immediate post-test, and delayed post-test. Skills to recognize an anaphylactic reaction and administer an epinephrine auto-injector will be assessed by scenario-based questions and tasks. Utilization and completion rates of the program, as well as time on task, will be measured by the Learning Management System. Analysis: Repeated measures ANCOVA will be performed with co-variates of time on task, and pretest score to control for prior knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Background A vast majority of asthma exacerbations are linked to viral infections, most of which are caused by rhinovirus (RV). We hypothesize that eosinophils are key effector cells in asthma exacerbations. As such, using an in vitro model of human cells, we have shown that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and RV induce eosinophil degranulation when co-cultured with T-cells and autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDC), concurrent with moDC-dependent CD4+ CD45RO+ T-cell activation. While our original hypothesis has been that such activation is mediated solely by antigen-presentation (AP), our recent data also suggest that RV may be the major pathogen associated with asthma attacks because of its unique ability to interact directly with T-cells. Materials and methods Human monocytes, T-lymphocytes, autologous moDC and eosinophils (EOS) were isolated from blood. moDC were cultured with RSV, RV, or sham, then washed, and incubated with autologous T-cells. To determine the role for antigen presentation, some moDC were treated with the inhibitor chloroquine before virus culture. In some, no moDc were added and T lymphocytes (CD4, CD8 or a mix) were exposed to RSV, RV or UV-inactivated RV (RV-UV). T-cell activation and apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry (CD25 expression and Annexin-V/TO-PRO-3 staining, respectively), and proliferation by BrdU incorporation (Cell Proliferation ELISA, Roche). EOS cysteinyl-leukotriene (Cys-LT) release was measured by ELISA (Cayman Chemical). Cytokine release was measured by Searchlight (Pierce). Results RV presence induced a 5-fold increase in Cys-LT release from EOS co-cultured with T-cells and moDC, while RSV did not have any effect. In T-cell and moDC cocultures, RV induced greater increases in IL-1beta, IL10, IL-12p70, IL-13 and IFN-gamma compared with RSV. T-cells, and more evidently CD8+ T-cells, showed increased apoptosis when incubated with RV but not with RV-UV or RSV. Virus-loaded moDC induced proliferation of T-cells, but, unlike RSV, RV was insensitive to chloroquine. Conclusions Our results suggest that RSV and RV induce EOS and T-cell activation differentially. RSV induces proliferation in a MHC-II restricted antigen-presentation-dependent manner, while for RV this is not the sole pathway. In addition, based on cytokine and Cys-LT release, RV appears to be more potent compared to RSV. Our data are relevant to help understand why RV is so potent in the induction of asthma exacerbation in allergic patients, and will lead to novel potential targets for improved preventative strategies.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge translation (KT) promotes evidenced-based medicine but methods used to support related practices are often not evidence based [1,2]. Implementation research is complex, as it requires taking into account multiple levels (from patients, multidisciplinary healthcare teams and health facilities to local and national health care systems), which adds to the significant conceptual and methodological challenges that currently exist. These challenges are likely the reasons why the impact of implementation strategies has been modest and why conclusions that can be drawn from these approaches and how they should be applied to given settings are so limited.\r\n\r\nThere is pressure to improve quality of care, but there is a lack of information about which interventions work and under what circumstances. Most studies registered in the Cochrane collaboration are RCTs (~350,000), but only 2,400 are experimental and quasi-experimental trials of interventions to improve health care delivery. There is a need to shift the focus from developing new treatments to developing approaches that deliver what is already known to work and to create and evaluate interventions from evidence-based knowledge. Given the limited evidence base to work from, people involved in quality improvement (QI) have a responsibility to evaluate the effectiveness of their efforts not only because many interventions are ineffective and may lead to a waste of resources, but also because evaluation creates knowledge that may benefit others.\r\n\r\nWhen considering how to evaluate the impact of an intervention, one should first consider whether the interest is in local knowledge (i.e., whether an intervention worked in the context in which it was implemented, which is of interest to managers responsible for QI within an institution) or generalizable knowledge (i.e., whether an intervention is likely to work in comparable settings which is of interest to KT researchers). Determining the need for local or generalizable knowledge and available resources drives most choices in KT intervention study designs. Evaluation study designs include randomized controlled trials (the gold standard for assessing causality and impact of interventions); and non-randomized or quasi-experimental designs (e.g., controlled/uncontrolled before-after, and interrupted time series designs), which are more subject to biases but require fewer resources. These designs vary in their ability to control for bias to increase internal validity, but even the perfectly valid study may not determine the degree to which the results can be generalized to real practice conditions. Pragmatic study designs can facilitate this by maximizing the relevance of the results for real world decision-making, often for a broad range of settings. Despite a large number of studies, many knowledge gaps still remain. Rigorous evaluation of QI initiatives (using both quantitative studies to better understand “if” something works supplemented by qualitative studies to understand “why”) are needed to increase our knowledge of KT and to improve quality of care.",

    "abstract": "Mast cells (MC) are primary effector cells of IgE-mediated allergic inflammation. Nitric oxide (NO) is a short-lived free radical that regulates MC activities including inhibition of MC degranulation. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of NO in MC, we investigated protein tyrosine nitration in human mast cell lines treated with the NO donor S-Nitrosoglutathione (SNOG). Using 2D gel western blot analysis with an anti-nitrotyrosine antibody together with mass spectroscopy, we identified aldolase A, an enzyme of the glycolytic pathway as a target for tyrosine nitration in MC. Human MC lines HMC-1 and LAD-2 were treated with SNOG and the total aldolase activity and the intracellular fructose 1,6 bisphosphate (FBP), the substrate for aldolase were measured using a standard aldolase assay. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) was employed to define the metabolic changes associated with NO treatment. MC degranulation was measured using β-hexosaminidase assay. Aldolase A nitration was associated with reduction in the Michaelis constant (Km) and maximum velocity (Vmax) of aldolase in HMC-1 and LAD-2. NMR analysis showed that despite these changes in activity of a critical enzyme in glycolysis, there was no significant change in total cellular ATP content, although the AMP/ATP ratio was altered. Elevated levels of lactate and pyruvate suggested that NO treatment enhanced glycolysis in MC. Moreover, reduction in MC aldolase activity was associated with increased intracellular levels of its substrate, fructose 1,6 bisphosphate (FBP). Interestingly, FBP inhibited IgE-mediated MC degranulation in LAD-2 cells. Inhibition of MC degranulation by FBP has the potential to regulate MC function through multiple signaling pathways including phospholipase C (PLC). We are currently dissecting the precise signaling pathways underlying the effects of FBP. Analyses of the possible links between aldolase nitration, altered FBP levels and the regulation of MC function will evaluate the potential immunoregulatory role of FBP in allergic and immune diseases.\r\n\r\nSupported by: Canadian Institutes of Health Research, The Lung Association, Alberta & NWT and 75th Anniversary award, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta.",

    "abstract": "This was an analysis of the SAGE nested case-control, comprised of children with asthma (40%), no asthma and no allergy (40%), and rhinitis no asthma (20%). 486 children were seen at 8-10 years and again at 12-13 years. All children were assessed by a pediatric allergist and had skin testing to common aeroallergens. At 8-10 years, the families of children with a positive sensitization to HDM received an information brochure on environmental control for HDM. Parent modification of their home environment was defined as encasement of the child’s mattress or pillow and/or removal of carpet for the child’ sb edroom. Results 113 of the 486 children were sensitized to HDM (D. pteronyssinus or D.farinae). Of the 113 families, 49 undertook a home environment change. 30/49 (61%) of parents had children with asthma and 19/49 (39%) did not. Interestingly, the percent of parents who modified their environment did not significantly differ between those with asthmatic children (44%) and those with healthy children (42%). Conclusion Almost two-thirds of the families in the SAGE study made changes to their home environment because of HDM sensitization in their asthmatic child. However, these families were no more likely to change their environment than families with a child without asthma. We need to better understand the factors involved with parents’ willingness to modify their home environment for a child with asthma.",

    "abstract": "In addition to their role in allergic disease, mast cells can respond to many pathogens through the production of proinflammatory mediators. Mast cells are located close to blood vessels and sites of pathogen exposure. T and NK cells must reach sites of infection to eliminate affected cells, however possible mechanisms mediating this migration are poorly understood. We hypothesized that human mast cells exposed to virus-associated stimuli can recruit T cells and natural killer (NK) cells.\r\n\r\nPrimary cultures of human cord blood-derived mast cells (CBMC) were activated with poly(I:C), a synthetic analogue of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), or infected with mammalian reovirus.\r\n\r\nCBMC stimulated with poly(I:C) or reovirus produced several chemokines including CCL4 and CXCL8. In vitro chemotaxis assays using human peripheral blood T cells and NK cells demonstrated a predominant migration of NK cells to poly(I:C)-CBMC supernatants. Reovirus infection of CBMC induced the recruitment of both NK cells and multiple T cell subsets, NK cell recruitment was dependent on CXCL8.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is the first study to demonstrate that virus-stimulated mast cells induce the chemotaxis of NK cells and T cells. These findings may be useful for developing approaches to recruit potent immune effector cells to sites of viral infection, and enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of virus-induced exacerbations of allergic disease.\r\n\r\nThis work was supported by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.",

    "abstract": "Background Semaphorins are a family of proteins implicated in neurogenesis, angiogenesis and axonal migration. Previous work from our laboratory has shown that Th2stimulated B cells express a unique semaphorin, SEMA4C. Given the roles of other semaphorins, we hypothesized that SEMA4C was expressed on Th2stimulated B cells and might play a role in B cell trafficking and tissue homing therefore being expressed stronger in terminally differentiated B cells, such as memory and plasma cells. Experiment and results B cells were purified from tonsils removed from children undergoing routine tonsillectomy. They were cultured for 24 hours or 7 days at a concentration of 5X10 4 cells/mL in complete medium in the presence of aCD40 with either IFNg, IL-4, IL-21 or both IL-4 and IL-21. RNA was extracted, cDNA was made, and SEMA4C mRNA was amplified by qPCR and compared to the housekeeping gene GAPDH. After 24h culture, SEMA4C mRNA expression was detected only in IL-4stimulated cells but after 7 days, the expression was much stronger in both conditions containing IL-21, and decreased in IL-4-only stimulated cells. B cells were also similarly cultured for 72 hours at a concentration of 0.5X10 6 cells/mL in chamber slides. Slides were stained for SEMA4C with a fluorescent Alexa488 antibody and then visualized using fluorescent microscopy. As expected, stimulation with IL-21 yielded much higher SEMA4C expression than IL-4 alone whereas IFNg did not induce significant staining. Figures 1 and 2. Conclusion SEMA4C is induced in B cells upon Th2 stimulation but increases further upon follicle-like differentiation triggered by IL-21. This data confirms that SEMA4C is specific to terminally-differentiated B cells and supports our hypothesis that it might play a role in B-cell trafficking and homing in peripheral tissue follicles. SEMA4C could therefore be a key player in local allergic inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Mast cells are abundant at the periphery of the majority of solid tumors where they typically promote angiogenesis and enhance tumor growth. However, there is some evidence from epidemiological studies that allergic disease reduces cancer risk. In the context of infection, mast cell activation with Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists induces the production of multiple mediators which mobilize and activate known anti-tumor effector cells. TLR agonists can also be effective in tumor immunotherapy. We demonstrate that the TLR2 agonist Pam3CSK4 is tumor inhibitory and mediates its effects via mast cell activation and reversal of the normal pro-tumorigenic activity of mast cells. TLR2 agonist treatment decreased B16.F10 tumor growth in wild-type mice, but not in mast cell deficient Kit W-sh/W-sh mice. Tumor growth inhibition following TLR2 agonist administration was restored in Kit W-sh/W-sh mice by local reconstitution with wild-type, but not TLR2-deficient mast cells. Mast cell dependent tumor growth inhibition occurred independently of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production and was not associated with direct tumor cytotoxicity or degranulation in vitro. Tumor growth inhibition was associated with mast cell dependent recruitment of natural killer (NK) and T cells. This study demonstrates that local mast cell activation provides a novel opportunity to modify the tumor microenvironment for successful cancer immunotherapy. Supported by the CCSRI and CIHR.

    "abstract": "Eosinophils are major effector cells in allergic inflammatory response. They are known to synthesize, store, and release a wide range of pro-inflammatory mediators. Eosinophils contain different populations of mediator-storage organelles, including small secretory vesicles as well as crystalloid granules. In cytolysis, eosinophil cell membrane loses its integrity and crystalloid granules are released to extracellular space. Potential function of crystalloid granules in extracellular space as it relates to inflammatory events remains widely unknown. We hypothesized that eosinophil crystalloid granules are equipped to function independently in extracellular space. Our findings indicate that both DNA and RNA localize to human and rabbit eosinophil crystalloid granules and that RNA seems to be synthesized in intra-granular space further suggesting the presence of functional transcription machinery inside the granules. Furthermore, we show here that crystalloid granules express functional membrane receptors for a cytokine, IFN-gamma, as well as G protein-coupled membrane receptors for a chemokine, eotaxin. Our findings indicate that these receptors function by activating signal-transducing pathways within granules leading to mediator release from granules to extra-granular space in a cell free environment. Taken together our findings define a new potential role for eosinophil crystalloid granules as independent extracellular functional units in inflammatory events and may reveal a novel target in modulating the inflammatory events.",

    "abstract": "The 2006 GINA report recommends control driven treatment of asthma in children. This raises the question of how to define good asthma control. A pragmatic and short definition of asthma control could be: Resolution of symptoms and elimination of disease variability. This sounds easy to assess, but several studies have found that accurate assessment of asthma control is difficult in clinical practice. Physicians often over-estimate the level of asthma control and patients often under-report symptoms and the impact the asthma has on their daily life. A main reason for this is that accurate assessment of symptom resolution and disease variability requires assessment of a variety of outcomes such as day and night symptoms, need for rescue medication, impairment of daily activities such as school, work and participation in physical activities, frequency of exacerbations and measurement of the variability of lung function with time, either spontaneously or in association with a beta2 agonist or a provocation test such as a standardized exercise challenge. Assessment of all these outcomes in a child is complex due to communication problems with the child and the family and an unconscious adjustment of the daily lifestyle.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate this accurate assessments of asthma control a variety of validated, easy to use instruments have been developed. These include the Asthma Control Test (ACT) (http://www.asthmacontrol.com), the Childhood Asthma Control Test, the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) (http://www.qoltech.co.uk/acq.html ), the Asthma Therapy Assessment Questionnaire (ATAQ) (http://www.ATAQInstrument.com), and the Asthma Control Scoring System and the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire. Most of these have been developed for and validated in adults, but some also exist in a version validated for paediatric use in school children. Their value in clinical practice, which may be quite different from the research setting in which they have been validated, requires further evaluation.\r\n\r\nThe value and shortcomings of the various measurements and tools normally used to assess asthma control in children is discussed and the importance of using combinations of several outcomes and validated, easy to use instruments is emphasised. Due to communication problems with children and their families some objective measures should always be included in the assessment of control.\r\n\r\nA combination of the 1) Childhood Asthma Control Test, 2) three weeks of diary recordings of symptoms, rescue beta2 use and morning and evening peak expiratory flow rate and 3) a standardized exercise challenge test will detect more that 95% of uncontrolled asthma in a population seen in primary care.",

    "abstract": "Objective/purpose The prevalence of asthma in Canada (and worldwide) has been increasing over the last 20 years with currently over 3 million Canadians suffering from it. Asthma appears to result from environmental influences directing a genetically predisposed host towards a pro-allergic, Th2-dominated immune response. Studies in humans and animals identify the time around birth and early infancy as a period during which the decision of proallergic versus non-allergic immune responses to environmental stimuli appears to be made. Presumably this is the reason why the incidence of first diagnosis is highest in infants and children, although asthma can occur at any age. The very fact that all three components (environmental, genetic and developmental) are necessary for asthma to occur also offers the opportunity to intervene early in life through e.g. vaccination against allergies. Vaccination as a strategy to prevent or cure asthma is a tremendous opportunity. An ideal vaccine would be one that prevents or cures asthma after only one dose and protects for life. It is well established that the whole heat-killed bacterium Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) given as an adjuvant along with model allergens effectively prevent allergic sensitization and/or allergic inflammation in adult animals following local allergen challenge. We have successfully developed a novel, live, but highly attenuated neonatal vaccine platform based on the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes (Lm). Our published data suggest that our Lm-based vaccine platform is capable of inducing strong anti-allergic immune responses for an entire life only after one dose given to newborn mice. Now we have investigated whether our Lm-based vaccine platform will provide protection from allergic reactions upon challenge with the allergen, after only one immunization given around birth. Our specific aim addressed the following objective: Do our Listeria monocytogenes vaccine strains producing model allergen ovalbumin (OVA) and inducing a strong Th1 response, prevent allergic reactions upon challenge with the allergen in a neonatal mouse model?",

    "abstract": "Asthma is still not optimally controlled in Canada, as in other countries [1,2]. As an effort to determine what could be optimal care of this chronic condition, Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) have been produced and revised regularly in the last two decades, although recent reports suggest that they are not still sufficiently implemented, particularly into primary care [1-4]. Cabana et al. had reported, following a systematic literature review of studies on barriers to adherence to CPGs, that more than half of physicians were not aware of the exact content of current guidelines; common barriers to guidelines implementation included a lack of agreement and/or motivation to change, a lack of self-efficacy, inertia of previous practice, and external factors, such as lack of time and insufficient resources [4].\r\n\r\nIn regard to asthma, we previously reported data from questionnaires completed by 2,605 Canadian practitioners [5]; we observed that Canadian Asthma Consensus Guidelines (CACG) were considered well known only by a minority of Primary care Physicians (PCP) and that significant discrepancies existed between this Guideline’s recommendations and current care, such as a low use of objective measures of airflow limitation to assist with diagnosis, difficulties with proper assessment of medication needs, a low provision of written action plans for patients and an infrequent referral to other health professionals for asthma education. In keeping with this initial study, following a recent Canadian survey, we proposed that an insufficient use of objective measures for the diagnosis of asthma explained the over-diagnosis of asthma observed [6].\r\n\r\nMore recently, using a sample of patients treated in primary care in Canada, we confirmed that many patients still do not enjoy adequate guideline-defined asthma control, particularly women, current smokers, older patients and those who lack a written action plan for exacerbation management [1]. However, primary care physicians recognized a lack of control among most asthma patients and were likely to recommend appropriate medication changes and aftercare to patients who fail to achieve guideline targets for asthma control. This, therefore, suggests that although there have been improvements in guideline implementation, some care gaps still persist.\r\n\r\nIn order to better understand how Canadian guidelines are implemented and to develop targeted strategies to improve their translation into current care, we developed a new tool, the Physicians’ Practice Assessment Questionnaire (PPAQ) [7]. As an initial assessment of this tool, implementation of fourteen key-recommendations on asthma management from the most recent CACG was evaluated in a group of 47 general practitioners7. Validation of the questionnaire showed good internal consistency and good test-retest, and revealed that the lowest self-reported rates of implementation were for: 1) referral for patient education; 2) provision of a written action plan; 3) regular assessment of inhaler technique; and 4) referral to a specialist for difficult to control asthma or uncertain diagnosis. This suggests that in order to improve asthma control, these specific behaviors should be addressed and translation of these recommendations facilitated.\r\n\r\nFinally, in regard to rhinitis, under-diagnosis and under-treatment of rhinitis seems common and although international guidelines are available, we need to better understand how physicians integrate their recommendations into care [8]. Barriers and facilitators of guidelines’ translation into current care should be further addressed.",

C5a mediates itspro-inflammatory effects via interaction with two C5areceptors, C5aR and C5L2. C5aR initiates G protein-coupled receptor signaling while C5L2 is not coupled toG proteins and its role in C5a-mediated immune pro-cesses is not well understood. We hypothesized thatmast cells (MC) expressed C5aR and/or C5L2 and thatC5a activated MC through these receptors.MethodsHuman MC (LAD2) and bone marrow-derived MC(BMMC) were stimulated with C5a and degranulationwas determined by measurement ofb-hexosaminidaserelease. BMMC were cultured from bone marrow ofwild type and CL52 knock-out mice in interleukin-4(300U/ml) and stem cell factor (50ng/ml). Tumor necro-sis factor (TNF), granulocyte macrophage colony-stimu-lating factor (GM-CSF), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10)production was measuredby cytometric bead array.Expression of C5aR and C5L2 receptors was analyzed byquantitative PCR (qPCR) and flow cytometry.ResultsC5a (100ng/ml) stimulated LAD2 degranulation (25%) andproduction of TNF (22±1.3pg/ml), GM-CSF (15±0.4pg/ml), MCP-1 (53±3.6pg/ml) and IP-10 (32±4.3pg/ml).qPCR showed that LAD2 expressed mRNA for C5a andC5L2 and flow cytometry showed that LAD2 expressedsurface C5L2 but not C5aR.

    "abstract": "Access to information is essential to effective and efficient clinical practice. On one hand, clinicians must keep track of new scientific evidence relevant to their field of practice. On the other hand, encounters with patients generate questions requiring answers in order to provide adequate clinical care. The main challenge is to access truly useful information that is: 1) relevant to clinical practice, 2) scientifically valid, and 3) requires minimal efforts to find, to appraise and to decide to integrate or not into practice. [1] The Internet now allows both staying up-to-date and finding answers to clinical questions.\r\n\r\nThree main strategies can be used to take advantage of Internet resources: “push”, “pull” and “exchange.” The “push” strategy is similar to subscribing to a paper-based medical journal. The main purpose of this strategy is to keep aware of new knowledge relevant to practice. Many organizations offer to “push” clinical information to health care providers through Web portals (e.g.,, amc.ca, Journal Watch), e-mails alerts (e.g.,, InfoPratique, InfoPoem, evidenceupdates, Dynamed Weekly updates, GFD journal alerts, Pubmed) and RSS (Really Simple Syndication) (e.g.,, RSS4medics). There is, however, a risk of being rapidly overloaded with useless information, either irrelevant to practice, invalid, and/or needing extensive work to appraise, if pushed information is not judiciously selected.\r\n\r\nInformation can also be actively searched for (“pull” strategy), usually for the purpose of answering clinical questions. Most often, electronic tools offer a much faster and broader access to information than searching through piles of medical journals accumulating on shelves over the years. From databases of original studies (e.g., Medline, Embase) and systematic reviews (e.g., Cochrane Library) to virtual libraries (e.g., MD Consult, Stat!Ref), repositories of clinical practice guidelines (e.g., CMA Infobase, National Guideline Clearinghouse), critical summaries, synopsis of original articles (e.g., InfoCritique, ACP Journal Club, InfoPoem, Clinical Evidence) and evidence-based e-textbooks (e.g., UpToDate, Essential Evidence Plus, ACP PIER, Dynamed), a huge amount of clinical information can be accessed on the Web or on a personal digital assistant (PDA). Federated search engines searching simultaneous resources such as Infoclinique, TripDatabase and MacPlus can ease the process of finding answers to clinical questions in the maze of information. Most questions can be answered by a judicious combination of just a few of these resources.\r\n\r\nReaching out to colleagues to obtain or share information about a clinical question has always been valued by health care professionals. This “exchange” strategy for keeping up-to-date and answering clinical questions is increasingly available through Web 2.0 functionalities (blogs/tweeters, wikis, pod/podcasts). Website such as Asklepios from the Canadian Medical Association is an example of the multiple initiatives now available to foster communities of practice among health care providers who are sharing similar interests. However, we are still at the “early adapters” phase of implementation and the effectiveness of these new e-tools to improve healthcare has yet to be demonstrated. By combining selected “push” and “pull” resources, the internet can provide access to useful information to facilitate evidence-based clinical care.",

    "abstract": "Over the last half-century, chronic disease incidence, including allergic manifestations (AM), has increased exponentially in developed nations and amongst the wealthy in developing nations. Concurrently, there has been a “nutrition transition” in the same populations. Dietary patterns have shifted from a prudent diet (high fruit and vegetable-, and omega-3 fatty acid intake; low omega-6 fatty acid intake) to a western-style diet (higher levels omega-6 fats, lower amounts of fresh fruits and vegetables, and omega-3 fats). While diet can impact health at any life stage, it is likely to be most important during the fetal and infancy periods, when the immune system is immature. Based on an extensive review of the literature, we considered this hypothesis for the 3 nutritional progressions from fetal life through infancy: prenatal nutrition, breastfeeding and introduction of solid foods. While there is little conclusive evidence to support that a prudent diet is protective against AM especially after birth, modest evidence suggests that a prenatal maternal nutrition high in n-3 and micronutrients (e.g. vitamins C, D and E) protect against AM. This indicates that there may be a window of opportunity during fetal development in which allergic manifestation risk may be altered. The effect of breastfeeding on the prevention AM is unresolved. Despite this, exclusive breastfeeding to 4-6 months should be encouraged as human milk contains numerous immunological properties and is associated with other health benefits. If breastfeeding is not possible, hydrolyzed formulas seem to confer a greater protective effect than traditional formulas. Solid foods should be introduced at age 4-6 months. The order of introduction seems to have little effect on AM. At present, it is impossible to conclusively state that a particular dietary pattern or food will alter AM risk in infants. Implications for research and practice are also discussed.",

The aim of this study was to determine the size of any patient survival benefit from such interactive case-based learning method [1] aimed at facilitating implementation of guidelines in primary care.\r\n\r\nThis was a prospective randomized controlled trial in a primary care practice setting, in Stockholm, Sweden. New guidelines for secondary prevention in coronary artery disease were mailed to all general practitioners in the area and presented at a common lecture in 1995. The general practitioners were randomized according to their Primary Health Care Center into well-matched patient/physician pairs and were randomly allocated to active intervention with either exposure to a case-based learning method or usual care. General practitioners in the intervention group participated in recurrent case-based learning dialogues at their Primary Health Care Centers during a two-year period. A locally well-known cardiologist served as the facilitator. Consecutive patients (n=255) with coronary artery disease were included. Ten-year mortality rates were obtained from the Cause of Death register and were assessed as all cause and cardiovascular mortality.\r\n\r\nThe two Primary Health Care Center groups of patients and physicians were well matched and did not differ at baseline. The attendance rate at the seminars was 82% or higher. After ten years, nineteen (44%) of the patients included in the control group had deceased compared to 10 (22%) in the intervention group (p=0.017; log rank test). The inclusion of the covariates age, sex, hypertension, smoking and diabetes did not change the results. Patients treated by a specialist died at a rate comparable to the intervention group (23%). Cardiovascular mortality was 32% in the control group and 16% in the intervention group (p=0.007).\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, case-based learning methods for general practitioners improved survival in patients with coronary artery disease. The hazard ratio (HR) of survival between intervention and usual care is 0.45 (95% CI 0.20-0.95) if the case-based learning method is used to assist implementation of evidence based care.",

    "abstract": "Objective/purposeFenretinide [N-4-hydroxyphenyl, 4HPR] is a syntheticretinoid derived from vitamin A with pro-apoptotic andanti-inflammatory properties. Studies have shown thatat high concentrations fenretinide is an effective anti-neoplastic agent, regulating cell growth and differentia-tion. We have recently demonstrated that fenretinide, atdoses 5-10× lower than for cancer treatment, has pro-tective effect against bacterial infection[1] and osteo-porosis[2] in Cftr-knockout mice. The effect offenretinide as a potential treatment for allergic asthmainduced inflammation has not been evaluated in asth-matics. The goal of this study was to determine if, bynormalizing inflammatory mediators, fenretinide wouldbe able to alleviate the symptoms associated with aller-gic asthma.MethodsHyperresponsive to methacholine, mice of A/J strainwere sensitized weekly using ovalbumin (OVA) forthree consecutive weeks, then age-matched and sepa-rated into two study groups and two control groups.For a period of 4 weeks, the study groups were orallytreated with fenretinide while the controls were treatedwith the drug vehicle. During the last week of treat-ment, the control and study groups were split into twoadditional groups and underwent allergen challengesfor three consecutive days, with either an OVA solu-tion or PBS. Forty-eight hours after the third challenge,resistance of the respiratory system of the mice inresponse to methacholine was measured using a Buxcoplethysmograph. Total IgE in plasma was measured byELISA. Lung histopathology was observed using H&Eand PAS stains.FindingsVehicle treated OVA challenged mice exhibited highvalues of airway resistance, plasma IgE concentration,and immune cell infiltration into the airways comparedto PBS challenged animals. Interestingly, fenretinidetreated OVA challenged mice had a statistically lowerrespiratory resistance. In addition, fenretinide treatmentabrogated the recruitment of eosinophils to the regionsurrounding the blood vessels and airways. Similarly,after drug treatment a decrease in goblet cell hyperplasiawas also observed through histopathology. However, nodifference was observed in the level of plasma IgEbetween the control and study groups.DeliverablesFenretinide has been demonstrated to have great poten-tial as a therapeutic agent. Our findings provide a novelapproach to treat allergen-induced asthma and will helpus in pursuing these studies towards the use of thisdrug for patients suffering from allergic asthma.RelevanceThe data presented herein will facilitate the develop-ment of fenretinide as a therapeutic compound in thetreatment of allergic asthma and provide the foundationfor the identification of drug targets for the developmentof effective future drugs.",

In the third phase of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys conducted in the USA (1988 to1994) over 15% of tested individuals had positive skin-test responses to this extract. The rate of skin test positivity to Russian thistle in Canada is unknown. Objective To determine the prevalence of skin test positivity to Russian Thistle in patients from Kingston and the Southeastern Ontario catchment area, and the possible clinical significance of the same. Methods A retrospective chart review was performed to document the rate of sensitization amongst tested patients to Russian thistle extract (Hollister-Steir). Only patients with appropriate histamine responses were included. We collected demographic data in addition to the presence/ absence of relevant clinical symptoms. Results Of 410 charts reviewed, 170 underwent skin testing to Russian thistle. Of these, 17(10%) were positive. Of the test-positive cohort, 47% (8/17) had symptoms that correlated seasonally with the predominant Russian thistle pollen season (August-October). The mean age of skin-test positive individuals was 35.2 years. 82% and 52.9% of these had concomitant positive skin tests to ragweed and birch, respectively, allergens with known cross-reactivity. Conclusions This preliminary evaluation suggests that the prevalence of skin test positivity to Russian thistle in the studied area is approximately 10%, with about half of these individuals reporting correlative seasonal symptoms. Including Russian thistle in routine skin testing panel may better establish the clinical significance of this environmental allergen.

Patients’ age ranged from 2 to 19 years old, 7 patients being below the age of 10. Six out of the 10 patients were transitioned from IVIg to SCIg: 4 patients due to systemic side effects associated to IVIg perfusions and 2 patients due to poor quality of life related to frequent travels to the hospital for IVIg infusion. Four out of the 10 patients were Ig naive patients and were started directly on SCIg. All patients received a weekly dose of 100mg/Kg infused in two different sites assisted by a battery-powered pump. Patients were given a 1:1 dose when transitioned from IVIg to SCIg. A significant increase of the IgG level was noted in all patients. All patients tolerated very well SCIg therapy with no reported systemic adverse reactions. Local infusion sites reactions were the most frequent observed reactions with a frequency similar to the one observed in patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDD). Lastly, parents reported improvement in quality of life under SCIg therapy; their child had improved social functioning, better resistance against infections and much improved overall health. Conclusion While home-based SCIg administration relative to hospital-based IVIg has been shown to improve PIDD patients’ quality of life, we believe that SCIg has the potential to improve patient’s satisfaction and independence also in patients with secondary hypogammaglobulinemia.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of respiratory disease (asthma, allergies and COPD) has increased dramatically in the last 25 years, with a heavy economic and social burden. Provision of information is recognized as a means to improve patient knowledge and self-management skills, and can overall result in improved disease management and quality of life. The Partnership in Lung Age Testing and Education (PLATE) Programme was a one-year demonstration project designed to investigate the effectiveness of a population-based approach to the management of respiratory disease. The PLATE objectives were: to improve patient education and disease management skills; increase public awareness about respiratory disease; and promote a healthy lifestyle. During phase one, 13 Airways Clinics were established in Toronto and Hamilton at various community settings (e.g. pharmacies, shopping malls, libraries), providing community residents with respiratory health education, which aimed to improve the implementation of best practices for chronic disease management through clinical assessments, peak flow testing, and follow-up with regular health care providers. Project participants were categorized into three groups: 1) with physician-diagnosed asthma (61%); 2) with physician-diagnosed COPD (11%); and 3) with respiratory symptoms, but without a diagnosis and/or long-time smokers (28%). More than half (60%) of the participants were female; over 75% were over the age of 40 years. Participants were provided with an educational kit to encourage ongoing education for management of their chronic disease. Phase two is currently under-way and includes a community outreach component, in addition to a follow-up survey to examine changes in the levels of knowledge gained from phase one. Despite the small sample size (87 participants), findings indicate that the highest level of interest came from high-needs communities, and that pharmacies are the most appropriate setting within which to host clinics, while shopping malls are best for information displays. More research is needed to confirm these findings.",

    "abstract": "Objective/purposeIn asthmatic individuals, airway narrowing representsthe early phase of the asthmatic response to allergeninhalation challenge, occurring within thirty minutes [1].In 50-60% of allergic asthmatic adults, the earlyresponse is followed by the late phase asthmaticresponse, usually starting between 3-4 hours after aller-gen inhalation challenge [2], and characterized mainlyby cellular inflammation of the airway [3]. The pathwaysleading to the late response are not completely under-stood. Understanding these pathways is important forevaluating allergic diseases such as asthma. In contrastto the more transient isolated early response, develop-ment of the late response is associated with the hall-mark inflammatory features of chronic allergic disease.MethodsNine adult subjects participating in ethically approvedallergen challenge studies were recruited followinginformed consent. Inclusion criteria included non-smo-kers with stable, mild to moderate atopic asthma, free ofother lung diseases. Subjects developing either an iso-lated early asthmatic response (≥20% drop in FEV1within 2 hours) or the dual asthmatic response (earlyresponse + ≥15% drop in FEV1 between 3-7 hours)were studied.

A high prevalence of atopy was found in children with recurrent wheeze who were at high risk of developing persistent asthma based on the Asthma Predictive Index (API)[1]. A newly modified API now includes allergic sensitization to aeroallergens and to foods as criteria for the risk assessment of persistent asthma in children with recurrent wheeze. However, associations between wheeze and atopy in the absence of asthma have not been extensively examined. Since atopy is considered a risk marker for asthma in children with recurrent wheeze, we predicted that it would not be associated with wheeze when asthma was absent.",

    "abstract": "Background Nitric oxide (NO) is a short-lived, reactive molecule generated by nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Three isoforms of NOS have been identified including: neuronal NOS (NOS1), endothelial NOS (NOS3) and inducible NOS (NOS2). Objective To identify expression of isoforms of NOS in nasal polyps (NP) and normal nasal tissue, and to determine if differences exist in NOS expression in NP rich in eosinophils (Eo-hi) or with few eosinophils (Eo-low). Methods NP were obtained after endoscopic surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis, and separated into two categories based on eosinophil density. Nasal middle turbinates (MT) were also collected as normal controls from patients who had undergone surgery for pituitary adenomas. To identify cell types expressing isoforms of NOS, double immunostaining was performed using anti-NOS and anti-leukocyte antibodies (e.g. mast cells [MC], eosinophils, T cells and macrophages). Results Expression of NOS isoforms in all cell types was greater in NP than in MT. Number of NOS2 positive cells in Eo-hi NP was higher than in Eo-low NP. However, there were no differences in the numbers of NOS1 and NOS3 positive cells between Eo-hi and Eo-low NP. Both NOS2 positive MC and NOS2 positive Eo were significantly greater in NP than in MT. In addition, the percentage of NOS2 positive MC in Eo-hi NP was significantly higher than in Eo-low NP. Conclusion Elevation in NOS2 expression in several cell types might be an important factor in the life history of NP, especially those with an abundance of eosinophils.",

    "abstract": "The concept of whether there are mutual substitutions of antibodies on cell surfaces has not received much attention to date, presumably because it does not look important. However, it could be far more relevant than first appearance because most, if not all, allergic diseases could be cured if nonpathogenic antibodies substituted pathogenic antibodies on the surface of mast cells.\r\n\r\nIn 1976, Turton reported that his hay fever had been cured after three time-repeated infections and exterminations of hookworm [1]. In 1979, Kojima hypothesized in a domestic journal that antihookworm antibodies might have saturated all Fc receptors on Turton's mast cells [2].\r\n\r\nIf there were only two antibody molecules on a cell, their mutual substitution could occur in a probability of 1/2 because an equilibrium state exists between free and cell-bound antibodies. If there were three antibody molecules, the probability would be 2/3. It follows that when N antibody molecules are present, the probability of their mutual substitution is (N-1)/N. There are numerous antibody molecules bound to mast cells. Therefore, the probability, (N-1)/N, is virtually equal to 1. A logical conclusion is that mutual substitutions of antibodies do occur on cell surfaces without fail.\r\n\r\nSupporting the above theory are the results of the following case. In 1995, a 31-year-old woman with an egg allergy was treated with injections with a nonspecific antigen preparation, Asthremedin (Nippon Zohki Pharmaceutical Company, Osaka, Japan). Her blood samples were taken before and 4 months after the start of treatment. Ovalbumin and Asthremedin were separately labeled with fluorescence. Aliquots of her blood taken before the treatment were separately incubated with labeled ovalbumin and labeled Asthremedin in an ice bath for 20 minutes. Ratios of leukocytes that became fluorescent during the incubation were analyzed using flow cytometry. Before treatment, the ratio of leukocytes that became fluorescent during the incubation with the labeled ovalbumin was 16.2% (mean of a duplicate test), whereas the ratio of leukocytes that became fluorescent during the incubation with labeled Asthremedin was 0.02% (mean of a duplicate test). After 4 months, the respective ratios were 9.6% and 17.4%. These results demonstrate that there were substitutions of antibody molecules on the surface of leukocytes.\r\n\r\nRepeated intradermal injections at 2- to 7-day intervals with a nonspecific antigen preparation, for example, killed microorganisms, may be a successful treatment of allergic disease. The appropriate initial dose would depend on the severity of the disease, that is, the more severe the disease, the less the initial dose. The least initial dose in my experience has been 1 ng protein of killed Neisseria sicca et flava (Itoyu Pharmaceutical Company, Osaka, Japan). In most cases, 10 ng protein of killed Neisseria sicca et flava was used as the initial dose. The dose was raised by 50% after every 10-time repetition. Mixing one-fifth of the volume with 1% lidocaine solution softened the pain accompanying the intradermal injection. The average necessary period of treatment has been one-thirteenth of the duration of the disease.\r\n\r\nThe total number of cases I have seen during the last 15 years is 721, consisting of various allergies and atopic conditions. There has been no case of failure except for those who dropped out of the treatment. In addition, this treatment has caused no disagreeable side effects. The absence of failed cases implies that this treatment is reliable and deserves further study.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The Champlain BASE™ and Ontario eConsult services are virtual platforms that serve to facilitate contact between primary care providers and specialists across Ontario, relaying patient-specific questions to relevant specialists via a secure web-based platform. Despite ample evidence regarding the general effectiveness of these platforms, their utility as it pertains to clinical concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccines has not yet been explored. Methods We performed a cross-sectional descriptive analysis of COVID-19 vaccine related eConsults on Ontario patients completed by five allergy specialists between February and October of 2021. 4318 COVID-19 vaccine-related eConsults were completed in total during this time; with 1857 completed by the five allergists participating in this analysis. Question types/content were categorized using a taxonomy developed through consensus on a weighted monthly sample of 499 total cases. Data regarding whether external resources were required to answer each eConsult, impact on primary care provider referral decisions, and allergy consultant response times were collected. A 2-question survey was completed by primary care providers following eConsultation and results were collected. Results 41.08% of eConsults received involved safety concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccine administration in the setting of prior allergic disease and another 36.1% involved a potential reaction the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. 72.1% of eConsults were answered by specialist without needing external resources, and only 9.8% of all eConsults received resulted in a recommendation for formal in-person referral to Clinical Immunology &amp; Allergy specialist or another subspecialty. Average time to complete eConsult was 16.4 min, and 79.7% of PCP eConsult queries which would have traditionally resulted in formal consultation were resolved based on advice provided in the eConsult without need for in-person assessment. Conclusions Our study demonstrates the utility of the eConsult service as it pertains to COVID-19 vaccine-related concerns. The eConsult platform proved an effective tool in diverting the need for in-person assessment by an Allergist or other medical specialty. This is significant given the large volume of eConsults completed by Allergists, and demonstrates the impact of an effective electronic delivery of care model during a time of strained resources and public health efforts directed at mass vaccination.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Hereditary angioedema (HAE), which is caused by C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency or dysfunction, is a rare and potentially life-threatening disease. In patients with HAE, excess production of bradykinin causes acute unpredictable recurrent attacks of angioedema in localized regions, including the larynx and intestines. Given the fact that HAE is an autosomal dominant disease, C1-INH produced in patients with HAE is 50% of that produced in healthy individuals. However, most patients with HAE present plasma C1-INH function of &lt; 25% owing to the chronic consumption of C1-INH by kallikrein–kinin, contact, complement, coagulation, and fibrinolysis cascades. Recently, several therapeutic options have been developed for acute attacks and prophylaxis in the treatment of HAE; however, currently, there is no curative therapy for HAE. Case presentation Here we report the case of a 48-year-old male patient who presented with a long-standing history of HAE and underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at the age of 39 years and has been in complete remission of AML and HAE thereafter. Notably, after BMT, his C1-INH function gradually increased as follows: &lt; 25%, 29%, 37%, and 45.6%. Since his 20 s, he intermittently presented with an acute attack of HAE once every 3 months from the initial attack. Further, after undergoing BMT, the number of acute attacks decreased to twice within 4 years until the age of 45 years, and subsequently, the patient has been free of acute attacks. C1-INH is mainly synthesized by hepatocytes, but it is known to be partially produced and secreted from peripheral blood monocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. We speculate that the C1-INH function may be increased by extrahepatic production of C1-INH, possibly synthesized by differentiated cells derived from hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells after BMT. Conclusions This case report supports efforts to focus on extrahepatic production of C1-INH in the next strategy of new treatment development for HAE.",

Methods This study used EMR data from 1,574 primary care providers in seven Canadian provinces, representing 689,301 patients. Using a subset of patient records seven medical students or family medicine residents created a reference set of 1,772 patients. A total of 23 clinician-informed case definitions were validated against the reference. We assessed agreement using sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and overall accuracy. The case definitions with the best agreement statistics were deployed to estimate the prevalence of eczema in the CPCSSN. Results Case definition 1 had the highest SE (92.1%,85.0-96.5) but a lower SP (88.5%,86.7–90.1) and PPV (36.6%,33.1–40.3). Case definition 7 was the most specific case definition with a SP (99.8%, 99.4–100) and PPV (84.2%,61.2–94.7) but low SE (15.8%,9.3–24.5). Case definition 17 had a SE (75.3%, 65.7–83.3), SP (93.8%, 91.5–94.3) and PPV 43.7% (38.3–49.2). When we applied the most specific and most sensitive case definitions, we estimate the prevalence of eczema to be between 0.8 and 15.1%. Case definition 17 suggests an eczema prevalence estimate of 8.2% (8.08–8.21%). Conclusions We validated EMR-based eczema case definitions to estimate the prevalence of clinician-documented eczema. Future studies may choose to apply one or more of these definitions’ dependent on their studies objectives to inform disease surveillance as well as explore burden of illness or interventions related to eczema care in Canada.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Helminth/tuberculosis (TB)-coinfection can reduce cell-mediated immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and increase disease severity, although the effects are highly helminth species dependent. Mtb have long been ranked as the number one single infectious agent claiming the most lives. The only licensed vaccine for TB (BCG) offers highly variable protection against TB, and almost no protection against transmission of Mtb. In recent few years the identification of naturally occurring antibodies in humans that are protective during Mtb infection has reignited the interest in adaptive humoral immunity against TB and its possible implementation in novel TB vaccine design. The effects of helminth/TB coinfection on the humoral response against Mtb during active pulmonary TB are however still unclear, and specifically the effect by globally prevalent helminth species such as Ascaris lumbricoides , Strongyloides stercoralis , Ancylostoma duodenale , Trichuris trichiura . Plasma samples from smear positive TB patients were used to measure both total and Mtb-specific antibody responses in a Peruvian endemic setting where these helminths are dominating. Mtb-specific antibodies were detected by a novel approach coating ELISA-plates with a Mtb cell-membrane fraction (CDC1551) that contains a broad range of Mtb surface proteins. Compared to controls without helminths or TB, helminth/TB coinfected patients had high levels of Mtb-specific IgG (including an IgG1 and IgG2 subclass response) and IgM, which were similarly increased in TB patients without helminth infection. These data, indicate that helminth/TB coinfected have a sustained humoral response against Mtb at the level of active TB only. More studies on the species-specific impact of helminths on the adaptive humoral response against Mtb using a larger sample size, and in relation to TB disease severity, are needed.",

Nevertheless, we believe that chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with or without nasal polyps (CRSwNP or CRSsNP) should have been listed due to its high incidence and prevalence, its association with asthma which is also endorsed in both GINA and EPOS, as well as in several peer-reviewed scientific papers, and to reflect the role of this comorbidity in poor control and a most severe presentation of asthma for the patient. Consequently, several targeted therapies (especially monoclonal antibodies) used for several years in severe forms of asthma are now indicated also for the effective treatment of nasal polyps.",

This study aimed at determining the prevalence of the eosinophilic phenotype defined as an eosinophil count ≥ 300 cells/mm 3 among severe asthma patients in Lebanon. Methods The Lebanese Chapter of the PREPARE study was a national, multicenter, cross-sectional observational study. Patients aged ≥ 12 years with severe asthma were identified and prospectively enrolled during clinic visits and completed the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) assessment of asthma control questionnaire. Patients’ health characteristics were collected from medical records and blood samples were obtained for measurement of serum IgE levels and blood eosinophils count. Results Overall, 101 patients (with mean age of 46.3 ± 17.0 years and 73.27% females) with severe asthma were included and, among them, 37% had eosinophilic phenotype, 67.3% had atopic phenotype with IgE &gt; 100 IU/mL and 25.7% patients had overlapping atopic and eosinophilic phenotypes. Close to 80% had late-onset asthma, beyond 12 years of age, and around 85% had at least one severe exacerbation in the 12 months prior to study enrolment. The majority of participants [64.4%] had uncontrolled asthma, 24.7% had partially controlled symptoms and 10.9% had controlled symptoms. 19.8% of participants were on chronic oral corticosteroids, 78.2% had short course treatment of corticosteroids and all were prescribed a combination of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonist. Conclusions The majority of patients with severe asthma were uncontrolled of which 37% present with an eosinophilic phenotype, which should be taken into consideration for better management of these patients in view of the novel phenotype-specific therapeutic options.",

The present study assesses a cohort of Urban Pest Surveillance and Control Service (UPSCS) workers with high exposure to avian and fungal antigens, in order to identify their degree of sensitization and the potential risk of developing HP. Methods Workers were divided according to their work activity into Nest pruners (Group 1) and Others (Group 2). All individuals underwent a medical interview, pulmonary function tests and the determination of specific IgG antibodies. Antigenic proteins of pigeon sera were analysed using two-dimensional immunoblotting. Proteins of interest were sequenced by liquid-chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS). Results 101 workers were recruited (76 men, average age: 42 yrs); (Group 1 = 41, Group 2 = 60). Up to 30% of the study population exhibited increased levels of IgGs to pigeon, small parrot and parrot, and up to 60% showed high levels of Aspergillus and Penicillium IgGs. In Group 1, specific parakeet and Mucor IgGs were higher ( p = 0.044 and 0.003 respectively) while DLCO/VA% were lower ( p = 0.008) than in Group 2. Two-dimensional immunoblotting showed protein bands of 20–30 KDa recognized by HP patients but not by workers. LC–MS analysis identified Ig Lambda chain and Apolipoprotein A-I as candidate proteins for distinguishing HP patients from exposed workers. Conclusions Two pigeon proteins were identified that may play a role in the development of pathological differences between HP patients and exposed workers. DLCO/VA may have a predictive value in the development of HP disease.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Childhood atopic dermatitis can have a negative effect on caregivers’ quality of life and stress levels due to the burdensome nature of its treatment. Given that the condition often emerges in infancy, atopic dermatitis-related stress also carries the potential to negatively affect the developing mother-infant bond. While it is plausible that atopic dermatitis has a negative impact on maternal-infant bonding, these relationships have not been studied directly. In light of this gap, the current study investigated the association between infantile atopic dermatitis and the maternal-infant bond using a mixed-method design. Methods Mothers of infants (&lt; 19 months) with atopic dermatitis were recruited from social media and medical clinics between October 2021 and May 2022. Mothers with infants unaffected by inflammatory skin conditions were also recruited to serve as a control group. Participants were asked to complete questionnaires related to their demographics, child’s health, and mother-infant bond. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to assess bonding quality among cases and controls. A subset of cases were also asked to participate in semi-structured interviews focused on infantile atopic dermatitis and the maternal-infant bond. Results The final sample consisted of 32 cases and 65 controls. Scores on the impaired bonding and risk of abuse subscales did not significantly differ between cases and controls. However, mothers of infants with atopic dermatitis did report lower levels of caregiving anxiety ( b = − 1.47, p &lt; 0.01) and pathological anger/rejection ( b = − 1.74, p = 0.02) relative to controls. Qualitative findings suggest that the topical therapies required to manage atopic dermatitis may strengthen the bond between some mothers and infants. Conclusion Findings suggest that atopic dermatitis does not have a negative impact on maternal-infant bonding and may actually improve bonds in some cases. In light of this finding, clinicians may leverage the potentially positive impact of atopic dermatitis-related caregiving on the maternal-infant bond to encourage caregivers to remain adherent to their child’s topical treatments.",

The use of bloodworms as a fish food has led to a number of differing manifestations dependent on the route of exposure.

She had no atopic history and had eaten no food on the day of one of the reactions. Only after persistent questioning regarding what she may have transferred from her hand to her face (she was right-handed) did she divulge that she fed the fish in her aquarium in the office. She did not know the source of the fish food, and I requested that she place a tiny amount on her forearm the following day. This produced a swelling of the entire forearm. The fish food was freeze-dried bloodworms.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, at the annual meeting of the Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (CSACI) that same week, Dr. J. Roberts presented the case of a girl who had developed anaphylaxis after accidental ingestion of residual fish food that was on her hands when she was eating dinner. This individual had a striking reaction to a dilute preparation of the bloodworm fish food on skin testing and did not react to other fish food preparations.\r\n\r\nSubsequent to these cases, a colleague mentioned additional cases of asthma symptoms in employees at the Vancouver Aquarium, where bloodworms are raised and processed as a food source.\r\n\r\nThe well-defined case presented in this issue and the others mentioned suggest that bloodworm may be a more common cause of allergic reactions than generally recognized and warrants consideration when the patient's history is reviewed.\r\n\r\nR.

This disease is caused by defects in NADPH oxidase, which result in the inability of phagocytes (neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages) to destroy certain microbes. The only established curative therapy for CGD is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.A 23-year-old Caucasian male with X-linked chronic granulomatous disease underwent a reduced-intensity conditioning, matched unrelated donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant, after which he was started on tacrolimus and mycophenolate for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis. Seven months later, he was admitted to hospital for nutritional support secondary to odynophagia and anorexia. Upper endoscopy revealed ulcers in his esophagus, and he was initially treated with acyclovir due to the risk of CMV infection until biopsies came back negative for viral colitis. Following a sigmoidoscopy that showed nonspecific colitis, he was started on mesalamine. Although pathology showed a pattern of widespread inflammatory changes initially suggestive of CGD colitis, a peripheral blood chimerism study showed 100% donor alleles suggesting CGD remission. Since this patient's colitis was refractory to other immunomodulators, and due to its severity, the patient underwent a partial colectomy 1 year after his HSCT and will likely require the removal of the remaining large bowel.This case demonstrates a unique presentation of colitis in a post-transplant CGD patient. Since CGD colitis could be excluded due to the patient's recent successful hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, a broad differential diagnosis is required for determining the etiology of this new-onset colitis in this patient with pre-existing chronic granulomatous disease. This case delineates the need for interdisciplinary care and describes a severe case of colitis after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",

However, this association has received less attention in multigenerational populations. To this end, we sought to examine maternal allergic disease status ever, and daughters’ menarche. Methods In a cohort of children born in 1995, in Manitoba, Canada, we considered maternal allergic disease ever to daughters’ age 7–8 years, and daughters’ menarche at ages 12–14 years. We included all participants for whom we had information on both the exposure and the outcome of those eligible. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression, with adjustment for confounding variables. Results Overall, the prevalences of maternal allergic diseases were 28.6% for asthma 18.8% for food allergy, 27.3% for eczema and 45.5% for rhinitis. By age 12–14 years, 41.6% (64/159) girls had reached menarche. Maternal food allergy was significantly associated with daughters’ menarche (OR 4.39, 95% CI 1.51–12.73), whereas no association was found for maternal asthma, eczema or rhinitis. With consideration to comorbid disease, a combination of maternal asthma + food allergy was associated with daughters’ menarche by age 12–14 years (OR 6.41; 95% CI 1.32–31.01).

    "abstract": "Meeting AbstractsAnnual Scientific Meeting, Montreal, October 26-29, 2006 Digital Ischemia Related to Gemcitabine R. Khouqeer, M. Almarzouqi, M. Baron Introduction: We present the occurrence of gemcitabine-induced digital ischemia in a 73-year-old female with a history of breast cancer metastatic to the peritoneum and the lung. She presented with painful purple fingers after 10 days of her second cycle of gemcitabine. She had no prior history of Raynaud's or any vascular diseases. Case Report: A 73-year-old female was diagnosed with breast cancer in May of 1992, for which she was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide and Adriamycin), radiation, and then surgical resection. In addition to that she received tamoxifen for 5 years. However, in the autumn of 2000, she was diagnosed with infiltrating adenocarcinoma carcinoma of the omentum consistent with metastases from the breast and therefore was placed back on tamoxifen. She failed this therapy, as evidenced by recurrent ascites, and she was started on navelbine for a total of eight cycles, with an excellent response. However, in November 2001 her disease appeared to have progressed, with evidence of increased ascites. Her chemotherapy was stopped, and she was started on Arimidex. The ascites resolved. She had progressive disease in May 2003 and therefore was switched to Megace. Then in October 2003 she was switched to gemcitabine, which was tolerated well during the first and second cycles. After 10 days of the second cycle she started to develop a bluish discoloration of all her fingers, which was associated with severe pain. She had normal pulses and no ischemic changes in her feet. Her past medical history included DM2, asthma, A.fib, pneumonias, and no history of blood transfusion or any liver disease. She is a non-smoker and does not consume any alcohol. The physical examination of her fingers revealed good radial and ulnar pulses. The physical examination also revealed blue fingertips (all 10) and severe tenderness, with small ulcers on her fingers. Laboratory investigations: normal CBC, LFT, renal, ESR 115, CRP 49, +ANA (Spk)1:80, -ve ACLA, ANCA, and Cryo and normal LAC and C3, C4. ECHO showed normal EF, MR, TR, PAP 41. An angiogram showed slow distal filling with very slight improvement with nitro challenge. In hospital she was started on ASA and nifedipine XL for 1 week, with little response. She was put on Solu-Medrol 60 mg IV for 1 week and then switched to oral prednisone 50 mg Q wk, which was tapered down to 5 mg Q wk over 11 weeks, with a good response that was apparent within 2 weeks after initiating the corticosteroids. Conclusion: This case illustrates that gemcitabine alone may produce digital ischemia. This is only the third case in which this has been reported to occur in patients not on other chemotherapeutic agents as well.Management of Anaphylaxis in a Tertiary Care Emergency Department Anne K. Ellis, James H. Day Background: Publications regarding the emergency management of anaphylaxis report rates of epinephrine administration between 16 and 57%; EpiPen prescription rates vary from 0 to 22%. Objective: To document treatment, observation, and discharge strategies for patients with anaphylaxis in a tertiary care emergency department (ED) in Canada. Methods: Retrospective chart review of ED visits from 1999 to 2002; all charts with a discharge diagnosis of \"anaphylaxis\" or \"allergic reaction\" were evaluated; if symptoms/signs were consistent with anaphylaxis included in the study. Management strategies, total observation time, and discharge management/advice were analyzed descriptively and compared to symptomatology via chi-square. Results: 129 patients were treated for an acute systemic allergic reaction consistent with anaphylaxis in the period reviewed. Average age was 31.8 years (range 0.9-79), and 62 (48.0%) were female. Details of management strategies are presented in the Table.The overall rate of epinephrine use was 79.1%, but it was given as first-line therapy in only 66 (51.1%) and was given subcutaneously (SC) by ED personnel in all cases. Documented hypotension and/or decreased SaO2 resulted in higher rates of corticosteroid administration (p < .034). Pediatric cases (≤12 yr) were significantly less likely to receive corticosteroids and H2 antagonists (p < .025), and trended toward decreased epinephrine use (p = .08).Average ED observation time was 3.8 hours. Nineteen patients had a documented biphasic reaction (13 were discharged from the ED prior to the second phase); 4 were subsequently admitted (total admission rate 8.4%). Conclusions: Anaphylaxis was treated with epinephrine by the ED at a higher rate than reported elsewhere but was not routinely administered first line and was given SC, rather than IM, discordant with published guidelines. Anaphylaxis was more likely to be labeled an \"allergic reaction,\" leading to underreporting, and EpiPens remained underprescribed, although more frequently than reported elsewhere. Average observation time was 4 hours, which was insufficient for 13 patients (10%) who returned after discharge from the ED with biphasic reactivity. Despite improvements, anaphylaxis continues to be an underdiagnosed and under-treated condition. Support: This study was internally funded.Allergen-Induced Changes in Adhesion Molecule Expression and Function on Bone Marrow Progenitor Cells in Asthmatic Subjects A. Catalli, J. Thomson, I. Babirad, M. Duong, R. Watson, G. Gauvreau, P.M. O'Byrne, R. Sehmi, McMaster University and St. Joseph's Healthcare, Hamilton, ON Rationale: Eosinophilic airway inflammation is an underlying feature of asthma and is associated with activation of hematopoietic events in the bone marrow. Understanding the mechanisms regulating progenitor cell mobilization and trafficking from the bone marrow into the airways may be important for the development of effective asthma treatment. Objectives: We set out to characterize preferential activation of adhesion pathways for the mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells from the bone marrow. Methods: Bone marrow aspirates were obtained from mild asthmatics pre- and several time points post-allergen challenge. Low-density nonadherent mononuclear cells were harvested by density gradient centrifugation on Percoll. Changes in expression of β1 (CD49d/α4β1, CD49e/α5β1) and β2 (CD11b/Mac-1) integrins on CD34+45+ progenitor cells were assessed by flow cytometry. A sequential multigating strategy was used to enumerate level and intensity of expression. Adhesion of an enriched CD34+ cell population to fibronectin (20 μg/mL coated wells) following SDF-1 stimulation was similarly enumerated by flow cytometry. Results: There was a significant decline in CD49d levels on CD34+45+ cells 24 hr post-allergen challenge as compared to baseline (pre-Ag: 10.7 ± 3.8 vs post-Ag; 3.0 ± 0.9, p = .02, n = 9 and 13, respectively), which had begun to recover by 48 hrs. There was no significant allergen-induced change in CD49e or CD11b expression (CD49e: 34.8 ± 3.4 vs 32.4 ± 7.0, n = 13 and CD11b: 4.1 ± 1.1 vs 2.7 ± 1.0, n = 14 in pre vs post, respectively). Adhesion to fibronectin was attenuated 24 hr post-allergen challenge, corresponding to the decline in CD49d expression, and had begun to recover by 72 hrs. Conclusion: Our data suggest that down-regulation of β1 integrin expression, as well as the associated adhesive properties of progenitor cells, may be responsible for reducing the tethering forces to extracellular matrix components such as fibronectin within the bone marrow, thus facilitating the egress of CD34+45+ cells to the peripheral circulation during an allergic inflammatory response.

Ross, C.A. Gillespie, B.A. Kulbaba, S.E. Filuk, L.J. Stewart, J.C. St. Vincent, D.L. Stockwell, N.F. Cisneros, A.B. Becker, The Children's Asthma Education Centre, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB The Children's Asthma Education Centre (CAEC) evaluated the effectiveness of our Family Asthma Program© (FAP) in meeting objectives of asthma education. Current guidelines for asthma education recommend that programs be evaluated. Asthma education objectives listed in The Canadian Network for Asthma Care Asthma Educator's Guide are to improve patients' asthma knowledge and skills; improve patients' self-assessment abilities/skills; improve patients/caregivers' self-confidence; improve patients' adherence to behaviours that promote asthma self-management; and improve the relationships between patients and health care professionals. We evaluated 98 families of children ages 3 to 11 years from our FAP from April 2005 to May 2006. During the first session families are given a questionnaire and asked whether they agree, disagree or are unsure about the following four statements: I feel comfortable asking my doctor about asthma; I feel confident I can manage my child's asthma; When my child has an asthma attack I know what to do; I know when and how to give my child's asthma medicine. After the final session the families completed the same questionnaire.Conclusion: The CAEC FAP effectively meets objectives for asthma education. There is significant improvement in the families' knowledge and confidence in managing their child's asthma even among parents who already felt comfortable about discussing asthma with their physician.Molecular Markers of Eosinophilopoiesis: Multiplex Q-PCR Analysis of GATA-1, MBP, and IL-5 Receptor mRNA Expression in Peripheral Blood A.K. Ellis, L. Crawford, J.A. Denburg, Division of Clinical Immunology and Allergy, Department of Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON Rationale: Using colony assays and flow cytometry, we have shown that eosinophil/basophil (Eo/B) progenitor phenotype and function are associated with both atopic risk at birth and early childhood clinical outcomes. We have also recently demonstrated that real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) can reveal kinetic patterns of expression in cord blood (CB) of several Eo/B lineage-specific genes, specifically GATA-1, MBP, and IL-5Rα, as surrogate molecular markers of Eo/B differentiation. These same methods have yet to be established in peripheral blood (PB) samples. Objective: To use Q-PCR to determine the kinetic patterns of expression of CB Eo/B-lineage specific genes in PB to evaluate surrogate markers of Eo/B differentiation. Methods: PB non-adherent mononuclear cells (PB NAMNC) were isolated from random fresh samples and incubated in the presence of IL-5. At 24, 48, and 72 hours post-stimulation, RNA was isolated, reverse transcribed, and expression of IL-5Rα, GATA-1, and MBP was determined using comparative Q-PCR in a multiplex reaction. Relative expression ratios of stimulated to unstimulated cells were calculated using the delta-delta Ct method. Results: Stimulation of PB NANMC with IL-5 resulted in an up-regulation of GATA-1 expression, peaking at 24 hours, with a slower return to baseline expression than that observed in CB. MBP expression was minimally altered at all time points, compared with CB, where slow up-regulation, maximal at 72 hours, had been observed. There was completely stable expression IL-5Rα, similar to that seen in CB. Conclusion: Multiplex Q-PCR analysis of mRNA from PB demonstrates expression of critical Eo/B lineage-specific events. Further investigation of the validity and utility of Q-PCR analyses of PB for surrogate, molecular markers Eo/B differentiation, and their relationship to atopy and atopic outcomes are underway.

Amin, S. Balkovec, F. Ratjen, P. Subbarao, The Hospital for Sick Children and The University of Toronto, Toronto, ON Background: Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) has been proposed as a non-invasive marker of lower airways inflammation. To assess its potential applicability in infants, we developed an in vitro system to test the effects of respiratory rate (RR), tidal volume, and temperature of the cooling device on EBC collection volume. Methods: A mechanical ventilator (Evita XL, Drager, Germany) was used to modulate tidal volumes and respiratory rates over the range expected for infants. The ventilator delivered 100% relative humidity. The temperature at the EBC collection point was 34°C. The ventilator was connected via a modified two-way valve (Hans-Rudolph Inc, Kansas) separating inspiratory and expiratory flow to a modified R-Tube for EBC collection. EBC was collected for tidal volumes from 20 to 120 mL in increasing increments of 20 mL. For each tidal volume, EBC was collected over 20-minute periods for respiratory rates ranging from 20 to 70 breaths per minute in increments of 10 breaths/min. The temperature of the cooling device was modulated by storing the R-Tube sleeve at -80°C, -20°C, and -8°C for at least 1 hour prior to sample collection. Data were analyzed using factorial ANOVA and linear regression. Results: EBC volume ranged from 0.37 to 3.8 mL. Using factorial ANOVA, both tidal volume and respiratory rate were found to be significant factors in determining EBC volume (p < .05). A trend toward significance was observed for the sleeve temperature (p = .053). EBC volume had the strongest correlation with tidal volume (r = .74, p < .05) followed by respiratory rate (r = .13, p = .4). The linear regression model found that tidal volume had the greatest effect on EBC volume, followed by respiratory rate; temperature had a minimal effect. Conclusions: Exhaled breath condensate collection rates using a modified R-Tube in an in vitro model collects adequate amounts of fluid for analysis. Tidal volume had the strongest effect on EBC.Alternaria Allergy and Fall Asthma Admissions C.A. Gillespie, S.E. Filuk, N.L. Ross, B.A. Kulbaba, L.J. Stewart, W.T.A. Watson, A.B. Becker, The Children's Asthma Education Centre, Children's Hospital, Winnipeg, MB Background: Fall is the peak season for asthma exacerbations. Alternaria levels increase in prairie agricultural regions in the fall. At the Children's Hospital in Winnipeg, as a small pilot project, we asked whether children who were admitted to hospital in fall were more likely to be allergic to Alternaria than children admitted in winter. Methods: Families of children ≥3 years old admitted to hospital for asthma in September and October 2004 (n = 67) and December 2004 through February 2005 (n = 28) were approached during or following admission for study participation. Children were excluded if they lived outside Winnipeg, had additional respiratory conditions, or were deemed otherwise unsuitable. Following written consent, a questionnaire to gather pertinent history was completed, children were skin-tested to common aeroallergens, including Alternaria, and spirometry was performed when possible. Results: Participation included a total of 15 children, with 1 child being admitted in both seasons. Although nonsignificant, results indicated a trend toward a positive relationship between Alternaria allergy and fall admissions.Conclusions: Due to the small number of participants it is difficult to make any definite conclusions. However, health care providers and asthma educators should be aware of the trend, especially in prairie regions. Appropriate management plans and education may help lower the admission risk for Alternaria-sensitive individuals.Regulation of Progenitor Cell Traffic in Allergic Inflammatory Responses: Stromal Cell-Derived Factor 1-Stimulated Adhesive Responses of Cd34+ Cells Jennifer V. Thomson, Irene M. Babirad, Roma Sehmi, Firestone Institute for Respiratory Health, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON Stromal cell-derived factor 1α (SDF-1; CXCL12) is a potent progenitor cell chemoattractant and is thought to retain CD34+ progenitor cells within hematopoietic compartments, such as the bone marrow (BM). Ligation of SDF-1α coupling to its exclusive receptor, CXCR4, results in mobilization of CD34+ cells to the peripheral circulation (PB). Little, however, is known about the interplay of chemokines in mediating the egress of CD34+ cells from the BM in allergic inflammation. We have previously shown that 24-hour post-allergen (Ag) challenge in dual-responder asthmatics, BM CD34+ cells showed significant attenuation in CXCR4 expression and reduced migrational responsiveness to SDF-1α in vitro. This was associated with a significant increase in the proportion of CD34+ cells expressing CXCR4 in PB. We propose that increased mobilization of progenitor cells may reflect changes in SDF-1α-stimulated adhesive interactions of progenitor cells with BM extracellular matrix components. In the current study we investigated modulation of adhesive interactions of progenitors to fibronectin in vitro. We found that SDF-1α stimulated adhesion of CD34+ progenitor cells to fibronectin in a dose-dependent manner optimal at 10 ng/mL (p < .05). The adherence of CD34+ cells was significantly inhibited by anti-VLA4 > anti-VLA-5 > anti-VLA4 + VLA-5 (69 ± 13%, 59 ± 28%, 58 ± 29% inhibition, respectively; p < .05). Pre-exposure to CCR5-acting proinflammatory chemokines such as RANTES (200 ng/mL) and MIP-1α (20 ng/Ml) inhibited SDF-1α-stimulated adhesion of CD34+ cells to fibronectin (82 ± 12%, 60 ± 32% inhibition, respectively, p < .05). Our findings show that SDF-1α maintains the retentivity of progenitor cells to the bone marrow through adhesion to fibronectin and attenuation of this adhesive response may promote the egress of progenitor cells to the PB in an allergic inflammatory response. This work was supported by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research and the Ontario Thoracic Society.Asthma Care Maps Are a Valuable Tool in the Management of Asthma Peter Strachan, Cathy Gillespie, Leslie Galloway, Nancy Ross, Allan Becker, Section of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB Background: Patient education is an important underpinning of asthma care. The Children's Asthma Education Centre (CAEC) provides asthma education for children with asthma and their families. However, many children with asthma and their families do not get referred for asthma education. Children's Hospital recently introduced an in-patient care map for children with an asthma exacerbation. Hypothesis: Introduction of an in-patient asthma care map increases rates of referral for asthma education. Methodology: Retrospective analysis of medical records for children admitted to hospital in September 2000 (before introduction of the care map) and September 2005 (after introduction) was carried out. We assessed (1) proportion of children referred to CAEC, (2) duration of admission, (3) pulmonary function testing, (4) discharge use of inhaled corticosteroids, and (5) repeat emergency department visits within 3 months. Results: There was a highly significant increase from 13 of 26 children referred to CAEC in 2000 to 24 of 24 children in 2005 (p < .0001). The care map was also associated with a significant increase in PFTs (from 7 to 76%). Significantly more children were discharged using inhaled corticosteroids (85 vs 100%) and there was a reduction in subsequent ER visits from 31 to 17%. Also, the average length of admission decreased from 59 hours in 2000 to 39 hours in 2005 (p < .0001). Conclusion: An asthma care map results in significantly more asthma education for children admitted to hospital with an asthma exacerbation. In addition, the care map was associated with shorter duration of hospitalization and decreased likelihood of subsequent emergency department visits.Hereditary Angioedema: Literature Review and a Case Report Farag I. Farag, Ashraf A. Abdel-Naby, Hanan Taha, Amgad Abd-Ellatief, Faculty of Medicine, Suez Canal University, Egypt; International Medical Center, Egypt; Holding Company of Biological Products and Vaccines (VACSERA), Egypt; Omega Laboratories Limited, Canada Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disease of the complement system manifesting as recurrent attacks of massive edema of the skin and respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. The basic defect in HAE is the deficiency or dysfunction of the C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH). We report here a case of HAE that was misdiagnosed as a combination of intractable asthma and skin allergy for 30 years until successfully diagnosed and treated at VACSERA and the International Medical Center in Egypt. Subject and Methods: The case was a 48-year-old male with positive consanguinity and a family history suffering since 2002 from severe recurrent episodes (7 days/month) of a wheezy chest, shortness of breath, and edema of the face, neck, and body with dysphagia, constipation, and abdominal cramps. Antihistamines, bronchodilators, and megadoses of corticosteroids were ineffective in aborting the attacks. Onset started at age 16; it was mild at first and then worsened with age. C4 and C1-INH serum levels during episodes were 2 mg/dL (normal 10-40) and 9 mg/dL (normal 15-35), establishing the diagnosis of HAE. Marked clinical improvement and elevation of C4 and C1-INH levels were detected when the patient was maintained on danazol (600 mg/day). Conclusions: We conclude that HAE, albeit rare, should be included in the differential diagnosis of intractable asthma associated with skin allergy.A Case of Hemolytic Anemia Following Intravenous Immunoglobulin Administration in a Patient with Chronic Urticaria Sari M. Herman, Stephen Betschel, Gordon Sussman, Department of Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON; Division of Clinical Immunology and Allergy, Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON Purpose: To report an unusual case of hemolytic anemia following intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) administration. We review the published literature examining hemolytic anemia with the use of intravenous immunoglobulin and the evidence for its use in chronic urticaria. Design: Case report. Methods: We report a case of a 54-year-old man with a 7-year history of chronic urticaria refractory to conventional therapy who was treated with IVIG. Results: A 3-day course of treatment with IVIG (1 g/day) was initiated. After the first infusion our patient developed a headache. A week after completion of therapy he developed arthralgias and jaundice. Laboratory studies revealed a normocytic anemia (hemoglobin 106 g/L) with polychromasia and a few spherocytes present, hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin 79 μmol/L), and a low haptoglobin (<0.0583 g/L) despite a negative direct Coombs' test. Laboratory values returned to normal approximately 2 weeks after the onset of the hemolytic reaction. Complete clearing of his urticaria occurred within 2 days after the IVIG treatment. Recurrence of his urticaria appeared 2 months later. Conclusions: IVIG has been used for the treatment of chronic urticaria in patients unresponsive to conventional therapies with short-term results. Although IVIG therapy is generally safe, hemolytic anemia is a potentially serious complication that is often overlooked. Clinicians should be aware of possible adverse effects related to intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels with IVIG therapy is recommended.Asthmatic and Non-Asthmatic Children Have Similar Levels of Body Dissatisfaction J.L.P. Protudjer, G.D.M. Marchessault, C. Benoit, A.L. Kozyrskyj, A.B. Becker, John Buhler Research Centre, Winnipeg, MB Rationale: Body image is important to preadolescents. Youth with asthma may have experiences that decrease or alter their body image, resulting in greater body dissatisfaction; however, the few studies that have explored this association suggest that asthmatic children often have greater body dissatisfaction that non-asthmatics. Methods: Children enrolled in a cohort study born in Manitoba in 1995 were assessed by pediatric allergists for asthma at age 8 to 10. We administered the Children's Body Shape Drawing Questionnaire to assess overall body dissatisfaction (absolute difference between perceived current body shape and desired body shape) and queried feature-specific satisfaction using the Healthy Youth Survey (1 = very satisfied; 5 = very dissatisfied) in both asthmatic and non-asthmatic boys and girls. Results: In total, 532 children were assessed for both asthma status and body dissatisfaction. Using the Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney U test, we found no difference (p = .69) in body dissatisfaction in asthmatic versus non-asthmatic children. Neither asthmatic boys and girls (p = .22) nor non-asthmatic boys and girls (p = .26) had differences in overall body dissatisfaction. Asthmatic and non-asthmatic boys had the same median level of body dissatisfaction (median = 9.00; range = 4 (most satisfied) to 27 (most dissatisfied)), as did asthmatic versus non-asthmatic girls (median = 8.00). No differences in facial (p = .91), muscle (p = .44), weight (p = .37), or height (p = .48) dissatisfaction were found between asthmatics and non-asthmatics. Conclusions: Asthma does not affect body dissatisfaction in preadolescent children. Based on other literature, we speculate that other socio-cultural factors, such as peer pressure and media, and biologic factors, such as puberty, influence body dissatisfaction in preadolescent children independent of a chronic disease such as asthma.

McNagny, The Biomedical Research Center, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC Migration of mast cells and eosinophils to the lung during allergic asthma leads to persistent inflammation and the development of airway hyperresponsiveness, presumably due to the release of potent inflammatory factors. Previously we showed that expression of CD34 is essential for efficient mast cell migration; therefore, we examined the role of this sialomucin in allergic inflammation. CD34KO and wild-type (WT) mice were sensitized and challenged with chicken ovalbumin (OVA). Airway hyperresponsiveness was tested using a metacholine challenge. Differential cell counts were performed on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells. Histologic preparations were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and toluidine blue for evaluation of tissue inflammation and mast cells counts. BAL eosinophils were also stained for CD34 expression, sorted, and evalulated via in vitro migration assays. We found that CD34KO mice had far fewer cells in BAL than WT controls (1.162 ± 0.32 compared with 2.946 ± 0.417 × 106 cells/mL in WT; p = .0015). All hematopoietic subsets were significantly reduced, and histologic analysis revealed attenuation of both inflammation and mast cell counts in CD34KO mice (inflammation score: 6.57 ± 1.15 vs 10.33 ± 0.92 in WT, p = .03; mast cell counts: 6.28 ± 1.5/section vs 18.17 ± 1.5 in WT, p = .0002). Similarly, airway hyperresponsiveness in CD34KO OVA-challenged mice was lower and comparable to that of unsensitized WT mice. Interestingly, BAL and tissue-derived eosinophils in WT mice were found to express significant levels CD34, and we found a 57.2% reduction in the ability of CD34KO eosinophils to chemotax toward eotaxin in an in vitro migration assay compared with WT eosinophils. Taken together our results suggest that CD34 plays an important role in mast cell and eosinophil migration, presumably by reducing adhesion and enhancing invasiveness, and that this mucin may offer a target for therapeutic intervention.Is There a Correlation Between Skin-Prick Tests and Bronchial Hyperresponsiveness in Children? J.J. Liem, R. Rabbani, A.L. Kozyrskyj, A.B. Becker, Section of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, University of Manitoba; The Manitoba Institute of Child Health, Department of The Children's Hospital Foundation, University of Manitoba; Departments of Community Health Sciences and Pediatrics and Child Health, Faculties of Medicine and Pharmacy, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB Background: Allergists frequently use the skin-prick test to detect sensitization to aeroallergens in patients with asthma. It is assumed that sensitization on the skin reflects inflammation in the airways, resulting in bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Rationale: To determine if allergen sensitization is associated with bronchial hyperresponsiveness in children. Methods: The SAGE cohort is a birth cohort study of all children born in the province of Manitoba, Canada, in 1995. A case-control group of these children was assessed by asthma specialists and diagnosed with asthma, rhinitis, or neither. They were then allergy tested to common aeroallergens and underwent a methacholine challenge to determine the concentration of methacholine required to drop their FEV1 by 20% (PC20). Spearman's correlations were determined between the total number of positive skin-prick tests with PC20. Results: 723 children were assessed from across the province of Manitoba (urban and rural locations). Four children refused skin-prick testing and 58 children did not perform proper methacholine challenges. The correlations between the number of skin-prick tests and total mean wheal diameters with PC20 were -0.296 (p < .0001) and -0.310 (p < .0001), respectively. When stratified by gender, the correlation for boys was -0.310 (p < .0001) and -0.331 (p < .0001) for the number of skin-prick tests and total mean wheal diameters, respectively. For girls, t",

    "abstract": "Background: Peanut allergy affects 0.5 to 1% of the general population.Despite enormous efforts to educate peanut allergic patients and their families and increasing public awareness of hidden sources of peanuts, accidental exposures to peanuts still happen.The aim of this study was to calculate the cumulative risk of accidental exposures to peanut among peanut allergic patients and to study their effect on peanut-specific IgE levels (PN-IgE).Methods: This was a retrospective chart review of peanut allergic patients followed up at LHSC from 1997 to 2004.Peanut allergic patients who were less than 15 years old at the time of first reaction to peanut and had serial measurements of PN-IgE were included in the study.Diagnosis of peanut allergy was based on significant history of acute reaction and positive SPT/PN-IgE to peanut.Statistical Analysis: Cumulative risk of accidental exposures and time to significant change of PN-IgE were calculated using Kaplan-Meiers survival curves.Comparisons were made using the log-rank statistics.Results: Medical charts from 118 peanut allergic patients were reviewed (median age at first reaction was 1.5 years old, baseline PN-IgE value was 18.75 kU A /L). Ninety-four patients decreased their PN-IgE levels, whereas 24 experienced elevation of PN-IgE.There were 88 reported accidental exposures in 64 patients and 17 patients experienced more than one accidental exposure.Calculated cumulative risk of reported accidental exposures at 1, 5 and 10 years post initial reaction was 24.8%, 34% and 65.1%, respectively.Conclusion: The predicting factors that determine resolution vs persistence of peanut allergy remain unknown and further studies are required.In conjunction with the avoidance of peanuts, education concerning early recognition of accidental exposures and knowledge of how to manage such reactions remain the main focus of peanut allergic patients' care.",

Denburg (denburg@mcmaster.ca)#These authors contributed equally to the work.Allergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology 2019, 15(Suppl 2):A1Background: Hemopoietic progenitor cells (HPC), both in the bone marrow and in peripheral tissues, differentiate into inflammatory effector cells and, thus, can modulate central and peripheral inflammation. There is growing evidence for the involvement of hemopoietic processes in the pathogenesis of atopy and asthma from pre-conception and birth. This is the basis for the “bone marrow” hypothesis of allergic disease, arguing that a perinatal environmental challenge leads to the skewed production and mobilization of HPC, regulating central and peripheral production of cell types that perpetuate allergic responses.The objective of this study was to assess the association of cell surface receptor profiles of cord blood (CB) HPC with atopy and allergic disease development and lung function at 1- and 3-years in the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) Study.Methods: We used flow cytometry to compare cytokine and toll-like receptor expression levels in CB HPC from infants who developed atopic sensitization (as assessed by positive skin prick test) at 1 and 3 years of age with healthy controls. We also compared the CB HPC receptor expression in relation to lung function as measured by lung clearance index (LCI) in the CHILD Study infants.Results: We found a significant increase in IL5RA-expressing HPC populations in the CB of cases at 1 and a trend towards increased IL17RB-expressing HPC in the CB of atopics at 1-year of age. Conversely, GM-CSFR- and ST2-expressing CB HPC were decreased in atopics both at 1- and 3-years. Additionally, there was evidence of infants with poor lung function at 3-years exhibiting higher IL5RA and IL17RB expression on the surface of CB HPC.Conclusions: This study provides evidence of pre-existing cellular alterations in infants’ CB progenitors at birth, which herald the development of atopy/allergic disease and, potentially, future asthma. The observed pattern of receptor expression suggests Th2 skewing of CB HPC before the onset of allergic disease or measurable lung function deficits. Our results suggest that measurable immune cellular patterns at birth could be utilised to develop novel strategies for atopic/allergic disease interception in infants before disease onset.Acknowledgements: This study was supported by grants from The Allergy, Genes & Environment (AllerGen) Network of Centres of Excellence, and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.A2 Metabolomic profiling of asthmatic children: a promising approach for improving asthma controlMays Al-Dulaymi1, Chun Che1, Joan Dietz1, Anas El-Aneed2, Darryl Adamko1 1Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; 2College of Pharmacy and Nutrition, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada Correspondence: Darryl Adamko (darryl.adamko@usask.ca)Allergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology 2019, 15(Suppl 2):A2Background: Pediatric asthma management can be a challenge in a typical primary care setting where we often lack objective tests for asthma diagnosis and severity. Metabolomics is the study of small molecules created by cellular metabolic activity [1, 2]. We have demonstrated that asthma has a different metabolomic profile compared to healthy children [3]. We have identified 50 urinary metabolites as potential diagnostic biomarkers for asthma [4]. Recently, we developed targeted mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods to accurately quantify these biomarkers in urine [5]. For this project, we hypothesize that our novel MS-based method will differentiate healthy children from those with asthma. We also expect that we will see changes in the urine of children with asthma depending on whether they have well controlled asthma versus uncontrolled asthma.Methods: To determine asthma severity, we recruited children with atopic asthma (n = 18) and followed them monthly (July–November). An Asthma Control Questionnaire, Mini Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire and Asthma Control Test were filled at each visit. Pulmonary function tests were performed on all children 6 years of age or older. Urine samples were collected from all children during their appointments. The urine samples were analyzed using our targeted liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric platform and value were normalized to creatinine. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA, SIMCA) was used on these data to create models of separation. To diagnose asthma in young children, we also have obtained urine samples from healthy children or those with asthma (n = 100 each) diagnosed at 5 years of age from the CHILD birth cohort. Similar methods are being applied and the data is expected for the January meeting.Results: There were 21 instances where patients’ asthma control worsened and 30 instances where their asthma control improved. Preliminary PLS-DA modelling generated a separation model of controlled and uncontrolled asthma with an R2 value of 0.72 and a Q2 value of 0.631.Conclusion: Positive results were attained in the differentiation of asthma severity. Blinded analysis will be done using a separate cohort of children. Urine samples from the CHILD study are being analyzed and will ready for presentation at the January AllerGen meeting. We expect that further assessment of the urinary biomarkers will create a metabolomic signature that could diagnose asthma in pre-school children and predict the development of uncontrolled asthma.

Earlier studies have shown that SDB in children is associated with neurobehavioral functions related to executive functioning, behavior development and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [1]. We hypothesize that preschool SDB may share a common genetic predisposition with neurobehavioral functions during early childhood.Methods: In this study, genomics data were ascertained from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) Study using the Illumina HumanCore Exome BeadChip. A total of 2048 Caucasian subjects had available SDB variables derived from parent-reported sleep-related breathing disorder subscale (age 5) in addition to cognitive behaviour assessments (i.e. Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) internalizing and externalizing scores, which are associated with anxiety and aggressive behaviours, respectively). We selected 108 loci for a candidate gene analysis of both SDB and CBCL scores that included variants previously associated with schizophrenia in a genome-wide association study by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) [2]. In addition to main genetic effects, we investigated the potential for genetic interactions with exposures such as exclusive breastfeeding until 3 months.Results: Single variant associations with CBCL externalizing score identified 14 significant variants located at chromosome 6q12 (p < 3.63 × 10−5). In addition, we identified 2 variants significantly associated with SDB at chromosome 6p22.1 (p = 1.8 × 10−5). Moreover, we identified an interaction effect between genetic variants at chromosome16q21 and exclusive breastfeeding at 3 months for CBCL externalizing score.Conclusion: Our study identified that genetic variants associated with schizophrenia in adults may contribute to cognitive behavioural traits and SDB among children during early childhood. These results suggest a common genetic predisposition that can be detected early in childhood and is modifiable by environmental exposures such as breastfeeding. On-going analyses include genetic risk score analysis and gene-set association tests of rare variants. Furthermore, we will explore gene-environmental interactions using additional exposures such as parental SDB, sleep duration, apnea–hypopnea index, sleep habits, and physical activity.Acknowledgements: Imputation of markers for CHILD subjects was performed by G.

Studying the single gene defects that cause these disorders has led to fundamental discoveries in basic and clinical immunology [2, 3]. This, in turn, has created new therapeutic targets for allergic diseases, which carry an immense health and economic burden in Canada [4, 5]. Germline gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in JAK1 are a newly described cause of primary atopic disorder [6]. The clinical phenotype of the first and only described affected family includes severe atopic dermatitis, markedly elevated peripheral blood eosinophil counts, hepatosplenomegaly, autoimmunity, and failure to thrive [6]. We sought to characterize the mechanisms behind JAK1-mediated atopic immune dysregulation, focusing on its effect on T cell activation and differentiation.Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy controls and patients carrying the JAK1 GOF mutation were evaluated by flow cytometry. T cell activation status and T helper cell subset distribution were analyzed using extracellular surface marker and intracellular cytokine staining by flow cytometry. Gene expression of RNA extracted from whole blood samples of affected patients and healthy controls was analyzed using next-generation RNA sequencing. Gene signatures corresponding to differentially expressed genes found in T helper subsets were compared between healthy controls and JAK1 GOF patients before and after treatment with ruxolitinib, an approved JAK1/2 inhibitor.Results: T cell immunophenotypic analysis by flow cytometry revealed a decreased proportion of naïve CD4+ T cells, in keeping with increased T cell activation. Elevated percentages of polarized T helper subsets were seen in comparison to healthy controls, with particular skewing towards the Th2 subset. RNA sequencing analysis revealed increased expression of Th1, Th2 and Th17 gene signatures in patients compared to healthy controls, with post-ruxolitinib treatment analysis showing a decline in Th2 and Th17-associated gene expression.Conclusions: Hyperactive JAK1 signaling appears to enhance T cell differentiation, in particular towards T helper subsets implicated in allergic inflammation. Medications that inhibit JAK1 may have benefits in treating disorders associated with allergic immune dysregulation, such as atopic dermatitis, asthma and eosinophilia. References 1.

A5 Influence of simulated obstructive sleep apnea on thoracic fluid volume and airways resistance in healthy subjectsXiaoshu Cao1,2, T. Douglas Bradley2,3, Swati Bhatawadekar2, Bojan Gavrilovic2, Shumit Saha1,2, Cristina O. Francisco2, Azadeh Yadollahi1,2 1Institute of Biomaterials & Biomedical Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; 2University Health Network-Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; 3Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada Correspondence: Xiaoshu Cao (Xiaoshu.cao@mail.utoronto.ca)Allergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology 2019, 15(Suppl 2):A5Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common in asthmatics, with a significant overlap of 12–50% [1]. OSA prevalence increases with increasing asthma severity, suggesting a pathophysiological link between the two [2]. OSA is also a risk factor for frequent nocturnal asthma exacerbations [3]. Recently, overnight rostral fluid shift (fluid displacement out of the legs into the neck and peripharyngeal tissues) was found to increase upper airway resistance and severity of OSA [4]. Recently, we have shown that in asthmatics while supine, fluid shifts from the legs into the thorax increases lower airways resistance (RLA) [5, 6]. During an obstructive apnea, intrathoracic pressure decreases dramatically, which could increase blood pooling into the thorax and increase thoracic fluid volume (TFV). Our objective is to determine whether in asthmatics, generation of negative pleural pressure by co-existing OSA could draw fluid into the thorax and therefore exacerbate lower airways narrowing and increase RLA. We hypothesized that negative pleural pressure generated by inspiratory efforts against an occluded upper airway will increase TFV. If true, the excess fluid in the thorax may increase RLA, worsening asthma during sleep.Methods: Healthy subjects laid supine for 30 min and were randomized to a control or intervention study arm with a 1-h seated washout period between the study arms. In the control arm, subjects breathed normally. In the intervention arm, subjects performed Mueller maneuvers (MM) by breathing against occluded mouth and nose to simulate OSA. 25 MMs were performed for 15 s each at esophageal pressure of − 40 cmH2O followed by 15 s of normal breathing. TFV and RLA were monitored continuously. Changes in TFV and RLA from 0 min to 30 min were calculated and compared between study arms using repeated measures ANOVA.Results: In six healthy subjects, MMs caused a significantly greater increase in TFV of 124 ml than the control arm (P = 0.0007, Fig. 1). However, RLA did not change significantly during MMs compared to control (0.3 ± 1.4 vs − 0.9 ± 1.3, P = 0.16).Fig. 1Changes in TFV during MMs and control study arms (n = 6)Full size image Conclusion: The results provide strong evidence that MMs draw fluid into the thorax. However, in healthy subjects this did not affect RLA. Based on our previous findings that induced rostral fluid shift of 53 ml provokes increases in RLA in asthmatics [5, 6], it is likely that MMs will have similar effects in asthmatics. Accordingly, we plan to test this hypothesis in asthmatics. References 1. Kong DL, Qin Z, Shen H, Jin HY, Wang W, Wang ZF. Association of obstructive sleep apnea with asthma: a meta-analysis.

HMOs shape the growth of infant gut microbiota and contribute to immune system development. Maternal secretor status and environmental factors influence HMO synthesis and concentration. While specific genetic variants in fucosyltransferase (FUT) genes are known to determine maternal secretor status, it remains unknown if other genetic factors modulate HMO concentrations in breastmilk [1]. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of genetic variants with the concentration of HMOs in breastmilk.Methods: Our study involved a subgroup of 1206 Canadian mothers from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) birth cohort. Breastmilk samples were collected 3–4 months postpartum. A total of 19 HMOs were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS); secretor status was determined from the presence of 2′-fucosyllactose [2]. Genotyping data were obtained using the Illumina HumanCoreExome BeadChip and imputations were conducted using IMPUTE2 based on sequence data from the 1000 Genomes Project. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of maternal secretor status (logistic regression) and of each HMO concentration (linear regression), which included 6 million imputed variants (minor allele frequency > 0.05). The functional effect prediction tool SnpEff was used for annotation of the associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to determine their potential coding or regulatory functions.Results: We identified significant associations for multiple loci in chromosome 19 (within the region encoding FUT2) with 16 HMO concentrations as well as maternal secretor status. In addition, several variants on chromosome 3 were correlated with 6′-sialyllactose (P = 3.92 × 10−9) and disialyllacto-N-hexaose (P = 1.51 × 10−8); the most significant SNP in this region was a genetic variant located downstream of the β-galactoside α-2,6-sialyltransferase 1 (ST6GAL1) gene.Conclusions: Common genetic variations are strongly correlated with HMO concentrations. In addition to observing expected associations for genetic variants in the FUT2 locus on chromosome 19, we identified several novel associations with variants on chromosome 3. Future work in our lab will investigate the genetic factors modulating other breastmilk components, and determine the long-term impact on infant health and childhood asthma.Acknowledgements: This work was supported by AllerGen NCE Inc., Research Manitoba and CIHR.

This study aimed to identify distinctive patterns of respiratory-related health services use (HSU) between birth and 3 years of age.Methods: We conducted a longitudinal analysis on a sub-cohort enrolled in the Toronto site of the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) birth cohort study in 2009–2012. We included 729 mother and child pairs of this sub-cohort who were linked to Ontario health administrative databases (2009–2016) using unique personal health card numbers. Based on the individual trajectories of hospitalization, emergency department (ED) and physician office visits for respiratory conditions and total healthcare costs, we performed a cluster analysis to identify distinct groups of children who followed a similar pattern of respiratory-related HSU between birth and 3 years of age. Finally, we compared the distributions of early respiratory symptoms and health characteristics across HSU groups, and examined group-specific future healthcare costs between 3 and 5 years of age.Results: Two statistically significant distinct HSU pattern groups were identified. The majority (N = 678, frequency weight = 0.905) showed a pattern of low and stable respiratory care utilization (Low HSU) while the remainder (N = 51, weight = 0.095) showed a pattern of high and varying utilization (High HSU) (Fig. 1). From 0 to 3 years of age, the Low- and High-HSU groups differed in their mean trajectories of total healthcare costs ($783 per 6 months decreased to $114, versus $1796 to $177, respectively). Compared to Low-HSU, the High-HSU group was associated with a constant risk of respiratory-related hospitalizations and early high ED utilization and physician visits for respiratory problems. The two groups differed significantly in the timing of wheezing (late onset in Low-HSU versus early in High-HSU), future total costs (stable versus increased), prevalence of atopy and parental socioeconomic status.Fig. 1Distinct patterns of respiratory-related HSU between 0 and 3 years of age. Right panel shows the model-estimated posterior mean trajectory of each pattern. Left panel shows the observed longitudinal profiles of each patternFull size imageConclusions: We identified distinct patterns of respiratory-related HSU in early life that may be associated with subsequent respiratory-related morbidity. These patterns may help identify at risk children in a large population and inform health resource allocation.A8 Genetic risk score analysis to identify polygenic variations for predicting recurrent wheeze in the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development",

As such, there is uncertainty regarding how host factors modulate the disease course. Case Presentation This report examines these factors in two geriatric patients with multiple comorbid conditions who were residents of the long-term care facility in West Virginia that was the epicenter of COVID-19 in the state. Each patient had substantial, unprotected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 with subsequent negative PCR and antibody testing. Conclusions These cases could represent an important step in understanding host factors that modulate the disease course and susceptibility of patients exposed to SARS-CoV-2, and illustrate the need for further research into host resistance relating to this pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Intestinal helminths have been proposed to have a protective role against allergic sensitization and atopic diseases. However, consistent data demonstrating this are lacking in Sub-Saharan countries. We aimed to assess the association between intestinal helminths and allergic disorders among school children enrolled in mass deworming program in Sululta, Ethiopia. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted among 526 school children aged 5 to 14 years old from primary government schools in Sululta district, Ethiopia. An interviewer-led questionnaire administered to parents provided information on demographic and lifestyle variables. Questions on allergic disease symptoms were collected using the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Children (ISAAC) questionnaire 6 months following deworming treatments. Atopy was defined as a positive skin prick test reaction to one or both dust mite ( Dermatophagoides ) and German cockroach ( Blatella germanica ) allergens. Fresh stool samples were collected, processed, and examined by direct wet mount, Kato-Katz technique, and formol-ether concentration technique. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to assess the association between allergic disorder and helminths infection. Results Of the total 526 school children, 58.2% were females. Overall, 24% (126/526) had allergic symptoms, 5.1% (27/526) had atopy, and 16.9% (89/526) had intestinal helminths. There was no association between helminthic infection and self-reported allergic symptoms (P = 0.317), but Ascaris lumbricoides infection was positively associated with atopy (AOR = 4.307, 95% CI 1.143–16.222, P = 0.031). Atopy was related to increased allergy symptoms (AOR = 2.787, 95% CI 1.253–6.197, P = 0.012), and family history of allergy was associated with increased childhood allergy (AOR = 2.753, 95% CI 1.565–4.841, P = 0.001). Deworming in the past 6 months showed a reduced odd of self-reported allergic symptoms (AOR = 0.581, 95% CI 0.366–0.954, P = 0.034). Conclusion While no significant association between self-reported allergy and helminths was found in this study, this may have been due to the low prevalence and intensity of helminthic infection in the sample. There was a positive association between Ascaris lumbricoides and atopy. To further examine the underlying mechanism behind this positive association, a longitudinal study is needed.",
