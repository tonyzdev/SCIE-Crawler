    "abstract": "The influenza A virus RNA genome segments are packaged in ribonucleoprotein complexes containing RNA polymerase and nucleoprotein. The ribonucleoprotein is involved in the transcription of viral genes and replication of the viral RNA genome in the nucleus of the infected cells, and represents the minimal transcriptional and replicative machinery of an influenza virus. During transcription, the viral RNA polymerase synthesizes capped and polyadenylated mRNA using 5΄ capped RNA primers. During replication, the viral RNA polymerase generates a complementary RNA (cRNA) replication intermediate, a full-length complement of the vRNA that serves as a template for the synthesis of new copies of vRNA. The nucleoprotein is also an essential component of the viral transcriptional machinery. The molecular determinants of the transcriptional and replicative activities of the viral RNA polymerase are not fully understood, but recent data suggest that transcription is performed by a cis-acting RNA polymerase, forming part of the ribonucleoprotein complex, while replication might be carried out by a trans-acting RNA polymerase. Viral as well as cellular factors are known to be involved in the regulation of the activities of the RNA polymerase, e.g. the viral nuclear export protein has been shown to regulate the accumulation of viral transcription and replication products. The viral transcriptional machinery represents an attractive target for the development of antiviral drugs and lead compounds targeting nucleoprotein and the PA endonuclease domain of the RNA polymerase have already been identified.",

    "abstract": "The blood brain barrier consisting of astrocytes, pericytes and brain microvascular endothelial cells plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of neurotropic viruses by controlling the access of circulating molecules, immune cells or viruses into the central nervous system (CNS).However, this barrier is not impenetrable and neuroviruses have evolved to disrupt and evade it.This review aims to describe the underlying entry mechanisms of several neuroviruses such as (Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile virus (WNV), Zika virus (ZIKV), Nipah virus (NiV), Rabies virus (RABV), Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)) into the CNS through BBB disruption.The mechanisms, through which neurotropic viruses enter the BBB, are being studied and are becoming clearer, however, some aspects still remain unknown.Some of these viruses are able to invade the brain parenchyma by a 'Trojan horse' mechanism, through diapedesis of infected immune cells that either cross the BBB paracellularly or transcellularly.Important mechanisms of BBB disruption associated with paracellular entry of viruses include alterations in expression or phosphorylation of tight junction proteins, disruption of the basal lamina and disruption of the actin cytoskeleton.In the absence of such mechanisms, indirect effects of viruses on the immune system are likely causes of barrier disruption.",

In humans, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), Borna disease virus, rabies virus, and influenza A virus have been shown to take the olfactory route for neuroinvasion based on forensic and post-mortem specimens. This article briefly summarizes the anatomy, physiology, and immunology of the olfactory system and presents a battery of neurovirulent viruses that may threaten the human brain by invading through this peripheral pathway, especially focusing on two of the most intensively studied viruses--HSV-1 and influenza A virus. Viruses may insidiously invade the olfactory neural network not only to precipitate encephalitis/encephalopathy but also to promote the development of neurodegenerative and demyelinating disorders. Substantial information obtained by analyzing human specimens is required to argue for or against this hypothesis.",

This study is thus aimed to explore the inhibitory potential of Muuraya koengii bioactive compounds isomahanine, murrayanol and mahanimbine against the EBNA-1 of EBV. 3D structure of EBNA-1 was retrieved from the PDB data bank with further optimization of both the protein and ligands. In-silico inhibitory potential of the selected M. koengii bio-compounds against EBNA-1 as well as the molecular properties of the derivatives against EBNA-1 were assessed. Murrayanol seems to be a potent inhibitory drug to target EBNA-1 with a promising binding energy of -7.21 with two hydrogen bonds. Drug likeliness parameters recorded murrayanol to be the most promising of the tested compounds, followed by isomahanine. Molecular docking evaluations show that EBNA-1 might be inhibited with M. koengii biocompounds. Keywords: EBV; EBNA; M. koengii; in-silico.",

This protein has been attributed many cellular functions, including energy generation, stress response, carcinogenesis and involvement in neurodegenerative diseases, which is well documented by many names it has been given (CSA, MOT, MOT2, GRP75, PBP74, GRP-75, HSPA9B, MGC4500, MTHSP75, and mortalin). As an immortalization marker (hence the name \"mortalin\") in mouse embryonic fibroblasts cybrids it preferentially segregated with loss of immortality in passaged cells. Mortalin regulates the functions of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and plays important roles in stress response and maintenance of the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, mortalin appears to have roles in membrane trafficking and viral release regulation, since it interacts with Nef protein it is necessary for secretion of exosomal negative factor (Nef) and HIV-1 virus release. Recently, mortalin has been described as a significant player in neurodegenerative diseases. Mutations in HSPA9 gene have been found in Parkinson΄s disease patients; mortalin isoform expression differs in hippocampus of patients with Alzheimer΄s disease and could regulate the β-amyloid toxicity pathway. In this review we summarize the functions of mortalin, its pathological implications in neuronal dysfunction and possible roles in neurodegenerative diseases.HSPA9/mortalin/GRP75; mitochondria; cancer; Alzheimer΄s disease.",

Its role during viral infection has largely been unexplored. Wogonin treatment effectively suppressed both influenza A and B virus replication in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells and human lung epithelial (A549) cells. In contrast, wogonin treatment following influenza A virus infection led to up-regulation of interferon (IFN)-induced antiviral signaling. Additionally, influenza A virus infection in A549 cells induced 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and activation in a time-dependent manner and wogonin treatment led to the suppression of AMPK phosphorylation. Furthermore, the treatment with AMPK-specific inhibitor (compound C; CC) attenuated influenza A virus replication. These data suggest that wogonin possesses a potent anti-influenza activity mediated by regulation of AMPK activation, suggesting that wogonin has the potential to be developed as an anti-influenza drug.",

Due to absence of any validated treatments for MPXV infections, the preventive strategies hold significant importance. The current study proposes potential vaccine targets against MPXV by deploying immunoinformatic method. The monkeypox virus encodes 190 different proteins. These proteins were shortlisted on the basis of antigenicity, surface expression, allergenicity, and toxicity. The shortlisted ten proteins were subjected to identification of B- and T-cell epitopes using IEDB, ABCpred, NetMHCpan4.0, and NetMHCIIpan4.0. All the epitopes were further screened for antigenicity, allergenicity, and toxicity properties using VaxiJen, Allertop, and Toxinpred server. All the epitopes have 97.5% worldwide population coverage. Overlapping B-cell, CTL and HTL epitopes were used to design three vaccine construct using suitable linkers and three different adjuvants. Molecular docking was performed for all the three vaccine constructs with TLR4. Based on docking scores and physicochemical profile the vaccine construct V1 with beta defensin adjuvant was selected for further analysis. In silico cloning of V1 into pBAD-DEST49 vector showed maximum expression in bacterial system. Immune simulations also confirmed the high immune responses of V1 within the host cell. The study results may lead towards identification of clinically effective vaccines against MPXV with better safety and potency profile.",

    "abstract": "Viral replication depends entirely on the energy and biosynthetic precursors supplied by the host cell metabolic network. Viruses actively reprogram host cell metabolism to establish optimal environment for their replication and spread. They stimulate the uptake of extracellular nutrients and predominantly modulate glucose, glutamine, and fatty acid metabolism to support anabolic metabolic pathways. Some viruses activate the process of aerobic glycolysis, divert the glycolytic carbon for biosynthetic reactions, and stimulate glutamine utilization to replenish tricarboxylic cycle intermediates. Others use glutamine carbon to promote de novo fatty acid synthesis, amino acid supply or glutathione production. The unique metabolic signature and different dependence of viral life cycle on the individual metabolic processes is therefore characteristic feature of almost each virus. Deeper understanding of how viruses alter cellular metabolic pathways or their upstream regulatory circuits may lead to development of more effective antiviral treatment strategies based on targeted metabolic inhibition.

In this study, four important virus proteins were used to make a multi-epitope protein vaccine. For this purpose, antigenic determinant of 4 proteins were selected and a protein structure was designed using 4 domains containing epitopes. After examining its antigenic potential, its three-dimensional structure was designed and then docked with immune system receptors. Finally, using the dynamic molecular (MD) simulation, complexes and interactions were investigated and their interaction energies were measured. The results of the study showed that the designed structure has good relative stability and interacts well with its receptors and can be used as a vaccine candidate for further studies.",

    "abstract": "Several types of influenza vaccines are available, but due to the highly unpredictable variability of influenza virus surface antigens (hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase) current vaccines are not sufficiently effective against broad spectrum of the influenza viruses. An innovative approach to extend the vaccine efficacy is based on the selection of conserved influenza proteins with a potential to induce inter-subtype protection against the influenza A viruses. A promising new candidate for the preparation of broadly protective vaccine may be a highly conserved N-terminal part of HA2 glycopolypeptide (HA2 gp) called fusion peptide. To study its capacity to induce a protective immune response, we immunized mice with the fusion peptide (aa 1-38 of HA2 gp). The protective ability of fusion peptide was compared with the ectodomain aa 2-23 of M2 protein (eM2) that is antigenically conserved and its immunogenic properties have already been well documented. Corresponding peptides (both derived from A/Mississippi/1/85 (H3N2) virus) were synthesized and conjugated to the keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and used for the immunization of mice. Both antigens induced a significant level of specific antibodies. Immunized mice were challenged with the lethal dose of homologous (H3N2) or heterologous A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) influenza A viruses. Immunization with the fusion peptide led to the 100% survival of mice infected with 1 LD50 of homologous as well as heterologous virus. Survival rate decreased when infectious dose was raised to 2 LD50. The immunization with eM2 induced effective cross-protection of mice infected even with 3 LD50 of both challenge viruses. The lower, but still effective protection induced by the fusion peptide of HA2 gp suggested that besides ectodomain of M2, fusion peptide could also be considered as a part of cross-protective influenza vaccine. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that active immunization with the conjugated fusion peptide of HA2 gp provided the effective production of antibodies, what contributed to the cross-protection against influenza infection.",

In the present study, the antiviral potential of polysaccharide-peptide (PLS) and an extracted β-glucan from Agaricus brasiliensis were investigated in the replication of bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) in HEp-2 cell cultures. The cytotoxicity (CC50) was assayed by the MTT method and the antiviral activity (IC50) was estimated by the plaque reduction assay. To study the possible mode of action of PLS and β-glucan, the following protocols were performed: the virucidal assay, adsorption assay and the time-of-addition assay. The PLS presented a selectivity index (SI) higher than 12.50 and β-glucan 9.19. The antiviral inhibition (67.9%) in cells treated with PLS during virus infection was higher than that in cells treated prior to or post infection. The β-glucan presented high inhibition of virus replication by plaque assay (83.2%) and by immunofluorescence assay (63.8%). Although the mechanism has yet to be defined, we suggest that PLS and β-glucan inhibited BoHV-1 replication by interfering with the early events of viral penetration. Additional studies are required for a better understanding of the mechanism of action of PLS and β-glucan.",

The ongoing outbreak in Wuhan City spread rapidly throughout China, where the fatality rate ranged from 2.1 to 4.9%. Due to its high transmissibility, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020. The current outbreak has the potential to become the first pandemic of the new millennium. Most patients who were first diagnosed with COVID-19 worked at or lived in the vicinity of the local Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where live animals were also on sale. The concerted efforts of Chinese scientists led to the independent isolation from patients and identification of a novel coronavirus, SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), on 6 January 2020; this has been an important step in the development of treatment. The purpose of this article is to overview the history, epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID 2019 reported in recently published studies. Based on the results of virus genome sequencing and a model of the interaction between host cells and the virus, we propose several possible targets for antiviral drugs, which may provide new ideas for epidemic control and vaccine development.

    "abstract": "More than 20 years after the discovery of the first anelloviruses (AVs), they still remain a mysterious group of viruses. To date, there is no clear understanding of their impact on the host organism, although information is emerging about their participation in various pathologies. Unfortunately, the widespread distribution of AVs makes it difficult to determine their significance. However, it is well known that AVs are an important component of the human virome. We assessed the abundance of AVs in viromes from four individual nasal and pharyngeal samples from children with respiratory symptoms using a metagenomic approach. Three of samples were positive for bocavirus, influenza virus A and respiratory syncytial virus, while one sample was negative for any respiratory viruses in standard PCR diagnosis. AVs were detected in all samples, namely Torque teno mini virus (TTMV). The greatest abundance and diversity of AVs [Torque teno virus (TTV), TTMV and Torque teno midi virus (TTMDV)] were observed in a diseased patient who had an absence of respiratory viruses. It is suggested that an activated immune system to combat the main pathogens, against the background of which the number of AVs decreases, may explain the reduced diversity of anellome in other patients. We also compared the results of the metagenomic workflows and qPCR for major respiratory viruses, which were in agreement. In addition, metagenomic sequencing made it possible to obtain additional data on viral genomes in order to establish their taxonomic identification and characterize individual viral profiles in patients.",

This study investigates the prevalence, genetic variability, intrahost population polymorphism and secondary RNA structure of GYSVd-1 in Slovakia, where its molecular characteristics have been largely unexplored. Leaf samples from 49 grapevine plants across western and southern Slovakia were analyzed using RT-PCR, followed by sequencing and phylogenetic analyses. GYSVd-1 was detected in 73% of the samples, demonstrating high prevalence rates across vineyards in Slovakia. Sequence analysis revealed a high degree of genetic similarity among Slovak isolates, with nucleotide identity ranging from 96.2% to 100%, consistent with low variability reported globally. Phylogenetic analyses showed no specific grouping of Slovak isolates. Intrahost variability, assessed via subcloning of RT-PCR products, demonstrated the presence of random mutations among viroid clones, consistent with quasispecies nature of viroids in their hosts. These findings suggest that both interhost and intrahost viroid populations evolve under similar pressures to maintain structural stability essential for viroid function. Secondary RNA structure analysis of Slovak GYSVd-1 isolates revealed that all unambiguous sequences exhibited the characteristic rod-like conformation. In contrast, a significant proportion of sequences from mixed populations failed to form proper rod-like structures, suggesting that these variants may lack biological viability. Overall, this study unveils the prevalence of GYSVd-1 in Slovak vineyards and provides valuable insights to guide future phylogenetic studies and structural analyses of viroids.",

Furthermore, our results revealed that the M protein of PEDV does not induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and does not activate NF-κB which is responsible for IL-8 and Bcl-2 expression.This is the first report to demonstrate that the PEDV M protein is localized in the whole cell and induces cell cycle arrest at the S-phase.This study provides novel findings in the function of M proteins of PEDV.",

Apart from its role in assisting protein folding in cooperation with Hsp10, Hsp60 contributes to regulation of apoptosis, as well as participates in modulation of the immune system activity. Hsp60 may favor oncogenesis by promoting survival or growth of some tumor cell types. Hsp60 is a subject of medical research due to its role in pathogenesis of certain tumors and infectious diseases.

The virions produced in HEK 293 T cells were antigenic, but able to replicate only for one cycle, e.g. first generation single-cycle replicable (SCR) virions. The presence of VSV-G in the envelope of these virions had to ensure a wider spectrum of susceptible cell types for the replication of SCR. Replication of the first generation SCR virions in HEK 293T, MT-2, and mouse spleen cells was examined by p24-capture ELISA, syncytium formation assay, and electron microscopy (EM). HEK 293T and MT-2 cell lines showed a similar replication capacity, while primary cultures of mouse spleen cells were much less effective. The infection of MT-2 cells with the first generation of SCR virions yielded the second generation SCR virions, which were non-infectious. Summing up, the HIV-1 SCR virions represent the useful tool for HIV-1 research facilitating a better biological safety. Moreover, considering their antigenic composition and limited replication, SCR virions may be a promising candidate for the vaccine studies.",

Toxicity of current available drugs and inevitable emergence of multi-drug resistant strains makes things worse. In the present study a series of novel Biginelli-type pyrimidine compounds were evaluated as potential anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 agents using green fluorescence protein (GFP) reporter single round HIV-1 infection assay. The rate of infected cells was monitored by flowcytometry. The effect of compounds on the cellular proliferation was considered as the cyotoxicity. The anti-HIV-1 active compounds were selected for HIV-1 replication and syncytium formation assays. The antiretroviral activity of compounds was measured against luciferase reporter A murine leukemia virus (AMLV) virions as the retrovirus control. Compounds 2, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 20, and 21 were the most potent against HIV-1. Compound 8 had the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 100 nmol/l for inhibiting HIV-1 replication and 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) was up to 100 μmol/l (therapeutic index (TI) >1000). Results show that the active compounds were able to inhibit the retrovirus control as well. Analysis of structure of the studied compounds proved relationships with their anti-HIV-1 effects. Some of the studied compounds seem to be promising anti-HIV-1 drug candidates. Structural manipulation based on the well-defined structure-activity relationships might propose some new leads for anti-HIV-1 drug discovery programs.",

    "abstract": "Apple trees are natural hosts of four economically important virus species in China.We used a simple, sensitive multiplex RT-PCR protocol with an internal control to simultaneously detect and differentiate four apple viruses: apple chlorotic leaf spot virus (ACLSV), apple mosaic virus (ApMV), apple stem pitting virus (ASPV), and apple stem grooving virus (ASGV).This multiplex RT-PCR could be used as an alternative to other routinely used detection methods.We used this protocol to evaluate the occurrence and distribution of the four apple viruses in China.The four viruses were widely distributed throughout the main apple production region of China, including Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Hebei, Beijing, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Shandong, Gansu, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Sichuan, and Yunnan.The four viruses, ApMV, ASPV, ASGV, and ACLSV, were present in 80.1%, 65.1%, 73.7%, and 69.7% of the samples, respectively.Two or more of the viruses were detected in most of the infections.The most frequent virus combinations were ApMV + ASGV + ASPV + ACLSV with an incidence of 27.22%, followed by ApMV + ASGV + ACLSV (14.37%),ApMV + ASGV + ASPV (12.54%), and ASGV + ApMV (11.01%).The incidence of the ASPV + ACLSV combination was the lowest (0.61%).This is the first extensive survey conducted in China for monitoring the four apple viruses, which provides important information for apple virus distribution and management in China.",

Association of SARS-CoV-2 infection with defensins has not been investigated. In this study, we have investigated the expression of defensin genes in the buccal cavity from patients with COVID-19 infection along with negative control samples. Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab samples collected for screening SARS-CoV-2 infection in early 2020 from Hyderabad, India, were analyzed for the expression of major defensin genes by the quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, qRT-PCR. Forty SARS-CoV-2 infected positive and 40 negative swab samples were selected for this study. Based on the qRT-PCR analysis involving gene specific primers for defensin genes, 9 defensin genes were found to be expressed in the nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal cavity. Four defensin genes were found to be significantly down regulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in comparison with the control samples based on differential expression analysis. The significantly down regulated genes were defensin beta 4A/B, 106B, 107B, and 103A. Down regulation of human beta defensin 2, 3, 6 and 7 suggests that antiviral innate immune response provided by defensins may be compromised in SARS-CoV-2 infection resulting in progression of the disease. Correction of the down regulation process through appropriate defensin peptide-based therapy could be an attractive method of treatment.

These include: relative ease of isolation, the ability to differentiate along mesenchymal and non-mesenchymal lineages in vitro and the ability to be extensively expanded in culture without a loss of differentiative capacity. MSC are not only hypoimmunogenic, but they mediate immunosuppression upon transplantation, and possess pronounced anti-inflammatory properties. They are able to home to damaged tissues, tumors, and metastases following systemic administration. The ability of homing holds big promise for tumor-targeted delivery of therapeutic agents. Viruses are naturally evolved vehicles efficiently transferring their genes into host cells. This ability made them suitable for engineering vector systems for the delivery of genes of interest. MSC can be retrovirally transduced with genes encoding prodrug-converting genes (suicide genes), which are not toxic per se, but catalyze the formation of highly toxic metabolites following the application of a nontoxic prodrug. The homing ability of MSC holds advantages compared to virus vehicles which display many shortcomings in effective delivery of the therapeutic agents. Gene therapies mediated by viruses are limited by their restricted ability to track cancer cells infiltrating into the surrounding tissue, and by their low migratory capacity towards tumor. Thus combination of cellular therapy and gene delivery is an attractive option - it protects the vector from immune surveillance, and supports targeted delivery of a therapeutic gene/protein to the tumor site.",

The present study reports development and standardization of an isothermal based recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay for a sensitive, rapid, easy, and cost-effective method for detection and diagnosis of CYMV. Two different oligonucleotide primer sets were designed from ORF III (coding for polyprotein) and ORF II (coding for virion associated protein) regions of CYMV to perform amplification assays. Comparative evaluation of RPA, PCR and immuno-capture recombinase polymerase amplification (IC-RPA) based assays were done using purified DNA and plant crude sap. CYMV infection was efficiently detected from the crude sap in RPA and IC-RPA assays. The primer set used in RPA was specific and did not show any cross-amplification with banana streak MY virus (BSMYV), another Badnavirus species. The results from the present study indicated that RPA assay can be used easily in routine indexing of citrus planting material. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on development of a rapid and simplified isothermal detection assay for CYMV and can be utilized as an effective technique in quarantine and budwood certification process.",

As some RNA viruses can be directly transmitted from bats to humans, it is crucial to collect data about their frequency, genetic diversity and phylogenetic characterization. In this study, we report the molecular identification of 44 new astroviruses (with a detection rate of 4.5%) in 962 apparently healthy bats that belong to five different species and that were captured in different caves in North-East Gabon, Central Africa. Our results show that bat astroviruses form a group that is genetically distinct from astroviruses infecting other mammals. Moreover, these astroviruses showed an important genetic diversity and low host restriction in bat species.",

This study compared the changes in cellular metabolism, ROS levels, antioxidant enzyme activities, and Keap-1/Nrf2 pathway in IAV-infected MDCK cells after NTZ treatment in vitro , using LC-MS-based metabolomics, flow cytometry, immunoblot. We observed that the NTZ treatment in the IAV-infected cells drastically altered the metabolism of small molecules, among which eleven metabolites were highly relevant to NTZ. The virus induced oxidative stress was also remarkably suppressed by NTZ. Meanwhile, the Nrf2 pathway and some proteins with modulating antiviral activity were activated after NTZ treatment, protecting cells from IAV injury. Therefore, regulation of the intracellular oxidative state is the primary outcome of NTZ treatment, which may underpin an antiviral mechanism attributed to the thiazolide.",

Here, we investigate the effects of SP (stabilized in prefusion conformation) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC-C) lineage on the ACE-2 expression profile and in cell glucose metabolism. Our data indicate that SP binds to ACE-2, is internalized by HUVEC-C cells, and positively modulates ACE-2 expression. In addition, SP alone induces a transient increase in glucose uptake and a decrease in lactate production, characterizing itself as a metabolic regulating protein. The present study is the first to demonstrate that SP induces a slight change in cell metabolism, promotes the overexpression of ACE-2 and its increased availability in the membrane of endothelial cells in a time-dependent fashion.",

The virus does not exclusively infect humans, but can also be found in non-human primates as in the families Hominidae (chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan) and Hylobatidae (gibbon), which are distributed over Africa (chimpanzee and gorilla) and Southeast Asia (orangutan and gibbon), the endemic areas of human HBV. The prevalence of asymptomatic HBV carriers reaches in gibbons 23-33% and in orangutans 15%. The genome organization of non-human primate HBVs is nearly identical to that of human HBVs. Because of this close similarity, the question of cross-transmission of HBV between species has arisen. There are many data on cross-transmission of human HBVs to the non-human primates. However, a cross-transmission of HBVs from non-human primates to humans has not been reported yet. Using more advanced diagnostic methods, the non-human primates have increasingly been identified as a reservoir of several viruses such as lymphocryptoviruses, Cercopithecine herpesvirus 1 (CeHV-1), Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), Simian foamy virus (SFV), and HBVs. Thus veterinarians, zookeepers, or people in close contact with non-human primates may potentially become infected with those viruses causing severe diseases. Enhanced awareness of prevalence, genetic relatedness and evolution of non-human primate HBVs will help prevent further spread and cross-transmission of these viruses between humans and non-human primates.",

We included 148 HCC cases and 148 controls from the Tanta Cancer Center and the Gharbiah Cancer Society in the Nile delta region. Serological (ELISA) and molecular (PCR) analysis for HBV and HCV infection were performed on plasma samples from each subject. Epidemiologic, environmental, and medical histories were collected by interviewing of subjects. Around 90.5% of cases and controls were from rural areas. HCV infection was high in both cases and controls (89.2% and 49.3%, for cases and controls respectively by serology). HCV was the most important HCC risk factor [OR 9.7 (95% CI: 3.3-28.0, P <0.01)], and HBV infection showed marginal tendency of increased risk [OR 5.4 (95% CI: 0.9-31.8, P <0.06)].

    "abstract": "The differences in the influenza viral pathogenesis observed between different pathogenic strains are associated with distinct properties of virus strains and the host immune responses.In order to determine the differences in the duck immune response against two different pathogenic strains, we studied genome-wide host immune gene response of ducks infected with A/duck/India/02CA10/2011 and A/duck/ Tripura/103597/2008 H5N1 viruses using custom-designed microarray.A/duck/India/02CA10/2011 is highly pathogenic virus (HP) to ducks, whereas A/duck/Tripura/103597/2008 is a low pathogenic (LP) virus strain.Comparative lung tissue transcriptome analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed that 686 genes were commonly expressed, 880 and 1556 genes are expressed uniquely to infection with HP and LP virus, respectively.The up-regulation of chemokines (CCL4 and CXCR4) and IFN-stimulated genes (IFITM2, STAT3, TGFB1 and TGFB3) was observed in the lung tissues of ducks infected with HP virus.The up-regulation of other immune genes (IL17, OAS, SOCS3, MHC I and MHC II) was observed in both infection conditions.The expression of important antiviral immune genes MX, IFIT5, IFITM5, ISG12, β-defensins, RSAD2, EIF2AK2, TRIM23 and SLC16A3 was observed in LP virus infection, but not in HP virus infection.Several immune-related gene ontology terms and pathways activated by both the viruses were qualitatively similar but quantitatively different.Based on these findings, the differences in the host immune response might explain a part of the difference observed in the viral pathogenesis of high and low pathogenic influenza strains in ducks.",

BT disease is caused by bluetongue virus (BTV) of the genus Orbivirus (the family Reoviridae). BTV is transmitted by certain species of biting midges of the genus Culicoides. Although originally BT was restricted to African continent, now it is present in all the continents except Antarctica. Conventional BT vaccines such as live attenuated and inactivated vaccines showed different degree of success in BT control. However, conventional vaccines have certain disadvantages of reversion to virulent strain and frequent booster dose requirement. Several BT outbreaks in India and the rest of the world open a new insight for development of better vaccines. The development in molecular biology techniques allowed the development and validation of several modern vaccines such as subunit vaccine, recombinant vector vaccine, disabled infections single cycle (DISC) vaccine, differentiating infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) approach etc. Most of these vaccines are considered as safer, having better protective immune response and provided cross-protective immunization against more than one serotype.

As for the cellular responses, the adjuvanted fusion peptide induced lymphocyte proliferation, CTL response, and cytokines IFN-gamma and IL-4 in the Th1 pattern. Humoral immune response to the adjuvanted fusion peptide included an increase in IgG antibodies of more IgG2a than IgG1 subtype. These results indicate that the employed HIV-1 peptide construct can elicit both cellular and humoral immune responses in mice.

Single infections were prevalent in years 2005-2007 and the most frequent were those of PVY. A triple combination of those viruses was most frequent mixed infection type in 2008. The presence of all five detected viruses was confirmed in selected ELISA-positive samples by RT-PCR and sequencing. The comparisons of obtained virus isolate sequences with those available in NCBI, confirmed the authenticity of serologically detected viruses. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial nucleocapsid gene sequences revealed a joint clustering of Serbian, Bulgarian and Montenegrin TSWV isolates into one geographic subpopulation, which was distinct from the other subpopulation of TSWV isolates from the rest of the European countries.

PB1-F2 has been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection as well as to the secondary bacterial infection.

We proved that PB1-F2 protein increased the level of expression of PB1 protein and vRNA in the infected cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that a higher level of vRNA expression resulted in the increase of expression of multiple viral proteins, including NP, M1, and NS1. Finally, we used plasmids expressing N-terminal (1-50 aa) or C-terminal (51-87 aa) region of the PB1-F2 molecule for transfection of MDCK cells co-infected with influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) virus deficient in the PB1-F2 protein expression (PR8ΔPB1-F2). These experiments clearly showed that N-terminal region of PB1-F2 protein was responsible for the increase in PB1 protein expression. C-terminal region of PB1-F2 protein had no effect. Thus, we have identified the important function for N-terminal region of PB1-F2 protein.",

Testing of 1777 sheep and 1026 goat blood samples collected between 2004 and 2008 resulted in isolation of twelve pestiviruses, seven from sheep and five from goats. All of them were antigenically typed as bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV-1). Both the partial 5ʹ-UTR and entire non-structural autoprotease (Npro) gene of the pestiviruses were amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced. The phylogenetic analysis confirmed all twelve sheep and goat pestiviruses as BVDV-1 and they were further classified into two subtypes, BVDV-1b (seven) and BVDV-1c (five). This is for the first time that BVDV-1c was detected in sheep and goats. However, no association between the subtype and geographic area of origin was observed. Although closely related, BVDV-1b and BVDV-1c isolates of sheep and goats were placed in a different clade than previously reported Indian BVDV-1b/BVDV-1c isolates. This study confirmed widespread prevalence of BVDV-1 in Indian sheep and goats that has significance in the epidemiology of bovine viral diarrhea.bovine viral diarrhea virus; BVDV-1; goat; Npro; genetic typing; sheep; 5ʹ-UTR.",

The BnRV1 genome was 12,293 nucleotides long followed by a poly(A) tail. Two open reading frames (ORFs), called ORF1 and ORFX, were predicted. The larger ORF, ORF1, encodes a polyprotein of 3,471 amino acids and the smaller ORF, ORFX, overlaps ORF1 and encodes an 87 aa long protein of unknown function. The BnRV1 ORF1 polyprotein was predicted to undergo proteolytic processing to yield seven mature proteins, including an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and three distinct coat proteins. The ORF1 and ORFX proteins share sequence similarities with the respective proteins of viruses in the genus Waikavirus, including the bellflower vein chlorosis virus, rice tungro spherical virus, and maize chlorotic dwarf virus. A phylogenetic tree inferred from a conserved segment of the polyproteins of several Secoviridae viruses confirmed that BnRV1 is a novel species of the genus Waikavirus. The BnRV1 genome sequence identified in this study may be useful for the study of waikavirus biology and waikavirus-derived diseases.

COVID-19 is a pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), previously known as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Typical symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough and fatigue. As a novel disease, there are still many unsolved questions regarding COVID-19. Nevertheless, genetic analysis has demonstrated that the virus is strongly associated with certain SARS-like coronavirus originated from bats. The COVID-19 outbreak started in a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, China, but the exact origin of the virus is still highly debatable. Since there is currently no registered antiviral drug for the disease, symptomatic treatments have been applied routinely to manage COVID-19 cases. However, various drugs and vaccines have been currently under research. This review aims to consolidate and discuss the likely origins and genetic features of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the recent clinical findings and potential effective treatments of COVID-19.

Two bait plasmids that expressed DNA binding domain (BD) fused to either RNA binding domain or to effector domain of NS1 were constructed and transformed into yeast. The bait yeast was mated with a prey yeast containing human macrophage cDNA library fused to DNA activation domain. Obtained clones were interacting with interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), MHC class I HLA-B, cathepsin B, ubiquitin, and adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR1). These proteins play important role in the immune response, targeting for proteosomal degradation, and RNA editing.

In this study, we investigated RSV gene expression in RSV-infected rice tissues and in viruliferous SBPH using a sensitive and reliable real-time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) method. The results revealed that NS3 gene exhibited the highest abundant expression in both, rice plants and SBPH. Disease-specific protein (SP) gene was the only gene with highest expression in rice, but not in SBPH. The expression levels of other genes were lower than SP and approximately equal to each other in both, in rice and SBPH. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in SBPH was present in a notably low level.

    "abstract": "The reported incidence of vector-borne diseases including various cases of Rickettsioses in humans is increasing due to a combination of climatic and social factors, escalating the opportunities for contact between people and ticks, fleas or lice.Many of the emerging infectious diseases currently challenging human health in Europe are transmitted by ticks which normally feed on domestic or wild animals.Each Rickettsia spp.has one or several tick vectors, and their geographical distribution varies according to geographical conditions; e.g.; altitude or temperature, which is gradually changing due to a global warming.Evidence of Rickettsia spp.particularly of a newly discovered species is a strong indication that a great number of diseases may be caused by so far undetected or unrecognized organisms.Their diagnosis relies mostly on rare \"spot like\" cooperation of clinicians with scientists, the members of the working groups that are devoted to the scientific studies of the corresponding research areas.The clinical picture of the disease caused by rickettsiae varies significantly from flu like symptoms to severe fatal outcomes, reflecting the various factors, e.g. a variability of virulence of rickettsial species due to cell invasion, dissemination of rickettsiae, genomics, immune response of an infected organism, or a tricky impact of a treatment.Several major reviews on rickettsioses have been previously published, e.g. in 1997 (Raoult and Roux, 1997a), in 2005(Parola et al., 2005), and in 2011 (Botelho-Nevers and Raoult, 2011).In this work we intend to present a short historical overview and to describe new trends in research studies of rickettsiology.The main focus will be on rickettsioses affecting Europe΄s population.",

    "abstract": "The freshwater Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis), an indigenous crustacean in China, has been cultured for more than 30 years. It was reported that the bunya-like virus from Eriocheir sinensis (EsBV) was associated with the tremor disease (TD), which causes high mortality and has a serious impact on production. In this study, full-length genome sequences of EsBV were pursued using next generation sequencing; the genome of EsBV was found to be composed of 6.7 kb L, 3.3 kb M, and 0.8 kb S segments, respectively. PCR detection based genomic sequences showed that the positive rate of EsBV reached 40% in crabs from farming ponds. EsBV had the highest similarity with the Wenling crustacean virus 9, an unassigned, negative sense ssRNA virus. EsBV clustered with the Wenling crustacean virus 9 firstly, and then the branch clustered with Peribunyaviridae clade in every phylogenetic tree - based on L, M and S encoded sequences, respectively, indicating that EsBV can be classified in the family Peribunyaviridae, to which the orthobunyaviruses belongs, but not belonging to any known genera in the family Peribunyaviridae. There were unique complimentary terminal sequences for EsBV, with only partial consensus with members from the orthobunyaviruses. We believe that the findings of this research will be vital for future research about EsBV and will also go a long way in illuminating its relationship with TD.

To better understand the molecular evolution and genetic variation of DHAV-3, a total of 482 dead Cherry Valley duckling liver samples collected from Shandong province of China during 2012-2014 were tested, and the complete P1 coding sequences of 18 DHAV-3 strains were analyzed. The detection rate of DHAV-3 was 64.5% (311/482) in clinical liver samples and 73.0% (92/126) in duckling flocks. The P1 genes of the 18 DHAV-3 isolates shared 91.9%-99.0% nucleotide similarity and 95.2%-100% amino acid similarity with those of the other 26 reference strains. Based on the P1 and VP1 gene sequences, phylogenetic analysis results indicated that the genotyping of DHAV-3 strains presented a distinct geographical distribution. Except B63 strain, all Chinese strains isolated from different host species (duck or goose) at different time were classed into the CH genotype. All Korean and Vietnamese strains belonged to the KV genotype, and all the Korean strains were clustered into KV1 subgenotype, while B63 strain and the Vietnamese strains from different host species (duck or goose) were clustered into KV2 subgenotype. Ten variable amino acid residues were highly conserved within genotypes or subgenotypes in the VP0, VP3 and VP1, respectively, which were possibly the geographic molecular markers of DHAV-3. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study about the genetic variation of the P1 gene of different DHAV-3 strains, which will be helpful for understanding of the molecular epidemiology of DHAV-3.",

The total nucleic acid extracted from these samples was amplified by PCR using universal 16S rRNA primers specific to phytoplasma and primers specific to DNA-A-like sequence of begomovirus. A total of eighteen eggplant samples showing the symptoms of little leaf and mosaic tested positive for the presence of both begomovirus and phytoplasma. The phytoplasma associated with the mixed symptoms of mosaic and little leaf in the eggplant samples was identified as a member belonging to Clover proliferation group (16SrVI) (nucleotide sequence identity of 97.5-97.8%). The characterized begomovirus from the eggplant samples was identified as a strain of previously described bipartite begomovirus tomato leaf curl Palampur virus (ToLCPalV) (92.5-94.1% nucleotide sequence identity), which is known to infect cucurbits and solanaceous crops in India and Ireland. Further, putative recombination events were detected within the 16S rRNA gene F2n/R2 fragment of phytoplasma and DNA-A of strain of ToLCPalV. Most of the sequence variations observed within the phytoplasma were due to intra and interspecific recombination events between eggplant little leaf-16SrVI-D, Ca. P. asteris-16SrI and Ca. P. pruni-16SrIII. Similarly, most of the DNA fragments of newly characterized strain of ToLCPalV appear to have been derived from tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV), squash leaf curl China virus (SLCCNV) and ToLCPalV like ancestors. This perhaps is the first evidence of mixed infection of both phytoplasma-begomovirus in eggplant in India.",

The fruits, seeds, and root tubers of T. kirilowii have been used clinically in traditional Chinese medicine. The TrARV1 genome sequence was predicted to have six open reading frames (ORFs) encoding five canonical structural proteins of the family Rhabdoviridae (N ORF for nucleocapsid, P ORF for phosphoprotein, M ORF for matrix protein, G ORF for glycoprotein, and L ORF for polymerase), and an accessory protein. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses based on L and N proteins confirmed that TrARV1 is a novel member of the genus Cytorhabdovirus of the family Rhabdoviridae. TrARV1 is most closely related to Wuhan insect virus 5 and persimmon virus A. The putative cis-regulatory elements involved in transcription termination and polyadenylation, commonly found in the gene junction regions of rhabdoviruses, were also identified in the TrARV1 genome having the consensus sequence 3'- ACUAAAUUAUUUUGAUCUUU-5'.

Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis indicated that these 14 plant-associated dicistro-like viruses were novel members of the family Dicistroviridae, five of which are placed within the genera Aparavirus and Cripavirus, which mainly consist of viruses infecting animals, including insects. The other nine plant dicistro-like viruses formed clades with unclassified dicistroviruses.

The TcCV1 genome was predicted to encode nine proteins, eight of which have orthologs in previously identified closteroviruses. The TcCV1 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and heat shock protein 70 homolog (Hsp70h) showed 27.8-68.2% and 23.8-55.1% amino acid identity, respectively, to orthologous proteins of known closteroviruses.

The gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection is RT-qPCR; however, for early and low viral load detection, a much more sensitive method, such as droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), is required. Our first step was to developed both, ddPCR and RT-qPCR methods, for sensitive SARS-CoV-2 detection. Analysis of ten swab/saliva samples of five Covid-19 patients in different stages of disease showed positivity in 6/10 samples with RT-qPCR and 9/10 with ddPCR. We also used our RT-qPCR method for SARS-CoV-2 detection without the need of RNA extraction, obtaining results in 90-120 minutes. We analyzed 116 self-collected saliva samples from passengers and airport staff arriving from abroad. All samples were negative by RT-qPCR, while 1 was positive, using ddPCR. Lastly, we developed ddPCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 variants identification (alpha, beta, gamma, delta/kappa) that are more economically advantageous when compared to NGS. Our findings demonstrated that saliva samples can be stored at ambient temperature, as we did not observe any significant difference between a fresh sample and the same sample after 24 hours (p = 0.23), hence, saliva collection is the optimal route for sampling airplane passengers. Our results also showed that droplet digital PCR is a more suitable method for detecting virus from saliva, compared to RT-qPCR.

The major categories of pathogenic emerging and re-emerging viral infections include respiratory, arthropod-borne and bat-borne zoonotic viruses. These viral infections are notorious for causing immune dysregulation and have the potential to mount excessive immune reaction, causing immunopathology that includes tissue injury, systemic inflammation, multi-organ failure and even death. A better understanding of the emerging or re-emerging viral-mediated immunomodulation is necessary for controlling the virus, while preventing severity of the disease associated with exaggerated immune response.

Intracerebral (i.c.) inoculation of weaning mice was followed then by 17 and 20 serial passages in Vero cells of RFV and PM strains, respectively. The adapted strains designated as FRV/K and PM/K gave titres of 10(6) +/- 1.5 log (LD50/ml for i.c. inoculated mice) in several harvests taken from one infected cell culture. Pooled harvests were concentrated 20-fold by ultrafiltration and were tested as animal vaccine after inactivation with beta-propiolactone (BPL). Another vaccine preparation destined for human use, in addition to concentration and inactivation, was also purified by gel filtration. Control tests revealed that the antigenic content of different strain FRV/K harvests was very high in comparison with that of strain PM/K and the reference tissue culture vaccine (RIV, Netherland). In sheep the antibody response induced by the FRV/K strain was very high; serum neutralizing index (NI) higher than 4 was reached 40 days after the second vaccine dose, whereas the vaccine preparation from strain PM/K gave NI of 2.3 and the reference vaccine NI of 3.8, respectively.

Three mutant prM and/or E (prM-E) genes lacking N-glycosylation sites were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. The effects of the N-glycan on folding, secretion and cytotoxicity of mutant proteins were determined by comparison with their wild type (wt) counterparts. Removal of N-glycan from the prM protein resulted in a complete misfolding of the E protein and failure to form virus-like particles (VLPs). A similar removal of N-glycan from the E protein led to a low efficiency of its folding and VLPs formation. The secretion and cytotoxicity of the E protein was also markedly impaired in case the glycosylation sites in the prM or E or both proteins were removed. These results suggest that the N-glycosylation of the prM protein is critical to the folding of the E protein, which makes it pivotal in the cytotoxicity of JEV particles and their production.",

These results suggested that the flavonoid may be a viable therapeutic option for recurrent HSV-1 infection.",

    "abstract": "Many aspects of the pathogenesis of Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) still need further elucidations.Previous studies have indicated that oxidative stress occurs during infection with the other retrovirus, human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1).Similar results have been observed in some other chronic viral infections including hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV).In order to reveal possible oxidative stress in HTLV-1-infected patients, we evaluated serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC) as an indicator of oxidative stress in these patients.Forty-four HTLV-1-seropositive individuals were included in this study, consisting of 12 symptomatic and 32 asymptomatic (carrier) cases.Controls consisted of 36 apparently healthy, HTLV-1-, HIV-and hepatitis-seronegative individuals.All symptomatic patients had HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/ tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP).Serum TAC levels in patients and healthy individuals were measured using a quantitative TAC assay.The antioxidant capacity in HTLV-1-seropositive cases was significantly reduced compared to control group (P = 0.001).In addition, TAC was lower in patients with more than 5 years history of HAM/TSP compared to those with ≤5 years duration of the myelopathy (P = 0.03).Our results show a depletion of TAC during HTLV-1 infection, which intensifies along with the disease progress.This finding indicates a role of the oxidative stress in pathogenesis of HTLV-1.These results may prompt further research to evaluate any possible therapeutic effect of antioxidant dietary supplements for HTLV-1 infected individuals.",

A single nucleotide change in this part of the genome and its effect on the amino acid sequence may significantly affect the range of infected hosts, tropism for specific tissues, or virulence. The high polymorphism in the hypervariable region can be exploited for phylogenetic analysis. The aim of this study was to analyze the polymorphism of the VP2 hypervariable region in isolates of the Aleutian mink disease virus (AMDV) infecting Polish mink farms and to determine the phylogenetic relationships between the Polish isolates and genetic variants of the pathogen occurring in other countries. The study compares farms from two regions of Poland. The isolates contained five changes in the amino acid sequence, which had not previously been recorded in the NCBI database. There were 21 changes noted between the genotypes obtained and the sequence of the reference strain [GenBank NC_001662.1], of which 8 were in the hypervariable region. The isolates identified in our study exhibit a high degree of similarity within the farms, but between farms there is considerable variation in the amino acid sequence of the VP2 protein fragment. Because variants characteristic for farms were obtained, it will be possible to trace the movement of the virus between farms, and in the longer term to use the characteristic sequences as a marker of the origin of infected animals.",

SPF chickens were intranasally inoculated with 104 EID50/0.1 ml of the virus. Sera, fecal swabs, and different tissue samples were collected on different days post infection. Clinical signs, gross pathology, and histological changes were recorded. The amount of virus genome was quantified in different tissues and feces using quantitative real-time PCR assay. The highest viral loads were detected in the feces and cecal tonsils. Real-time PCR results demonstrated variant-2 tropism for respiratory tract, digestive system and renal tissue that is due to its epitheliotropic nature. This is the first pathogenicity study of Iranian variant-2 virus. Based on histology observations and clinical signs this isolate was classified as a nephropathogenic IBV.

The intracellular residency of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria was observed in CRS. The overall prevalence of CRS is estimated between 5-15% in the human population, and biofilms were formed in sinuses in 40-80% of cases. The bacterial species S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are known to form difficult to treat biofilms in CRS. Bacteriophages (phages) or lysins can be alternatives to antibiotics in the biofilm treatment. The application of a P. aeruginosa phage cocktail ex vivo decreased biofilm biomass of bacterial isolates from the sinuses of CRS patients by a median of 70%. Further, animal studies performed on a sheep sinusitis model demonstrated significant reduction in S. aureus and P. aeruginosa biofilm biomass by phage cocktails while maintaining safe prolonged topical application (up to 20 days). Staphylococcal lysin P128 used at a concentration of ≥12.5 µg/ml in vitro against the biofilm of methicillin sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates from the sinuses of CRS patients demonstrated a significant reduction of the biofilm (up to 95.5%). Staphylococcal lysin CHAP(k) applied in vivo in mice nasal infection caused a significant 2 log reduction of S. aureus suggesting its potential use against bacteria in nasal mucosa. Furthermore, a beneficial effect of phage therapy in the treatment of chronic sinusitis in humans was observed. Here, we summarize the recent, quite scarce data regarding phage application in chronic rhinosinusitis and look further into this phenomenon.

    "abstract": "Persistent infection with gammaherpesviruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus may lead to development of various lymphomas and carcinomas in humans. Murid gammaherpesvirus 4 (MuHV-4, also known as MHV-68) is widely used as a model to study all aspects of gammaherpesvirus pathogenesis. Similar to human gammaherpesviruses, MuHV-4 is known for its variability, as evidenced by the existence of multiple strains/variants that differ from each other in primary sequence and some pathogenetic features. Detailed knowledge of the dependence of pathogenic properties on genome structure and sequence would help to better understand the complex host-pathogen interactions. The main aim of this study was to analyze how various strains/variants of MuHV-4, mainly MHV-72 and MHV-4556 induce latency and reactivation. In this study, we characterized the ability of MHV-72 and MHV-4556 to establish latency in spleen, lungs and thymus of immunocompetent mice after intranasal infection. Moreover, we described the potential of these strains to reactivate ex vivo using the method of tissue explantation and stimulation with inhibitor of histone deacetylases, trichostatin A. Our results clearly demonstrate that both MHV-72 and MHV-4556 exhibit a significant deficit in the establishment of deep latency in spleen. Moreover, MHV-72 has a reduced ability to establish latency in lungs as well as thymus. Regarding reactivation, we found that both MHV-72 and MHV-4556 have a significant deficit in ex vivo reactivation from latency in lungs as well as thymus in comparison to MHV-68. Moreover, MHV-72 also possessed a deficit in the ex vivo reactivation from spleen. In contrast, MHV-4556 was able to respond to the trichostatin A-mediated reactivation stimuli by increasing the DNA copy number but had a defect in the release from tissue during the early and deep latency in spleen. Our results contribute to molecular characterization of differences among the MuHV-4 strains in the ability to establish latency and reactivation and could also serve to better understanding of strain-dependent variances among human gammaherpesviruses.",

Blood, heart, and pancreas were collected for virological and histopathological analysis. The presence of viral RNA in the heart and pancreas of infected mice was studied. Different cytokines were detected in the serum. Pathological changes were absent in the hearts of infected mice. Maximum pathological changes were identified in the pancreas of infected A/J mice. Infiltration of pancreatic cells was observed depending on the mouse strain and mutants. CD1 mice were less susceptible to CVB2 infection. CVB2/O/VP1-Q164K mutant induced maximum changes in the pancreas of A/J-infected mice. We suggest that the single altered amino acid in the VP1 protein was related to the virulence factor and was associated with the pathology and presence of viral RNA in the pancreas of infected A/J mice.",

The first one at the glycosidic hydroxyl group of the reducing GlcN I and the second one at the O-4' position of the non-reducing GlcN II. The primary fatty acids consisted of three 3-hydroxytetradecanoic [C14:0(3-OH)] and one 3-hydroxyhexadecanoic [C16:0(3-OH)] acids. The latter was amide-linked to GlcN I and one C14:0(3-OH) was amide-linked to GlcN II. Two secondary fatty acids were represented by C14:0(3-OH) and were equally distributed between the O-2' and O-3' positions. The phosphate group at O-4' carried a non-stoichiometric substituent Ara4N. The minor lipid A species contained exclusively C14:0(3-OH) with an asymmetric distribution (4+2) at GlcN II and GlcN I, respectively. The P. salmonis lipid A resembles structurally strongly endotoxic enterobacterial lipid A. This could be one of the reasons for the observed high endotoxicity of P. salmonis.",

Tissue samples from 122 cervical cancers, 104 lung cancers, and 138 controls were subjected to RT-PCR or PCR, sequencing, and sequence analysis. The infection rates of HPV-16 in cervical, lung cancers, and non-malignant controls were 68.9%, 17.3%, and 37.0%, respectively. Asian prototype variants prevailed in cervical and lung cancers, while European prototype variants in non-malignant controls. In comparison to the lung cancer, cervical cancer showed a much higher diversity of HPV-16 oncogenes. These results indicate that in Sichuan, China, Asian prototype variants of HPV-16 are more pathogenic than their European counterparts.",

They are responsible for the recognition of various antigens and take part in the modulation of immunity responses. In general, they are divided into \"bacterial\" and \"viral\" TLRs, even though this classification overlaps in some cases. Genetic similarity of TLRs gives them the status of highly conservative proteins throughout the animal kingdom. However, there is a certain level of variation between different species that can result in semi-disparate recognition ability. Furthermore, their universal signaling pathways predispose them not only as a target for vaccination trials in humans, but also for the genetic selection in veterinary medicine. Moreover, the selection pressure and their conservative properties make them a suitable system for the evolutionary studies, since each separate genetic system has its own unique ortholog/paralog. TLRs 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9 play a crucial role in the recognition and modulation of the innate immunity in response to the viral infection due to their predominant localization on the white blood cells and endothelial cells, while intracellularly localized TLRs lead the way.",

All alphaherpesviruses have developed sophisticated strategies to interfere with the host cell apoptotic mechanisms, but the ability of EHV-1 to induce apoptosis in neurons has not been determined yet. In this study, apoptotic and necrotic changes in cultured murine neurons were methods identifying key stages of apoptosis. These methods have demonstrated characteristic apoptosis features, like DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation, membrane blebbing and cell shrinkage in the infected cells. It seems likely that apoptosis was the predominant way of cell death in EHV-1-infected murine neurons. However, we showed also that during acute EHV-1 infection the majority of infected neurons remained unchanged and survived for more than eight weeks in culture, suggesting some protective mechanisms induced by the virus. Furthermore, it was shown that infection of neurons with EHV-1 has no significant influence on the level of the caspase 3, 7, and 8. We speculate that the control of apoptosis may be the key mechanism regulating the balance between productive and latent infection at the site of virus persistence.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of telbivudine on number and function of DCs in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). After 6 months of telbivudine treatment, the number of plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) increased significantly, nearly to levels observed in normal controls. However the capacity of pDCs to produce interferon α (IFN-α) was not enhanced during treatment. Accordingly, monocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs) exhibited a markedly enhanced expression of HLA-DR, decreased expression of PD-L1, and increased capacity to produce interleukin (IL)-12. These findings suggest that the improved function of peripheral myeloid DCs (mDCs) with telbivudine therapy in CHB patients may be associated with up-regulated expression of HLA-DR and down-regulated expression of PD-L1.",

However, the precise role of the PRV UL54 protein in the virus life cycle is still poorly understood. To shed more light on this problem, we considered it essential to have available an antiserum specifically detecting this protein. Since it was known that a full-length UL54 protein is a too big molecule for efficient expression in prokaryotic systems, it was truncated from 1 to 66 N-terminal amino acids, fused to EYFP-His tag and expressed in Escherichia coli through an appropriate expression vector. The truncated protein was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and used for raising an antiserum in rabbits. Western blot analysis showed that this antiserum specifically recognized the purified truncated as well as full-length UL54 protein in PRV-infected cells. Immunofluorescence assay confirmed the latter finding and also demonstrated localization of this protein first in nucleoli and later in whole nuclei of PRV-infected cells. These results indicate that the prepared antiserum could serve as a valuable tool in further studies of PRV UL54 protein function.",

Conserved cleavage sites between individual viral proteins of this region were determined and the number of amino acids of respective proteins was estimated as follows: 168 for Npro, 100 for C, 227 for Erns, 195 for E1, 373 for E2, 70 for p7, 453 for NS2, and 683 for NS3. Based on sequence and phylogenetic analysis of 5΄-UTR, Npro, and E2 the isolate 297 was characterized as a border disease virus of genotype 3. It was found to be distinct from other BDV-3 strains analyzed so far, consequently forming a distinct branch within the phylogenetic clade. All these data expand a relatively limited knowledge of genetic properties of individual BDV genotypes and strains circulating in the Central Europe.",

Additionally, neither the genome B genomic component nor the DNA beta sequence was detected. The results of phylogenetic analysis using the maximum parsimony method showed that SPLCV-KR is more closely related to SPLCV-US (US) than SPLCV-CN (China) and SPLCV-JP (Japan). A tandem repeat dimer of SPLCV-KR was cloned and found to be infectious in sweet potatoes (Ipomoea batatas) via biolistic inoculation. The SPLCV-infected sweet potatoes exhibited mild leaf curl symptoms of SPLCD, and the newly-replicated viral DNA was detected via Southern blot analysis. Results of biotic, molecular, and phylogenetic characterization suggest that SPLCV-KR is a new strain of SPLCV and is importantly placed in the evolutionary progression from curtoviruses to begomoviruses.sweet potato leaf curl virus; sweet potato leaf curl disease; phylogenetic analysis; infectious clone; biolistic infection.",

Due to segmented nature of dsRNA genome and wide host range, vast genetic and antigenic diversity exists amongst different isolates of rotaviruses. A total of 230 fecal ovine and caprine samples collected from organized farms and villages in Haryana were screened for rotavirus detection. Samples were screened by latex agglutination test and RNA-PAGE followed by RT-PCR and nucleic acid sequencing. The latex agglutination test showed 25 newborn lamb and 4 kid fecal samples positive for rotavirus. However, RNA-PAGE showed only 9 lamb fecal samples positive for rotavirus. All the samples were subjected to RT-PCR employing vp4 and vp7 gene specific primers of group A rotavirus of ovine, bovine and human origin. Only two samples from lamb (Sheep18/Hisar/2013 and Sheep22/Hisar/2013) showed vp4 and vp7 gene specific amplification with human group A rotavirus (GAR) specific primer. However, they did not show any amplification with ovine and bovine rotavirus specific primers. The nucleotide as well as deduced amino acid sequence analysis of vp4 gene of these isolates showed >98/97% and vp7 gene >95/94% nt/aa identity with human GAR from different regions of the world. Based on nucleotide similarity search, Sheep18/Hisar/2013 and Sheep22/Hisar/2013 isolates were genotyped as G1P[8] and G1P[4]. Phylogenetic analysis also confirmed that these isolates were clustered closely with human rotaviruses from different regions of the world. Earlier, higher prevalence of human rotaviruses was reported from the sample collecting area. The amplification of ovine samples with human rotavirus gene specific primers, sequence identity and phylogenetic analysis strongly suggests the zoonotic transmission of human GAR to sheep.",

    "abstract": "Influenza A viruses (IAVs) cause yearly repeating infections in humans.The current vaccination approach is based on the production of virus-neutralizing antibodies.Virus-neutralizing antibodies, however, are closely strain-specific due to the IAV variability.Therefore, antibodies produced during the previous influenza season do not provide sufficient protection against new infection, and, hence, annual revaccination is needed.The utilization of the influenza conserved stem domain of hemagglutinin (HA), the HA2 gp, led to a new vaccine design based on cross-reactive cellular and especially humoral immune responses represented by HA2-specific antibodies.The HA2-specific antibodies exhibit cross-reactivity with HA2 gp within one subtype or even among subtypes and play a role in protective immunity against influenza infection.There are several elimination mechanisms of viral replication mediated by HA2-specific antibodies.After recognition of the epitope, they prevent the conformational rearrangement of HA or the insertion of the fusion protein into the endosomal membrane and, consequently, the fusion pore formation.In this case, no release of viral genetic information into the target cell is enabled and virus cannot replicate.The HA2-specific antibodies are involved in the elimination of pathogen via the Fc fragment by activation of the cytotoxic mechanisms of innate immunity as are the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP), or complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), resulting in virus elimination and earlier recovery of the host from the infection.Though the protective effect of HA2-specific antibodies on the course of IAV infection was shown, few cases of worsening of IAV infection mediated by HA2-specific antibodies have been described.The identification of antigenic epitopes on HA2 gp that induce antibodies with such deteriorating effect on influenza infection can help to eliminate the unsuitable epitopes of HA2 gp as immunogens during the design of heteroprotective vaccine against influenza and can remove the side effects linked with the observations mentioned above.",

They activate the same intracellular signalling pathways and have similar biological activities as IFN-α/β, including antiviral activity, but signal via distinct receptor complex, which is expressed in a cell- and species-specific manner. IFN-λ was reported to induce in vitro marked antiviral activity against various RNA viruses, but corresponding data on DNA viruses are sparse. Therefore we examined the IFN-λ1 induced antiviral activity against two strains of herpes simplex virus 1, a highly pathogenic ANGpath and moderately pathogenic KOS. The antiviral response was determined in vitro in Vero cells, known as deficient in production of type I IFNs and in Vero E6 cells, responding to viral infection with abundant IFN-λ production, although deficient in production of type I IFNs. The results showed that IFN-λ1 induced in Vero cells higher antiviral activity against ANGpath strain than against KOS strain. In Vero E6 cells endogenous IFN-λ induced higher antiviral activity against ANGpath strain than against KOS strain, but because of the virus induction of IFN-λ expression the antiviral activity was detected later. The observed differences between the IFN-λ1-induced antiviral activities against viral strains of various pathogenicity suggest that virus attributes may play role in the antiviral state of cells induced by IFN-λ.",

A total of 350 asymptomatic and symptomatic fig samples were collected and tested by dot-immunobinding assay (DIBA) for the fig mosaic disease (FMD) using a polyclonal antiserum. According to DIBA results, FMD was present in 73% of the collected symptomatic samples from all visited regions. Samples with positive reactions in DIBA were then analyzed by RT-PCR using with specific primers. PCR results showed that about 14.8% of the FMD-positive samples from three inspected provinces are infected with at least one virus. FMV was the most widely spread virus (14%) followed by FLMaV-2 (1.5%), whereas FMMaV was not found. Phylogenetic analysis of the glycoprotein nucleotide and amino acid sequences of known FMV isolates showed two independent groups with high bootstrap values, with all Iranian isolates distinctly clustered in group I, subgroup IA beside those reported in Turkey. Nucleotide diversity was high within but low between different selected geographic regions and except for Europe, nucleotide distance within geographic regions was low. Statistical analyses indicated a correlation between the genetic structure of the FMV isolates and the geographical origin of isolation.

Furthermore, the indirect immunofluorescence assay confirmed that there were a few N protein-positive cells in the high-dose infected cells in Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3, while there were no N protein-positive cells in the low-dose infected cells in all rIFN-β treatment groups.In addition, the numbers of N protein-positive cells in high-dose infected cells (MOI = 10) in Group 1 were lower than that in Group 2 and Group 3. The results above demonstrated that both pre-treatment with rIFN-β and an earlier post-treatment with rIFN-β could inhibit the PRRSV replication and could clear the low-dose infected PRRSV, which indicated that the rIFN-β had efficient antiviral activities when the cells have been infected with PRRSV.",

The C-terminal effector domain suppresses the host response and is associated with the pathogenicity of the virus. To better understand the regulatory role of the C-terminal domain, we used reverse genetics system to generate NS1-truncated virus (NS80) and compared the cytokine profiles in the lungs of mice infected with the NS80 mutant and with the control virus A/WSN/33 (WSN). The NS80 virus was attenuated and the viral titer in the lungs was about 25 times lower than viral titer of control A/WSN/33. Mice infected with NS80 virus exhibited more severe clinical symptoms and 2 mice died 6 days post infection. NS80 virus activated retinoic-inducible gene (RIG)-1-like receptor signaling pathway more strongly than control WSN virus and mice infected with NS80 virus exhibited a greater abundance and more diverse cytokine profile. Infection with NS80 virus induced the expression of the following factors: pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1α, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-16), interferons (IFN-α and IFN-ε), chemokines (CCL2, CCL11, CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL10, CXCL11 and CXCL13), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9), metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 (TIMP-1), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1). All these cytokines are associated with viral pathogenicity. Our data show that attenuation of the virus should not be directly linked with pathogenicity.

The current treatment of chronically infected patients is long-term, expensive and relies on treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogs in combination with immune therapies, that frequently lead to adverse side effects.Recently, the National Institute of Health proposed strategic plan for Trans-NIH research to cure hepatitis B. The key priority is better understanding of HBV life cycle and its interactions with host cell.Due to the fact that HBV is a small double stranded DNA virus encoding only a limited number of proteins, HBV replication widely relies on host cell pathways and proteins.As demonstrated by numerous reports, HBV core protein (HBc) which is the main component of viral nucleocapsid, plays multiple roles in HBV life cycle and is engaged in many protein interaction networks of the host cell.Several recent studies have shown that HBV proteins can be modified by different types of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) that affect their protein-protein interactions, subcellular localization and function.In this review, we discuss diverse PTMs of HBc and their role in regulation of HBc function in the context of HBV replication and pathogenesis.",

In this study, we found that the decreased levels of main intracellular non-enzymatic antioxidant glutathione (GSH) during BoHV-1 infection also contributed to ROS production. Exogenous GSH administration dramatically inhibited BoHV-1 replication, indicating the critical role of decreased GSH for BoHV-1 replication. Interestingly, GSH synergistically enhanced the antiviral effects of acyclovir (ACV) against BoHV-1 infection in vitro. This study not only illuminates the effect of GSH on BoHV-1 infection but also provides evidence that pharmacological modulation of GSH-mediated ROS production in combination with specific antiviral drugs is a viable therapeutic approach to fighting virus infection.",

    "abstract": "Parvoviruses affect both vertebrates and invertebrates, and can be both detrimental and benign to the host. Numerous studies about parvovirus-induced apoptotic cell death have been researched and reported. In most parvovirus infections, cell death heightens the virus dissemination and causes tissue damage, often leading to disease. Cell cycle arrest also induces cytopathic effects in infected cells and is sometimes a prerequisite to apoptotic cell death. Cell death mechanisms caused by parvovirus infections vary depending on the infecting parvovirus strain and the cell lines involved. Apo-ptosis, however, is a frequent form of cell death induced by parvoviruses. The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a major contributor to parvovirus infection-induced cell death. However, other proteins such as the 11 kDa, NP1 and viral genome replication can also induce cell death. Understanding the mechanisms involved in parvovirus cell death, and host response is important in the development of treatment for cytopathic parvoviruses. This review article discusses parvovirus-induced apoptotic cell death and the mechanisms involved. Keywords: apoptosis; cell cycle arrest; cell death; parvovirus; viral protein.",

The MjVA and MjVB genomes encode proteins showing amino acid sequence similarities to those of poleroviruses (the genus Polerovirus, the family Solemoviridae) and amalgaviruses (the genus Amalgavirus, the family Amalgaviridae), respectively. The MjVA genome contains seven highly overlapping open reading frames, which are translated to seven proteins through various translational mechanisms, including -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) at the slippery motif GGGAAAC, non-AUG translational initiation, and stop codon readthrough. The MjVB genome encodes two proteins; one of which is translated by +1 PRF mechanism at the slippery motif UUUCGN. The abundance analysis of virus-derived RNA fragments revealed that MjVA is highly concentrated in plant parts with well-developed phloem tissues as previously demonstrated in other poleroviruses, which are transmitted by phloem feeders, such as aphids. MjVB, an amalgavirus generally transmitted by seeds, is distributed in all samples at low concentrations. Thus, this study demonstrates the effectiveness and usefulness of RNA-seq analysis of plant samples for the identification of novel RNA viruses and analysis of their tissue distribution.

In this study we showed that BBR exhibits a strong antiviral activity with broad spectrum of inhibition against different strains of Zika virus (ZIKV) and the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) in Vero cells. The inhibitory effect of BBR on ZIKV and DENV-2 growth was also demonstrated in human cell lines. The analysis of BBR mode of action showed that the compound did not affect early events of viral multiplication cycle or viral protein expression. By contrast, BBR strongly impaired the formation of intracellular and extracellular infectious viral particles. Furthermore, BBR was able to inhibit ZIKV induced activation of ERK1/2 and p38 cell signaling pathways and also reduced p38 phosphorylation in uninfected cells. Like BBR, the p38 inhibitor SB202190 reduced p38 phosphorylation in both uninfected and ZIKV infected cultures and caused a significant diminishment of viral yields even when it was added late during the infection. These results suggest for the first time that the inhibitory effect of BBR on p38 signaling might contribute to the antiviral action of the compound against flaviviruses.",

    "abstract": "Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV, Flaviviridae ), a small enveloped flavivirus with an unsegmented positive-stranded RNA genome, is the most prominent member of the mammalian group of tick-borne flaviviruses. TBEV, originally isolated in 1937, is identified as Orthoflavivirus encephalitidis now. TBEV causes the most important arboviral disease of the human central nervous system (CNS) in Europe and Northeast Asia. It is transmitted to hosts primarily by ticks of the genus Ixodes and Dermacentor , but can also be acquired by ingestion of infected unpasteurized dairy products. Approximately one-third of all human TBEV infections are associated with severe clinical neurological disease. The remaining two-thirds are asymptomatic or present with mild clinical symptoms. In hosts, TBEV tend to induce different types of immune effector mechanisms. Components of innate immunity - natural killer cells, complement proteins, macrophages and dendritic cells usually provide rapid and intense protection in the acute phase of infectious diseases. In turn, cell-mediated immunity provided by T and B lymphocytes plays an important role in virus clearance and protective immunity, and thus influences the outcome of disease. The virus-host relationship is not passive. Therefore, viruses themselves respond actively to host immune defence activities. This is made possible by a number of mechanisms that ensure their escape from the host’s immune surveillance. The aim of this review is to summarize the history of the last 50 years as well as advances in research on the immunology of TBEV, specifically in the Central European area.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus, is causative of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The viral entry process is facilitated by the highly antigenic spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, which binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. However, research involving live SARS-CoV-2 is limited to biosafety level (BSL)-3 facilities, hindering the progress in vaccine and therapeutic development. Pseudotyped viruses have emerged as valuable tools for studying entry inhibitors, fusion inhibitors, and neutralizing assays in BSL-2 facilities. Several modifications to the spike protein have been identified to enhance the yield of pseudotyped viruses. Notably, the removal of the last 19 amino acids from the spike protein and the D614G modification have been shown to increase pseudovirus titers. In this study, we aimed to identify an effective expression vector for pseudotyping by inserting SARS-CoV-2 S Δ19 into the intron-containing pcDNA3.1 vector. The inclusion of the β-globin intron sequence led to a significant augmentation in spike protein expression and a threefold improvement in pseudotyped virus production. Furthermore, we examined whether the woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE) could enhance spike protein expression by subcloning the spike protein gene into a lentiviral vector containing WPRE. Our results demonstrated that vectors containing the WPRE exhibited increased spike protein expression compared to vectors lacking the WPRE in HEK293-hACE2 cells. This study demonstrates that the inclusion of a β-globin intron and WPRE enhances the production of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped lentiviruses, a valuable tool for COVID-19 research.",

    "abstract": "Due to the successful eradication of smallpox worldwide and the cessation of smallpox vaccination campaign in 1980, the human population seems to be more susceptible to poxvirus infection. In the last years, an increased detection of zoonotic orthopoxviruses (OPXVs) has also been observed. In particular, in the past 50 years, a high incidence of monkeypox virus (MPXV) disease (MPOX) in both Central and Western Africa was reported. MPXV is not as lethal as variola virus (VARV), the etiological agent of smallpox, but it represents a threat to public health. The global events of MPOX in May 2022, and the ongoing outbreaks in Central and Western Africa in August 2024, have prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare MPXV a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Preventive vaccination remains the most effective control against MPXV. Smallpox vaccines of the second and third generations have been suggested for high-risk groups, in spite of several limitations, such as some adverse events, reduced immunogenicity, and manufacturing issues. The emerging threat of MPXV highlights the urgent need for the development of vaccines that can effectively control MPOX and potentially prevent diseases caused by other related OPXVs. Our study aims at introducing basic information on the biology of poxviruses, and on factors that may contribute to the reemergence of zoonotic poxviruses. It also summarizes the evolution of vaccinia-based vaccines and strategies that may control and prevent future outbreaks.",

The full-length nucleoprotein (N) gene sequence of a rabies virus isolate from India is reported for the first time and the same has been compared with available N gene sequences from the database. A central domain of 230 amino acids (aa) from aa 141 to aa 370 exhibited more than 95% similarity. There were 8 amino acid positions (aa 29, 32, 38, 84, 119, 379, 438, and 439) at which substitution was unique for Indian isolates but common for laboratory strains. In antigenic epitopes, except for a single amino acid difference at the antigenic site IV, the amino acids were conserved. The Indian isolate also possessed two Bam HI sites (aa 247 and 278), while the other Asian isolates had only one site at aa 278 or were not digested with Bam HI at all. Phylogenetic analysis also demonstrated that the Indian isolate was closely related to the Sri Lankan isolate and grouped in the cluster that comprised of the isolates from other Asian countries namely China and Pakistan.",

In such a situation, complete characterization of the vaccine strains is imperative. With regard to the frequent outbreaks of this disease, FMDV field strains are also of interest. Therefore three vaccine strains and two field strains of type A FMDV from India were completely sequenced and the obtained sequences were subjected to sequence and phylogenetic analyses. Based on the complete coding region, all the Indian strains clustered in the Asia topotype and exhibited a more than 11% nt divergence from the other Asian strains. The 5'-UTR of some Indian strains revealed block deletions of 43 and 86 nt corresponding to the pseudoknot region. Amino acids S44 in VP2 and F164 in VP1 were found to be the exclusive signatures for the Asia topotype. The vaccine strains differed at 65 aa positions in the capsid region, 13 of them antigenically critical. Variability at such positions is likely to affect the antigenic profile of these strains. Complete genome sequences of the vaccine strains presented here could serve as the reference for any comparative genomics in future.",

Results of this analysis indicate that the human pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus is a new re-assorted virus, which combines genetic materials from the avian flu (H1N1) virus, classical swine flu (H1N1) virus, human flu (H3N2) virus, and Eurasian swine flu (H1N1) virus. Analysis of the sequences for receptor-binding and cleavage sites of hemagglutinin (HA), stalk region of neuraminidase (NA), non-structural protein 1 (NS1), polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2), and polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1) suggested that (i) the human pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus is a low virulent and low pathogenic virus, (ii) its replication is restricted to the cells of upper respiratory tract, so it does not lead to a systemic infection, (iii) it spreads among humans only, (iv) its replication could be inhibited by oseltamivir, zanamivir, interferon (IFN), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha).

    "abstract": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) non-structural protein 2 (nsP2) is considered to be the master regulator of viral RNA replication and host responses generated during viral infection. This protein has two main functional domains: an N-terminal domain which exhibits NTPase, RNA triphosphatase and helicase activities and a C-terminal protease domain. Understanding how CHIKV nsP2 interacts with its host proteins is essential for elucidating all the required processes for viral replication and pathogenesis along with the identification of potential targets for antiviral therapy. In current study yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening of a human fetal brain cDNA library was performed using nsP2 protein as bait. The analysis identified seven host proteins (CCDC130, CPNE6, POLR2C, MAPK9, EIF4A2, EEF1A1 and EIF3I) as putative interactors of CHIKV nsP2 which were selected for further analysis based on their roles in host cellular machinery. The gene ontology analysis indicates that these proteins are mainly involved in apoptosis, transcription and translational mechanism of host cell. Domain mapping of nsP2 revealed that these associations are not random connections but instead they have functional significance. Further studies to identify the amino acid residues and their chemical interactions that may help in opening new possibilities for preventing these interactions, thus reducing chances of chikungunya infection were performed. This study expands the understanding of CHIKV-host interactions and is important for rational approaches of discovering new antiviral agents.",

These BOFDIs show morphopathological similarities with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis and old dog encephalitis (ODE) in measles virus-infected patients and in canine distemper virus-infected dogs, respectively. The brain tissue from 3 BOFDI-affected striped dolphins was investigated by means of double labelling-indirect immunofluorescence (DL-IIF) and ultrastructurally, in order to characterize the DMV-targeted neuronal and non-neuronal cell populations, along with the associated submicroscopic findings. Viral colonization of calbindin-immunoreactive (IR) and nitric oxide synthase-IR neurons was detected in the cerebral parenchyma from the 3 DMV-infected dolphins under study, associated with nuclear (chromatin) and cytoplasmic (mitochondrial) ultrastructural changes. Furthermore, a limited viral targeting of brain astrocytes was found in these animals, all of which exhibited a prominent astrogliosis/astrocytosis. To the best of our knowledge, those herein reported should be the first submicroscopic pathology and neuropathogenetic data about BOFDI in striped dolphins. In this respect, the marked astrogliosis/astrocytosis and the low viral colonization of brain astrocytes in the 3 DMV-infected dolphins under investigation are of interest from the comparative pathology and viral neuropathogenesis standpoints, when compared with ODE-affected dogs, in whose brain a non-cytolytic, astrocyte-to-astrocyte infectious spread has been recently documented. Further studies aimed at characterizing the complex DMV-host interactions in BOFDI-affected striped dolphins are needed.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major cause of acute lower respiratory tract infection in infants. Winter outbreaks in Chile result in 5% of infected children hospitalized, with 0.01% mortality. Increased evidence indicates that viral and host factors modulate the severity of infection. Using DNA microarrays, we characterized the genome-wide transcriptional response of lung mucoepidermoid cells (NCI-H292) at 0, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post-infection (hpi) with a single dose of RSV/A. During the whole studied period, a bi-phasic gene expression profile was observed by a total of 330 differentially expressed genes. About 60% of them were up-regulated between 24-72 hpi and then turned-off at 96 hpi. This transient, early gene expression pattern was significantly enriched in biological processes like interferon signaling, antigen processing and presentation, double-stranded RNA binding and chemokine activity. We detected 27 common genes up-regulated between 24-72 hpi, from which IFIT1, IFI44, MX1, CXCL11 and OAS1 had the highest expression. The second pattern comprised over 120 genes, which remained silenced until 72 hpi, but were steeply up-regulated by 96 hpi. Biological processes of this late-response profile included cell cycle division and microtubule cytoskeleton organization. Conversely, the genes belonging to virus response pathway showed a decreased expression at 96 hpi. We conclude that RSV induces an early innate immune activation profile response until 72 hpi. Thereafter, the viral response is inhibited, leading to host cell recovery. The presented cellular model allows to study the specific pathways involved in elimination of infection at prolonged time intervals and their subsequent analysis in severe RSV disease of infants and/or older adults.",

    "abstract": "Group A rotaviruses (RVA) are considered as important causative agents of diarrhea in both human and animal species. Fecal specimens (n = 300) were collected from both diarrheic and healthy animals during the year 2009 from animal farms from Nagpur (Maharashtra), Western India. RVA antigen was detected by ELISA in 3.1-25% and 72% in bovine and porcine species, respectively. Genotyping based on VP6, VP7 and VP4 of RVA-positive samples showed predominance of genotype I-1 (63%) and genotype I-2 (37%), G4 (45.5%) and G10 (27.3%) genotypes, P[6] (72.7%) and P[8] (18.1%) genotypes, respectively. Other RV genotypes such as G1(4.5%), G2(9.1%), G3(4.5%) and mixed infections (9.1%) were detected at low level. Predominance of unusual G-P combinations (9/23, 39.1%) were observed. Circulation of G2P[8] and mixed infections with G1, G3, P[6] and G1, P[8], P[6]) are reported in porcine species for the first time in Western India. In conclusion the present study highlights the circulation of unusual G-P combinations and VP6 genogroup specificities of human RVA strains indicative of possible interspecies transmission and reassortment events in animal species. The study further warrants utmost need for such surveillance studies across the country to understand the role of animals as genetic reservoirs for the emergence of RVA strains pathogenic for humans.

    "abstract": "Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is one of the viruses that cause hand, foot and mouth disease. Its viral capsid protein 1 (VP1), which contains many neutralization epitopes, is an ideal target for vaccine development. Recently, we reported the induction of a strong immune response in rabbits to a truncated VP1 fragment (Nt-VP1t) displayed on a recombinant Newcastle disease virus (NDV) capsid protein. Protective efficacy of this vaccine, however, can only be tested in mice, since all EV71 animal models thus far were developed in mouse systems. In this study, we evaluated the type of immune responses against the protein developed by adult BALB/c mice. Nt-VP1t protein induced high levels of VP1 IgG antibody production in mice. Purified VP1 antigen stimulated activation, proliferation and differentiation of splenocytes harvested from these mice. They also produced significant levels of IFN-γ, a Th1-related cytokine. Taken together, Nt-VP1t protein is a potent immunogen in adult mice and our findings provide the data needed for testing of its protective efficacy in mouse models of EV71 infections.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of monocyte response to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) occurs via activation of receptors that elicit innate antiviral effects and later T-cell responses. Our previous data (Yew et al.., 2010) demonstrated that human monocyte scavenger receptor A type 1 (SR-A1) are required for sensing of HCMV by endosomal toll-like receptors (TLRs)-3 and -9, which in turn induce critical pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, it remains unclear which subcellular molecules associated with SR-A1 lead to downstream activation of TLR-3 and/or TLR-9 signaling pathways. Herein we report that Lyn kinase, associated physically and functionally with SR-A for low density lipoprotein (LDL) recognition, acts as a key SR-A1-induced kinase that plays a critical role in TLR-3/9 signal transduction upon HCMV exposure to THP-1 monocytes. We found that disruption of the SR-A1 signal transduction through molecular inhibition by Lyn kinase oligonucleotides not only blocks the activation of downstream TLR-9 pathway but also alters the downstream TLR-3 pathway. In particular, Lyn kinase oligonucleotides resulted in decreased expression of TLR-9-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) but strongly upregulated canonical TLR-3-induced interferon beta (IFN-β) and non-canonical TLR-3-induced NF-κB-dependent p35 (35kDa) subunit of interleukin 12 (IL-12p35) gene transcription. Thus, the observed shift away from TNF-α to robust IFN-β and IL-12p35 induction may offer opportunities for therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Cassava mosaic disease (CMV), caused by one or a combination of cassava mosaic geminiviruses, is ranked among the most important constraints to profitable and efficient production of cassava. Effective control measures require in-depth knowledge of the viral causative agent. Using rolling-circle amplification and unique enzymes, the full genome of two species of cassava mosaic geminivirus isolated from infected cassava plants in Ghana were cloned into pCambia 1300 and pET-28b. The sequences of the genome were determined on an ABI sequencer and a pairwise comparison was performed with other cassava-infecting geminiviruses from different countries. It was revealed that cassava grown in Ghana is attacked by two species of geminivirus in either single or mixed infections. These are the African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV) and the East African cassava mosaic virus (EACMV)-like, with high sequence similarity of 94% and 80%, respectively, between the DNA-A and DNA-B components of each virus, and 66% and 41% similarity of the common region (CR) (for A and B accordingly). The DNA-A of ACMV and EACMV-like contained 2781 and 2800 nucleotides, respectively, while their DNA-B components had 2725 and 2734 nucleotides, respectively. ACMV DNA-A was over 97% similar to those of other ACMVs from the continent. In contrast, EACMV-like DNA-A was over 98% similar to the isolates from Cameroon and other West African countries, and less than 88% similar to other EACMV species. Thus ACMV and EACMV-like were named African cassava mosaic virus-Ghana and East African cassava mosaic Cameroon virus-Ghana. Computer analysis revealed that their genome arrangement follows the typical old world bipartite begomovirus genome. The association of these two species and their interaction might account for the severe symptoms observed on infected plants in the field and in the greenhouse.",

    "abstract": "Clinical importance of myocarditis, predominantly caused by coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), is recently rising. However, a detailed mechanism of pathogenesis of CVB3 myocarditis still needs to be clarified. Recently, it has been reported that histone modifications including acetylation are involved in coxsackievirus replication. To examine whether the CVB3 replication requires histone acetylation, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors were employed. We found that the HDAC2 activity increased in virus-infected cells at 12 hrs p.i. and that HDAC inhibitors suppressed the virus replication in vitro. This suggests that the HDAC2 activity may be required for the virus replication. Eventually, a HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A protected against CVB3-induced myocardial injury in vivo. Our results suggest that HDAC may be a novel therapeutic target for treating viral myocarditis.coxsackievirus B3; histone acetyltransferase; histone deacetylase; HDAC inhibitors, trichostatin A; apicidin; valproic acid; shRNA; myocarditis; mouse.",

    "abstract": "A growing body of evidence suggests that host genetic factors play an important role both in susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection and in progression to AIDS. Interleukin 18 (IL-18) is a pleiotropic proinflammatory cytokine that serves as an important regulator of immune responses. It plays a key role in induction of both Th1 and Th2 cytokines and, thereby, modulates their immune responses. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the IL-18 gene promoter region may lead to an altered transcriptional activity and IL-18 production, and so this may account for individuals' variation to the risk of HIV-1 infection. With this perspective, the -137G/C polymorphism in the promoter region of the IL-18 gene was studied in 500 patients with HIV-1/AIDS and an equal number of sex and age matched healthy controls using sequence specific polymerase chain reaction analysis. We did not observe any significant association of the heterozygous G/C genotype with the risk of HIV-1-infection/AIDS. However, statistically signiﬁcant associations of the G allele and homozygous G/G genotype of -137 G/C polymorphism of IL-18 promoter with increased risk of HIV-1/AIDS were identiﬁed. The data of the present study suggest that IL-18 -137 G allele and G/G genotype seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection among North Indians.",

Far-western and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) assay showed that VP90 interacts with VP26 and VP28, two major envelope proteins. Far-western blot with recombinant VP26 (rVP26), N-terminal end of VP28 (rVP28N) and C-terminal end of VP28 (rVP28C) provided further evidence for interaction of rVP90 and rVP26 or rVP28.

To further understand the genetic characteristics and evolution, we investigated the source and molecular characteristics of the H9N2 subtype swine influenza virus (SIV), and observed its pathogenicity in BALB/c mice. The BALB/c mice were inoculated intranasally with 100 median mouse infectious dose of A/swine/HeBei/012/2008/(H9N2) viruses to observe the pathogenicity. The HA, NP, NA and M gene were cloned, sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed with related sequences available in GenBank. The infected mice presented with inactivity, weight loss and laboured respiration, while the pathological changes were characterized by diffuse alveolar damage in the lung. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of HA, NP, NA and M gene was similar with that of A/chicken/Hebei/4/2008(H9N2). The HA protein contained 6 glycosylation sites and the motif of HA cleavage site was PARSSR GLF, which is characteristic of low pathogenic IV.

Four synthetic siRNAs were designed to target structural envelope region genes (Erns, E1, and E2) and one cocktail of siRNA was generated to target the 5ʹ-UTR of the BVDV-1 genome. The inhibitory effects of siRNAs were assessed by determination of infectious viral titer, viral antigen and viral RNA. The siRNA cocktail and three of the synthetic siRNAs produced moderate anti-BVDV-1 effect in vitro as shown by 25%-40% reduction in BVDV-1 antigen production, 7.9-19.9-fold reduction in viral titer and 21-48-fold reduction in BVDV-1 RNA copy number. Our findings suggest that siRNA cocktail targeted at the 5ʹ-UTR is a stronger inhibitor of BVDV-1 replication and the targets for siRNA inhibition can be extended to BVDV-1 structural envelope protein genes.",

    "abstract": "Apoptosis, an intrinsic cellular pathway that eliminates unwanted cells from multicellular organisms, represents an important mechanism for protection against viral infections.When cells infected by viruses get recognized by immune cells, apoptosis is triggered in the infected cells.Among the many regulators of apoptosis involved in this process, a family of proteins homologous to oncogene Bcl-2 plays a central role.Their concerted activities converge to permeabilization of mitochondrial membranes and activation of apoptotic pathways in the presence of diverse apoptotic signals, including virus infection.In the genomes of many viruses, genes encoding for homologues of antiapoptotic proteins of Bcl-2 family can be found.These proteins, collectively referred to as vBcl-2 proteins, inhibit apoptosis in infected cells at the different stages of virus life cycle to enable the virus to complete its replication and to spread.",

Among various therapeutic control measures, RNA interference (RNAi) is one of the methods being explored to inhibit FMD virus replication and spread. The RNAi is achieved by short hairpin RNAs or artificial microRNAs (amiRNAs). Utility of amiRNAs as antiviral, targeting conserved regions of the viral genome is gaining importance. However, delivery of miRNA in vivo is still a challenge. In this study, the efficacy of amiRNAs in preventing FMD virus replication in a permissive cell culture system was investigated, by generating stable cell lines expressing amiRNAs targeting three functional regions of the FMD virus (FMDV) genome (IRES, 3B3 and 3D). The results showed that amiRNA targeting 3D polymerase is relatively more efficient. However, expression of multiple microRNAs targeting the three regions did not exhibit additive effect. The data suggest that 3D specific miRNA is a potential valid strategy in developing novel antiviral measures against FMDV infection.

The three genome contigs of ZoVT showed 88.2‒97.2% nucleotide sequence identity to each other, indicating that they descended from a common ancestor.

The phylogenetic analysis using REP sequences of ZoVT and other Betaflexiviridae viruses showed that Prunus virus T is the closest known virus to ZoVT, whereas potato virus T, the type species of the genus Tepovirus, is the second closest virus. Genome sequences of ZoVT, which is the third tepovirus species identified to date, may be useful for investigating the evolution and molecular biology of tepoviruses.

PAFV1 was predicted to have three open reading frames (ORFs): ORF1, encoding a replicase (REP) with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity; ORF2, a movement protein (MP); and ORF3, a hypothetical protein. The PAFV1 REP sequence showed high similarity to those of three known members of the family Gammaflexiviridae i.e., Entoleuca gammaflexivirus 1 (EnFV1), Entoleuca gammaflexivirus 2 (EnFV2), and Botrytis virus F (BVF). A genome contig of the fungus Monosporascus cannonballus also contained a sequence of an endogenous virus similar to that of PAFV1. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis indicated that PAFV1, EnFV1, and the endogenous virus of M. cannonballus formed a distinct subgroup (apart from EnFV2 and BVF), and may be the founding members of a novel genus in the family Gammaflexiviridae. Notably, MP sequences of PAFV1/EnFV1 showed similarity to the MP sequences of the mycovirus group called tobamo-like mycoviruses (an unassigned taxon), implying that genomic recombination occurred between members of the family Gammaflexiviridae and tobamo-like mycoviruses. Since PAFV1 is phylogenetically related to mycoviruses, PAFV1 may also be a mycovirus that infected a fungus associated with the mastic tree sample, which is evidenced by the presence of fungal ribosomal RNA sequences in the mastic tree transcriptome. Thus, the PAFV1 genome sequence may be useful in elucidating the genome evolution of Gammaflexiviridae and tobamo-like mycoviruses.

In this study, the complete genome sequence of FCV 14Q315, which was detected from a dead domestic cat with a hemorrhagic-like disease, was analyzed to identify the genetic characteristics. The FCV 14Q315 genome was 7,684 bp. Phylogenetic analyses based on the ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3 sequences indicated that FCV 14Q315 is more closely related to FCV 15D022 than to other FCV strains. ORF1 of FCV 14Q315 shared high sequence similarity with ORF1 of FCVs 15D022 and UTCVM-H1. We further evaluated genetic recombination in ORF1 of FCV 14Q315 and detected intergenic recombination between p30 and the ORF1/ORF2 junction with high significance. Particularly, the non-recombination region in ORF1 of FCV 14Q315 showed high sequence similarity with FCVs GX2019, CH-JL2, and 15D022. The recombination region in ORF1 of FCV 14Q315 showed the highest similarity with FCV UTCVM-H1, which is associated with a hemorrhagic-like disease. The results suggest that the UTCVM-H1-like FCV was introduced into the Republic of Korea and presumably recombined with Korean FCVs by occasional mixed infections. In addition, the Korean FCV strains were located in several phylogenetic clusters with marked genetic diversity in the ORF2 region. These results imply that Korean FCVs possess high genetic diversity owing to mutations and recombination. Furthermore, it is possible that certain FCVs caused cyclical infections in the Korean cat population based on a phylogenetic analysis of FCVs isolated at different time points.

Two novel potyvirid viruses, Striga-associated poty-like virus 1 (SaPlV1) and Striga-associated poty-like virus 2 (SaPlV2), were identified from the transcriptome data of purple witchweed (Striga hermonthica). SaPlV1 was most closely related to bellflower veinal mottle virus (BVMoV), the only member of the genus Bevemovirus, and then to macluraviruses (the genus Macluravirus). The SaPlV1 genome encodes a 2462-amino acid (aa) polyprotein that may be cleaved into nine mature peptides. The cleavage sites of SaPlV1, BVMoV, and macluravirus polyproteins shared strong sequence similarities. SaPlV2 was most closely related to celery latent virus, the sole species of the genus Celavirus, which is the most divergent potyvirid genus. The SaPlV2 polyprotein contained 3329 aa and it may be cleaved into at least seven or eight mature peptides.

A strain of calicivirus was discovered in this study in the feces of cormorants collected at Xiamen Horticulture Expo Garden in 2021 and was named Cormcali01. The genome of Cormcali01 was 8,561 bp in length which contained characteristic motifs present in other caliciviruses. Furthermore, it demonstrated a significant deviation from all existing calicivirus nucleotide sequences, exhibiting the highest amino acid identity (47.34%) to the unclassified Ruddy turnstone calicivirus A. A pairwise comparison of the VP1 protein showed that Cormcali01 had the highest amino acid identity of 43.90% with the unassigned Ruddy turnstone calicivirus A. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that VP1 of Cormcali01 clustered with unassigned caliciviruses. Therefore, based on phylogenetic analysis and pairwise comparison, Cormcali01 should be affiliated with the unassigned calicivirus, which were suggested to comprise a new calicivirus genus, the Sanovirus genus. After investigating the prevalence of Cormcali01, we discovered that 22.22% of fecal samples (10/45) were tested positive. These findings expand our understanding of the genetic variation of caliciviruses and provide valuable epidemiological information regarding a potential outbreak of calicivirus disease in birds.",

    "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have gained prominence due to their involvement in various cellular processes, but their specific roles remain elusive. Dysregulation of lncRNAs has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases. In this study, we aimed to shed light on the role of lncRNAs in individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) by examining their changes in the expression patterns related to the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) during acute or chronic phases of infection, compared to healthy controls. We found 316 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs in patients receiving long-term ART, shedding light on their potential roles. We also observed interactions between these DE lncRNAs and specific microRNAs (miRNAs). Some of these miRNAs, such as hsa-miR-574-5p, hsa-miR-765, hsa-miR-6165, hsa-miR-1207-5p, and hsa-miR-378i, are associated with cancer progression or suppression, while others, including hsa-miR-328-5p, hsa-miR-4753-3p, and MiR-664, play roles in immune system regulation. Furthermore, our study revealed substantial enrichment in distinct Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, such as axon guidance, PI3K-Akt signaling, and MAPK signaling pathways. Although our results indicate possible molecular processes impacted by the discovered lncRNAs, we cannot explicitly establish causality or specific connections between lncRNAs and genes in these pathways, fostering more specific studies. Furthermore, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis highlighted terms such as cytoskeletal protein binding, ion channel function, synaptic processes, neuron projection, and the somatodendritic compartment, underscoring the relevance of lncRNAs in these cellular components within the context of HIV-1 infection and ART treatment. In conclusion, our study emphasizes the need for further exploration of lncRNAs as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in HIV-1-infected patients, with a particular focus on CD4 + T cells. Understanding the functions of lncRNAs in these contexts may pave the way for novel treatment strategies and improved patient outcomes, aligning with the broader goals of our research.",

The ability or inability of various TBE virus strains to cause viraemia in adult C. glareolus in titres higher than the threshold level of infectivity for tick vectors was considered as an ecological marker of TBE virus. This marker was designated Cg: Cg+ and Cg- for TBE virus strains inducing respectively higher and lower levels of viraemia than the threshold of infectivity.",

Although biologists, chemists, physicians, veterinarians, and even physicists attempted to elucidate the nature of viruses, the question still remains \"Are viruses alive?\" Different theories have aimed at unifying our views of virology to provide an answer. However, the discovery of a mimivirus, its genome organization and replication cycle, in addition to the recently found virophage challenged the established frontier between viruses and parasitic cellular organisms. Consequently, the old controversy whether viruses are inert agents at the threshold of life or a different form of life was reignited. This review reopens the debate about the living nature of viruses from the classical concepts to the recent discoveries in order to rationally discuss our beliefs about the living or non-living character of viruses.filterable agent; mimivirus; virophage.",

A high variability and broad host specificity of influenza A viruses are the main reasons of repeated influenza infections. Therefore, no effective prevention against influenza is available today. The main problem of insufficient protection efficacy is that virus-neutralizing antibodies induced by current vaccines are closely strain-specific and the vaccines need to be updated each year. Therefore, various novel approaches to vaccine preparation have been developed with the aim to widen the spectrum of their efficacy. These approaches comprise using new adjuvants as components of the inactivated vaccines, new techniques of live attenuated vaccine preparation (reverse genetics), and new vaccine design focused on the conserved antigens of influenza A viruses inducing protective immunity not only against the influenza viruses antigenically similar (homologous) to vaccine strains, but also against heterologous viruses, even of different subtypes. In this review examples of new approaches to the induction of intersubtype immunity against influenza and their utilization in vaccine preparation are described.",

Keratinocytes are the primary cells involved in clinical lesions caused by HSV-2. In our study, we intensively examined cytokine expression in the HSV-2-infected keratinocytes. We observed upregulation of a series of cytokines including early-induced antiviral cytokines as interferons α, β (IFN-α, β), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), colony stimulating factors (CSFs) as G-CSF, GM-CSF, interleukin 3 (IL-3), growth factors (EGF, KGF, and IGF-β1), defensins, selectins, leukocyte function-associated antigens (LFAs,) and toll-like receptors (TLR-2, 3, 4, and 9). More importantly, we found that HSV-2-infected keratinocytes stimulated the proliferation of lymphocytes in co-cultivation system. These data suggest that keratinocytes participate in the immune response to HSV-2 infection in two ways. They secrete inflammatory cytokines to resist the HSV-2 infection directly and recruit the immune cells to eliminate the primary infection indirectly and enhance the adaptive immunity to prevent subsequent infections.",

Infectious cDNA clones of plant RNA viruses are excellent tools for functional studies of viral genomes. Preparation and use of PPV-D and PPV-M infectious clones have been previously reported. Here we describe the construction of an infectious cDNA clone of the strain PPV-Rec (isolate BOR-3) by the strategy involving the subsequent exchanges of homologous BOR-3 genome parts in the backbone of the previously prepared PPV-D infectious construct. The infectivity of each intermediate chimeric cDNA as well as that of the final construct (pIC-PPV-Rec) was confirmed by biolistic transfection of Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Complete sequence of the cloned viral BOR-3 cDNA revealed 0.14% of difference at the nucleotide level compared to original BOR-3 sequence, resulting in four amino acid changes. This slight inequality was related to the population heterogeneity of the initial BOR-3 isolate; no difference in the amino acid sequence resulted from the cloning steps performed.inter-strain chimera; biolistics; genome sequence.",

    "abstract": "Velogenic Newcastle disease virus (NDV) causes encephalitis and severe neurological disorders in avian species. Sialic acid (SA) has been considered as a receptor for NDV infection and determining tissue tropism. The neurotropic mechanism of NDV in birds is completely unknown. Here we have investigated the role of viral receptor SA in neurotropism of NDV in chickens. We determined that α2,3- and α2,6-linked SA receptors were implicated in NDV encephalitis and viral binding to primary neuronal cells using immunohistofluorescence and virus-cell binding assay. Both SA receptors were found to co-localize with velogenic strain F48E9 in neuropathological lesions of chicken brains after infection through intraocular-nasal routes. The replication of velogenic F48E9 in primary neuronal cells was more efficient than that of lentogenic strain LaSota. The virus-neuronal cell binding capabilities of both the velogenic and the lentogenic strains have no difference. Furthermore, the cell-binding capability and the replication of both strains were significantly decreased by pretreatment with sialidases in neuronal cells. These results demonstrated that α2,3- and α2,6-linked SA receptors were important for the initiation of NDV infection in the chicken nervous system. This study should provide preliminary evidence for a better understanding of the neurotropism of NDV in chickens.",

    "abstract": "Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) can establish in its host a persistent infection, without any prominent symptoms. Even during this infection, when the infectious virions are not released, the virus still disseminates effectively. A very effective and fast way of infection of neighboring cells utilized by many viruses is cell-to-cell transmission. Viruses use different ways of cell-to-cell spread through the extracellular space or by intracellular means through different protrusions. We have found that LCMV strain MX may use three different types of cell-to-cell transport. Firstly, similar to vaccinia virus, it can use actin to propel the virus towards the neighboring cell. Secondly, virus can travel through the intracellular space inside the tunneling nanotubes, that connect the cells even at longer distances and thirdly, the virus may travel on the surface of the membrane of different protrusions connecting two cells. We have also proved that the cells infected by MX strain of LCMV migrate faster than the uninfected cells or cells infected with a different LCMV strain. In accordance with faster migration, the infected cells form more lamellipodia with high expression of keratin 1. In this work, we have introduced three types of cell-to-cell transmission utilized by strain MX of LCMV and showed that even if the cells are not in tight connection, the virus forces them to migrate faster to join the nearest cell. As we show in this work, the virus may use more than one strategy to move to another cell, while each strategy can substitute another. These ways of transmission are very fast and effective and may have a serious impact on the host. Moreover, targeting the cell-to-cell spread, by inhibiting for instance GTPase dynamin, could be an effective way of virus elimination.

    "abstract": "Ginseng (Panax ginseng) is a valuable herb that is widely cultivated in Korea, China, and Japan because it contains a variety of pharmacologically active substances with a wide range of positive effects on human health. Identification and prevention of disease-causing viral pathogens of ginseng is important for improving the yield and quality of ginseng-derived bioactive molecules. In this study, the genome sequence of the virus Panax ginseng flexivirus 1 (PgFV1) was identified from a ginseng root transcriptome data set. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis showed that PgFV1 is a novel plant RNA virus species of the genus Foveavirus (the family Betaflexiviridae). Foveaviruses have flexuous and filamentous virions with a single-stranded positive-sense mono-segmented RNA genome. Its infection causes diseases with mosaic and ringspot symptoms in the stems and leaves. The PgFV1 genome encodes for 5 open reading frames: a replicase polyprotein for viral genome replication, 3 triple gene block proteins for viral cell-to-cell movement, and coat protein. Phylogenetic trees inferred from replicase polyprotein or coat protein sequences showed that PgFV1 is most closely related to grapevine virus T. PgFV1 is the first foveavirus identified to be associated with ginseng. Given the potential pathogenic features of previously known foveaviruses and importance of ginseng in the health industry, the PgFV1 genome sequence may be highly useful for studying ginseng foveaviruses.

    "abstract": "Novel duck reovirus (NDRV), the prototype strain of avian orthoreoviruses, continues to circulate among ducks. Analysis of its genome suggested that a putative second open reading frame in the S1 segment encodes a 162-amino acid nonstructural protein with size of 18 kDa, provisionally designated P18. This protein is different from the 17 kDa nonstructural protein encoded in the same open reading frame in other avian orthoreoviruses, which is designated P17 and consists of 146 amino acids. There is no corresponding protein in Muscovy duck reovirus. Antibodies raised to the purified recombinant protein reacted with viral P18 both in vitro and in vivo. In cells, P18 was located predominantly in the nucleus at 6-12 h post-infection, with negligible levels in the cytoplasm. However, the protein accumulated both in the nucleus and cytoplasm at 24 to 36 h post-infection. Immunohistochemistry indicated that P18 strongly accumulates in spleen tissues of infected ducklings. Collectively, the data provide the direct experimental evidence that P18 is expressed by novel duck reovirus both in vivo and in vitro.

    "abstract": "African swine fever (ASF) is an acute and severe infectious disease that seriously endangers the global porcine industry. In order to develop ASF serodiagnostic reagents with high specificity and sensitivity, in the present study, the antigenic epitopes of P72 protein of African swine fever virus (ASFV) were analyzed, and the ASFV multi-epitope fusion gene MeP72 in tandem with the dominant linear epitopes was constructed. The recombinant multi-epitope fusion MeP72 (reMeP72) was prepared in Escherichia coli. A colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic assay (CGIA) based on reMeP72 was developed for the detection of antibodies against ASFV. A total of 139 pig clinical serum samples were used for assessment of the potential diagnostic value of reMeP72. The results showed that CGIA did not cross-react with positive sera of viruses, such as classical swine fever virus (CSFV), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), pseudorabies virus (PRV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and swine influenza virus (SIV), showing high specificity. Sensitivity analysis showed that CGIA could detect ASFV-positive serum at a dilution of 1:64. Compared with commercial ASFV kits, the sensitivity and specificity of ASFV CGIA based on reMeP72 protein were 85.7% and 97.6%, respectively. The agreement rate of the two methods was 96.4%, showing a good detection performance. The results indicated that the reMeP72 was of potential value for the serodiagnosis of ASF.

Results from the LAMP reactions were visualized both by color changes after adding SYBR Green I staining dye and by DNA laddering on agarose gel electrophoresis. The optimal conditions for the curtovirus LAMP reaction were confirmed at 60°C for the universal primers and at 62°C for the three species-specific primer sets. Amplification of curtoviruses by LAMP reaction was ten-fold more sensitive than that by polymerase chain reaction.

To overcome difficulties encountered therein, an alternative assay, serum neutralization test (SNT), using Baby Hamster Kidney 21 cell line, has been standardized. The antibody response generated against JE vaccine was quantified and the assay was found to be sensitive and specific enough with significant accuracy and precision. On analysis of cell count, a cell concentration of 1.5 x 104 was selected as the optimum, since concentrations above and below this resulted in problems of confluent monolayer formation and incomplete monolayer formation. Incubation time has also been standardized for measuring cytopathic effect (CPE). Out of the four different time points selected, 90 min was found to be adequate for 50% reduction in the amount of CPE. The accuracy of SNT assay is explained in terms of fiducial limits at 95% level. Inter- and intra-assay reproducibility testing was also performed. A comparison of potency of JE vaccine by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and SNT method was conducted and it was found that SNT can be a reliable approach for estimating the potency of JE vaccine.

    "abstract": "Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is a neglected human pathogen, which can cause severe illnesses in humans.Th e most vulnerable are the human foetus and immunosuppressed individuals.Since there is no commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the diagnosis of anti-LCMV antibodies in human sera, we developed a sandwich ELISA method detecting anti-nucleoprotein IgG antibodies, using a specifi c monoclonal anti-nucleoprotein antibody and cells persistently infected with LCMV strain MX as antigen.In the present study we show standardization of this ELISA protocol, determination of its clinical specifi city and sensitivity and its application on 30 clinical samples from multiorgan donors.Comparison of these results to the indirect immunofl uorescence antibody test (IFA) demonstrates that ELISA is more sensitive.Th e developed ELISA assay provides a fast, simple and effi cient tool for the clinical detection of anti-nucleoprotein antibodies in human sera.",

    "abstract": "Equid herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) is a major pathogen of horses with a worldwide distribution, which can cause various clinical signs ranging from mild respiratory disease to neurological disorders. To initiate an effective infection, EHV-1 evolved a broad spectrum of mechanisms exploiting the host cell, including its actin filaments. An actin-myosin-driven transport has been described to precede cellular entry of different viruses. Therefore, in the present study we investigated the role of actin motor protein - myosin, during replication of two EHV-1 strains: Jan-E (wild-type EHV-1 strain isolated from aborted equine fetus) and Rac-H (attenuated strain highly adapted in cell cultures in vitro) in primary murine neurons. In order to investigate this, we used two inhibitors: blebbistatin (BLB; non-muscle myosin II inhibitor) and 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM; inhibitor of myosin ATPase). Our results demonstrated that limitation of Jan-E EHV-1 replication occurred in cells treated with myosin inhibitor, which confirmed the important role of actin motor proteins during the entry and egress of EHV-1 virions. Application of blebbistatin did not affect Rac-H EHV-1 replication, while BDM caused reduction of replication in murine neurons. Based on these results it can be assumed that EHV-1 virion movement was myosin-dependent.",

The AcNRV1 genome contains six open reading frames encoding a nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein, movement protein P3, matrix protein, glycoprotein, and polymerase (L). Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis using L and N protein sequences revealed that AcNRV1 is a novel member of the genus Alphanucleorhabdovirus, one of the six plant-infecting rhabdovirus genera of the family Rhabdoviridae. Wheat yellow striate virus and rice yellow stunt virus were identified as the closest known rhabdoviruses of AcNRV1. The conserved regulatory sequences involved in transcription termination/polyadenylation (TTP) and transcription initiation (TI) of individual genes were identified in the AcNRV1 genome with the consensus sequence 3'-(A/U)UUAUUUUU-GGG-UUG-5' (in the negative-sense genome), whereby dashes separate the TTP, untranscribed intergenic spacer, and TI elements. The AcNRV1 genome sequence will contribute to further understanding the genome structural evolution of plant rhabdoviruses.

    "abstract": "Phaseolus vulgaris alphaendornavirus-1 (PvEV-1, family Endornaviridae ) was identified by ribodepleted total RNA high-throughput sequencing in the virome of two bean plants ( Phaseouls vulgaris L.) grown in a garden in western Slovakia. Two nearly complete PvEV-1 genomes (ca. 14.06 kb, named PV1 and PV2) were assembled, showing 99.9% nucleotide identity, while their nucleotide identity with the reference PvEV-1 genome (NC_039217) reached 98.4%. Two primer pairs spanning the viral helicase encoding region and sequence upstream of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase were designed and used to confirm the presence of the virus in the original bean samples by RT-PCR. A subsequent search for PvEV-1 presence in Slovakia was focused on two groups of samples: 1) bean plants grown under open field conditions and sampled during the vegetation period and 2) bean accessions grown from seeds obtained from a Slovak and French bean germplasm collection. Based on RT-PCR results, 4 out of 15 bean samples from open fields and 12 out of 21 bean accessions from the curated germplasm collection tested PvEV-1-positive. Interestingly, sequencing of RT-PCR products revealed that all amplified isolates are identical in the two amplified genomic portion which is also identical to those of the PV1 and PV2 isolates. These results suggest a relatively high incidence of PvEV-1 in bean in Slovakia. This is the first evidence and characterization of PvEV-1 from bean plants in Europe.",

We found that in HTNV-infected human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) the levels of Ang-1 mRNA and protein were reduced on days 2 and 3 post-infection (p.i.), when endothelial permeability was increased. The HTNV-stimulated permeability was reduced by treatment of HUVECs with Ang-1. The plasma Ang-1 level was lower in HFRS patients than in healthy persons. Paired plasma samples of HFRS patients revealed markedly lower Ang-1 levels during the acute phase of HFRS as compared to the convalescent phase.

However, little is known about the host range, epidemiology and pathogenesis of this natural pathogen of free-living murid rodents. Therefore we addressed the question of transplacental transmission of MHV-68 from pregnant Balb/c mice chronically infected with the virus to their fetuses and shedding of the virus by breast milk from chronically infected mothers to their offspring. The mothers were positive to infectious virus and viral antigen in various organs but mainly in the spleen and peritoneal *macrophages. Virus-neutralizing serum antibodies, and leukocyte count with a proportion of atypical lymphocytes were increasing to elevated values with the time of infection. The chronic infection resulted in premature termination of pregnancy or reduced number and size of newborns due to their retarded development. Out of 10 infected pregnant mice just one died and another developed a tumor. All these results confirm the vertical transmission of MHV-68 in mice, teratogenicity of the virus and the virus shedding by breast milk.",

    "abstract": "Watermelon mosaic virus (WMV) is a member of the genus Potyvirus, which is the largest genus of plant viruses. WMV is a significant pathogen of crop plants, including Cucurbitaceae species. A WMV strain, designated as WMV-Pg, was identified in transcriptome data collected from ginseng (Panax ginseng) root. WMV-Pg showed 84% nucleotide sequence identity and 91% amino acid sequence identity with its closest related virus, WMV-Fr. A phylogenetic analysis of WMV-Pg with other WMVs and soybean mosaic viruses (SMVs) indicated that WMV-Pg is a distinct subtype of the WMV/SMV group of the genus Potyvirus in the family Potyviridae.",

    "abstract": "Considering the need for discovery of new antiviral drugs, in view to combat the issue of resistance particularly to anti-influenza drugs, a series of 2'-amino, 3'-amino and 2', 4'-dihydroxy chalcone derivatives were designed. Structure-based drug design was used to design inhibitors of influenza virus - H1N1 neuraminidase enzyme. These were further optimized by a combination of iterative medicinal chemistry principles and molecular docking. Based on the best docking scores, some chalcone derivatives were synthesized and characterized by infrared spectroscopy (IR) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The molecules were evaluated for their anti-influenza action against influenza A/Pune isolate/2009 (H1N1) virus by in vitro enzyme-based assay (neuraminidase inhibition assay). We have then selected few of them for multinuclear NMR studies, 31P NMR, in order to probe the molecular mechanism of their antiviral action. Reasonably good correlation between docking scores; anti-influenza activity; and 31P NMR results were observed. The computational predictions were in consensus with the experimental results. It was observed that among tested compounds, derivative 1A, viz. 2', 4'-dihydroxy-4-methoxy chalcone, showed highest activity (IC50 = 2.23 μmol/l) against the virus under study. This derivative 1A can be explored further to provide a future therapeutic option for the treatment and prophylaxis of H1N1 viral infections.",

The clones were directly transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens to prevent potential problems such as plasmid instability during propagation in Escherichia coli. Ninety-five percent of papaya seedlings infected with PLDMV-GFP or PLDMV-mCherry developed systemic symptoms typical of those caused by wild-type PLDMV. Green and mCherry red fluorescence was observed in leaves, stems, and roots of infected papaya plants. The fluorescent protein-tagged agroinfectious PLDMV cDNA clones were stable in papaya for more than 90 days and during six serial passages at 30-day intervals.

    "abstract": "Hypothiocyanite (OSCN-) is a natural component of human saliva and is produced by the lactoperoxidase (LPO)/thiocyanate/hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) system. OSCN- has been previously shown to exhibit antiviral activity against influenza viruses (IFV) A/H1N1/2009 and A/H1N2/2009 in vitro as well as antimicrobial and antifungal activities. We elucidated the antiviral activity of OSCN- against both IFV types A and B and the mode of its antiviral action. OSCN- was produced constantly at 900 ± 200 μmol/l in Na3PO4 buffer solution containing NaSCN and LPO in the presence of H2O2 as an original OSCN- solution. In a plaque reduction assay, IFV A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), A/Fukushima/13/43 (H3N2), B/Singapore/222/97, and B/Fukushima/15/93 were exposed to various concentrations of OSCN- for 0 to 30 min before adsorption to MDCK cells, and plaque formation was examined. OSCN- exhibited significant similar antiviral activities against all four viruses without cytotoxicity, and the EC50 values for them were from 57 ± 16 to 148 ± 27 μmol/l regardless of the exposure times. The exposure of MDCK cells to OSCN- before viral adsorption did not affect its anti-IFV activity (EC50: more than 450 μmol/l), but the exposure after viral adsorption affected it moderately (EC50: 380 ± 40 μmol/l). Moreover, the exposure of virus particles to OSCN- at 450 μmol/l did not affect the hemagglutinin activity of IFV in hemagglutination inhibition assay. These results suggest that the attachment of OSCN- to the viral envelope critically contributes to the mode of antiviral action of OSCN- without interfering with viral adsorption.

    "abstract": "Dengue, considered the most important arthropod-borne viral disease affecting humans, is transmitted by the bite of mosquitoes of the genus Aedes and caused by one of the four distinct serotypes of dengue virus (DENV-1, -2, -3 and -4). Infection with one of the four serotypes provides lifelong homotypic immunity. However, immunity against the heterologous serotypes is transient. As a consequence, secondary infection may lead to severer manifestations due to cross-reactivity of antibodies and T-cells. Over 500,000 people are hospitalized every year and around 2,5 million, living in endemic areas, are at risk of infection. Given the background, the development of vaccines and anti-DENV drugs is of the utmost importance, as is the characterization of an animal model for testing them. The purpose of this study was to investigate ultrastructural alterations caused by DENV secondary infection in BALB/c mice heart. To achieve our goal, six BALB/c mice were infected with DENV-1 and, 4 months later, reinfected with DENV-2. Uninfected mice were used as negative controls. Heart samples were collected and processed for ultrastructural and histopathological analysis. Our results showed edema, endothelium activation characterized by the presence of transport vesicles, free platelets in interstitium, mitochondria presenting rarefied matrix and degenerated cristae, and disorganization of muscle fibers. These results point not only to BALB/c mice susceptibility to DENV infection, but also to the fact that, although it is not an often reported occurrence, dengue can lead to heart damage.

Fifteen percent (18/120) of rabbit fecal samples and 17.5% (7/40) of swine fecal samples were positive for HEV RNA, but only 1% (2/200) of ferret fecal samples were positive for HAV RNA. Our study showed that co-infection with both HAV and HEV in patients and animals is infrequent. At least in our study, we showed that ferrets may represent the potential HAV hosts.

In addition, it is known that nectin-2 is also functional as a receptor for HSV-2, although the binding to the gD is weak. To examine an antiviral potential of a soluble form of human nectin-2 (hNectin-2Ig), transfected Vero cells expressing the entire ectodomain of nectin-2 fused to the Fc portion of human IgG were established. Specific binding of hNectin-2Ig to HSV-2 gD was confirmed by ELISA. Competitive ELISA demonstrated that accumulation of hNectin-2Ig in transfected cells increased significantly in a cell culture time dependent manner. Viral growth of several HSV-2 strains was significantly inhibited in the transfected cells that were cultured for 72 hr compared with control Vero cells, but not in cells that were cultured for 24 hr. These results indicate that accumulation of a soluble form of nectin-2 is required for exerting the resistance against HSV-2 infection.",

Results of polymerase chain reaction and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction employed to detect suspected RNA and DNA viruses indicated involvement of a geminivirus, which was further characterized by sequencing of full genome amplified by rolling circle amplification. Analysis of full length DNA-A revealed 96.4-96.7% nucleotide similarity with bitter gourd yellow vein virus (BGYVV) isolates and tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV) isolate. As per the recent revision of begomovirus species demarcation criteria, if a new virus isolate shares ≥91% nt sequence identity with any other isolate of an existing species, it should be treated as an isolate of that species, even if it is <91% identical to all other isolates from that species. This made BGYVV an isolate of ToLCNDV and resulted in the de-recognizing of the BGGYV. Hence, the present virus has been named as a strain of ToLCNDV and designated as Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus-Lentil-[India:Kanpur:Lentil:2014] with the acronym as ToLCNDV-Lentil-[IN:Knp:Len:14]. This is the first report of a begomovirus found associated with a disease in lentil from India.",

    "abstract": "Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) infection results in serious economic losses to the pig industry. This positive-sense RNA virus hijacks cell host proteins for its own replication. Although previous studies have shown that RPS3, a 40S ribosomal subunit protein, is mainly required for DNA repair, apoptosis and inflammation, the effect of RPS3 on CSFV replication remains uncertain. Thus, we investigated the potential role of RPS3 in CSFV infection in RPS3-knockdown and -overexpressing cell lines using real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and indirect immunofluorescence assays. Results showed that knockdown of RPS3 by lentiviruses enhanced CSFV replication, whereas overexpression of RPS3 by lentiviruses inhibited CSFV replication. These findings indicated the antiviral role of RPS3 in CSFV infection. Subsequent experiments revealed that CSFV replication was inhibited in cells cultured with the supernatants of RPS3-overexpressing cell, suggesting that the RPS3-mediated inflammatory response was involved in CSFV infection. Furthermore, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed that the secretion of antiviral cytokines (IL-8 and INF-β) was increased in cells with sufficient RPS3 expression but decreased in cells lacking RPS3 expression. RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence assays revealed that CSFV infection inhibited RPS3-mediated antiviral cytokine secretion. Taken together, these findings reveal that RPS3 is a novel antiviral factor that inhibits CSFV proliferation by increasing antiviral cytokine secretion.

Although the antibody response to the secreted form of gp was higher than that to complete gp, the protective efficacy of the respective DNA vaccine against challenge was not better than that of the DNA vaccine inducing complete gp. This indicates that the transmembrane domain of RV gp is important for generating protection against rabies and should be present in RV DNA vaccines.",

After intramuscular inoculation, both vaccines induced in BALB/c mice antibodies as assayed by ELISA and virus neutralization. However, IRES-gD-IL-2 elicited significantly higher levels of IgG (ELISA) and neutralizing antibodies than IRES-gD. Isotyping of sera from mice injected with IRES-gD-IL-2 revealed predominantly IgG2a antibodies. IRES-gD-IL-2 also elicited a higher delayed-type sensitivity (DTH) reaction. However, there was no difference in the protection against lethal challenge with HSV-1 between the two vaccines (P>0.05).

When total RNA from the samples was subjected to RT-PCR with a pair of primers corresponding to the CMV coat protein (CP) flanking regions, the expected ~870 bp DNA fragment was amplified at 18 samples of 34 tested. MspI restriction analysis of 18 amplified products produced two DNA fragments with sizes about 530 and 330 bp corresponding to MspI profile of CMV S-I. The amplification products of four representative samples were cloned and nucleotide sequences of 1-5 clones from each isolate were determined. The clones from each isolate were over 99% identical and also the isolates themselves were only up to 2% divergent. These isolates clustered in subgroup IA clade on a consensus phylogenetic tree and formed a distinct subclade suggesting that the isolates have originated from a common source.",

In this study, we showed that the binding of soluble heparin to the envelope glycoprotein E2 (E2) of HCV was dependent on the dose and conformation of E2. On the other hand, the binding of E2 to the cell surface after treatment with soluble heparin was not markedly inhibited, what was different from other viruses utilizing cellular HS as the primary receptor. However, the enzymatic removal of HS from the cell surface led to a significant reduction in the binding of E2 to the cells. These facts imply that E2 was bound to cellular HS but might also have another route for cell attachment. Monoclonal antibodies with neutralizing activity against E2 did not completely block the binding of E2 to the cell surface, but their neutralization activity was greatly enhanced in the presence of soluble heparin. Taken together, the cellular HS could act as an alternative receptor for HCV and the interaction of E2 with HS could play a distinct role in escaping of HCV from the humoral immunity.",

Analyses of nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the CYSDV coat protein (CP) showed that Iranian isolates form a cluster and were placed in the Eastern subgroup of CYSDV. The Eastern subgroup of CYSDV was divided into two diverged subgroups including Iranian isolates and Saudi Arabian isolates. The identity among Iranian isolates was more than 99 %. Estimation of genetic distances showed that the number of nucleotide and amino acid substitutions per site from averaging overall Iranian sequence pairs were 0.004 and 0.008, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses and the estimation of genetic distance indicated that Iranian isolates have low genetic diversity.",

    "abstract": "One of the most fascinating findings in retrovirology is the construction of viral vectors based on foamy viruses (FVs) for gene therapy. The envelope glycoprotein (Env), one of the structural proteins of FV, is an important antigen in the immunoassays, as it is highly specific. To compare the characteristics of all 15 available FV Envs, the phylogenesis, hydrophobicity, modifications, and conserved motifs were analyzed based on the Env sequences. Meanwhile, the secondary structures of transmembrane (TM) domains of FV Envs were predicted. The results of phylogenetic analyses based on Envs indicated that the foamy viruses from different hosts could form three groups. The hydrophobicity analysis revealed that FV Envs had two prominent hydrophobic regions, which was similar to other retroviruses. Though the glycosylation, ubiquitination, and the secondary structures of TM domains of FV Envs were in line with other retroviruses, the roles were distinctly different. Interestingly, the analyses of conserved motifs suggested that FV Envs possessed several specific functional motifs.",

    "abstract": "Human influenza viruses are major concern as the leading cause of global pandemics. In infecting cells, they preferentially bind to sialyloligosaccharides containing terminal N-acetyl sialic acid linked to galactose by an α-2,6-linkage (NeuAcα2,6Gal). The amount of NeuAcα2,6Gal in Vero cells, which are predominantly used for production of influenza vaccines over the past 30 years, may not be as high as that in epithelial cells of human respiratory tract, what leads to the suboptimal virus growth in Vero cells. In this study, we stably transfected Vero cells with cDNA of human α-2,6-sialyltransferase (SIAT1), an enzyme catalyzing α-2,6-sialylation of galactose on glycoproteins. Overexpression of SIAT1 in the transfected Vero cells (Vero-SIAT1 cells) was confirmed by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy. Vero-SIAT1 cells expressed 7 times higher amounts of NeuAcα2,6Gal, but 3 times lower amounts of NeuAcα2,3Gal as compared to parental Vero cells. Furthermore, the influenza viruses A (H1N1 and H3N2) and B grew in Vero-SIAT1 cells to the higher titers than in Vero cells. Taken together, these results imply that Vero-SIAT1 cells are useful not only for the propagation of human influenza viruses, but also for the preparation of influenza vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Begomoviruses (the family Geminiviridae) have either a monopartite or a bipartite (DNA A and DNA B) single-stranded DNA genome. DNA B contains the open reading frame for movement protein and enables some bipartite begomoviruses to invade non-phloem tissues, whereas monopartite begomoviruses are limited to the phloem. Betasatellite DNA replicates in association with some monopartite begomoviruses to produce severe symptoms and enhance replication of helper virus in some hosts. The cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellite (CLCuMuB) has been shown to substitute for the DNA B of a bipartite begomovirus by permitting systemic infection, but the tissue tropism and the role of betasatellites in releasing monopartite begomoviruses from the phloem to adjacent tissue has not been described. In this study, the tissue tropism of CLCuMuB and a monopartite helper virus, tomato leaf curl virus (ToLCV), has been investigated using in situ hybridization, promoter localization and analysis of transgenic 2β plants, which contain a dimer of the CLCuMuB genome. In situ hybridization showed that CLCuMuB and ToLCV were localized into the vascular tissue of infected plants. In addition, CLCuMuB was detected only in the vascular tissue of 2β transgenic plants after infection with ToLCV. β-glucuronidase (GUS) expression under the βC1 promoter was also limited to the phloem tissues. In conclusion, we showed for the first time that CLCuMuB localizes only in the phloem tissues and unlike the DNA B component, CLCuMuB is unable to release the monopartite helper virus out of phloem tissues.",

The virus titer and phenotype of cells were evaluated to compare the characteristics of normal and carcinoma cells infected with non-syncytial (non-syn) and syncytial (syn) strains of herpes simplex viruses. We found that the cells of both normal cell lines infected with photoinactivated K17syn- and USsyn- but not HSZPsyn+ acquired transformed phenotype accompanied by the presence of virus. Surprisingly, the infection with photoinactivated viruses K17syn- and USsyn- but not HSZPsyn+ resulted in the suppression of the transformed phenotype of A549 cells. Using nested PCR, herpesviral DNA was identified in newly transformed cells and cells that lost the transformed phenotype. The effect of putative herpesvirus-related growth factors (HRGF) produced by cells infected with photoinactivated viruses was quantified and compared. Since methylene blue is currently used in phototherapy of herpetic lesions, these results raise the question of whether such therapy is risky to human health.",

Children who have suffered severe RSV infections during infancy are prone to develop recurrent episodes of wheezing and asthma that may be associated with viral persistence. RSV infections in humans and animal models are characterized by extensive inflammatory responses. Epithelial cell lines acutely infected by RSV have shown activation of the NF-κB signaling through two independent pathways: the canonical pathway, mediated by RelA and p50 subunits, and the non-canonical pathway, mediated by the subunits RelB and p52. Herein, we investigated the state of activation of the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathways in macrophages either acutely or persistently infected by RSV and examined the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators. Activation of NF-κB subunits was analyzed through Western blot assays using acutely RSV-infected epithelial cells as a control. The expression levels of two pro-inflammatory cytokines and a chemokine were determined by quantitative RT-PCR and through immunobead assays. The results showed that p52 was abundant during acute and persistent RSV infection, indicating that macrophages predominantly activate the non-canonical pathway. We also observed activation of IL-1β, TNF-α and CCL5/RANTES transcription, though at higher levels in persistently infected macrophages than in acutely infected macrophages. In contrast, the protein levels of these cytokines/chemokine did not correlate with their mRNA transcription, as quantitation displayed higher levels during acute infection than in persistent infection, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation by RSV persistence.",

Using a TaqMan probe quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), we identified that the E3 and E4orf1 regions specifically detect Ad36 DNA, because these regions did not show cross reactivity with other types of adenoviruses. The limit of detection was 379 copy/ml and 384 copy/ml for E3 and E4orf1 regions of Ad36, respectively. The %CV (coefficient of variation) for reproducibility of the assay using adenovirus reference material ranged from 1.07-13.02. After we developed the standard protocol to detect Ad36 DNA, we used mouse as a surrogate model to confirm its clinical applicability. We administered Ad36 to mice via intranasal and oral routes, with intraperitoneal administration as the positive control, to analyze the effect of infection route. Ad36 DNA could be detected in lungs, liver, pancreas, and epididymal fat tissue after intraperitoneal injection, whereas it was found only in lungs after intranasal injection. No Ad36 DNA was detectable in any tested organ after oral injection. This indicates that the main route of infection with Ad36 is intranasal, suggesting that Ad36 is a respiratory virus.

    "abstract": "Marek's disease virus (MDV) is an immunosuppressive pathogen that can cause low production efficiency and high mortality rates in chickens. There is no current information on the MDV serotypes and pathotypes circulating in vaccinated commercial farms in Colombia where the birds are vaccinated in the incubator with Gallid herpesvirus (GaHV-2) and Meleagrid herpesvirus 1 (MeHV-1). Based on that, the main focus of this study was to understand the MDV's infection dynamics for the three known serotypes and to detect wild-virus pathogenic strains in 4-layer poultry farms in Antioquia. Samples of blood, feathers and spleens were collected from three randomly chosen animals according to age category: 1, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 days. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) that differentiates between the three serotypes of MDV was used to assess viral loads over time, and phylogenetic analysis of the Meq oncogene was done to compare the strains of MDV with those of known pathogenicity. Meleagrid herpesvirus 1 (MeHV-1) was detected in all blood and feather follicle samples with an average number of genome copies (per 10,000 cells) of 31.44 in blood as expected as a result of vaccination. GaHV-2 was also detected in almost 100% of the blood and feather follicle samples throughout all defined age categories, with an average of 10.65 genome copies in blood samples. Gallid herpesvirus 3 (GaHV-3) was detected in 72% of blood and 84.61% of feather samples, with less than 1 copy per 10,000 cells. Based on the number of 132 bp repeats of the BamHI-H and BamHI-D regions in pooled feather samples, there were 70% (8/25) of attenuated MDV and 30% (17/25) of virulent MDV strains circulating in the farms. Virus isolation was performed successfully from every farm. In conclusion, different strains of MDV are circulating for up to 120 days in layers in Antioquia-Colombia and could be of major impact in poultry health.

    "abstract": "For successful infection, viruses must recognize their respective host cells. A common mechanism of host recognition by viruses is to utilize a portion of the host cell as a receptor. Bacteriophage Sf6, which infects Shigella flexneri, uses lipopolysaccharide as a primary receptor and then requires interaction with a secondary receptor, a role that can be fulfilled by either outer membrane proteins (Omp) A or C. Our previous work showed that specific residues in the loops of OmpA mediate Sf6 infection. To better understand Sf6 interactions with OmpA loop variants, we determined the kinetics of these interactions through the use of biolayer interferometry, an optical biosensing technique that yields data similar to surface plasmon resonance. Here, we successfully tethered whole Sf6 virions, determined the binding constant of Sf6 to OmpA to be 36 nM. Additionally, we showed that Sf6 bound to five variant OmpAs and the resulting kinetic parameters varied only slightly. Based on these data, we propose a model in which Sf6: Omp receptor recognition is not solely based on kinetics, but likely also on the ability of an Omp to induce a conformational change that results in productive infection.

    "abstract": "The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) pandemic constitutes one of the greatest public health issues, since 36.9 million people worldwide were living with HIV in 2017 and 940,000 died from AIDS- related illnesses in the same year. One of the main obstacles in the effort to achieve viral eradication or long-term virologic remission is the existence of the HIV-reservoir. Except for resting memory CD4+ T cells there is a plethora of innate immunity cells including macrophages, dendritic cells, follicular T helper cells and NK cells which are now considered to play a role in viral latency and persistence. Hematopoietic precursor cells and progenitor mast cells, astrocytes, fibrocytes, renal and liver epithelial cells could also contribute to the reservoir, but their role remains controversial. Tissue reservoirs, such as the central nervous system (CNS), lymphoid tissue, adipose tissue and the gut-associated-lymphoid-tissue (GALT) are usually referred to as anatomic sanctuaries, where it is difficult to achieve high concentration and efficacy of antiretroviral agents. Accurate quantification of this reservoir is of the utmost importance and multiple assays have been developed for this purpose. The role of several cell populations in viral latency needs to be clarified by further studies. Furthermore, there is an urgent need for new assays, which will accurately measure the size of the reservoir, which plays a key role in predicting the timing of viral rebound upon cessation of antiretroviral treatment, since the currently available ones either overestimate or underestimate the size and have significant limitations.

The aim of the present study was to analyze the genotypes of rotavirus strains isolated from children with gastroenteritis, after the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine in México. Rotavirus was detected in 14/100 (14%) fecal samples from children with gastroenteritis, using a commercial test kit. The viral genome was purified from these samples and used as a template in RT-PCR amplification of the VP4 and VP7 genes, followed by gene cloning and sequencing. Among the rotavirus strains, 4/14 (28.5%) were characterized as G12P[8], 2/14 (14.3%), as G12P (not typed), and 3/14 (21.42%) as G (not typed) P[8]. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP7 gene showed that G12 genotypes clustered in lineage III. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that VP4 genotype P[8] sequences clustered in lineage V, whereas other P[8] sequences previously reported in Mexico (2005-2008) clustered in different lineages. Rotavirus genotype G12 is currently recognized as a globally emerging rotavirus. To our knowledge, this is the first report of this emerging rotavirus strain G12P[8] in México. Ongoing surveillance is recommended to monitor the distribution of rotavirus genotypes and to continually reassess the suitability of currently available rotavirus vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Marek's disease (MD) is a highly contagious neoplastic disease of chickens associated with economic losses, often due to visceral lymphomas. The etiological agent is MD virus serotype 1 (MDV-1), also called Gallid alphaherpesvirus 2 (GaHV-2). Despite intensive vaccination, MDV is constantly evolving and maintaining its presence in the world. The aim of this study was to genetically analyze a highly oncogenic MDV/Tur/2019 strain obtained from a poultry farm in Turkey's Elazig province in 2019. Genes associated with viral pathogenicity and oncogenicity Marek's EcoRI-Q-encoded protein (MEQ), phosphoprotein-38 (pp38), and viral interleukin 8 (vIL-8) were selected for this purpose. The vIL-8 nucleotide sequence showed high similarity (100% identity) to some European (EU-1, Polen 5) and Asian (03 India, GADVASU-M2) MDV strains. The pp38 nucleotide sequence showed high similarity (100% identity) to some American (CU-2, JM/102W, RB1B) and European (MD70/13, ATE2539) MDV strains. There were no disrupted four-proline molecules (PPPP) within the transactivation domain of the MEQ. However, according to phylogenetic results, the MDV/Tur/2019 strain was included in cluster 2a alongside European MDV strains (Polish, Hungarian, Italian) with very virulent and very virulent plus pathotypes. In conclusion, we believe that the MDV/Tur/2019 strain obtained from turkey herpesvirus (HVT)-vaccinated chickens has a very virulent or very virulent plus pathotype. Although this result provides some clues regarding the virulence of this strain, in vivo studies are needed to achieve exact pathotyping. Further, combination of HVT with the CVI988 strain should be used for vaccination to provide the best protection, as highly pathogenic MDV strains can break sterile immunity against the HVT vaccine.

    "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-borne flavivirus that reemerged in 2007 and, since then, has caused several outbreaks and spread to over 80 countries worldwide. Along with this, ZIKV infections have been associated with severe clinical outcomes, including neurological manifestations, especially in newborns, posing a major threat to human health. However, there are no licensed vaccines or specific antiviral agents available yet; thereby, there is an urgent need for the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies to fight this infection. In this context, seaweeds are proven sources of biologically relevant products, including antiviral ones, that remain poorly explored. Herein, we evaluated the antiviral potential of the dichloromethane extract of the red seaweed Bryotamnion triquetrum against ZIKV. MTT assay was carried out to evaluate the extract's toxicity in Vero cells, while standard plaque assays were performed for viral titer quantification in the antiviral assays. The B. triquetrum extract possessed great inhibitory activity on the ZIKV replication in Vero cells, with an EC50 of 1.38 µg/ml and a higher selectivity index than ribavirin (289.85 and 75.20, respectively), a licensed antiviral drug. The investigation of its mechanism of action revealed a moderate virucidal effect while it strongly impaired virus replication at both early and late steps of the virus replication cycle with moderate inhibition at the attachment stage. Finally, the B. triquetrum extract presented a remarkable synergistic effect with ribavirin at suboptimal concentrations, which also highlights the promising antiviral potential of this product as a drug candidate to combat ZIKV infection.

We analyzed a transcriptome dataset isolated from the common eelgrass (Zostera marina) and identified a novel varicosavirus named Zostera associated varicosavirus 1 (ZaVV1). The ZaVV1 genome consists of two genomic segments: RNA1 (6,632-nt) has an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a large multi-functional polymerase protein (L), while RNA2 (4,304-nt) has four ORFs: one for a nucleocapsid protein and three for proteins with unknown functions (P2, P3, and P4). Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis using L proteins showed that ZaVV1 is a novel member of the genus Varicosavirus of the family Rhabdoviridae. The conserved regulatory elements involved in transcription termination/polyadenylation and transcription initiation were identified in the ZaVV1 gene-junction regions with the consensus sequence 3'-UAUUAUUCUUUUUGCUCU-5' (in the negative-sense genome). The ZaVV1 genome sequence may be useful for studying the phylogenetic relationships of varicosaviruses and genome evolution of rhabdoviruses.

Southern blot analysis showed that DNAb could increase accumulation of its cognate virus in the infected N. benthamiana plants.

Murine gammaherpesvirus 4556 (MHV-4556), isolated from Apodemus flavicollis ticks has been considered a close relative of MHV-68 but different in some features of infection in vitro and in vivo. Previous comparison of MHV-4556 with MHV-68 has revealed their diversity in immune evasion protein MK3. In this study, HindIII and EcoRI restriction profiles of the MHV-4556 genome disclosed absence of the deletion that has been identified previously at the left end of genomes of murine gammaherpesvirus 76 (MHV-76) and murine gammaherpesvirus Šumava (MHV-Šumava). A 22, 565 bp portion of MHV-4556 genome sequence was sequenced, analyzed and compared with that of MHV-68. Nucleotide sequences of 21 genes of MHV-4556 and deduced amino acid sequences revealed their identity to those of MHV-68 except for differences in 15 nucleotides and 8 amino acids in 5 genes and their proteins, respectively. Due to these differences, immune evasion protein M4 and structural proteins encoded by ORF8 (gB), ORF11 (p43), ORF26 and ORF52, respectively, are predicted to have a reduced hydrophilicity and surface exposure compard with their MHV-68 counterparts. These differences obviously contribute to some different pathogenetical features of these viruses and could explain the weaker immunogenicity of MHV-4556 in comparison with MHV-68.murine gammaherpesvirus 4556; restriction analysis; partial genome sequence.",

Among the lytic genes, viral protein kinase (vPK) encoded by ORF36 is a member of serine/threonine protein kinase (CHPK) family, which is involved in viral gene expression, viral DNA replication and encapsidation, and nuclear egress of virions. Recent studies have shown that the BGLF4 protein of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a member of the CHPK family, alters the host cell chromatin structure through phosphorylation of its key regulators. The role of KSHV ORF36 in cellular mitotic events, however, is not yet understood. In the current study, we showed that KSHV ORF36 induced chromosome condensation and phosphorylation of histone H3 on Ser 10, which are known as cellular mitosis markers.

    "abstract": "The prevalence of porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2) infection in the pig population in Slovakia was investigated. Sera from pigs suspected for post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) as well as clinically healthy pigs were tested for viral DNA and specific IgM and IgG antibodies. Pigs (n = 198) were categorized to weaning, grower and fattening ones and sows. The results showed that PCV-2 antibodies were present in 53.4% of PMWS-suspects, in 50.0% of healthy pigs and in 69.0% of sows. In PMWS-suspect grower pigs, 40.7% were positive for IgM+IgG antibodies and 22.2% for viral DNA. In PMWS-suspect fattening pigs, 50.0% were positive for IgM+IgG antibodies and 25.0% for viral DNA. In healthy fattening pigs, almost 90.0% were positive for IgG antibodies and 38.5% for viral DNA. The highest proportion of PMWS-suspects was in grower pigs and specific antibodies were increasing with the age of pigs. A combination of positivities for IgG+IgM antibodies and viral DNA was a highly significant marker of PMWS. Viral DNA was detected in seropositive as well as seronegative PMWS-suspects. Overall, in all categories of pigs tested, specific antibodies and viral DNA were detected in 54.0% and 35.5%, respectively.",

In the protective experiment, mice were first administered single MAbs or their combinations intraperitoneally (i.p.) and 24 hrs later infected with the virus intracerebrally (i.c.). The results showed that single MAbs protected the mice to the extent of 45-65%, while combinations of two or three MAbs gave 85-90% or 100% protection, respectively. The enhanced effect of combinations of several Hs MAbs might be due to the sharing of neutralization epitopes recognized by the Hs MAbs. These results suggested that a combination of at least three epitopes represented by the Hs MAbs should be included in an effective JEV vaccine.",

The sequence characteristics of DEV UL29 gene was initially showed in our article. Phylogenetic tree analysis provided useful proof that DEV belongs to the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae. The predicted characteristics of ICP8 amino acid sequence showed that ICP8 possesses good immunogenicity and is a hydrophobic protein. These findings correlate with the experimental results that ICP8 protein forms inclusion bodies in the prokaryotic expression system. By immunofluorescence we have identified ICP8 as nuclear protein.

The present study aimed to identify potential selective pressures acting on the ORF5 gene of PRRSV isolates of North American type prevalent in China. The non-synonymous to synonymous rate ratio ω (dN/dS) was employed as a measure of selective pressure at the codon level. An overall ω of 0.45 indicated negative (purifying) selection as the major driving force operating on the ORF5 gene during adaptation of the virus to swine. Determination of ω values for individual amino acids sites revealed 8 positively selected sites, most of them situated in the N-terminal ectodomain, indicating their potential role in the binding of virus to the cellular receptors. Further, 75 negatively selected sites were identified in the rest of molecule, probably as a result of functional or immunological constraints. Determination of potential N-glycosylation sites revealed 7 sites, four of which coincided with the positively selected ones. These results indicated that a specific adaptive evolution has operated on the ORF5 gene of Chinese PRRSV isolates. It is hoped that the disclosed adaptive sites might help identify a candidate antigenic epitope for the use in vaccine against this serious swine disease.",

    "abstract": "Rotavirus is the major cause of severe virus-associated gastroenteritis worldwide in children aged 5 and younger. Many children lose their lives annually due to this infection and the impact is particularly pronounced in developing countries. The mature rotavirus is a non-enveloped triple-layered nucleocapsid containing 11 double stranded RNA segments. Here a global view on the sequence and structure of the three main capsid proteins, VP2, VP6 and VP7 is shown by generating a consensus sequence for each of these rotavirus proteins, for each species obtained from published data of representative rotavirus genotypes from across the world and across species. Degree of conservation between species was represented on homology models for each of the proteins. VP7 shows the highest level of variation with 14-45 amino acids showing conservation of less than 60%. These changes are localised to the outer surface alluding to a possible mechanism in evading the immune system. The middle layer, VP6 shows lower variability with only 14-32 sites having lower than 70% conservation. The inner structural layer made up of VP2 showed the lowest variability with only 1-16 sites having less than 70% conservation across species. The results correlate with each protein's multiple structural roles in the infection cycle. Thus, although the nucleotide sequences vary due to the error-prone nature of replication and lack of proof reading, the corresponding amino acid sequence of VP2, 6 and 7 remain relatively conserved. Benefits of this knowledge about the conservation include the ability to target proteins at sites that cannot undergo mutational changes without influencing viral fitness; as well as possibility to study systems that are highly evolved for structure and function in order to determine how to generate and manipulate such systems for use in various biotechnological applications.",

The nucleocapsid (N) protein is an important target for drugs and vaccines. The main purpose of this study is to detect missense mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 N protein and to reveal the effects of these mutations on protein structure by using in silico approaches. 161 missense mutations of the N protein were determined in 2286 SARS-CoV-2 genomes derived from the GISAID EpiCoV database in the Turkish population. Identified 161 missense mutations were analyzed by using sequence and structure-based methods to predict effects of mutation on function and structure of SARS-CoV-2 N protein. These analyzes revealed that some mutations showed deleterious effects and change of stability and flexibility of nucleocapsid protein. D3L, S194L, S235F, and P13L (Omicron variant) mutations were further analyzed in our study due to their importance in the literature and in our results. Even though, our findings are essential for research of SARS-CoV-2 virus, in vitro and in vivo validations are necessary.

The human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) is still one of the most relevant pathogenic agents involved in respiratory infections in children, the leading cause of bronchiolitis worldwide. In most cases, hRSV infection is not complicated; however, limited treatment and vaccine options increase the morbidity rates associated with bronchiolitis. The innate immune response governs the severity of the disease and controls the viral infection outcome. Current knowledge about the mechanisms involved in viral PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules) recognition, genetic characteristics of the inflammatory response, and understanding of antiviral response is crucial for vaccine development and biomarker tools to predict complications and guide therapeutic management. Here, we review key concepts related to pathogenesis and immune response against hRSV, highlighting aspects that could be considered in vaccine development.",

Through high-throughput RNA sequencing analysis of asymptomatic samples of Aconitum carmichaelii , a significant medicinal herb in Asia, we identified the genome sequences of two RNA viruses, tentatively named Aconitum potyvirus 1 (AcoPV1) and Aconitum potyvirus 2 (AcoPV2). The genomes of AcoPV1 and AcoPV2 encode polyproteins composed of 3,069 and 3,054 amino acids, respectively. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses established that AcoPV1 and AcoPV2 represent unique, novel members within the genus Potyvirus . The estimated RNA polymerase slippage rates at the GAAAAAA motif, responsible for the production of P3N-PIPO or P3N-ALT trans-frame fusion proteins, were 0.79% in AcoPV1 and 1.38% in AcoPV2. The RNA reads of AcoPV1 and AcoPV2 were predominantly found in the leaf and flower tissues, indicating potential feeding preferences of vectors for these viruses. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of high-throughput RNA sequencing in not only uncovering novel potyviruses, but also in elucidating their genomic dynamics within host plants.",

    "abstract": "Despite the urgent need for effective antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 to mitigate the catastrophic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, favipiravir and ivermectin are among the common repurposed drugs that have been provisionally used in some countries. There have been clinical trials with mixed results, and therefore, it is still inconclusive whether they are effective or should be dismissed. It is plausible that the lack of clear-cut clinical benefits was due to the finding of only marginal levels of in vivo antiviral activity. An obvious way to improve the activity of antivirals is to use them in synergistic combinations. The in vitro antiviral activity of the combinations of favipiravir, ivermectin, niclosamide, and chloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 was assessed in Vero E6 cells and the lung epithelial cell, Calu-3. Here we show that favipiravir and ivermectin had synergistic effects against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells. In addition, we found that favipiravir had an additive effect with niclosamide, another repurposed anti-parasitic drug with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. However, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of favipiravir was drastically reduced when evaluated in Calu-3 cells. This suggested that this cell type might not be able to metabolize favipiravir into its active form and that this deficiency in some cell types may affect the in vivo efficacy of this drug. Favipiravir and ivermectin show the best synergistic effect. This combination is being tested in a randomized controlled clinical trial (NCT05155527).",

In contrast, in the north-east part of the country we did not detect any dock plants infected with PVX. Next, two other viruses, Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) and Radish mosaic virus (RaMV) were mechanically inoculated and tested for their survival capacity and multiplication in the hybrid dock. Both viruses were detected 9 months after inoculation in the infected plants.",

The specificity and sensitivity of the probe was tested by the dot-blot hybridization. The detection limit of this method was equivalent to 0.8 microg of fresh infected tissue in each spot. Double-antibody sandwich (DAS) ELISA and RT-PCR had the detection limit 39 microg and 0.008 microg of fresh infected tissue, respectively. We evaluated leaf, fruit pulp, and seed of pepper plant by dot-blot hybridization and found all the tested tissues suitable for detection of PMMoV. Finally, 111 tissue samples including 93 samples collected from the pepper fields of Beijing and Baoding and 18 commercial seed samples were evaluated by this method. The results showed that the incidence rate of the infected samples was 14% and 61% for the field samples and commercial seeds, respectively. The high sensitivity and reliability of the molecular hybridization assay provided an important alternative method for the detection of PMMoV in a large-scale.",

The HA DNA or NA DNA was injected intramuscularly into BALB/c mice separately or as a mixture. The injection of plasmid was followed by an electroporation close to the site of puncture. Four weeks later, the immunized mice were challenged with a lethal dose of IBV. The protective abilities of DNA vaccines were evaluated by the detection of specific antibodies in serum, survival rate, virus titer in lungs, and change of body weight. We found that a single dose of HA DNA or NA DNA induced the formation of specific antibodies and conferred effective protection against the lethal challenge of IBV. However, the combined vaccine HA DNA and NA DNA enhanced the protective ability of immunized mice.

    "abstract": "Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV-68) provides a valuable tool to screen novel therapeutic strategies against oncogenic gammaherpesviruses. The development and characterization of antiviral agents usually depend on appropriate screening assays. The aim of this study was to develop rapid and sensitive method for testing antiviral compounds against gammaherpesviruses. For this purpose, a recombinant MHV-68 expressing firefly luciferase (MHV-68/LUC) was constructed. The conditions for MHV-68/LUC infection in Vero cells suitable for novel antiviral screening assay in 96-well plate format were then optimized. The sensitivity of MHV-68/LUC to acyclovir (ACV) and ganciclovir (GCV) was measured by the optimized luciferase activity reduction assay. The 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) values for ACV and GCV were comparable to those determined by conventional plaque reduction assay. Therefore, the luciferase activity reduction assay can efficiently replace the plaque reduction assay. The great advantages of novel assay are represented by the significant reduction in assay time and rapid and objective measurement of the assay. In order to evaluate whether the luciferase activity reduction assay could be used as a screening system for novel antivirals, newly synthesized quinolone/quinoline derivatives were tested for their effects on the replication of MHV-68/LUC in vitro. The compound 2-(1-(b-D-Xylopyranosyl)-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)-3,4-dibenzyloxy-quinoline showed significant antiviral activity and its IC50 against MHV-68/LUC was estimated to be 1,76 µg/ml. However, this compound was not suitable for in vivo testing due to its narrow selectivity index (SI = 11). Keywords: MHV-68; antiviral screening; luciferase; quinolone/quinoline derivatives.",

The nsp2 and ORF5 genes were sequenced for investigation of variations and phylogenetic analysis. The results showed that positive rate of PRRSV was 9.58% in the collected samples. Phylogenetic analysis of GP5 showed that these strains were clustered into two lineages (1 and 8) indicating different genotypes of PRRSV were circulating in Shandong province. Meanwhile, sequence analysis Of nsp2 showed that the PRRSV strains with 30 amino acids deletions were dominant. Moreover, novel pattern of recombination/deletion and insertion in nsp2 was observed in these strains, indicating that novel PRRSV strains with different patterns of deletions or insertions in nsp2 are emerging in China. All the results suggested that continuous surveillance of PRRSV in China is warranted. Keywords: PRRSV; GP5; nsp2; genetic analysis; Shandong.",

    "abstract": "In this review we discuss existing as well as new approaches to immunotherapy directed against infected or cancerous cells. These approaches traditionally exploit either natural components of immune system (such as cytokines, chemokines, co-stimulatory molecules and adjuvants), or monoclonal antibodies designed to target foreign agents and/or diseased cells through their molecular markers. Additional strategies in development include therapeutic vaccines, oncolytic viruses and T-cell therapies. In addition, we briefly describe a novel strategy called ReDIT (Re-Directed ImmunoTherapy), based on re-orienting the existing long-lasting immune responses (e.g. induced by measles vaccination or natural infection) towards new target molecules on the surface of infected or malignant cells. This can be principally achieved by using bi-functional protein constructs that contain an antigen carrier component and a re-directing component. The antigen carrier component can consist of the ectodomain of the measles hemagglutinin that can be recognized by antibodies and memory cells generated during previous infection or vaccination. The re-directing component consists of the specific virus- or tumor antigen-binding molecule. The fusion constructs are expected to boost existing anti-measles immunity and re-direct it against a new target, engaging the existing anti-measles immunity as an effector mechanism. Thus, ReDIT is a promising novel approach that may represent a valuable addition to immunotherapy of difficult to treat infections and tumors, as it exploits a mechanism distinct from other available therapies.",

DNA viruses often modulate the function of critical cell cycle proteins to maximize the efficiency of virus replication. Here we have examined the effect of Rta on cell cycle progression. Cell cycle analysis revealed that Rta induced HeLa cells in G0/G1-phase to reenter the S-phase. Analysis of the expression pattern of a key set of cell cycle regulators revealed that expression of Rta inhibited the expression of Rb and p53 and induced the expression of E2F1. These findings suggest that Rta plays an active role in redirecting HeLa cell physiology through an Rta-mediated cell cycle transformation.",

Murine gammaherpesvirus 72 (MHV-72) has been considered a close relative of MHV-68 but its replication in murine mammary gland cells and kinetics of infection of mice were found to be different. Pathological studies of a long-term-infection of mice revealed a similar or higher malignancy development rate in MHV-72-infected mice as compared with that of MHV-68. Previous comparison of MHV-72 with MHV-68 revealed their diversity in M3, MK3, and M7 genes encoding the chemokine-binding protein, immune evasion protein and glycoprotein 150, respectively. In this study, a portion (22,899 bp) of MHV-72 genome sequence was determined, analyzed and compared with that of MHV-68. Nucleotide sequences of 13 structural and 6 non-structural genes of MHV-72 and deduced amino acid sequences revealed their identity to those of MHV-72 except for differences in 9 nucleotides and 8 amino acids, occurring in 5 genes and their proteins. Due to these differences, 4 structural proteins encoded by ORF20, ORF26, ORF48, and ORF52, respectively, and a non-structural protein encoded by ORF4, all of MHV-72, are predicted to have altered hydrophilicity and surface exposure in comparison with their MHV-68 counterparts. These differences obviously contribute to some different pathogenetical features of these viruses and could explain the reduced immunogenicity of MHV-72 in relation to MHV-68, allowing MHV-72 to escape the host immune surveillance.",

    "abstract": "In order to further predict the epidemic trend and develop vaccines for 2009 H1N1 virus, we monitored its epitopes and molecular pathogenic characteristics during the epidemic process. We also analyzed the similarity of antigenic and genetic characteristics among the novel 2009 H1N1, representative seasonal H1N1 strains, and vaccine strains. 2009 H1N1 isolates had high similarity of hemagglutinin (HA) antigenic sites with H1N1 viruses isolated before 1940 and up to 80.0% similarity with 1918 H1N1. The elderly people born before 1940 have relatively low 2009 H1N1 infection rate, which might be responsible for their previous infection with either 1918 H1N1 virus or an early progeny. Compared to seasonal H1N1 vaccine strains from 1999 to 2010, the HA, neuraminidase (NA), and nucleoprotein (NP) proteins of the isolates had highly conserved CTL epitopes (60.5-65.8%, 69.6-82.6%, and 76.7%, respectively). The seriousness and mortality rate of 2009 H1N1 infections were similar to seasonal influenza, which may be related to the molecular characteristics of low toxicity of 2009 H1N1 and cross-T-cell immunity, due to vaccination or exposure to seasonal H1N1 virus. Some strains of 2009 H1N1 acquired mutations at antigenic and glycosylation sites. It is of particular interest that Haishu/SWL110/10 and Beijing/SE2649/09, isolated after November 2009, gained a new glycosylation site at the position 179 of HA protein, near the RBD. Thus, in the future, vaccination with glycosylated 2009 H1N1 virus may prevent the seasonal epidemic caused by strains with glycosylation site mutation near the receptor binding domain (RBD).",

    "abstract": "Influenza A virus undergoes frequent changes of antigenicity and contributes to seasonal epidemics or unpredictable pandemics.Nucleoprotein, encoded by gene segment 5, is an internal protein of the virus and is conserved among strains of different host origins.In the current study, we analyzed the differentially expressed proteins in A549 cells transiently transfected with the recombinant nucleoprotein of influenza A virus by 2D gel electrophoresis.The resolved protein spots on gel were identified by MALDI-TOF/Mass spectrometry analysis.The majority of the host proteins detected to be differentially abundant in recombinant nucleoprotein-expressing cells as compared to vector-transfected cells are the proteins of metabolic pathways, glycolytic enzymes, molecular chaperones and cytoskeletal proteins.We further demonstrated the interaction of virus nucleoprotein with some of the identified host cellular proteins.In vitro binding assay carried out using the purified recombinant nucleoprotein (pET29a+NP-His) and A549 cell lysate confirmed the interaction between nucleoprotein and host proteins, such as alpha enolase 1, pyruvate kinase and β-actin.The preliminary data of our study provides the information on virus nucleoprotein interaction with proteins involved in glycolysis.However, studies are ongoing to understand the significance of these interactions in modulating the host factors during virus replication.",

These are currently classified as four distinct species in the genus Fijivirus, family Reoviridae, but their taxonomic status has been questioned. To help resolve this, the nucleotide sequences of the ten genomic segments of an Italian isolate of MRDV have been determined, providing the first complete genomic sequence of this virus. Its genome has 29144 nucleotides and is similar in organization to those of RBSDV, SRBSDV, and MRCV. The 13 ORFs always share highest identities (81.3-97.2%) with the corresponding ORFs of RBSDV and phylogenetic analyses of the different genome segments and ORFs all confirm that MRDV clusters most closely with RBSDV and that MRCV and SRBSDV are slightly more distantly related. The results suggest that MRDV and RBSDV should be classified as different geographic strains of the same virus species and we suggest the name cereal black-streaked dwarf fijivirus (CBSDV) for consideration.",

We applied an infectious cDNA clone of plum pox virus (PPV), where the P1 was N-fused with a hexahistidine tag, to trace this protein in Nicotiana benthamiana plants during the PPV infection. Immunoblot analysis with the anti-his antibody showed a diffuse band corresponding to the molecular weight about 70-80 kDa (about twice larger than expected) in the root samples from early stage of infection. This signal culminated on the sixth day post inoculation, later it rapidly disappeared. Sample denaturation by boiling in SDS before centrifugal clarification was essential, indicating strong affinity of P1-his to some plant compound sedimenting with the tissue and cell debris.",

In the present study, six different isolates (MB11, HY12, PY12, BGE14, VCN14 and NKL14) of IBDV strains were subjected for genotyping along with vaccine virus (Georgia, intermediate strain) using RT-PCR for amplification of a 743 bp sequence in the hypervariable region of VP2 gene followed by restriction enzyme digestion with 5 different restriction enzymes (BspMI, SacI, HhaI, StuI and SspI). The RT-PCR products obtained from vvIBDV strains were digested by SspI enzyme except PY12, BGE14 and MB11 isolates. The SacI digested the isolate MB11, PY12 and the vaccine strain, but it did not cleave the very virulent isolates of IBDV. HhaI cleaved all the isolates with different restriction profile patterns. StuI digested all the vvIBDV isolates and BspMI was not able to differentiate field isolates from vaccine strain. Though RT-PCR combined with RFLP is a genotypic method, further confirmation of serotypes to distinguish the vvIBDV from cvIBDV has to be carried out using pathogenicity studies.",

The epizootic was suspected as Rift Valley fever (RVF)-like sickness based on clinical features. However, its etiological agent could neither be isolated nor implicated conclusively. During the post-epizootic period a male lamb died of similar clinical features and the spleen was immediately collected. Inoculation of spleen suspension in infant mouse brain yielded a virus that was serially passaged in infant mice and rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells. Electron microscopic observations revealed virus particles resembling flaviviruses. RT-PCR performed on extracted total RNA from infected cells and mouse brains with flavivirus-specific or RVF-specific primers gave negative results. However, an amplicon of 280 bp was obtained with pestivirus-specific primers from the 5'-UTR. Further, a nested PCR yielded a product of 157 bp. Nucleotide sequencing of the 157 bp product showed 100% homology to BVDV-1. Western blot analysis with a flavivirus envelope protein-specific MAb revealed three proteins of 33 K, 45 K and 55 K. Further studies suggested that the 33 K and 55 K proteins were glycosylated. This is the first report of isolation of BVDV-1 from a lamb in India.",

Three potential target sequences in the SLAM gene were chosen and cloned into the pSilencer 3.0-H1 vector. The vector constructs were used for transfection of B95-8 cells in which SLAM was then detected by flow cytometry, Western blot analysis and RT-PCR both at transcription and expression levels. One of the vector constructs was found to block effectively the SLAM expression as well as MV infection. These results suggest that RNAi could silence SLAM expression and inhibit the MV infection of host cells.",

Our data showed that GVT treatment of ts1-infected mice significantly increased their expression of Bcl-2 and VEGF in brainstem compared with ts1-infected untreated mice. We also studied the expression of specific microRNAs (miRNAs) such as miRNA-15 and -16 (targeting Bcl-2), and miRNA-20 (targeting VEGF). We found that the expression of miRNAs inversely correlated with the upregulation of their target proteins in ts1-infected untreated as well as in GVT-treated-ts1-infected mice. The data showed that GVT treatment prevented ts1-induced ND at least in part by upregulating Bcl-2 and VEGF expression, what likely occurred as a consequence of downregulation of their corresponding miRNAs.",

    "abstract": "Whitefly-transmitted viruses of the genus Begomovirus (the family Geminiviridae) have become a limiting factor for agricultural productivity in many warmer parts of the world. The economies of Pakistan and India have, since the early 1990s, suffered losses due to cotton leaf curl disease (CLCuD). The disease is caused by begomoviruses, the most important of which at this time is cotton leaf curl Kokhran virus strain Burewala (CLCuKoV-Bu), and a disease-specific betasatellite, cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellite (CLCuMuB). Efforts to minimize losses due to CLCuD rely mainly on the use of insecticides to kill the whitefly vector; no resistant cotton varieties are currently commercially available. The study described here has investigated RNA interference technology for its potential to yield resistance against CLCuKoV-Bu and three other begomoviruses; CLCuKoV, tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV) and Pedilanthus leaf curl virus (PeLCV). Three fragments of the virion-sense V2 gene of CLCuKoV-Bu were transformed into Nicotiana benthamiana in antisense orientation and transgenic lines expressing virus-specific short RNAs were assessed for their ability to yield resistance. Only CLCuKoV-Bu with the V2 sequence closest to the promoter was resistant. Inoculation of CLCuKoV-Bu with CLCuMuB into transgenic plants did not significantly affect the outcome, although viral DNA was detected in number of plants, suggesting that the betasatellite may impair RNAi resistance. Overall the results indicate that targeting the 5' end of V2 gene using antisense-RNA has the potential to deliver resistance against begomoviruses and that RNAi-based resistance imparts some degree of resistance to heterologous viruses.

With the increased amount of samples of H1N1 viruses and technology development, researchers have been studying how the viruses evolved. Here, we analyzed HA and NA genes of H1N1 viruses from three aspects: host distribution, geographical distribution and phylogenetic analysis. The data showed hosts were predominantly human, swine and poultry, and other hosts were mainly cat, ferret, wild bear, canine, cheetah and seal. In terms of geographical distribution, the North America and Eurasia were the main H1N1 influenza pandemic areas. Of them, the United States, China, Japan, Canada, the United Kingdom, India and Singapore were the most affected. The phylogenetic analysis of surface genes of influenza H1N1 viruses from 1918 to 2017 worldwide revealed the distribution of all avian influenza viruses (AIVs) showed a clear geographical difference, mainly concentrated in Eurasia and America. American and Eurasian swine viruses might be the ancestors of the 2009 pandemic virus' HA and NA genes. Swine influenza viruses played an important role in the spread of influenza viruses across species. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale phylogenetic analysis of HA and NA genes of influenza H1N1 viruses worldwide until now. Our findings further emphasize the importance of surveillance of the genetic diversity of influenza H1N1 viruses in different hosts and raised more concerns about the long-time monitoring.

Although some studies were done on the effect of interferon alpha (IFN-α) on BVDV, the effect of exogenous IFN against BVDV biotypes remains unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the comparative effect of exogenous human IFN-α (HuIFN-α) on different BVDV biotypes and genotypes. The results showed that exogenous HuIFN-α greatly inhibited the growth of different BVDV biotypes and genotypes. However, HuINF-α has a significant inhibitory effect on cp biotype compared to ncp one without significant variation between different genotypes. The effect of HuIFN-α on BVDV reached the maximum level at early stages of infection (0-20 h post infection) and increased in a dose-dependent manner (10-500 U/ml). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was used to evaluate the effect of exogenous HuIFN-α on RNA synthesis of both BVDV biotypes. HuIFN-α reduced RNA production of cp by 4 logs compared to only 2 logs for ncp strains. Additionally, the antiviral effect of IFN-α against both BVDV biotypes seems to be independent of the RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) activation as assayed by direct analysis of in vivo phosphorylation of eIF2-α and by 2-aminopurine (2-AP) treatment. Collectively, these results indicated that the exogenous HuIFN-α treatment has an inhibitory effect not only on cp BVDV biotype but also on the ncp BVDV. The antiviral effect of exogenous HuIFN-α was biotype, time, dose but not genotype dependent. PKR has no role in the inhibitory effect suggesting that other IFN-antiviral pathways were involved.

    "abstract": "Viruses have evolved sophisticated strategies to subvert immunity to benefit overall viral fitness.Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV, β-herpesvirus) represents a paradigm of very effective hijacking of gene functions that imitate host encoded immunomodulatory proteins.This co-evolution with the host immune system allowed for establishment of lifelong persistence.The HCMV infection is largely asymptomatic in healthy persons; however, it can induce serious disease in immunocompromised individuals.For this reason, great attention is paid to the development of therapeutics based on HCMV immunomodulatory 'tricks' as well as to the search for active vaccine against HCMV.While comparing the HCMV clinical isolates with extensively passaged laboratory strains, the unique long (UL) b' locus was commonly found to be deleted in HCMV genome while adapted to replication in human fibroblasts in vitro.This missing region, called UL/b' region, encodes up to 22 canonical genes with different functions, as of targeting cellular tropism (e.g.UL133-UL138); viral entry and assembly (e.g.UL128, UL130, UL131A); regulation of immunological synapses (e.g.UL135); inhibition of NK and T cell function (e.g.UL141, UL142, UL148, UL144), ablating activity (e.g.UL146, UL147), but mainly aimed at manipulating the host immune response.Moreover, the presence of UL/b' genomic region dramatically correlates with adverse effects in vaccinated persons, indicating that viral genes in this region play a significant role in controlling virulence.Here, we review how HCMV shapes our immunity by hijacked genes originated from UL/b' locus, discuss their impact in immunomodulation mechanism and how this knowledge may translate to clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is a retrovirus that affects primarily milky cows.Animals serologically positive to BLV show a Th1 cytokine profile with a predominance of interferon gamma (IFN-γ).IFN-γ has antiviral activity through mechanisms such as resistance to infection, inhibition of viral replication and apoptosis.The objective of this work was to determine the transcription levels of IFN-γ and its relationship with proviral load and persistent lymphocytosis in a population of Holstein cows of the province of Antioquia, Colombia.IFN-γ transcription levels were evaluated by qPCR in 140 Holstein cows.A one-way analysis of variance and a Student's t test were used to evaluate the differences between the means.The amount of IFN-γ mRNA found in BLV-positive cows was lower than in BLV-negative cows.Moreover, in the group of infected cows a lower level of IFN-γ mRNA expression was found in BLV and persistent lymphocytosis cows (BLV+PL) compared with BLV and aleukemia cows (BLV+AL).The level of IFN-γ mRNA expression was lower in cows with high proviral load (HPL) compared to cows with low proviral load (LPL).BLV infection is related to abnormal expression of IFN-γ mRNA, although IFN-γ has antiviral activity, its expression is affected by high proviral load.",

High morbidity with severe polyarthralgia, rashes and ocular, hemorrhagic and sensorineural complications are reported in the re-emerging infection (3-5). The acquisition of an A226V mutation in the envelope protein E1 has increased the transmissibility of the virus in the widely prevalent Ae. Albopictus mosquitoes (6).

The tetramer staining method was used to analyze peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from HBV-infected patients at different disease stages (chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatoma).

    "abstract": "Many human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) researchers focus on the developing new anti-reservoir therapy to eradicate HIV-1 provirus from the HIV-1-infected patients. HIV-1 provirus is the major obstacle for effective HIV-1 treatment because it integrates into the host genome and can produce a virus progeny after stopping highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We established two novel cell lines latently infected with HIV-1 by limiting dilution cloning of A3.01 cells infected with HIV-1. Analysis of the flanking sequence of HIV-1 proviral DNA integrated into chromosomal cellular DNA revealed that proviral DNA was inserted into different sites of different chromosomes in the two examined cell lines. In these lines, virus reactivation could be induced by a phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment that resulted in a marked increase of the production HIV-1 p24 antigen and appearance of the infectious virus. The novel cell lines latently infected with HIV-1 represent further tool for the study of molecular mechanisms of viral latency and development of anti-reservoir therapy of HIV-1 infection.",

    "abstract": "Influenza viruses may change their transmissibility and virulence via single or multiple point mutations in the functional regions of their structural proteins. In this study, we compared sequences of all three subunits of viral RNA polymerase, i.e. PA, PB1 and PB2, of the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus isolates from different stages of the pandemic and found that the frequencies of three mutations, including V14I and K716Q in PA and K736G in PB1, showed a similar trend. Interestingly, the death rate of infected patients during the pandemic matched the frequency of the three mutations with a 2-months delay. These findings suggest that the combined mutations may have acted synergistically in enhancing the transmissibility and/or virulence of the 2009 pandemic virus. If definitely proved, this hypothesis could guide the rational design of antiviral therapeutics targeting the RNA polymerase of influenza viruses.",

The quantity of viral RNA remained the same for 120 days at -20°C, but decreased when the samples were stored at either +4°C or +22°C.

The influenza virus sample that is to be used for RNA quantification can be stored at +4°C and freeze and thaw cycles should be avoided during transport. Our results clearly indicate that the quality and quantity of influenza virus nucleic acid depends on the chemical composition of used buffer and also that the samples can be protected from degradation even if they are not stored at ultra-low temperatures.

    "abstract": "Slovakia is a country with only 5.45 million inhabitants. However, the past two years of the COVID-19 pandemic have shown huge inter-regional differences. These were represented by different numbers of diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 cases and the vaccination rates in the regions, as well as by the willingness of the inhabitants to comply with anti-pandemic measures or to undergo testing. The occurrence of such regional disparities provided a rational basis for monitoring the epidemic situation within smaller areas, e.g. at city level. Trencin is a medium-sized Slovak county town with about 55 000 inhabitants. The city administration gave its residents the opportunity to assess their current level of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and received an additional benefit in the form of data on the real epidemic situation in the city, which helped in further management of anti-pandemic measures. The primary aim of the study, conducted in January and February 2022, was to determine the levels of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the inhabitants of Trencin. The results showed that 75% of the study participants, representing the adult population of the city, had detectable IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Noteworthy, at the time of the study, 13% of the Trencin city population who were unaware of overcoming COVID-19 had specific antibodies against the virus. Furthermore, the antibody levels in recovered unvaccinated subjects increased not only with the severity of their COVID-19 symptoms, but also after multiple recoveries from the disease. On the other hand, the severity of side effects after vaccination did not influence the antibody levels. The results of the study are in line with the current view that hybrid immunity (vaccination plus SARS-CoV-2 infection in any order) offers greater protection than immunity elicited by vaccination or COVID-19 separately.

In this study, we propose a quantitative criterion of “10% nucleotide difference” to distinguish PUUV genotypes, resulting in a subdivision of PUUV into twenty-one distinct genotypes. The application of this criterion suggested a further division of the CE, RUS, FIN and N-SCA lineages and was consistent with the current taxonomic position of the S-SCA, LAT, DAN and ALAD lineages. In addition, analysis of reassortment and recombination events showed that PUUV undergoes these processes, but they are relatively rare.

To study this problem, reverse genetics has been employed. Three reassortants, rgH9N2, rgH5N1 and rgH5N2, were prepared and compared. Their hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes originated from Chinese AIV isolates of H9N2 or H5N1 subtype, while the rest of their genes were derived from A/WSN/33(H1N1) virus (WSN). In the H5 HA reassortants, the multibasic cleavage site was converted to a monobasic one. The results demonstrated that the reassortants did not produce CPE on MDCK cells in the absence of trypsin, showed egg-adaptation phenotype and stability of HA and NA during consecutive egg passages, and were not lethal to chickens and mice. However, the rgH5N1 reassortant exhibited a residual virulence in terms of lethality to chick embryos and pathogenesis in chickens. It can be concluded that (i) the genetic modification of H5 HA attenuated the H5 reassortants, (ii) the presence of internal WSN proteins contributed to the attenuated properties of the reassortants independently on H5 HA, and (iii) also the overall genome composition contributed to virulence differences. This report provides further contribution of reverse genetics to the knowledge of virulence of influenza viruses.",

To investigate the pathogenicity of AIV, the isolate ZFE/2004 (H5N1) was used to infect chickens, mice, and pigs. The results showed that the isolate showed attributes of the highly pathogenic AIV such as high pathogenicity index (intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) of 2.85 and intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) of 3.00) and a specified hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site. In vivo experiments indicated that this isolate was highly lethal to the Balb/c mice. In addition, it was able to infect pigs, elicit specific antibodies, and cause flu-like clinical symptoms. Typical pathological changes were observed in the chickens as well. In vitro experiments showed that the isolate ZFE/2004 was able to induce apoptosis of infected MDCK cells that was detected by the DNA fragmentation analysis and electron microscopy.",

    "abstract": "Immunosuppression (ISP) affects the outcome of acute virus primoinfection as well as the course of virus latency. ISP may result from viral infection of the immune cells. This infection can be either transient, as in measles virus infection, or progressive as in Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1, 2) infections, which proceed to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Innate ISP occurs due to various congenital defects of cells, participating within immune response. In the majority of cases, ISP may be initiated by physical causes (e.g. irradiation) or by chemical substances including drugs used for post-transplantation therapeutic regimens. The hallmark of ISP is the impairment of B or T lymphocyte functions. Helper T lymphocytes produce a great variety of cytokines providing B lymphocyte proliferation and cytotoxic T cell maturation. The mature and/or activated memory cytotoxic T lymphocytes destroy the target cells, which synthesize virus-specific proteins. Since many ISP drugs hamper or downregulate the proliferation of B and T lymphocytes, their administration creates favorable conditions for the replication of reactivated DNA viruses otherwise produced in low amounts. Thus, ISP causes an extensive increase in the low-grade production of persisting virus, which might regularly occur during latency. In addition to reactivation of virus latency, ISP potentiates the replication and spread of any intercurrent infectious agent, whether bacterial, parasitic, yeast or fungal origin.",

The expressed fusion protein GnN0.7 was recognized by monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to HTNV Gn glycoprotein and N protein, respectively. Its molecular mass as determined by Western blot analysis corresponded to the predicted value. The mice immunized with insect Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells transfected with recombinant baculovirus carrying GnS0.7 gene, produced serum antibodies with titer up to 3,200 as assayed by immunofluorescence. Moreover, immunized mice showed positive proliferation index for splenocytes stimulated with HTNV Gn and N, respectively. These results indicated that insect Sf9 cells infected with the recombinant baculovirus expressed a fully biologically active fusion protein that elicited not only humoral but also cellular immune response in mice. Hence, this protein may be used as a genetically engineered subunit HTNV vaccine representing efficacious and safe alternative to traditional vaccines.",

Evaluation of the expression of RdRps was performed by the fluorescence, flow cytometry, Western blotting, and real-time PCR. We found that Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) siRNA could completely block the transcription and expression of RdRp. Additionally, Hepatitis C virus (HCV) siRNA could cause effective inhibition of RdRp, whereas Japanese encephalitis virus siRNA did not show significant repression of corresponding RdRp.

It causes serious economic losses in the global production of fruit trees belonging to the genera Prunus and Malus and can be vegetatively transmitted during propagation. In this study, an isothermal reverse transcription-recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay method was developed for detecting ACLSV in pear leaves. A set of RT-RPA primers showed high rapidity, sensitivity, and specificity in ACLSV detection. The RT-RPA assay was performed at a single, constant temperature of 42°C, could be completed in approximately 10 min, and did not exhibit cross-reactivity with other common pear viruses. This RT-RPA assay was 100-fold more sensitive than regular RT-PCR. The optimized RT-RPA assay was further used to detect ACLSV in field-collected pear samples. These advantages make RT-RPA a promising diagnostic tool for determining ACLSV infection in pear certification programs.

Study participants provided informed consent, anamnestic information, and self-collected dry blood spot samples that were analyzed by ELISA for SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific IgG antibodies. Relative antibody levels detected in 1928 subjects showed seroprevalence of 84.13% and led to the following main findings consistent with the current knowledge: (1) mRNA-based vaccines induce better humoral response compared to adenovirus vaccines, (2) antibody levels reflect severity of COVID-19 symptoms, (3) post-COVID vaccination results in marked elevation of IgG levels particularly in asymptomatic and mild cases, (4) antibody levels decrease with increasing time elapsed from vaccination or COVID-19. In addition, data sorting to distinct research institutes and their clustering to three principal scientific sections of the Slovak Academy of Sciences revealed marked differences in seroprevalence, and allowed to identify workplaces with relatively high seropositivity and response rate that can potentially provide a safer working environment than those, where seroprevalence was low or unknown due to low participation. Thus, findings of this study can have direct implications on management decisions during the next pandemic development, with the necessity to keep in mind the phenomenon of time-dependent immunity waning and current spread of more contagious Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2.

The positive effect of Isoprinosine therapy vanished after 120-150 days. After this interval, we demonstrated lower numbers of leukocytes, lower levels of VN antibodies and an increased number of atypical lymphoid monocytes in the Isoprinosine-treated group. Immunological parameters correlated with increased titers of virus in all investigated organs. Evidence of immunostimulation was demonstrated by lower incidence of tumor formation (7.5%) in the group of MHV-infected and Isoprinosine-treated mice in comparison to group without Isoprinosine treatment (17.5%). The presented results showed that Isoprinosine therapy had a positive impact on persistent infection of mice with MHV-68, but this effect was time-limited. The improvement of the investigated parameters lasted for five months only.

    "abstract": "Type I and type III interferons (IFNs) are induced by viral infection.It was concluded that these IFN species are identical in regulation and biological functions.However, these two systems diff er in the tissue expression of their receptors and their transcriptional regulation is fundamentally diff erent as well as cellular signaling pathways that drive expression of each IFN.Here, we have investigated the transcriptional profi le of endogenous IFNs aft er stimulation of cells with exogenous IFNs and subsequent infection of A549 cells with A/chicken/Germany/27 [H7N7] infl uenza virus.Both type I and type III IFNs exhibit high degree of the cross-induction.Our results show that type III IFNs (IFN-λ1, IFN-λ2 and IFN-λ3) are better inducers of CXCL10 than type I IFNs.Th e IFN-β1a and IFN-λ2 were the most potent IFNs and they highly increased the level of IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-λ, and CXCL10 mRNAs.Since type I IFNs up regulated expression of retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-1) mRNA, type III IFNs-λ down regulated expression of RIG-1 mRNA in infl uenza infected cells.IFN-α and IFN-ω induced similar amount of IFN-α, IFN-β and IFN-λ mRNA but diff er in induction of CXCL10 and RIG-1 mRNA.",

A total number of 12 pooled bursal samples were collected during 2014-2015 from broiler farms in different regions of Iran. Typical macroscopical and histopathological lesions of the bursa of Fabricius were found similar to reports by other researchers. A 474-bp part of hypervariable region of VP2 (hvVP2) was sequenced and analyzed. Ten isolates had the characteristic amino acid residues of very virulent IBD (vvIBD) viruses and the other two were identified as attenuated (vaccine) strains. The vvIBD isolates had a unique G to S mutation at position 254, compared to other Iranian vvIBD isolates. Two attenuated isolates had the mutation 253Q, not found in D78 strain, creating virulent variant of vaccine strains. Degree of similarity among the studied vvIBD isolates was relatively high (97.6-100%), proposing a common ancestor for them. However, they were partly different from previous Iranian and neighbor countries' isolates (96.2-97.3% similarity to Shiraz isolate and 95.7-96.7% to Iraq and Turkey isolates). In phylogenetic analysis, the studied vvIBD isolates classified as a separate subgroup in the group of isolates from Iran and neighbor countries. More studies on genetic and antigenic characteristics of these isolates as well as probable modifications in their pathogenicity are needed to evaluate the significance of the mentioned differences.",

The VLPs are similar to natural virus particles but lack viral nucleic acid. The objective of the present study was to express the VLPs of FMD virus (FMDV) serotype Asia-1 (IND 63/72), using baculovirus system and characterize them for antigenic structure. The VLPs expressed in insect cells showed immunoreactivity similar to inactivated cell culture FMDV. Further they possess similar sensitivity to trypsin as the inactivated cell culture FMDV, suggesting that trypsin-sensitive antigenic sites could be similarly arranged. Our findings suggest that the FMD VLPs have similar antigenic conformational feature like the wild type virus, thus supporting their utility in development of non-infectious FMD vaccines and/or diagnostic assays.",

    "abstract": "Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is one of the most common infections worldwide. Currently approved treatments of CHB include nucleoside/nucleotide analogues (NAs). However, long-term NA therapy is associated with accumulation of resistant mutations within the hepatitis B virus (HBV) polymerase gene. The incidence of naturally occurring HBV mutations leading to primary antiviral resistance has not been fully elucidated yet. The objective of present study was to detect the frequency of mutations within the HBV polymerase gene in 263 patients naïve to nucleoside/nucleotide analogues. Prevalence of HBV Pol gene mutations secondary to NA treatment in patients without pre-existing antiviral resistance mutations was also examined. Retrospective analysis showed that HBV Pol gene mutations were present in 7 out of 263 patients prior to the treatment. Mutations observed in NA-naïve CHB patients were associated only with resistance to lamivudine and adefovir. Compensatory mutations were observed as well. In the course of antiviral treatment, HBV Pol gene mutations were identified in 65 out of the remaining 256 CHB patients (25.39%), while no mutations of any type were detected in 160 patients (62.5%). The profiles of detected mutations were comparable to those observed in other studies that focused on the analysis of clinically relevant NA-resistant mutations. In conclusion, we found out that antiviral resistance mutations may pre-exist in the overall viral population present in untreated patients, although the incidence of HBV Pol gene mutations in NA-naïve CHB patients was low and reached only up to 2.66%. However, possible circulation and transmission of NAs-resistant HBV mutants in human population should be taken into account.",

In this study, cells expressing human full-length PrP (HuPrP1) and PrP-knockout (PrP0/0/1) cells were incubated with various concentrations of copper, zinc, manganese and nickel for 4 days and then were assayed for intracellular content of these metals and cell viability. The results showed that HuPrP1 cells accumulated less heavy metals than PrP0/0/1 cells when concentrations of heavy metals exceeded physiological level. In conclusion, HuPrP1 cells are more resistant to chronic overload with copper, manganese, zinc or nickel than PrP0/0/1 cells. The resistance to metals overload is caused solely by the presence of PrP, since HuPrP1 and PrP0/0/1 cells differ only in the expression of PrP. These results indicate that one of the functions of PrP can be the modulation of trace heavy metal concentrations in cells and protection of cells against heavy metals overload and subsequent oxidative stress.",

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of 18-hydroxyferruginol ( 1 ) and 18-oxoferruginol ( 2 ) isolated from Torreya nucifera (T. nucifera) against bovine G8P[7] and porcine G5P[7] rotaviruses using two different assay strategies: 1) reduction of viral infectivity by neutralizing the virus (virucidal assay) and 2) inhibition of viral replication after infection (post-treatment assay). In the post-treatment assay, compounds 1 and 2 exhibited strong anti-rotavirus activity, with 50% effective concentration values of 24.7 μM (selectivity index; SI= 2.52) and 23.2 μM (SI= 1.75) against bovine G8P[7], 21.1 μM (SI= 2.95) and 22.6 μM (SI= 1.80) against porcine G5P[7], respectively. During viral replication, the two compounds demonstrated stronger inhibition of viral RNA synthesis in the late stages (18 h) than in the early stages (6 h). Compounds 1 and 2 also inhibited the synthesis of viral proteins such as VP6, as determined by immunofluorescence assay. Thus, it appears that compounds 1 and 2 isolated from T. nucifera possess strong antiviral activity against rotaviruses, inhibit viral replication, and may be developed into potential plant-derived therapeutic candidates against rotavirus infection.",

The highest level of transformation was obtained at a voltage field strength of 12.5 kV/cm with a pulse time of 10 miliseconds. Transformation efficiency was low (0.3%) with approximately 10(5) transformants/microgram of DNA. One construct, designated pAG10, reached sufficient levels in R. quintana to be isolated by density gradient centrifugation. Analysis of this plasmid after several cycles of growth in R. quintana revealed no obvious modifications. Physical maps of Rochalimaea spp. chromosomal DNA using pulse-field electrophoresis are being developed. Digestion of R. vinsonii chromosomal DNA with NotI or SfiI resulted in three and one fragments, respectively. When R. quintana was digested in a similar manner, both NotI and SfiI produced four fragments. Double digestion of R. quintana DNA with NotI and SfiI yield seven fragments ranging in size from 11 to 925 kb. Summing the fragments indicate an approximate genome size of 2.1 x 10(6) bp for R. vinsonii and 1.7 x 10(6) bp for R. quintana chromosomal DNA.",

Two genomic regions, namely a 814 nt-long one spanning the movement protein (MP) gene and a 5'-part of the coat protein (CP) gene, and a 1426 nt-long one covering a part of the CP gene and the adjacent 3'-non-coding region (3'-NCR) were analyzed. Although no HV5-specific molecular features could be found in the two regions, marked differences were observed in the 3'-NCR. There was a 54 nt-long portion in which the sequence identity of some compared isolates was only 54.7%. Moreover, an unique one-nucleotide deletion occurred in the HV5 3'-NCR. These changes were also reflected in the predicted RNA secondary structure of this region. Particular biological behavior of GFLV HV5 isolate, namely a symptomless infection, could be related to the observed molecular differences.",

According host tests, the isolates were classified into B-host and BR-host group. The nucleotide sequences of the coat protein (CP) and helper component proteinase (HC-Pro) genes of the isolates were determined. The CP genes consisted of 864 nucleotides encoding a polypeptide of 288 amino acids. The HC-Pro genes comprised 1374 nucleotides encoding a polypeptide of 458 amino acids. The genes CP and HC-Pro of the 14 isolates shared nucleotide sequence identities ranging from 89.2 to 99.5% and 79.1 to 99.9%, respectively. Amino acid sequence identities of CP and HC-Pro proteins ranged from 95.1 to 100% and 94.8 to 99.8%, respectively. Phylogenetic tree based on the CP gene indicated that 13 of the 14 TuMV isolates belonged to the world-B group, while the remaining isolate ZJ1 belonged to the basal-BR group. The phylogenetic tree based on the HC-Pro gene was similar to that of CP gene with the exception of the isolate JX that clustered with the Asian-BR group. Our results were consistent with the previous results demonstrating that a majority of the isolates collected from Brassica spp. belonged to the world-B group.",

    "abstract": "Infectious bursal disease virus isolates obtained from southern parts of India were subjected to comparative sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of 743bp hypervariable region of VP2. The sequence analysis showed that among eight isolates, only HY12 showed the characteristic conserved amino acid residues at 256I, 294I, and 299S of vvIBDV. Six isolates BGE14, PY12, NKL14, VCN14, RPM14 and EDE14 had conserved amino acid residues at 256I and 299S, whereas at residue 294, isoleucine was substituted by valine. The remaining isolate MB11 had leucine at residue 294 and asparagine at residue 299 similar to classical strain 52/70. The serine-rich heptapeptide sequence SWSASGS adjacent to the second hydrophilic region was conserved in all seven Indian IBDV isolates except isolate MB11. Conservation of this sequence was earlier reported to be an indication of a virus isolate being pathogenic in nature. The reported heptapeptide sequence of the classical strain is 'SWSARGS'. In the present study, 'SWSARGS' heptapeptide sequence was observed in MB11 isolate. The pathogenicity trials conducted with these isolates further confirmed the genome analysis in classification. This study further reveals that the circulating IBDV strains in India could be diverse in nature.",

    "abstract": "The integrated proviral genome is the major barrier to a cure for HIV-1 infection. Genome editing technologies, such as CRISPR/Cas9, may disable or remove the HIV-1 provirus by introducing DNA double strand breaks at sequence specific sites in the viral genome. Host DNA repair by the error-prone non-homologous end joining pathway generates mutagenic insertions or deletions at the break. CRISPR/Cas9 editing has been shown to reduce replication competent viral genomes in cell culture, but only a minority of possible genome editing targets have been assayed. Currently there is no map of double strand break genetic fitness for HIV-1 to inform the choice of editing targets. However, CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing makes it possible to target double strand breaks along the length of the provirus to generate a double strand break genetic fitness map. We identified all possible HIV-1 targets with different bacterial species of CRISPR/Cas9. This library of guide RNAs was evaluated for GC content and potential off-target sites in the human genome. Complexity of the library was reduced by eliminating duplicate guide RNA targets in the HIV-1 long terminal repeats and targets in the env gene. Although the HIV-1 genome is AT-rich, the S. pyogenes CRISPR/Cas9 with the proto-spacer adjacent motif NGG offers the most HIV-1 guide RNAs. This library of HIV-1 guide RNAs may be used to generate a double strand break genetic fragility map to be further applied to any genome editing technology designed for the HIV-1 provirus.

During persistent infection, a unique strain MX of LCMV does not yield infectious virions, therefore it is not able to use a receptor for its dissemination, and spreads by cell-to-cell contacts. Virus can be transported to the neighboring cell by different cellular structures such as tunneling nanotubes or cytonemes. Using q-PCR, immunofluorescence, siRNA and western blot, we show that keratin 1 (K1) is essential for the persistent infection caused by LCMV strain MX, and its absence very effectively slows down the course of infection. In contrast, other LCMV strains, namely Clone 13 and Armstrong, which produce expression of K1, desmosomes in cells expressing K1 (42-MG-BA) but not in cells without K1 expression (NIH/3T3). We conclude that the presence of the virus enhances the K1 expression, while the presence of K1 protein potentiates the viral spread in persistently infected cells.

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), a crucial adaptor protein localized on mitochondria, plays vital roles in various biological processes. Autophagy and apoptosis are two independent and closely linked cell death pathways. But whether MAVS could induce apoptosis and autophagy in rhabdomyosarcoma cells (RD cells) and what is the relationship between autophagy and apoptosis still remains elusive. Here, we reveal that overexpression of MAVS could trigger both apoptosis and autophagy in RD cells. Interestingly, MAVS-induced apoptosis was dependent on the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway and inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. Also, it was found that inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine (3-MA) enhanced MAVS-induced apoptosis resulting in increased cleavage of caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Meanwhile, autophagy induction by rapamycin resulted in decreased MAVS-induced apoptosis. In addition, we found that MAVS expression was inhibited upon Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) infection and overexpression of MAVS could inhibit CA16 replication. Collectively, our study provides novel insights into the link between apoptosis and autophagy induced by MAVS overexpression in RD cells and gains a greater understanding of MAVS-induced antiviral functions, which provide new targets for CA16 treatment.

    "abstract": "To establish infection, a wide variety of pathogens, including viruses, have evolved a number of strategies to avoid immune elimination. Viruses have acquired and optimized molecules that interact with the host chemokine network in order to disrupt immune surveillance and defense of vertebrates, helping to promote cell entry, facilitating dissemination of infected cells, and evasion the immune response. Viral immunomodulators include ligands, chemokine receptors and chemokine-binding proteins (vCKBPs) functioning as either cell surface receptor mimics, ligand mimics, or secreted chemokine-binding proteins. vCKBPs specifically modulate chemokine gradient formation and ligand-receptor recognition when they have a potential to even completely block chemokine-mediated responses to viral infection. Members of only two virus families (Herpesviridae and Poxviridae) encode vCKBPs capable of sequestering host chemokines through either the chemokine receptor, GAG-binding pocket, or both, which may result in the inhibition of chemotaxis in vivo. Here, we focused on vCKBPs encoded by α-, β-, and γ-herpesviruses, of which several have been experimentally used as anti-inflammatory or anti-immune reagents in animal models. Current results suggest that vCKBPs could be used to regulate the activity of both chemokines and chemokine receptors for the treatment of infections such as AIDS, diseases such as arthritis, neurotrauma, inflammatory CNS disorders, atherosclerosis, transplant rejection, and metastatic spread and angiogenesis. Better understanding of vCKBPs biology will help evaluate, which human diseases related to chemokine network dysregulation might be effectively treated with these novel promising immunomodulatory drugs to enable the manipulation of chemokine functions and leukocyte trafficking.

    "abstract": "Currently, Slovakia is a rabies-free country, but the epizootiological situation of rabies was not always favorable.The main reservoir species of rabies virus in the first half of the last century was the domestic dog.Since 1906, hundreds of cases were reported, of which approximately 90% were infected dogs.The disease had a typical urban character.Since 1929, the number of rabid domestic animals decreased due to the implementation of dog vaccination campaigns in particular parts of Slovakia.From the second half of 1950s, red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) have become an important reservoir of the RABV.In this time period urban rabies in Slovakia changed into sylvatic form.One effective method of prevention and control of wildlife rabies is an oral rabies vaccination of red foxes.It is carried out in Slovakia since 1993.A detailed development of the rabies epizootiological situation on the territory of the Slovak Republic until the application of oral antirabies immunisation of foxes and the current situation after its performance is the main object of this review.",

In the present study, we showed the construction of recombinant baculovirus highly-expressing the extracellular domain of human coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor (exCAR) in High Five insect cells. The recombinant exCAR was recovered from the cell culture medium as a secreted soluble protein and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The final yield of recombinant exCAR was about 8-10 mg/l of supernatant with the purity of 96.3%. Binding activity assay showed that the recombinant exCAR exhibited an intact ability of binding to the knob domain of the adenovirus type 5 fiber protein (Ad fiber knob) displayed by T7 phage. These results showed that the recombinant human exCAR produced in insect cells and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography retained its ability to bind to the Ad fiber knob and could potentially be used in therapy of adenovirus infection.",

    "abstract": "Coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3) is believed to be a major cause of viral myocarditis, with virus-induced apoptosis playing an important role in pathogenesis. The purpose of this study was to characterize the antiviral activity of a novel fluoronucleoside analogue, N-cyclopropyl-4'-azido-2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-β-D-cytidine (NCC), against CVB3 in vitro and in vivo, and to establish whether NCC inhibits apoptosis in infected cells. In this study, HeLa cells infected with CVB3 were treated with NCC. Cell viability and apoptosis were examined. Caspase-3 and Bcl-2 levels were monitored by real-time RT PCR and Western blot analysis. For in vivo studies, BALB/c mice infected with CVB3 were treated with NCC daily. Serum markers of myocardial injury and histological studies were measured to examine myocardial injury on day 8 post-infection. To measure apoptosis, levels of Bcl-2 and caspase-3 were examined by immunohistochemistry and real-time RT-PCR. We found that NCC inhibited virus-mediated cytopathic effects in HeLa cells with an EC50 of 116.60 ± 0.32 μM. In infected mice, administration of NCC (2 mg/kg) decreased the activities of serum creatine kinase and lactic dehydrogenase, inhibited the replication of CVB3 and alleviated damage to the heart. Importantly, NCC suppressed CVB3-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells and affected the expression of apoptosis-related factors in infected mice. Together, our results demonstrate that NCC exerts significant antiviral activities against CVB3. We conclude that NCC is a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of viral myocarditis.

In our study, 43 PRRSV strains were  successfully isolated from the lungs of sick pigs, and the genetic variations of these isolates were analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the isolates belonged to PRRSV2 and that lineage 8 (8.7) subgroup III strains remained the dominant type circulating in South China. In addition, sequence alignment analysis identified many novel deletions and mutations in the Nsp2 and GP5 genes. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis showed that highly frequent recombination events of PRRSV between different lineages might occur in Guangdong Province. These results may help to elucidate the epidemiology and genetic variation of PRRSV isolates in Guangdong Province.

    "abstract": "Circulation of dominant genotype VII of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) causes significant economic losses to the poultry industry in China. Although most of genotype VII NDV has frequently been isolated in China to date, the genome sequence difference between duck-origin and chicken-origin NDVs remains largely unknown. In this study, a NDV strain of Chicken/China/HB/2017 (HB), isolated during an outbreak in China, was subjected to genetic, biological, phylogenetic and the pathogenicity characterization. The complete genome of HB strain is 15,192 nucleotides (nt) long and consisting of six genes in the order of 3'-NP-P-M-F-HN-L-5'. Several amino acid mutations were identified in the functional domains of F and HN proteins, including fusion peptide, heptad repeat region, transmembrane domains, and neutralizing epitopes. Phylogenetic analysis based on the F gene revealed that the HB strain and three other duck-origin NDV strains in China were grouped under subgenotype VII.1.1 and shared 99.1~99.2% nucleotide identity. Additionally, the challenge experiment results showed that the strain was highly pathogenic with 100% morbidity and mortality. Virus shedding was detected from 2 days post-infection until the fifth day. In conclusion, this study offers our understanding of circulating strains of NDV and genes involved in virulence and evolution between different hosts.

    "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a pathogen that infects blood cells, using CD4 molecule and two cell receptors CCR5 and CXCR4. The other major actor is gp120/gp41 viral protein complex, which interacts with receptors. Here, the presence of synonymous mutations associated with HIV-1 tropism and the related RNA secondary-structure in HIV-1 infected patients was evaluated. The analysis includes gp120-sequences from 340 HIV-1 subtype-B infected patients, all retrieved from Los Alamos database and with phenotypic HIV tropism determination based on recombinant-virus entry-assay. Frequencies of all nucleotide substitutions were calculated. Mfold and RNAfold algorithms were used to predict RNA secondary-structure of HIV-1. Nineteen codons in V2/C2, V3 and C3 domains were found to be closely related to CCR5 and CXCR4. Additionally, in X4-sequences, gp120 gca303gcu and gua222guc synonymous mutations are positively related to the gp120 S11R and T8A/I codons in V3 protein domain. Furthermore, gua222guc increases stability of the viral RNA secondary-structure. Probably, it would not be surprising if a novel escape viral strategy therapy will be related to the gp120 synonymous mutations. Moreover, in relation to the pivotal role played by gp120 in polyvalent vaccine approaches, the impact of gp120 synonymous mutations may play an important role in HIV entry into the cell.

    "abstract": "Apoptosis is a characteristic feature of a nucleopolyhedrovirus infected insect cells. This defensive strategy of the insect cells also affects the viral infectivity. On the contrary, the P35 baculovirus apoptosis inhibitor impedes the insect cell apoptosis induced by viral infection. Our previous investigation of the Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) acetylome showed that 3 lysine (K) (70, 127 and 256) sites of P35 were acetylated during infection. How these modifications affect the interaction between the insect cells and BmNPV is still unknown. In order to explore the underlying mechanism of P35 lysine acetylation, mutants with glutamine or arginine substitution were constructed to mimic the acetylated (Q) and deacetylated (R) state. ELISA and DNA fragmentation assay were used to ascertain the acetylation effects on apoptosis. Subsequently the results showed that acetylation of K70 upregulated the anti-apoptotic activity, thereby preventing apoptosis induced by insect cells. Caspase 1 activity assay further confirmed that, acetylated K70 exhibited a strong anti-apoptotic activity in cell lines infected with BmNPV. Intriguingly, an examination with the yeast 2 hybrid (Y2H) assay revealed an interaction with the silkworm caspase 1. Taken together, we demonstrated that acetylation of P35 is crucial for an interaction with caspase 1 and the upregulation of anti-apoptotic activity.

In this study, we analyzed natural selection on the 260 sequences of subtype 1 hemagglutinin (HA1) gene of H1N1 viruses isolated from humans and swine in Asia. Nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates (dN, dS) were determined for each amino acid site in the HA1 coding region. Four and two positively selected sites were identified in human and swine viruses, respectively. These sites might be involved in the change of antigenic epitopes to evade the host immune system. The results indicate that more diversifying and less purifying selection controls HA1 of human viruses compared with the swine viruses. Furthermore, thirteen sites evolving differently in human and swine viruses were identified in the HA1. These sites may play a role in the cross-species transmission. The analysis of adaptive evolution of the HA1 can provide valuable information for accelerating vaccine and drug development for prevention and treatment of influenza A (H1N1) in Asia.Influenza A virus; H1N1; hemagglutinin; positive selection; antigenic epitope.",

To avoid possible antigenic changes in field FMDV isolates during their adaptation to BHK-21 cells, a standard step used in production of conventional FMDV vaccines, the custom-made chimeric conventional or DNA vaccines, in which antigenic determinants are replaced with those of appropriate field strains, should be constructed. Using this approach, we made a plasmid-based chimeric FMDV DNA vaccine containing structural genes of serotype O in the genome backbone of serotype Asia 1, all under the control of Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) immediate early gene promoter. BHK-21 cells transfected with the chimeric DNA vaccine did not show cytopathic effect (CPE), but expressed virus-specific proteins as demonstrated by 35S-methionine labeling and immunoprecipitation. Guinea pigs immunized with the chimeric DNA vaccine produced virus-specific antibodies assayed by ELISA and virus neutralization test (VNT), respectively. The chimeric DNA vaccine showed a partial protection of guinea pigs challenged with the virulent FMDV. Although the chimeric DNA vaccine, in general, was not as effective as a conventional one, this study encourages further work towards the development of genetically engineered custom-made chimeric vaccines against FMDV.",

The latter is believed to be involved in the membrane fusion. Using a recombinant plasmid containing RUBV E1 and E2, 11 of total 20 cysteines present in the ectodomain of wild type E1 were mutated to test their role in the fusion via the formation of disulfide bridges. The recombinant plasmids containing mutated E1 (Cys2-Cys20) or wild type (wt) E1 were expressed in BHK-21 cells. Their fusogenic and hemadsorption activities in addition to a potential of cell surface expression of E1 and E2 were assayed. The results showed that the fusogenic activity was lost in all tested mutants, while the hemadsorption activity and cell surface expression potential were affected differently in individual mutants. Since only the Cys5 and Cys8 mutations led to a reduction of both hemadsorption and cell surface expression, we assume that these mutations prevented the formation of the disulfide bridge, what led to a misfolding of E1 and consequently to a failure of recognition of E1 by E2. In conclusion, the disulfide bridges disrupted in all the tested mutants appear essential for the cell fusion, while only the disulfide bridge C(5)-C(8) seems to be crucial for the transport of E1 and E2 in the cell.",

Since they up-regulate MHC class I molecules; the cell-mediated immunity may play an important role in the defense against viruses. In this work, we tested a CFSE-based assay in determining proliferative response of lymphocytes isolated from mice or monkeys previously immunized with various DENV antigens to in vitro stimulation with DENVs. A positive proliferative response was obtained with lymphocytes of animals immunized with either live DENV-2 or its recombinant proteins. A similar result was also obtained with CD8+ T cells from mice immunized with live DENV-1 or DENV-2 following stimulation with homologous viruses. A comparison of the carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-based and a 3H-thymidine incorporation-based assays of proliferative response of total lymphocytes showed a fair correlation of results of both assays. However, the CSFE-based assay offers in addition the determination of contribution of the CD8+ or other subsets of T cells to total proliferative response. These results represent the first and successful application of a CFSE-based assay to the evaluation of cell-mediated immunity to DENVs. This assay might be also exploited in testing candidate DENV vaccines.",

Although Ethiopia is a major sugarcane producer, and virus-like symptoms are frequently observed in sugarcane fields, there is a complete lack of information as to the occurrence, distribution and molecular properties of SCBV. This study was aimed to identify and characterize SCBV isolates in Ethiopia using molecular methods. Out of 292 leaf samples collected and tested by PCR, 76 samples (26% incidence level) were found SCBV-positive. Nucleotide sequence analysis results showed that three Ethiopian isolates (SCBV-EtS3, SCBV-EtS6 and SCBV-EtC10) shared high level of nucleotide identity (99.5-100%) among themselves and with SCBV isolates from China (accession numbers MH037614 and MH037915). Another isolate, SCBV-EtC2, shared maximum identity of 78% with the other three SCBV isolates from Ethiopia and 99.8% with SCBV isolates from China (KM214357 and KM214307). Based on phylogenetic analysis, isolates from Ethiopia were segregated into two different clusters. Isolates SCBV-EtS3, SCBV-EtS6 and SCBV-EtC10 clustered with SCBV-Q group and SCBV-EtC2 with SCBV-H group. This study provides information on the occurrence of SCBV for the first time in Ethiopia and also contributes to the understanding of the genetic diversity of SCBV.

These animals were multiple vaccinated with the above vaccine during previous years. The study was conducted to determine the actual status of the protective antibodies generated after vaccination. Initially, the serum samples were tested by Liquid phase blocking ELISA (LPBE), and only samples with titer more than 1.4 in LPBE were chosen for further analysis. These samples were tested with an in-house Gold Nanoparticle-based test for detection of anti-FMDV structural protein antibodies, in which the antibodies were detected at 10-4 dilution; this was suggestive of strong antibody titer generated post-vaccination. To test the binding affinity of these antibodies with the antigen, an avidity ELISA was developed and outcomes were expressed in terms of avidity index (AI). It was found that the avidity was low in some of the animals even after multiple vaccinations. Therefore, multiple vaccinations and strong antibody titer generation may not be the actual indicator of the protective immune response generated. We conclude that avidity ELISA can be a better approach than LPBE to measure the level of protective antibodies generated post-vaccination.

For rapid identification of sweepoviruses, we developed a technique based on isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification in conjunction with lateral flow dipsticks (RPA-LFD). The optimum reaction conditions for the RPA were 20 min incubation at 37°C. The RPA-LFD specifically detected distinct sweepovirus species, with no other viruses infecting sweet potato causing a cross-reaction. The detection limit of the RPA-LFD was 1.0×104 copies of the target DNA molecule per reaction, and it exhibited a 10-fold greater sensitivity than the conventional PCR. Furthermore, when coupled with an alkaline polyethylene glycol-based crude genomic DNA extraction, the entire procedure was completed in 30 min without the use of any special instruments other than a water bath. Therefore, the RPA-LFD technique is a potential sweepovirus diagnostic tool that can be used in the field with fewer available resources.

An analysis of the essence of the oncogene position effect from this standpoint shows that an integration, similar in its mechanism but differing in polarity, of the genome of other viruses with the cell genome should lead to the formation of a corresponding antiviral stable (life-long) immunity or also to the emergence of pseudoautoimmune disease of the type caused by slow viruses.",

The obtained nucleotide sequences were compared with those of twenty other IBDV isolates/strains. Phylogenetic analysis based on this comparison revealed that NP1SSH and NP2K clustered with very virulent (vv) IBDV strains of serotype 1.

In this study, to assess the possibility of an epidemic of poliomyelitis caused by a VSLP in Japan under the current vaccination policy of administration of live attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), we determined titers of serum neutralizing antibodies to poliovirus 1 (PV-1) strains Sabin (vaccine strain), Mahoney (wild-type strain) and G4-12 (VSLP) in various groups of residents of Toyama Prefecture, Japan. The seropositivity and geometric mean neutralizing antibody titers against these strains in the individuals who obtained two doses of OPV were 99.1%, 94.5% and 95.5%, respectively, and 564, 186 and 194, respectively. Although the antibody titers to G4-12 were lower compared with those to Sabin, these results indicate that the OPV vaccination policy in Japan has been effective in preventing poliomyelitis caused by VSLPs. These results also suggest that (i) an epidemic of poliomyelitis caused by a VSLP has not occurred in Japan due to herd immunity, and (ii) the possibility of reemergence of VSLPs will be prevented if sufficient herd immunity is acquired immediately after completion of the OPV vaccination in accordance with the poliomyelitis eradication program.",

The sensitivity of IBV and NDV RT-PCR was 10(3.7) and 10(3.0) EID50, respectively. Although a multiplex RT-PCR could detect and differentiate NDV and IBV genomes present in the same sample, there was a slight inhibition of the IBV PCR if a high amount of NDV genome was present in the sample. To overcome this problem a separate PCR for each virus was used to assess the interaction between vaccine IBV and NDV either inoculated singly or together into chickens. In the group vaccinated with the Newcastle disease (ND) vaccine alone, the viral genome was detected on days 2, 4 and 7 post vaccination (p.v.), while in the chickens given the infectious bronchitis (IB) vaccine alone, the viral genome was detected only on day 4 p.v. In the group inoculated with both vaccine viruses there was a 10(3)-fold reduction in the cDNA dilution factor on day 4 p.v. for both IBV and NDV genomes. This demonstrated clearly that when both these vaccines are administered there is a transient reduction in the replication of both viruses, probably due to their competition for the same target epithelial cells in the respiratory tract.",

Later on, MHV-68 infection was detected in D. reticulatus and Haemaphysalis concinna ticks collected on vegetation, which supported the idea that ticks can acquire the virus from feeding on infected hosts. Here, we report MHV-68 infection, which was detected by nested PCR, in D. reticulatus and I. ricinus adult ticks and I. ricinus nymphs collected in five geographically isolated localities, in west, southwest, south and central Slovakia. Viral incidence in ticks was 46.7% (121/259) without considering the season, site of collection and tick species and their life stage. MHV-68 infection was detected in all five localities investigated and in both tick species. Here, for the first time, we report MHV-68 infection in I. ricinus nymphs collected from the vegetation. The finding of virus in ticks from five separated localities suggested that ticks became infected with MHV-68 via feeding on infected rodents; thus, this virus might be a newfound natural pathogen in ticks.",

    "abstract": "The pumpkin leaf curl disease is an emerging disease of pumpkin in Assam, India. Symptomatic pumpkin leaf samples from different locations were immunologically tested using Begomovirus specific antibody. PCR with the ELISA-positive samples, using Geminivirus universal primers amplified 1.4 kb virus-specific fragments. Sequence of these amplicons showed around 95% identity with squash leaf curl China virus-[Pumpkin: Varanasi] (SLCCV-Pumpkin: Varanasi EU573715). To investigate the possible functions of the viral proteins present in the fragment, the full-length C2 and C3 genes were conceptually translated and were subjected to in silico proteomic analyses. The phylogenetic analysis of both the proteins divulged the relationship of our isolate with related viruses and isolates. Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of the proteins revealed the presence of the known viral conserved motifs, viz., zinc-finger (ZNF) motif [36CXCX(7)CX(6)H53], the arginine-rich nuclear localization signal (NLS) motif (28RRRR31) as well as the minimal activation domain in C2 protein. In the C3 protein, the 91LKYLD95 and the replication enhancer motif (30YFK32) were found to be conserved. Finally, 3-D models of the two proteins were predicted via ab initio approach and subsequently, the models were validated. To our knowledge, this study is a pioneering attempt to construct the ab initio 3-D models of two begomoviral proteins taking a SLCCV isolate as a model.

Considering the poor immunogenicity of the epitope in humans and significant diversity in the global distribution of HCV genotypes, the aim of this study was to construct an anti-HCV phage library by using a series of optimal strategies to screen novel broadly neutralizing antibodies from Chinese donors. mRNA was isolated from peripheral blood samples of 39 patients who were anti-HCV positive. A phage library was constructed by inserting a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) gene repertoire into the T7Select10-3b vector. A synthetic peptide representing the HCV E2 N-terminal 412-423 region was used as \"bait\" for bio-panning. The binding affinities of phage clones to the synthetic peptide were evaluated through peptide-ELISA. Two scFv clones (R3-19 and R4-85) showing the strongest binding affinities were selected. The complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of these clones were aligned with those of other previously reported broadly neutralizing anti-HCV antibodies, and multiple conserved amino acid sites were found. The optimized procedures ensured that two novel scFv antibodies were isolated from a constructed phage library and showed specific binding to the poorly immunogenic HCV E2 412-423 linear epitope.

It is therefore imperative to understand the molecular mechanism enabling this virus to jump from avian to mammalian species. In this study, two H9N2 influenza viruses were isolated from the same region in eastern China but from different hosts; one was isolated from mink and named A/Mink/Shandong/WM01/2014(H9N2)(WM01), while the other was isolated from chicken and named A/Chicken/Shandong/LX830/2014(H9N2)(LX830). Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis showed that both H9N2 influenza viruses had similar genetic backgrounds. The results of infection in minks suggested that both viruses caused significant weight loss and pathological changes in the lungs. Mouse infection showed that LX830 was nonpathogenic in mice, but WM01 resulted in 25% mortality and pathological changes in the lungs, such as severe edema and diffused inflammation of the interalveolar septa. Comparison of the full genomes of both H9N2 influenza viruses showed 52-nucleotide-synonym mutations in 8 gene segments and 7-nucleotide-antonym mutations, resulting in 7 amino acid (AA) substitutions distributed in the PB1, PA, NA and M gene segments. None of these mutations did affect splicing of the M and NS gene segments at the nucleotide level or minor open reading frames (ORFs), such as PB1-F2 and PA-X.

We describe different mouse models used for studying the diseases caused by coxsackieviruses and the immune responses in different mouse models. We then shortly elucidate experiences from our laboratory related to the oral route of infection, and compare the similarities and differences we found in this model. Keywords: pathogenesis; coxsackievirus; murine models.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are multitasking organelles that play a central role in energy production, survival and primary host defense against viral infections.Therefore, viruses target mitochondria dynamics and functions to benefit their replication and morphogenetic processes.we endeavor to understand the role of mitochondria during infection of ectromelia virus (ecTV), hence our investigations on mitochondria-related genes in non-immune (L929 fibroblasts) and immune (rAw 264.7 macrophages) cells.our results show that during later stages of infection, ecTV significantly decreases the expression of mitochondria-related genes regulating many aspects of mitochondrial physiology and functions, including mitochondrial transport, small molecule transport, membrane polarization and potential, targeting proteins to mitochondria, inner membrane translocation, and apoptosis.Such down-regulation is cell-specific, since macrophages exhibited a more profound down-regulation of mitochondria-related genes compared to infected L929 fibroblasts.only L929 cells exhibited up-regulation of two important genes responsible for oxidative phosphorylation and subsequent ATP production: Slc25a23 and Slc25a31.changes in the expression of mitochondria-related genes are accompanied by altered mitochondria morphology and distribution in both types of cells. in depth ingenuity Pathway Analysis (iPA) identified the \"Sirtuin Signaling Pathway\" as the most significant top canonical pathway associated with ecTV infection in both analyzed cell types.Taken together, down-regulation of mitochondria-related genes observed especially in macrophages indicates dysfunctional mitochondria, possibly contributing to energy collapse and induction of intrinsic pathway of apoptosis.Meanwhile, alteration of the expression of several mitochondria-related genes in fibroblasts without apoptosis induction may represent poxviral strategy to control cellular energy metabolism for efficient replication.",

    "abstract": "Sialic acids (SA) usually linked to galactose (Gal) in an α2,6- or α2,3-configuration are considered the main cell receptors for influenza viruses, in particular for their hemagglutinins (HA). The typing of influenza virus HA receptor selectivity is relevant for understanding the transmissibility of avian and swine viruses to the human population. In this study we developed a simple and inexpensive gel-capture assay (GCA) of the influenza virus HA receptor-binding selectivity. Its principle is the binding of soluble influenza virus to pentasaccharide analogs, representatives of receptors of human and avian influenza viruses, immobilized on a gel resin. The human and avian analogs consisted of a sialyllactose-N-tetraose c (LSTc) [Neu5Ac(α2,6)Gal(β1-3)GlcNAc(β1-3)Gal(β1-4)Glc] and a sialyllactose-N-tetraose a (LSTa) [Neu5Ac(α2,3)Gal(β1-3)GlcNAc(β1-3)Gal(β1-4)Glc], respectively. Following equilibration, the unbound virus is washed away and the bound one is assayed via HA by densitometry as a function of the analog concentration. Using GCA, the receptor selectivity of three influenza viruses of different HA subtype was investigated. The results showed that the egg-adapted A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus exhibited an avian α2,3-linked LSTa selectivity, however, it retained the ability to bind to the α2,6-linked LSTc human receptor analog. Influenza B virus B/Florida/4/2006 showed α2,6-linked LSTc selectivity and a poor α2,3-linked LSTa avidity. The H3N2 virus A/Wisconsin/15/2009 displayed almost comparable avidity for both receptor analogs with a marginally greater α2,3-linked LSTa avidity. The described assay protocol provides a simple and rapid method for the characterization of influenza virus HA receptor binding selectivity.",

In this study, the sequence, predicted 3D-structure and subcellular localization of UB homologs encoded by two different nucleopolyhedroviruses of Bombyx mori (BmNPV) and Helicoverpa armigera (HaNPV) were compared. UBs of BmNPV and HaNPV (Bm-UB, Ha-UB, respectively) shared only 73% of sequence identity of the different aa in relation to Hu-UB being localized in non-conserved parts, namely in two heterogeneous regions of aa 15-32 and aa 53-60. Interestingly, Bm-UB and Ha-UB share the same seven lysines except for an additional Lys54 in Bm-UB. However, in spite of the sequence heterogeneity, Bm-UB and Ha-UB have a similar predicted 3D-structure. A difference in their subcellular localization during virus growth in insect cell lines was found in the late stage of formation of occlusion-derived virus (ODV). In particular Bm-UB was localized mainly and evenly in the nucleus, while Ha-UB on the nuclear membrane. These data suggest that (i) UBs, besides being engaged in various cellular processes, have a role in specific processes of virus growth, and (ii) Bm-UB and Ha-UB may show certain different activities associated with the virus growth.",

    "abstract": "Rotavirus infection is the most frequent cause of infantile gastroenteritis worldwide and a signifi cant cause of death in infants and young children, following severe diarrhea and dehydration.Rotavirus vaccines are considered the most eff ective way to prevent rotavirus infections.In the process of developing rotavirus vaccines, it is crucial to establish a reliable and standardized method to determine vaccine titer.In this study, we developed an indirect immunofl uorescence assay (IFA) to determine the infectious titer of Lanzhou lamb rotavirus (LLR) vaccine grown in MA104 cells.Th e activating concentration of trypsin was 1 μg/ml for healthy monolayers of MA104 cells at 100% confl uence.Aft er incubation for 18 hr, a rabbit anti-SA11 polyclonal antibody, diluted at 1:800 in PBS, was added to all wells, followed by an Alexa-488-conjugated secondary antibody diluted at 1:500 in PBS.Cells were examined with a fl uorescence microscope.Our results show that IFA was more reproducible, more sensitive, simpler, and more rapid than the log 50% cell culture infectious dose-ELISA (lgCCID 50 -ELISA) in measuring the rotavirus vaccines.IFA provided a reliable basis for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of rotavirus, and the certifi cation of rotavirus vaccine production.",

    "abstract": "The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) tegument protein VP22 encoded by the UL49 gene is essential for HSV-1 infection. However, its precise functions in the virus life cycle are unknown. A relatively important tool for disclosing these functions is an antiserum specifically detecting VP22 in the infected cell. To this end, a recombinant truncated VP22 protein consisting of C-terminal 45 aa fused to EYFP (enhanced yellow fluorescent protein) and His-tag was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified by the Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography, and used for the preparation of antiserum in rabbits. Western blot and immunofluorescence assay showed that this antiserum specifically detected purified truncated VP22 as well as full-length VP22 in the HSV-1 infected cells. These results indicate that the prepared antiserum could serve as a valuable tool for further studies of VP22 functions.",

However, the mechanism of this selective oncolytic activity is so far unclear. In this study, using the phage display screening we identified the cellular protein binding to HSV-1 mutant (mtHSV) as (Ras guanyl releasing protein 2) Rasgrp2 which regulates the Ras signaling pathway. Rasgrp2 was found to bind directly to purified mtHSV as well as to mtHSV present within infected HeLa cells where it aggregated on the cell membrane. NIH3T3 cells were found nonpermissive to mtHSV but they became permissive following transformation with the Rasgrp2 gene. This effect was linked to the activation of the Ras-PKR signaling pathway. These observations indicate a key role of Rasgrp2 in the mtHSV infection of NIH3T3 cells and are important for the potential use of mtHSV in cancer therapy.",

The CLC main workbench was used to generate genotype-specific consensus sequence, global consensus sequence and a representative phylogenetic tree from non-structural 4 B (NS4B) protein sequences of seven different HCV genotypes reported from all over the world. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of NS4B protein especially the residues involved in interaction with ER membrane were found to be highly conserved. Other residues found to be highly conserved across all HCV genotypes included; 5 aromatic residues of N-terminal domain (NTD) (F49, W50, W55, F57, and Y63), 3 hydrophobic leucine residues (L237, L240, L245), and 2 positively charged residues of CTD (R248 and H250), dimerization motif of transmembrane domain 3 (TMD3) (G143YGAG147) and its surrounding residues (F118 and F155) and TMD1 Ser/Thr cluster residues (T87, S88 and T95) involved in the hydrogen (H) bond interactions. In short, amino acids of NTD, TMD and CTD domains involved in the membrane association/anchoring of NS4B and formation of membranous web are highly conserved and can serve as potential targets for antivirals and peptide vaccines. These conserved residues formed the basis for the development of five short peptides proposed to serve as potential therapeutic target. The phylogenetic analysis was particularly interesting for NS4B sequences of 3a Pakistani isolates. The high degree of variability prevented the clustering of Pakistani isolates with other sequences in phylogenetic tree, revealing geographical disparity.",

It is a 30-36 kDa type II transmembrane protein, expression of which is induced by type I interferon. Mouse tetherin inhibits nascent cell-free particle release. However, it is unclear whether mouse tetherin restricts cell-to-cell spread of moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV) or whether is the mouse tetherin involved in syncytium formation. To examine cell-to-cell spread and syncytium formation of Mo-MLV in the presence or absence of mouse tetherin, R peptide (the cytoplasmic tail of the transmembrane protein (TM); 16 amino acids) truncated Env expressing vector was constructed. It contained enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in the proline rich region (PRR) of Env. This R(-)Env full-length molecular clone could rule out virus-cell transmission due to the slightly reduced R(-)Env protein incorporation into the viral particles. When NIH3T3 cells stably expressing mouse tetherin were transfected with R(-)Env full-length molecular clone, syncytium formation was significantly enhanced in the tetherin-expressing cells. These data suggest that tetherin-mediated retention of R-defective virions on the cell surface could enhance syncytium formation. In addition, we found that the R(-)Env full-length molecular clone containing EGFP in the PRR of Env to be a useful tool allowing fast and convenient detection of syncytia by fluorescence microscopy.",

Prepared cell lines originated from the Nagasaki mice (PrP0/0) and showed a fibroblast phenotype. The expression level of human prion protein in the developed cell lines was comparable to the physiological expression measured in GT1-7 cells. A great advantage of the prepared cell lines was their short doubling time that allowed obtaining of a large amount of cells for the proteomic experiments. Newly established cell lines open a broad spectrum of applications in the prion research. Besides the study of physiological function of the prion protein or its interactome, the new cell lines could be successfully employed as a unique tool for the better understanding of key events in the pathogenesis of prion diseases.",

In this study, the immune responses of mice to prime-boost vaccination with the recombinant DNA (rDNA) and recombinant Fowlpox virus (rFPV) both expressing HIV-2 Gag-gp105 chimeric protein, were compared to those elicited by each vector alone. Mice primed with the rDNA and boosted with the rFPV showed HIV-2-specific antibody levels, splenic CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocyte numbers, and Gag-gp105-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) activity increased by 20-30% as compared with those elicited by these vaccines alone. These findings suggested that the prime-boost strategy combining rDNA and rFPV elicited significant Gag-gp105 - specific cellular and humoral immune responses, thus supporting this novel approach to the immunization against HIV infections.",

Black mice respond to inoculation with asymptomatic infection with no microscopically detectable rickettsiae. The infection is accompanied in either case by immunological response and persistence of the agent in mice.

As hepatitis B (HB) represents a worldwide health problem, we attempted to develop a fast and easy approach to generation and screening of specific siRNA-targeted HB virus (HBV) genes. Using PCR amplification, specific siRNA expression cassettes (SECs) were developed and used to generate effective siRNAs against HB virus (HBV) replication and gene expression in mammalian cells. After screening, we identified two SECs that expressed siRNAs which efficiently decreased the level of HBV pre-c/c gene expression in transfected Bel-7402 cells by 81.9% and 87.3%, respectively. In addition, the level of HBV DNA was decreased by 83.5% and 85.2% in HepG2 2.2.15 cells, respectively. This study provides (i) a new effective application of RNA interference to study viral gene function and viral replication and (ii) a new tool for the prevention and treatment of human HBV infection.",

    "abstract": "Liver cancer is the 5th most common cancer caused mainly due to the late detection of hepatitis. Therefore, the early detection of hepatitis through genetic markers boosts effective and remedial management. In addition, to determine the occurrence of hepatitis C virus (HCV), genotyping is indispensable as majority of hepatitis cases remain undiagnosed. The current study was designed to find the gene expression of proteases and proteases inhibitors in different hepatitis patients and to determine HCV genotypes mainly focusing on untypeable genotypes of HCV in Abbottabad, Pakistan. PCR was conducted to find the expression of proteases and protease inhibitors genes in hepatitis patients and healthy individuals. HCV genotyping was done by PCR based method and untypeable genotypes were sequenced and verified using online tools. Controlled individuals showed normal expression of cystatin C and leptin, low expression of cathepsin B while high expression of other studied genes including cathepsin D and G, TPP1 and serpin B1 could be seen. Hepatitis A patients showed high expression of leptin while other genes showed low expression. Hepatitis B patients revealed considerable variations in the cathepsin and cystatin C gene expression. Therefore, low cystatin C (high cathepsin B) and/or high cystatin C (low cathepsin B) levels can be regarded as a potential marker for hepatitis B. Hepatitis C infected patients showed high gene expression of cystatin C and leptin, so they could be useful markers for the diagnostics and prediction of the severity of HCV infections. While genotyping findings showed that about 45% of total PCR positive samples (110) were found to be of 3a genotype followed by 3b in 18%, 1a in 13.6% and 1b in 10%. About 9% of infections turned out to be mixed infections, whereas only 4.5% were untraceable by our genotyping system. Sequencing of untypeable genotypes and applying online tools revealed that the described untypeable genotypes of HCV were in fact variants of 3a genotype. Furthermore, full length characterization of these variants could help to classify them into types and subtypes.

Of the two MAbs that cross-reacted with West Nile virus (WNV) and histones, the first one (NHA-1) neutralized JEV, while the second one was non-neutralizing. NHA-1 MAb given intraperitoneally (i.p.) 1 day before virus infection induced early death by about 2 days in comparison to controls, whereas mice administered HAI-positive anti-gpE JEV specific MAbs (Hs-1 or Hs-4) were invariably protected. In contrast, MAb NHA-2 failed to produce any effect in mice. Since the similar virus titers were recorded in the brains of experimental and control infected mice, the present results indicated a modification of the biological activity of JEV by the pre-existing MAb NHA-1 that might be leading to an early death of mice.Japanese encephalitis virus; neutralizing cross-reactive monoclonal antibody.",

Phylogenetic analyses of these isolates together with those available in the GenBank revealed two evolutionary divergent lineages, designated GFLV-G and GFLV-Ir that reflect origin of the isolates. Analysis of the genetic variability in the coat protein of these isolates revealed 37 genotype groups in GFLV population. Analyses indicate that GFLV-G and GFLV-Ir clades are significantly differentiated populations of GFLV. Also, geographical subpopulations of the virus in Iran were completely distinct from each other. Examination of nonsynonymous/synonymous nucleotide diversity showed that the CP gene has been under purifying selection. The neutrality tests indicate balancing selection operating within isolates of the northwest of Iran and purifying selection within the other populations.",

Previous studies suggest that the TGEV non-structural protein 7 (nsp7) plays an important role in the viral assembly process. However, the subcellular localization and other functions of the TGEV nsp7 protein are still unclear. In this study we have examined the subcellular localization and other functions of TGEV nsp7 protein through analysis of its effects on cell growth, cell cycle progression, interleukin 8 (IL-8) expression, and NF-κB activation. Our results showed that the nsp7 protein is localized in the cytoplasm and has no effect on intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) growth, cell cycle, and cyclin A expression. Further studies showed that TGEV nsp7 protein had no effect on GRP78 expression, could not induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activate NF-κB activity. Interestingly, the IECs expressing nsp7 protein secreted lower levels of IL-8 than control cells. This is the first report to demonstrate the subcellular localization and novel functions of TGEV nsp7 protein. These findings provide novel information about the function of the poorly characterized TGEV non-structural protein 7.",

HBV therapeutic vaccines targeting HBV e antigen (HBeAg) may have an excellent effect in overcoming HBV immune tolerance. Thus, there is urgency for designing therapeutic vaccine candidates that target HBeAg. In this research, we fused the C (472-507) gene sequence of HBV with the extracellular domain of human CD40 ligand sequence and ligated this fused sequence into the pEGFP-N1 vector to construct the recombinant plasmid pEGFP-N1-C (472-507)-ecdCD40L. Then, the dendritic cells (DCs) generated from human peripheral blood were transfected with this recombinant plasmid. After this, the phenotype and function of DCs were assessed. Compared with the three control groups of pEGFP-N1-C (472-507), pEGFP-N1 and phosphate buffered saline (PBS), we found that DCs transfected with the recombinant plasmid pEGFP-N1-C (472-507)-ecdCD40L enhanced the expression of costimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86 and HLA-DR) and secretion of cytokine IL-12p70. Furthermore, the capacity of inducing the proliferation of allogeneic lymphocytes was also improved. Our study validated that transfecting DCs with recombinant plasmid pEGFP-N1-C (472-507)-ecdCD40L could activate DCs and enhance their functions. Therefore, C (472-507)-ecdCD40L fusion sequence may be a promising vaccine candidate for chronic hepatitis B therapythat targets HBeAg.",

Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified VSV grown in medium containing pyruvate and DOG revealed the presence of two peaks in the region of the virus G protein.

Compared with PR8 infection, BJ501 induced a more rapid increase of virus-specific IgA and IgG antibodies in the nasal lavage fluid and a higher ratio of IgG1/IgG2a, indicating a stronger Th2 response to BJ501 in mucosal immunity. In addition, using virus-specific enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISpot assay), we observed higher and earlier responses of virus-specific IgA and IgG antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) and IFN-γ and IL-4 cytokine-secreting cells (CSCs) in NALTs of mice intranasally infected with BJ501 virus. In particular, the frequency of BJ501-specific IFN-γ-CSCs significantly correlated with the kinetics of BJ501 virus load in NALTs, suggesting an important role of IFN-γ-CSCs-associated mucosal cellular immune responses in BJ501 virus clearance.

During entry of some of the viruses PDI participates in thiol-disulfide exchange. Previous reports show that rotavirus entry is interfered by impermeant thiol/disulfide exchange inhibitors and antibodies against PDI. Our objective was to assess the interaction between PDI and triple-layered particles (TLPs) from rotavirus strains ECwt and RRV and from a human rotavirus isolate (HI) during the early steps of virus entry in a system of isolated small intestinal villi. Purified soluble PDI was incubated with either isolated intestinal villi or cell membrane-enriched fractions in the presence or absence of thiol/disulfide inhibitors such as bacitracin, DTNB or N- ethylmaleimide followed by the assessment of the PDI interactions with TLPs and rotavirus structural proteins in terms of their redox state changes. Soluble and membrane-bound PDI was found to interact with TLPs from all the rotaviruses assayed and also with the isolated structural proteins represented by the recombinant rVP5* (a tryptic cleavage product of VP4), rVP6 and the native VP7. PDI interaction with TLPs and rotavirus structural proteins was decreased by the presence of thiol/disulfide exchange inhibitors. Interactions of cell membrane-enriched fractions with TLPs produced rearrangements in the disulfide bridges of rotavirus structural proteins. We conclude that PDI interacts with rotavirus virions through redox reactions that could facilitate the rotavirus entry into the host cell.

However, its characteristics and function are still unclear. In this study, the transcription and expression of ADRV-1R were investigated in Chinese giant salamander thymus cells (GSTCs). ADRV-1R transcription starts 6 hours post-infection (hpi), while the protein expression starts 8 hpi. Drug inhibition assay showed that the transcripts are inhibited by cycloheximide (CHX), a de novo protein synthesis inhibitor, indicating that ADRV-1R is a viral delayed-early (DE) gene. Subcellular localization showed that ADRV-1R is distributed in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm. The effect of ADRV-1R overexpression on cell proliferation and virus titer was analyzed. ADRV-1R overexpression significantly promoted the cell proliferation starting at day 2. Flow cytometry analysis further indicated that the protein promotes the GSTC cell cycle progression from G1 phase into S phase (G1/S transition). Moreover, ADRV-1R overexperession significantly increased ADRV titer in GSTCs. The virus titer was 6.3-6.9-fold higher at 36 hpi and further after than the control GSTC lines. These data showed that ADRV-1R is a delayed-early protein promoting cell proliferation and virus titers.

    "abstract": "hand, foot, and mouth disease (hFMD) is a common pediatric disease, whose outcome depends of the enterovirus genotype infecting the patient.The present study is focused on the potential diagnostic value and the role of circulating microRNA-494 (miR-494) in enterovirus 71-induced more severe form of hFMD.We included 102 children with enterovirus 71 (EV71)-induced hFMD, 42 coxsackievirus A16 (CA16)-induced hFMD and 102 healthy controls.The plasma and serum samples were collected.The expression level of circulating miR-494 was determined by RT-PCR method.Moreover, RoC curve has been drawn to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of circulating miR-494 for the diagnosis of EV71induced hFMD.Furthermore, the correlation between the circulating miR-494 and the levels of interleukin 6 (iL-6), interleukin 4 (iL-4) and interferon γ (iFN-γ) in the serum of patients were analyzed.Circulating miR-494 was significantly increased in plasma of children with EV71-induced hFMD compared with the healthy children or CA16-induced hFMD, and level of miR-494 in the EV71 severe group was significantly higher than the EV71 mild group.Moreover, results of RoC analysis suggested that miR-494 is a sensitive biomarker to distinguish EV71 patients from healthy controls and CA16 patients.Furthermore, iL-6 and iFN-γ were elevated in serum of patients with EV71-induced hFMD and the level of circulating miR-494 in patients with EV71-induced hFMD was positively correlated with the serum levels of both iL-6 and iFN-γ, respectively.Circulating miR-494 was abnormally up-regulated in plasma of the children with EV71-induced hFMD, and miR-494 may serve as potential biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of the disease.",

These are of particular concern as evident from the recent global pandemic due to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The genus Ebolavirus belongs to the Filoviridae family and its members are known to cause the Ebola virus disease (EVD), a highly contagious disease with a mortality rate of approximately 90%. The similarity of the clinical symptoms to those of various tropical ailments poses a high risk of misdiagnosis. Diagnostic strategies currently utilized include real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, amongst others. No specific treatment exists at present, and the management of patients is aimed at the treatment of complications augmented with supportive clinical care. The recent outbreak of EVD in West Africa, which began in 2014, led to accelerated development of vaccines and treatment. In this review, we contemplate the origin of the ebolaviruses, discuss the clinical aspects and treatment of the disease, depict the current diagnostic strategies of the virus, as well discuss its pathogenesis.

The amplicons were cloned from six grapevine cultivars, and colony polymerase chain reaction (colony PCR) using recombination bacteria was subsequently analyzed by RFLP and SSCP. Four haplotypes of SSCP and six haplotypes of Sac I RFLPs were defined. The two methods had a 40% discrepancy rate in showing the degree of diversity. All clones were sequenced and were used to construct a phylogenetic tree with seven previously reported GRSPaV sequences. In the tree, all the newly acquired sequences were divided into three clusters, I, II, and III, which corresponded to haplotypes I, II, and III of SSCP, respectively. Haplotype IV of SSCP was grouped into cluster II. A recombination analysis showed that haplotype IV has undergone a recombination event. Together, these results indicate that the SSCP assay is useful for the rapid identification of genetic diversity of GRSPaV. This is the first report of an analysis of the large fragment of GRSPaV by colony PCR-SSCP.

The predominant enterovirus types associated with HFMD are EVA71, CVA16, CVA6 and CVA10. Four enterovirus types were classified into subtypes based on VP1 sequences. However, the phylogenetics of these enteroviruses is rarely concerned at the genomic level. In this study, we performed the phylogenetic analyses of the EVA71, CVA16, CVA6 and CVA10 using available full-length genomic sequences. We found that the topologies of phylogenetic trees of full-length genomic sequences and VP1 sequences were almost consistent, except few subtypes of EVA71 and CVA10. The mean genetic divergence was 15.8-27% between subtypes and less than 12% within subtypes/sub-subtypes at genomic level. Comparison of phylogenetic topologies between genomic and VP1 sequences helped us to identify two new EVA71 inter-subtype recombinants RF01_CC4 and RF02_CC4. Furthermore, EVA71 subtypes C1 and C2 and CVA10 subtype D were found to originate through inter-subtype recombination. The genomic reference sequences of these enteroviruses are provided here for subtyping. The results provide important insights into the understanding of the evolution and epidemiology of the four enteroviruses.

    "abstract": "Late expression factor 4 (LEF4), RNA polymerase subunit of Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV), plays an enzymatic role to enhance the capping of pre-mRNA of late and very late genes. Lysine acetylation is a post-translational modification process having many important functions associated with the regulation of a gene expression. Our previous study on lysine acetylome in BmNPV infected BmN cells showed that LEF 4 was acetylated at lysine 76 (K76). However, it is still unclear whether the modification of K76 residue contributes to the modulation of viral gene transcription. To elucidate the role played by acetylation or deacetylation of LEF4 K76 in the transcription of viral genes, we constructed acetylation mimicking and deacetylation mimicking mutant virus, K76Q and K76R, respectively. We then transfected BmN cells with these mutants and analyzed the level of pre-mRNA at different times. The K76R showed a significant decrease in the mRNA transcription level of vp39 and p10 genes at 48 and 72 h post-transfection, while K76Q did not show any significant changes compared with lef4-Wt. We further detected the virus titer of lef4-Wt, K76Q [et] K76R, and it was found that K76R impaired the virus infectivity ability at 72 and 96 h, while K76Q did not affect the virus infectivity. Moreover, the yeast two hybrid technique (Y2H) showed that both mutants (K76Q [et] K76R) affected the association of LEF 4 with the P47 protein. Taken together, these results indicated that acetylation modification of K76 is important for the proper transcription of late and very late genes, and the effectiveness of viral infection.

    "abstract": "Vaccination is one of the basic strategies in the fight against foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in endemic regions. Today, commercially available FMD vaccines are prepared with inactive whole virion, which has low immunogenicity. Therefore, considerable effort has been devoted to finding novel adjuvants. Although mineral oils are among the most common adjuvants, it is still difficult to provide a long-term and robust immune response. Combined adjuvant systems are currently being studied to solve the problem. Saponins and CpG-ODNs have been shown to increase the immune response to vaccines individually in various studies. In this study, the effect of different adjuvants and their combinations (Quil-A, E. coli DNA, and MontanideTM ISA 206) on total and neutralizing antibody response in sheep was investigated. According to the results, the Quil-A group induced the highest antibody level, followed by the combination of Quil-A and the E. coli DNA group. The group containing E. coli DNA also caused a higher antibody response than the group containing only MontanideTM ISA 206 for certain days of sampling. These affordable alternatives of saponin and CpG sources can be used individually to increase the potency of the FMD vaccine for mass vaccinations of sheep.

We generated IFN-β-resistant variants of the A/California/04/09 (H1N1) virus by serial passage in a human airway epithelial cell line, Calu-3, under IFN-β selective pressure. The combination of specific mutations (i.e., L373I in PB1, K154E1, D222G1, I56V2, and V122I2 in HA, and M269I in NA) correlated with decreased ability of the virus to induce expression of IFN (IFNB1, IFNL1, and IFNL2/3) and IFN-stimulated genes (IFIT1, IFIT3, OAS1, IRF7, and MX1) by target respiratory epithelial cells. In addition, the IFN-induced mutations were associated with decreased HA binding affinity to α2,6 sialyl receptors, reduced NA enzyme catalytic activity, and decreased polymerase transcription activity. Our findings demonstrate that the mutations in the influenza HA, NA, and PB1 proteins induced by IFN-b selective pressure significantly increase viral ability to productively infect and replicate in host cells.

High-throughput sequencing (HTS) surveys of viruses in purple passion fruit fields in the province of Antioquia suggested infection by a new member of the family Tymoviridae. In this work, we characterize the complete genome sequence of this virus, tentatively named purple passionfruit leaf deformation virus (PpLDV), and evaluate its distribution in Antioquia. PpLDV was assembled at high coverage in four datasets from different regions. The 6.1 kb genome of PpLDV encodes a single polyprotein with domains characteristic of the family Tymoviridae, contains a marafibox-like promoter and the 3'-UTR can fold into a tRNA-like secondary structure with a valine anti-codon. Phylogenetic analysis of the polyprotein revealed that PpLDV is a distinct member of the family Tymoviridae, more closely related to the genus Tymovirus and the unclassified Poinsettia mosaic virus (PnMV). The presence of PpLDV was confirmed by RT-qPCR and RT-PCR in samples from commercial purple passion fruit fields, plantlets and seed sprouts collected in Antioquia using primers designed in this study.

    "abstract": "Despite the widespread occurence of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) in different avian species, there has been scanty reports on genetic characterization of NDV strains from wild birds in India. During 2017-18, a total of forty eight cloacal swab samples were collected from apparently healthy migratory birds (painted storks, n = 32 and spot-billed pelicans, n = 16) at the Telineelapuram bird sanctuary of Andhra Pradesh, India. NDV was isolated from a spot-billed pelican (NDV/Pelican/Telineelapuram/2018) which is genetically identical to that isolated from a naturally infected backyard chicken flock (NDV/Chicken/SKLM-1/2018). The isolates are found to be velogenic based on mean death time, intracerebral pathogenicity index and the putative fusion protein cleavage site (112R-R-R-K-R-F117). Phylogenetic analysis based on full-length fusion gene classified the isolates into genotype XIII, sub-genotype 2.2, however these isolates demonstrated multiple amino acid substitutions in the critical domains of F and HN proteins. The pelican strain (MIG-9) was tested for its pathogenic and transmission potential in three-weeks-old broiler chickens and the isolate proved to be highly virulent to chickens. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence for the role of spot-billed pelicans in the maintenance of virulent NDV and its transmission to chickens in India. This study further highlights the role of wild birds in NDV transmission and the need for enhanced biosecurity in commercial poultry operations.

    "abstract": "Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is a severe viral infection of the central nervous system (CNS). Assay of antibody response is widely used in diagnostics of HSE. The aim of this study was to identify an immunodominant epitope determining the antibody response to herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of HSE patients. The synthetic peptides that resembled type-common as well as type-specific domains of glycoproteins B (gB) and G (gG) of these viruses were evaluated for binding with IgM and IgG antibodies in CSF samples from HSE and non-HSE patients in ELISA. The QLHDLRF peptide, derived from gB of HSV was found to be an immunodominant epitope in the IgM and IgG antibody response. The patients with confirmed and suspected HSE showed in ELISA against this peptide 26% and 23% positivities for IgM, 43% and 37% positivities for IgG and 17% and 15% for both IgM and IgG antibodies, respectively. The total positivities of 86% and 75% for both IgM and IgG antibodies were obtained in the patients with confirmed and suspected HSE, respectively. These results demonstrate that a synthetic peptide-based diagnostics of HSE can be an efficient and easily accessible alternative. This is the first report describing the use of synthetic peptides derived from HSVs in diagnostics of HSE using patientsʹ CSF samples.",

Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers, protection levels, and the magnitude of virus shedding were compared to that of the chickens that received either DNA plasmid or inactivated H5N2 vaccine alone. H5N1 virus A/chicken/Egypt/128s/2012 (H5N1) highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) clade 2.2.1/C was used for the challenge. Chickens immunized with 1 or 2 doses of H5-DNA vaccine failed to overcome the challenge with 0% and 10% protection, respectively. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR revealed virus shedding of 2.2 x 104 PCR copies/ml 3 days post challenge (dpc) in the only surviving bird from the group that received 2 doses of plasmid. However, chickens immunized with 1 or 2 doses of H5-DNA plasmid as prime and inactivated H5N2 vaccine as booster, showed 80% protection after challenge, with a viral shedding of 1.2 x 104 PCR copies/ml (1 dose) and 1.6 x 104 PCR copies/ml (2 doses) 3 dpc. The surviving birds in both groups did not shed the virus at 5 and 7 dpc. In H5N2-vaccinated chickens, protection levels were 70% with relatively high virus shedding (1.8 x 104 PCR copies/ml) 3 dpc. HI titers were protective to the surviving chickens. This study reports the efficacy of H5-DNA plasmid to augment reduction in viral shedding and to provide better protection when applied in a prime-boost program with the inactivated AI vaccine.",

Two variable DNA-B components, KA22 and KA27, cause distinct symptoms in blackgram [V. mungo (L.) Hepper] with the same DNA-A component. KA22 + DNA-A-agroinoculated blackgram plants displayed yellow mosaic symptom and accumulated high levels of viral single-stranded (ss) DNA. KA27 + DNA-A-agroinoculated blackgram plants displayed severe stunting symptom and accumulated very low levels of viral ssDNA. However, in mungbean [V. radiata (L.)

Swapping of KA27 DNA-B with the nuclear shuttle protein gene (NSP) of KA22 DNA-B (KA27xKA22 NSP) caused yellow mosaic symptom in blackgram, suggesting that KA22 NSP is the determinant of yellow mosaic symptom. Interestingly, KA27xKA22 NSP-infected blackgram plants accumulated high levels of viral ssDNA, comparable to that of KA22 DNA-B infection, suggesting that the KA22 NSP is responsible for accumulation of high levels of viral ssDNA. MYMV distribution was studied in blackgram and mungbean plants by leaf tissue hybridization, which showed mesophyll spread of the virus in KA22-infected blackgram leaflets and in KA27-infected mungbean leaflets, both of which displayed yellow mosaic symptom. However, the virus did not accumulate in the mesophyll in the case of KA27-infected blackgram leaflets.

    "abstract": "Baculoviridae is a family of invertebrate viruses with large double-stranded DNA genomes. Proteins encoded by some late expression factor (lef ) genes are involved in the regulation of viral gene expression. Lef-9 is one of four transcription-specific Lefs, which are components of the virus-encoded RNA polymerase, and can initiate and transcribe late and very late genes. As a multifunctional protein encoded by the Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV), Lef-9 may be involved in the regulation of viral propagation. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. To determine the role of lef-9 in baculovirus infection, lef-9-knockout virus (lef-9-KO-Bacmid virus) was constructed using the Red recombination system, and the Bac-to-Bac system was used to prepare lef-9-repaired virus (lef-9-Re-Bacmid virus). The lef-9-KO virus did not produce infectious viruses or show infection activity, while the lef-9-repaired virus recovered both. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis of the transcription levels in wild-type-Bacmid, lef-9-KO-Bacmid, and lef-9-Re-Bacmid viruses showed that the lef-9-KO bacmid had little effect on viral genome replication. However, the transcription levels of the early and late viral genes, lef-3, ie-1, vp39, and p10, were significantly lower in BmN cells transfected with lef-9-KO-Bacmids than in the controls. Electron microscopy showed no visible enveloped virions in cells transfected with lef-9-KO-Bacmids, while many mature virions in cells transfected with lef-9-Re-Bacmid and wt-Bacmid were present. Thus, lef-9 was not essential for viral genome replication, but significantly affected viral gene transcription and expression in all periods of cell life cycle.",

Heterologous immune responses against other genotypes were also recognized. NoV-specific IFN-γ was detected after the intrabuccal administration.

People with impaired immunity and children are particularly vulnerable. A few reports of neuroinfections caused by adenoviruses are found in literature. In this study the tropism of the human adenoviruses type 4, 5, 7 to primary cultures of murine neurons and the influence of infection on the neuron morphology and actin cytoskeleton was examined. The A549 non-small-cell lung cancer cell line was used as a reference line. Viral effects upon the cell culture were evaluated by direct immunofluorescence. The levels of adenovirus replication in the above-mentioned cell cultures were determined by real-time PCR. In the current study we demonstrated for the first time that human adenovirus (HAdV) type 4, 5 and 7 exhibits tropism for neurons cultured in vitro followed by the extensive replication of all serotypes in the primary culture of murine neurons. Immunofluorescent labelling and confocal microscopy revealed the changes in cell morphology, destruction of actin cytoskeleton and cell lysis as the final stage of infection. According to the obtained results we can assume that productive cycle of HAdV in the studied cell cultures occurred. We also observed accumulation of nuclear actin within nuclei of infected cells which may indicate that it plays role in adenovirus infection and replication in neurons and A549 cells.",

Non-specific actions include various means of microorganism inactivation by chemical or physical methods targeting structural components of a given pathogen. Exposure of viruses and bacteria to elevated temperatures is one of the effective methods for discharging their harmful potential. Using a model of the Human Adenovirus 5 exposed to elevated temperatures with subsequent titration of the virus in vitro in A549 cells, we showed a dramatic decrease of the virus titer after heat treatment for 5 s at temperatures over 100°C. To verify the potential of the heat inactivation in a closed environment, the prototype of a high-capacity pathogen-cleaning device was constructed and tested. Application of the device for 2 h at an airflow rate of 900 m 3 /h in a room of 226 m 3 reduced the total number of microorganisms in the air by more than 50% at all collection sites in the room.",

    "abstract": "The non-uniform usage of synonymous codons occurs in genomes of all organisms, including DNA and RNA viruses. The preferential selection of a codon at the expense of other synonymous codons within the same group is known as Codon Usage Bias. The understanding of this bias assists in unveiling the factors driving molecular evolution, as defined by the selection-mutation-drift theory. According to this model, molecular evolution is predominantly driven by mutation, natural selection, and genetic drift. Nevertheless, elements like nucleotide composition, gene length, and protein secondary structure also contribute to this process. Comprehensive genomic analyses that highlight the codon usage preference of the African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) are infrequent. ASFV, a hemorrhagic and highly contagious viral disease, almost invariably results in 100% fatality among infected pigs and wild boars. This study, therefore, embarked on a thorough examination of codon usage patterns in ASFV’s complete genomic sequences, an endeavor of great relevance to molecular evolution studies, complex transmission models, and vaccine research. For an exhaustive evaluation of ASFV’s whole-genome codon usage, we used parameters like ENC, RSCU, and CAI. A Principal Component Analysis was carried out to reaffirm the interconnected RSCU lineages based on the continent, and their evolutionary relationships were later elucidated through phylogenetic tree construction. ASFV emerged as a low-biased codon user (ENC = 52.8) that is moderately adapted to its host. Its genome has a high AT composition (64.05%), suggesting the impact of mutational pressure on genomic evolution. However, neutrality plot analysis revealed natural selection’s slight supremacy over mutational pressure. The low codon bias (&amp;gt;45) implies ASFV’s diverse usage of synonymous codons within a given codon family, allowing for effective translation and subsequent successful viral replication cycles. Its moderate adaptation (CAI = 0.56) permits the virus to infect a range of hosts, including reservoirs such as warthogs and bush pigs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the pioneering report providing a comprehensive examination of ASFV’s complete genomic sequences. Consequently, research focusing on viral gene expression and regulation, gene function prediction, parasite-host interaction, immune dysfunction, and drug and vaccine design may find this report to be a valuable resource.",

    "abstract": "The biological consequences of viral infection result from biochemical, physiological, structural, morphological and genetic changes in infected cells. In productive infections, virus-induced biological changes in cells may be closely related to the efficiency of viral replication or to the recognition of these cells by the immune system. These changes are usually associated with cytocidal viruses, as in the case of the pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. Many of these changes are required for effective viral replication. The physiological state of living cells has a significant impact on the outcome of viral infection, as the host cell provides the synthetic machinery, key regulatory molecules and precursors for newly synthesised viral proteins and nucleic acids. This review focuses on novel target cell types for SARS-CoV-2 exposure outside the respiratory tract. Findings and examples are collected that provide information on virus-cell interactions. The identification of unusual target cells for SARS-CoV-2 may help to explain the diverse symptoms in COVID-19 patients and the long-lasting effects after infection. In particular, the discovery of previously undescribed target cells for SARS-CoV-2 action needs to be considered to improve treatment of patients and prevention of infection.",

Comparison of the 50% plaque inhibitory doses for HSV-1 and its mutant MMdUr-20 in cell cultures with inhibition constants (Ki's) for the viral deoxythymidine kinases (dTKs) suggests that in the infected cell FMAU is phosphorylated by host enzymes. As compared to HSV-1, EHV-1 and PRV were more resistant to E-5-(2-bromovinyl-2'-deoxyuridine (BVdU) and to the 2'-fluoropyrimidine analogs, as are HSV-2 and the HSV-1 mutants MMdUr-20 and S1. Because the dTKs of the latter lack deoxythymidylate kinase (dTMPK) activity, there appears to be a correlation between resistance to these analogs and BVdU on the one hand, and lack of dTMPK activity on the other. We predict that EHV-1 and PRV dTKs will be shown to lack significant dTMPK activity.",

    "abstract": "Summary. - Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is an arenavirus that readily causes persistent infections, in which it does not interfere with vital functions of the cells, but can affect expression of \"luxurious\" genes. MX strain of LCMV (MX LCMV) has been identified as an agent transmissible by cell-to-cell contact in the human carcinoma MaTu cells grown in a mixed culture with HeLa cells. When compared to uninfected HeLa, the MaTu-MX-infected HeLa cells, to which the virus was transmitted via co-cultivation with mitomycin C-treated MaTu cells, showed an elevated expression of a protein called MN, suggesting that MN can be induced by MX LCMV. MN protein was later identified as the carbonic anhydrase isoform IX (CA IX), whose expression has been predominantly associated with hypoxic tumors of poor prognosis. Since the proposal that MX LCMV can induce such a cancer-related protein could substantially change our view on the biology of LCMV-host interaction we undertook its verification. Instead of co-cultivation, we used MaTu cell-free extracts to transmit MX LCMV to HeLa cells. These cells were then grown for more than 30 passages, but the level of MN/CA IX did not increase throughout the whole cultivation period as compared to uninfected HeLa cells. Moreover, a treatment of MaTu-MX-infected HeLa cells with ribavirin eliminated the virus, but did not reduce the MN/CA IX expression. Our results clearly showed that MN/CA IX is independent of MX LCMV and that the virus itself does not influence the MN/CA IX level in HeLa cells.",

Nucleopolyhedroviruses (NPVs) of the Baculoviridae family have been used for decades as biological pesticides to control insect pests. A new NPV, named Ophiusa disjungens nucleopolyhedrovirus (OpdiNPV), was recently isolated from OpdiNPV-infected O. disjungens larvae. In this study, a PstI fragment of OpdiNPV genome containing the deoxyuridine triphosphatase (dUTPase) gene was successfully cloned, sequenced and analyzed. Upstream of a 402 bp long ORF of the dUTPase gene, encoding a 133 aa long protein, typical transcription promoter boxes CAGT and TATA were found. The dUTPase was first expressed in his-tagged form in Escherichia coli as a 35.5 kDa protein. Then it was successfully expressed in insect Trichoplusia ni (Tn) cells in the form of an EGFP-fusion protein. It first appeared (at 24 hrs post infection (p.i.)) in the cell nucleus, but later (at 72 hrs p.i.) it was excluded from the nucleus and diffusely scattered all over the cell. These findings may serve as basis for development of engineered OpdiNPVs as biopesticides to control O. disjungens and other Lepidoptera insects.Ophiusa disjungens; nucleopolyhedrovirus; dUTPase.",

In this study, we used various mutants of the C-terminal domain to further analyze its karyophilic determinants. Plasmids expressing these mutants fused to maltose binding protein (MBP) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were transfected to COS-1 cells and subcellular localization of these fluorescent fusion proteins was determined by fluorescent microscopy. The results revealed that a maximum karyophilicity was exhibited by a region longer than the previously described one of 29 aa (aa 306-334), in particular by a 64 aa region (aa 289-352) with Arg341 and Lys349 as critical determinants.",

    "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) core (C) protein is thought to bind to viral RNA before it undergoes oligomerization leading to RNA encapsidation. Details of these events are so far unknown. The 5ʹ-terminal C protein coding sequence that includes an adenine (A)-rich tract is a part of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). This nucleotide sequence but not the corresponding protein sequence is needed for proper initiation of translation of viral RNA by an IRES-dependent mechanism. In this study, we examined the importance of this sequence for the ability of the C protein to bind to viral RNA. Serially truncated C proteins with deletions from 10 up to 45 N-terminal amino acids were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and tested for binding to viral RNA by a gel shift assay. The results showed that truncation of the C protein from its N-terminus by more than 10 amino acids abolished almost completely its expression in E. coli. The latter could be restored by adding a tag to the N-terminus of the protein. The tagged proteins truncated by 15 or more amino acids showed an anomalous migration in SDS-PAGE. Truncation by more than 20 amino acids resulted in a complete loss of ability of tagged C protein to bind to viral RNA. These results provide clues to the early events in the C protein - RNA interactions leading to C protein oligomerization, RNA encapsidation and virion assembly.hepatitis C virus; core protein; RNA binding.",

Moreover, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were assayed by flow cytometry. We found that all DNA vaccines induced IgG antibodies, predominantly of the IgG2a class and S3 DNA vaccine was the strongest inducer. M2 and S3 DNA vaccines elicited Th1- and Th2-based immune responses, respectively, while S1 and M3 DNA vaccines induced a mixed Th1/Th2 response. M1, S2, and S4 DNA vaccines were poorly immunogenic. To our knowledge, this is the first report characterizing mammalian reovirus DNA vaccines applied to a mouse model.",

Nucleotide sequence diversity analysis showed geographical differentiation among the TVBMV isolates. Three of the 10 isolates were found to have undergone recombination and new recombination sites were identified in the TVBMV genome. All coding genes were under negative selection and the population appeared to have remained stable over a long period.

Furthermore, JUN and VEE-VI viruses showed the same behaviour in Am as in Cm.

However, the underlying mechanism in cellular context is still unclear. In this report, we designed several cDNA-based HCV-like minigenomes containing different mutations at the 5'UTR of (+)RNA. These (+)RNAs transcribed from the minigenomes in vitro were transfected into HCV replicon cells for producing (-)RNAs with deletions of different stem loops (SL) at the 3'-end. The results showed that expression of the antisense transgene from minigenome increased, when the minigenome containing deletion of SL-C1+D1+E1 at the 3'-end of (-)RNA was transfected into the HCV replicon cells compared to that of the full minigenome. The expression of the transgene from minigenome decreased using other mutant minigenomes containing deletions SL-A1, SL-A1+B1, and SL-A1+B1+C1 at the 3'-end of (-)RNA. Finally, the transgene from SL-C1+D1+E1 of (-)RNA using CMV promoter-driven minigenome was expressed at higher level than full minigenome in HCV replicon cell lines. These results indicated that the region of (-)RNA interacting with HCV replicase may locate in the SL-C1+D1+E1 region of (-)RNA.Hepatitis C virus; minigenome; RNA dependent RNA polymerase; replication.",

    "abstract": "Nucleotide sequence analysis of the 3C protease (3C(pro)) region of Foot-and-mouth disease virus type A (FMDV-A) isolates from India has revealed incongruous phylogenetic grouping between 3C(pro) and VP1 region possibly due to the genetic recombination or independent evolution of non-structural and structural protein coding regions. Similar to the VP1 region, the emerging VP3(59)-deletion group maintained its genetic distinctiveness at 3C(pro) region and was found to be diverging with time. Two lineage specific signature aa residues were detected for the deletion group in proof of lineage specific drift or selection events. 3C(pro) region exhibited high degree of conservation as evident from low dN/dS ratio (0.036) and percentage of variable aa positions (20%). A transmembrane domain from aa 27 to 44 could be predicted that possibly anchors 3C to intracellular membranes for better interaction with RNA replication complex. On the basis of sequence conservation, the likelihood that the region aa 121-150 was carrying a vaccine exploitable T-cell epitope was very high.",

To investigate whether Vpu has a pH-modulating activity comparable to that of M2, Vpu was co-expressed with the pH-sensitive hemagglutinin (HA) from IAV. The results indicated that Vpu was unable to reduce the acidity of the exocytic pathway and reduce the conversion of the pH-sensitive HA to its low-pH conformation during transport to the cell surface. Despite these findings, we did not exclude the possibility that Vpu formed a weak ion channel with almost pore-like characteristics as was recently suggested.",

A His-tagged recombinant F (rF) protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, solubilized with 8 mol/l urea, purified by the Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and used for the raising of a polyclonal antibody in rabbits. The non-glycosylated rF protein proved to be a strong immunogen that induced a polyclonal antibody that was able to recognize also the glycosylated F1 subunit of native HRSV. The other way around, a polyclonal antibody prepared against the native HRSV was able to react with the rF protein. These results indicated that glycosylation was not necessary for the F domain aa 212-574 in order to be recognized by the specific polyclonal antibody.",

    "abstract": "Hepatitis C infection is a serious health issue worldwide caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV). There is an urgent need of search for new direct acting antiviral drugs due to the rapid development of drug resistance. The HCV NS5A protein is involved in creating resistance against antiviral therapy and there are also many reports that vitamin A deficiency is associated with non-responsiveness to antiviral treatment in HCV infected patients. So the present in silico study was aimed to find the relation between vitamin A deficiency and the NS5A protein's function in antiviral resistance. Structure of NS5A protein was predicted by using I-Tasser (Interactive Tasser). Previous data on conservative domains and dimer formation were confirmed by using a series of current computational methods. The structure was employed for molecular docking analysis to investigate the interaction of ligand BMS411 (4-[(5,5-dimethyl-8-phenyl-6H-naphthalene-2-carbonyl)amino]benzoic acid), a vitamin A related compound with NS5A protein. Docking analysis showed that retinoid BMS411 can bind to HCV NS5A protein and may act as inhibitor of this protein. The functionally interacting amino acid residues surrounding the ligand molecule were identified and were shown to be involved in the formation of binding pocket. The present study suggests that retinoids may play an important role in the improvement of the outcomes of antiviral therapy against HCV through interaction with NS5A and inhibition of this protein. It is of great importance to check and verify if other retinoids could act as NS5A inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Gerbera is the most popular cut flower known for its variety of colors and is grown across the world. Its production is challenged by numerous diseases affecting production and quality. During our survey, ten samples from the gerbera plants exhibiting phyllody disease symptoms were collected from Bangalore Rural District, Karnataka, India. The association of phytoplasma with the gerbera phyllody samples was confirmed by PCR using 16SrRNA, SecY, Ribosomal protein (rp) and SecA gene-specific primers. PCR products were amplified from all ten gerbera plants using phytoplasma-specific primers. The amplified PCR products were cloned and sequenced; the sequences of the ten clones were identical. Therefore, representative isolate (GePP1, Gerbera phyllody phytoplasma) was selected for further analysis. The sequence analysis showed that GePP1 shared maximum nucleotide (nt) identity of 97.1% (16SrRNA) with Eggplant big bud, 98.7 to 98.8% (SecY gene) with Tomato big bud, 99.2 to 99.6% (rp gene) with Alfalfa witches-broom (EF193371) and 99.1% (SecA gene) with Sesame phyllody phytoplasmas and that it belongs to the Ca. P. aurantifolia (16SrII) group. This result was well supported by the phylogenetic analysis showing GePP1 (16Sr RNA, SecY, rp and SecA genes) closely clustering with the Ca. P. aurantifolia 16SrII group isolates reported so far. The virtual RFLP pattern generated for the phytoplasma from gerbera was different (similarity coefficient 0.89) from the reference pattern of Ca. P. aurantifolia (16Sr II) subgroup after analysis with four enzymes (BfaI, Hha1, Sau3AI and RsaI). Based on the threshold similarity coefficient for a new subgroup (delineation should be set at 0.97), the GePP1 may be considered as new subgroup of Ca. P. aurantifolia (16SrII) group. This is the first report of Ca. P. aurantifolia belonging to 16Sr II group affecting gerbera in India. Keywords: Candidatus Phytoplasma aurantifolia; phyllody; gerbera; PCR; phylogenetic analysis.",

    "abstract": "The complete genome of a novel virus from Arma chinensis was determined by RNA sequencing and rapid amplification of cDNA ends. This virus has a single-stranded RNA genome of 10,540 nucleotides (nt) excluding the poly(A) tail. Two non-overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) in the sense direction were predicted: one long ORF at the 5' end of the genome (6,219 nt) that encodes a polypeptide of 2,072 amino acids (aa), and one short ORF at the 3' end of the genome (3,033 nt) that encodes a polypeptide of 1,010 aa. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the virus clusters within a large cluster of currently unidentified picorna-like viruses with a high bootstrap value. We named the virus isolate Arma chinensis picorna-like virus 1 (AcPV-1). The prevalence of AcPV-1 infection in samples of Arma chinensis from the wild was at a low level (5.48%, 8 positives in 146 samples). Keywords: Arma chinensis; genomic characterization; phylogenetic analysis; Arma chinensis picorna-like virus 1; prevalence.",

One major question in predicting the course of the COVID-19 pandemic is how well and how long the immune response protects the host from reinfection. Although more studies are needed, evidence suggests that virus-specific B cell response in people with SARS-CoV-2 infection is rapidly generated and seems to be more reliable marker of long-lasting humoral responses than serum antibodies. Here we reviewed all related major studies of immune response to SARS-CoV-2 virus to better understand the natural protection against the virus, and the risk of reinfection. The ability of our community to eradicate this virus will mostly depend on our knowledge of the immune response, critical not only for vaccine development and distribution but also for therapeutic options.

DNA1 molecules of all isolates contained three characteristics: a single ORF, conserved hairpin structure, and A-rich region. Nucleotide sequence comparison showed that DNA1 molecules of 5 examined isolates shared high sequence identity (71.8-98.8%).

Mice given 300 or 600 r were inoculated intraplantarly either on the 5th or 13th day after irradiation. Irradintion with either single dose led to a decrease in virus in regional lymph nodes and blood. if the animals were inoculated 5 days after irradiation. The decrease in virus titer was most marked in mice irradiated with a dose of 600 r and inoculated with 1500 LD/sub 50/ of virus. The titer of virus in the organs examined remained unaffected as long as the virus did not penetrate the regional lymphatic system into blood. The slower penetration of virus through the lymphatic system of irradiated mice was apparently caused by general changes in the lymphatic system, although it appears probable that an important factor was also the decreased number of lymphocytes, which may act as carriers of virus.

    "abstract": "Homologous interference in vitro is defined as the ability of primary viral infection to prevent secondary homologous superinfection. Non-cytopathic bovine viral diarrhea virus (ncp BVDV) has been classified according to the exaltation of Newcastle disease phenomenon (END) as END positive (E+) and END negative (E-) strains. Simultaneous inoculation of MDBK-SY cell monolayers with BVDV/E- virus and a three log higher amount of BVDV RK13/E+ virus, leads to acquisition of the BVDV/E- feature of blocking Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection in cells. BVDV/E- strains, particularly at a high titre and MOI ≥1.25, can exert and impose their effects in BVDV/E+ infected cells; however, if BVDV/E- MOI is reduced to MOI below 0.625, the BVDV/E+ effect can be restored leading to cytopathic effects (CPE) induction by NDV reciprocal to the titre of the BVDV RK13/E+ strain. Moreover, blocking and prevention of induced CPE by NDV or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) occurs even when BVDV/E- superinfects primary BVDV/E+ infected cells, indicating a defective homologous interference between BVDV/E+ and BVDV/E- strains. Taken together, BVDV/E- strains have a strong competitive potency and mediate a fast acting (i.e. within 60 min) influence against BVDV/E+ activity. This may be relevant in vivo where BVDV/E- and BVDV/E+ combinations are frequently isolated from infected individuals.",

In ruminants, an animal is considered as a foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) carrier if a live FMDV/FMDV RNA is obtained from the oro-pharyngeal fluid (OPF) beyond 28 days after infection. These carrier animals may pose a risk for causing outbreaks in healthy animals. Moreover, it is important to conduct serosurveillance to know the virus circulation. In the present study, an ELISA was developed using field samples to detect FMDV specific secretory IgA antibodies. These samples were also tested for the presence of FMDV RNA using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). It was found that more carrier animals were detected by IgA ELISA in comparison to qRT-PCR. Thus, IgA ELISA is an important tool to detect FMD carriers. An ELISA based on detection of antibodies against FMDV 2B non-structural protein (NSP) was also used to confirm the results obtained from screening of 3AB3 NSP ELISA. These two new approaches (IgA ELISA and 2B ELISA) form important tools for detection of carriers and virus circulation, respectively, during FMD eradication program.

To analyse the epizootiology of BT, over 110,000 samples collected from domestic and wild ruminants were screened for the presence of BTV RNA and virus-specific antibodies using real-time RT-PCR assay and commercial ELISA kit, respectively. During laboratory analysis, specimens collected from 333 (0.8%) cattle, 79 (2.2%) sheep, 4 (0.9%) goats, and 1 (2.3%) mouflon were found to be positive by viral RNA-detection assay. In addition, antibody to BTV was detected in 5.5% (3158/57,250) of cattle, 10.1% (517/5120) of sheep, 40% (116/290) of goat, and 5.6% (16/284) of buffalo origin samples. The majority of positive samples originated from south-western counties; however, 18 out of 19 counties reported cases or antibody prevalence in the examined animals. Genome sequencing of a representative BTV-4 strain from 2015 was also performed. When comparing this strain with the isolate BTV4-HUN2014 detected only a year earlier in Hungary, mutations at 14 sites were identified within the amplified and sequenced genome.

In this study, it was demonstrated that the PA subunit of the viral RdRp interacts with β-actin proteins by the yeast two-hybrid assay. It was shown that the amino-terminal domains of the β-actin protein bind to the carboxy-terminal moiety of the viral PA protein in the mammalian cells. The results were supported by in silico analysis. Over-expression of the β-actin protein was found to have a negative effect on the viral RdRp activity in mini-replicon, but its mechanism of action has remained unknown. The results suggest that the interaction of β-actin and PA protein, a component of vRNPs, may have a role in the intracellular trafficking of the influenza vRNPs and/or viral transcription.",

These viruses cause diseases with varying degrees of severity, from a simple respiratory tract infection to severe diseases. Since EVs include more than 70 serotypes currently circulating in the population, a methodology that detects most of them is needed. ELISA is a rapid, sensitive, and economical diagnostic method for the identification of EV serotypes and can also be used as a retrospective diagnostic tool or in the investigation of outbreaks of infection. Commercial EV-ELISAs often appear and gradually disappear from the market supply. We have used the KTL-510 peptide, a synthetic viral protein of poliovirus VP1, as an antigen in a peptide-based ELISA for the detection of a broader spectrum of anti-EV antibodies. We aimed to design, optimize, and standardize this in-house ELISA with the peptide, and implement the method for routine detection of anti-EV IgG in human sera. For determining the cut-off value, we used 100 patients’ sera which were previously tested negative for IgG antibodies against EVs using a commercial ELISA kit available. We monitored patients’ sera samples sent for serological testing of anti-coxsackievirus antibodies to the National Reference Center for the Identification of Enteric Viruses between 2018–2022.

In our study, we identified a total of 942 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Vero cells infected with Enterovirus 71 (EV71), with 568 gene exhibiting increased expression and 374 gene showing decreased expression. To elucidate the functional implications of these DEGs, we conducted a comprehensive functional enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. This analysis revealed three genes that were significantly upregulated, which we subsequently validated using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction technology (RT-qPCR). The RT-qPCR results were in strong agreement with our RNA-Seq data, confirming the reliability of our findings. This study represents the pioneering RNA-Seq analysis that delves into the cellular response of Vero cells to EV71 infection. Our results not only provide a foundational understanding of the molecular changes induced by EV71 but also offer crucial insights into the mechanisms by which EV71 modulates the host immune system. These insights are pivotal for future research endeavors aimed at developing effective therapeutic strategies against EV71 and related pathogens, as well as for understanding the broader implications of viral infections on host immunity.",

    "abstract": "Background Currently, there are approximately 240 million individuals worldwide suffering from chronic hepatitis B infection, yet a definitive cure remains elusive. In the context of pharmaceutical interventions for this patient population, the potential issue of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation must be taken into consideration. Nutlin-3 is a small molecule of imidazoline analog, which inhibits tumor growth by suppressing the interaction between human double minute 2 (HDM2) and p53. However, whether it affects HBV replication is not clear. Methods HepG2.2.15 cells were used to assess the impact of Nutlin-3 on HBV replication. The expression of Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) was detected by ELISA. The expression of pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) and core-DNA was detected by RT-qPCR. The activation of relevant signaling pathways was assessed through Western blotting and confocal microscopy detection of the expression of associated proteins. Results We found that Nutlin-3 significantly enhances the expression of HBsAg and HBeAg, and it also promotes the expression of pgRNA and Core-DNA. Nutlin-3 promotes HBV replication independent of the HDM2. Instead, it activates the autophagy pathway through p53-mediated mTOR inhibition to promote HBV replication. Conclusion When using Nutlin-3 for cancer therapy, it’s important to be aware of the potential side effect of promoting HBV replication in individuals with chronic hepatitis B infection.",

Mixed populations with monospecific antigenic characteristics contained genomes of both viruses detectable by the TC marker (dual spetrum of cytopathogenicity).

Two strains belonging to another functional group induced no synthesis of virus-specific macromolecules in CEC, but were able to adsorb onto the cells. With one of these viruses, no transcription of parental RNA could be detected in CEC.

Since 1996, only alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN) in monotherapy has been used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in hemophiliacs (6 patients). In Czech Republic a combination therapy with alpha-IFN and ribavirin has been used since 1999 (13 patients). Finally, a combination therapy with pegylated alpha-IFN (PEG-alpha-IFN) and ribavirin is being used since 2001 (still 3 patients). In all cases, the treatment lasted 48 weeks. A sustained virological response (SVR, defined as an undetectable serum HCV RNA level 24 weeks after the treatment was completed) was not achieved in any of 6 patients treated with alpha-IFN alone. A combination therapy with alpha-IFN and ribavirin yielded better results: four of eight patients still untreated with alpha-IFN (naive patients), one of two relapsers, and one of three non-responders to previous alpha-IFN monotherapy achieved SVR. So far the combination therapy with PEG-alpha-IFN and ribavirin has been used only in 3 patients. SVR was achieved in one patient who had relapsed after the combination therapy with IFN-alpha and ribavirin, and in 1 of 2 non-responders to this therapy. We conclude that the efficacy and tolerability of the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in hemophiliacs did not differ from that of chronic hepatitis C in other patients.",

    "abstract": "This study was focused on the detection, characterization and virulence of a new baculovirus isolate from the larvae of cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni (Hubner) (lepidoptera: Noctuidae).T. ni is a polyphagous pest, and it has cosmopolitan distribution.An infected T. ni larvae was collected from a cabbage field in Turkey.Scanning electron microscopy studies showed the presence of typical occlusion bodies (oBs) with average size of 0.76 to 1.46 µm in the collected larvae.Since the virions have single nucleocapsid within the envelopes, the isolate was named as Trichoplusia ni single nucleopolyhedrovirus Turkey isolate (TrniSNPV-Tr).The total genome of the TrniSNPV-Tr was determined as 122.9 kb in size.Sequence analysis of the amplified late expression factor 8 (lef8), late expression factor 9 (lef9) and polyhedrin (polh) genes showed that the virus is a new isolate of nucleopolyhedroviruses and close to Trichoplusia ni SNPV isolates mentioned in the literature.However, this is the first study for the detection and characterization of a baculovirus from T. ni in Eurasian region.insecticidal activities of the TrniSNPV-Tr isolate (10 6 oBs/ml -1 ) against neonate, 3 rd and 5 th instar larvae of T. ni and Helicoverpa armigera showed 98%-91%, 91%-87% and 65%-60% mortalities, respectively, within 14 days.lc 50 of TrniSNPV-Tr was determined as 2×10 3 -9×10 3 , 3×10 4 -7×10 4 and 1×10 5 -2×10 5 oBs/ml on neonate, 3 rd and 5 th instar larvae, respectively.All these results showed that, TrniSNPV-Tr has good potential to be utilized as a bio-pesticide against T. ni larvae in the future.",

We recently developed the compound nH115a, an inhibitor of the La protein that has high stability and anti-HBV activity. However, the mechanism, by which this compound inhibits HBV infection and its safety to embryos, remains unclear. Our goal was to examine the molecular mechanism, by which nH115a inhibits HBV infection, and to characterize its embryotoxicity. Microarray experiments using HepG2. 2. 15 cells (established by transfecting an HBV plasmid into HepG2 hepatoma cells) and bioinformatics analyses were used to measure the effect of nH115a on the expression of lncRNAs, mRNAs, and circRNAs. The embryonic stem cell test was used to assess the embryotoxicity of nH115a. nH115a significantly altered the expression of 2402 lncRNAs, 338 mRNAs, and 559 circRNAs. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis indicated the differentially expressed transcripts functioned in interleukin-2 production, I-SMAD binding, RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), NLRP3 inflammasome complex assembly, cytoplasmic sequestering of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), and death receptor binding. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis indicated the most enriched pathways included transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling, pathways in cancer, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, p53 signaling, antigen processing and presentation, Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, and B cell receptor signaling. The results of the embryonic stem cell test indicated that nH115a exhibited weak embryotoxicity. In conclusion, immune responses, TGF-β/SMAD signaling, and cancer-related pathways may function in the nH115a-mediated inhibition of HBV replication.

The viral dsRNA was already detected in some plants from the family Poaceae or in watermelon. To identify new hosts of PMeV, we have collected 38 plant species belonging to 15 families of common weed species found in papaya-growing areas in México and used reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) or quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) for virus detection. We have detected the viral RNA in 11 species belonging to the families Acanthaceae, Fabaceae and Poaceae. Under experimental conditions, PMeV-Mx in Panicum hirsutum and Ruellia nudiflora inoculated weed species, showed that PMeV-Mx is able to replicate in plant cells of these species and spread in a systemic way.

MT-2 and MT-4 cells and control PBMCs were treated with 1,25VitD3 and percentages of Tregs and Th17 cells was determined by flow cytometry. Gene expression and cytokine levels were analyzed by real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. Treatment with-1,25VitD3 increased the percentage of Tregs in MT-2 and MT-4 cells, while it decreased the percentage of Th17 cells among MT-2 cells. 1,25VitD3 treatment also significantly improved FOXP3 gene expression in MT-2 cells, while reducing ROR-γt-gene expression in MT-2 and MT-4 cells comparing to untreated cells. Treatment with 1,25VitD3 significantly improved IL-10 levels in MT-2 cells, as well as TGF-β levels in both cell lines culture supernatants. 1,25VitD3 treatment diminished IL-6 levels in cell culture supernatants of MT-2 and MT-4 as well as IL-17 A levels in MT-2. Here we showed, that 1,25VitD3 modulated immune responses by enhancing Tregs differentiation and functions as well as inhibiting Th17 differentiation and actions in HTLV-1 infected cell lines.

This virus is responsible for a very damaging disease that has resulted in significant reductions in yields and cultivated area for this crop in Colombia. Tamarillo is frequently co-cultivated with other solanaceous plants but no evidence for cross-pathogenicity of TaLMV has been found until now. In this work, we report a natural infection of cape gooseberry (Physalis peruviana L.) by TaLMV. Infection by TaLMV was detected by RNAseq screening of cape gooseberry fields and confirmed by RT-qPCR and Sanger sequencing. The sequenced genome is 99.3% identical to previously sequenced TaLMV isolates, and evidence suggests that it can accumulate at high loads in this new reported host. RT-qPCR analysis indicates that TaLMV is already widely distributed, can naturally infect other solanaceous hosts and may become an emerging threat to the cape gooseberry agroindustry, the second most important exotic fruit export in Colombia.

It moderates the course of influenza virus type A (IAV) infection, however, its impact on the induction of virus-neutralizing antibodies (VNAbs) is not understood in details. Here, we examined the influence of low (10 mg/kg) or high (60 mg/kg) doses of OS on the viral titer in lungs of BALB/c mice infected with 0.5 LD50 of IAV and on the level of VNAbs. Prophylactic application of OS (6 h before the infection) delayed the increase of viral titer in lungs with a lower peak in comparison to non-treated control mice. After therapeutic OS application (44 h after the infection), maximum of virus titer did not significantly change. However, the induction of VNAbs strongly decreased, to 16.7%-18.1% of the control, after preventive application of high OS dose. A minimal decrease of VNAbs titers was observed in groups of mice treated with low dose of OS applied therapeutically. They lowered to 91.1% / 14 or to 94.1% / 21 days post infection (p.i.) of VNAbs titers of non-treated control mice. In all other groups, levels of VNAbs titers dropped to 26.5-53.7% of those of non-treated mice. It should be noted that VNAbs titers were in direct proportion to maximal virus titers in mouse lungs of corresponding groups. In summary, after OS application the clinical symptoms of the disease were milder or non-observable in all OS-treated groups, but the lowering of VNAbs titers was dependent on the OS dose and interval between drug app-lication and the start of infection.

The coronavirus strain and immunization status have a significant impact on the severity of COVID-19 infections. The current study intends to evaluate and compare the symptoms, severity, and breakthrough infections in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals over the three waves of the pandemic. Methods This was a retrospective survey study. A Google based questionnaire was used to collect data on demographics, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection status, re-infections, associated symptoms, severity, and vaccination status over three waves, post-COVID-19 sequelae, and willingness to receive a COVID-19 booster dose in the Indian population. The replies of 3,404 Indian participants were analysed using STATA 11. Results Each wave showed a decrease in the number of symptomatic COVID-19 infections. However, fever and loss of smell/taste were identified as the most common symptoms in each wave. Clinical symptoms such as fever, weariness, and shortness of breath were shown to be considerably higher in vaccinated than unvaccinated individuals. The number of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections increased between the second and third waves. Approximately 36.5% of people with protracted COVID-19 had previously received immunization after recovering from a natural COVID-19 illness. Overall, 34.8% of individuals were hesitant to take the COVID-19 booster dose. Conclusion Increased symptoms in vaccinated individuals during the second wave, emphasizing the potential role of antibody-dependent augmentation. A considerable fraction (36.5%) of those with protracted COVID-19 infections had previously received vaccination after contracting the virus naturally. The fact that vaccine received after COVID-19 infection has been shown to be a risk factor for long-term COVID-19 emphasizes the need for vigilance in this specific subgroup.",

    "abstract": "Human infections with avian infl uenza A viruses (IAVs) without or with clinical symptoms of disease were recently reported from several continents, mainly in high risk groups of people, who came into the contact with infected domestic birds or poultry.It was shown that avian IAVs are able to infect humans directly without previous adaptation, however, their ability to replicate and to cause a disease in this new host can diff er.No spread of these avian IAVs among humans has been documented until now, except for one case described in Netherlands in the February of 2003 in people directly involved in handling IAV (H7N7)-infected poultry.Th e aim of our work was to examine whether a low pathogenic avian IAV can induce a virus-specifi c immune response of biological relevancy, in spite of its restricted replication in mammals.As a model we used a low pathogenic virus A/Duck/Czechoslovakia/1956 (H4N6) (A/Duck), which replicated well in MDCK cells and produced plaques on cell monolayers, but was unable to replicate productively in mouse lungs.We examined how the immune system of mice responds to the intranasal application of this non-adapted avian virus.Th ough we did not prove the infectious virus in lungs of mice following A/Duck application even aft er its multiple passaging in mice, we detected virus-specifi c vRNA till day 8 post infection.Moreover, we detected virus-specifi c mRNA and de novo synthesized viral nucleoprotein (NP) and membrane protein (M1) in lungs of mice on day 2 and 4 aft er exposure to A/Duck.Virus-specifi c antibodies in sera of these mice were detectable by ELISA already aft er a single intranasal dose of A/Duck virus.Not only antibodies specifi c to the surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) were induced, but also antibodies specifi c to the NP and M1 of IAV were detected by Western blot and their titers increased aft er the second exposure of mice to this virus.Importantly, antibodies neutralizing virus A/Duck were proved in mouse immune sera aft er the second dose of virus and a slight increase of mRNA expression of immune mediators tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and IP10 has been observed in lungs of these mice 48 hr aft er the infection.Th ese observations correspond to the limited replication ability of the virus in mice and provided an important information about its ability to induce virusspecifi c antibodies, including those neutralizing virus, even without the previous virus adaptation to the new mammalian host.Such antibodies could consequently infl uence the immune potential of exposed individuals and their defensive capability against the newly emerged, even more virulent IAV.",

    "abstract": "The primary objectives of hepatitis B treatment include improved clinical and histological progression as well as virus eradication. For many years, lamivudine was a first-line therapy for treating hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. However, its long-term use is associated with high resistance rates (up to 70% after 5 years) due to mutations in the viral YMDD motif. The purpose of this study was to outline factors responsible for the development of viral resistance during long-term lamivudine therapy. Initially, 230 patients receiving lamivudine therapy for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection were enrolled in the study. All subjects received follow-ups in the first year to assess viral and biochemical responses. Only 136 and 104 patients received follow-up assessments during the second and third years of treatment, respectively. Viral breakthrough (VBT) occurred in 49 of 230 patients (21.3%). Hepatitis B \"e\" antigen (HBeAg) status before treatment was significantly associated with VBT in the first 2 years of treatment; however, this effect was not significant in the third year. Pre-treatment HBV DNA levels were predictive of VBT in the HBeAg-positive subgroup after all years of treatment (P = 0.001, P = 0.002, and P = 0.002, respectively). These levels were also predictive in the HBeAg-negative subgroup after 1 year of treatment (P = 0.001). In resource-poor communities, financial concerns drive the selection of antiviral therapy to treat CHB. Lamivudine monotherapy is a relatively cheap and effective treatment to manage CHB. However, consistent follow-ups and treatment modifications appear essential to prevent long-term treatment failure.",

    "abstract": "Synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) is induced as an early response to viral challenges. Here, we studied effects of endogenous and exogenous NO on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) genome replication, using a persistently RSV infected macrophage-like cell line. NO was evaluated indirectly by nitrites accumulation and it was increased in infected macrophages with respect to non-infected cells. Phagocytosis of bacteria by persistently RSV infected macrophages increased nitrites production, and under such conditions the number of RSV-genome copies decreased up to 8.7-fold, whereas chemical inhibition of the inducible-NO synthase enzyme increased viral replication 2.7-fold. Since phagocytosis activates many signaling pathways, which could contribute to viral control, we explored the individual effect of NO by using the NO donor SNAP. Intriguingly, even though SNAP raised nitrites levels up to 3-fold, the number of RSV genome copies augmented 2.3-fold. This enhancement was associated with lengthening of the G0/G1 cell cycle phase mediated by the NO donor, as evaluated by BrdU/7-AAD incorporation through flow cytometry; this phase of the cell cycle was favorable for an increased RSV genome replication. Thus, NO produced endogenously during RSV persistence was not enough to control virus replication, although macrophage activation through phagocytosis inhibited replication of the persistent viral genome. In contrast, the NO donor SNAP increased viral genome replication, at least partially by altering the cell cycle, indicating that both sources of NO were not bioequivalent.  Keywords: cell cycle; endogenous nitric oxide; exogenous nitric oxide; nitric oxide donor; respiratory syncytial virus; viral persistence.",

Here, we report viral RNA transcription and L1 capsid protein expression in long-term BPV1 virion-infected S. cerevisiae culture. Northern blot hybridization showed that viral RNA was detected in long-term BPV1-infected S. cerevisiae cultures (82-108 days). The levels of the viral RNA transcription varied significantly over the long time period, which showed active transcription at an early stage (Day 3 to Day 16), weak transcription at a middle stage (Day 23 to Day 45) and stable transcription at the late stage of culture (Day 55 to Day 82/85/95). Three major BPV1 transcripts of 4.3, 2.6 and 1.8 Kb were identified, with 4.3 Kb a minor transcript and the 1.8 Kb the most prominent transcript compared with the 2.6 Kb species. Immunoblotting showed that L1 capsid protein was expressed, with its variable amounts corresponding to the levels of RNA transcription over the time period. 35S-methionine/cysteine labeling and immunoprecipitation proved that the detected L1 protein was newly synthesized in BPV1-infected S. cerevisiae cultures. 33.3-54.2% of the cell colonies expressed L1 protein. Thus, the S. cerevisiae system, as a promising model, may be used not only for the study of virus like particle formation of BPV1 in vitro, but also for further functional analysis of individual viral genes in BPV1 life cycle.

    "abstract": "Nora virus is a RNA picorna-like virus that produces a persistent infection in Drosophila melanogaster. The genome is approximately 12,300 bases and is divided into four open reading frames (ORFs). Structurally, there are four important viral proteins: VP3, VP4A, VP4B, and VP4C. Three proteins (VP4A, VP4B, and VP4C) that form the virion's capsid are encoded by ORF 4, which produces a polyprotein that is post-translationally cleaved. The fourth protein (VP3) is encoded by ORF 3 and it is hypothesized to play a role in virion stability. The genes for these proteins were individually cloned into Escherichia coli, expressed, and the proteins were purified. Virus-like particles (VLPs) were assembled in vitro by mixing the proteins together in different combinations and measured via electron microscopy. Assemblies that contained VP4A and/or VP3 created VLPs with similar sizes to purified empty Nora virus capsids, potentially indicating that VP4A and/or VP3 are vital for Nora virus capsid structure, assembly, and/or stability. Not only does this study provide insight into the role of Nora virus proteins, but it may also lead to a deeper understanding of how Nora virus or other picorna-like viruses undergo assembly. Keywords: RNA viruses; Nora virus; picorna-like virus; virus-like particles; capsid assembly.",

Results obtained by BiFC further confirmed the self-interaction of P3, and the subcellular localization of reconstituted YFP fluorescence was observed mainly in nuclei of Nicotiana benthamiana leaf epidermal cells. Domains involved in P3/P3 self-interaction were analyzed by YTHS and BiFC using deletion mutants. The results showed that R domain (residues 1-61) in the N-terminus could self-interact, and it also interacted with the S domain (residues 62-199) in the C-terminus of P3. The present work would serve as a molecular basis for further characterization of CABYV proteins, and the regions involved in P3/P3 self-interaction could provide the clue for understanding the capsid assembly pathway of CABYV.",

In this work, we succeeded in establishing a latent infection of HeLa and CGL1 cell lines with non-oncogenic murine gammaherpesvirus 76 (MHV-76), which differs from MHV-68 and MHV-78 besides by oncogenicity also by deletion of M1-M4 genes and eight tRNA-like sequences. Viral latency in these cell lines, λHeLa and λCGL1, was demonstrated by the presence of viral DNA, suppression of viral latency-associated ORF73 gene and appearance of low amounts of infectious virus following treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Both latently infected cell lines showed irregular presence of viral antigen originating apparently from spontaneous reactivation. The growth of latently infected cells in culture was similar to that of non-infected ones. The latently-infected λHeLa cells did not induce tumors in mice following subcutaneous inoculation. These results (i) confirm that MHV-76 is the only non-oncogenic murine gammaherpesvirus of all the so far tested ones, (ii) suggest that some of the genes deleted in MHV-76 might be responsible for the oncogenicity of murine gammaherpesviruses, (iii) confirm that viral ORF73 is one of major latency-associated genes that is suppressed during virus reactivation, and (iv) present MHV-76 as another murine gammaherpesvirus useful as a model for study of gammaherpesvirus pathogenesis, oncogenicity, latency and reactivation.",

The respective HSV strains were isolated by cocultivation of blood leukocytes from chronically infected animals and cultures of the tumour cells with human embryo fibroblasts (HEF). HSV and Gross murine leukaemia virus antigens were detected in tumour cells by immunofluorescence and radioimmunoassay, respectively, and HSV antigen by immunofluorescence also in cultures of tumour cells and in cells of the brains, spinal cords, livers and spleens of the animals. HSV antibody was demonstrable in the blood serum from chronically infected tumour-bearing mice in a titre of 32.",

    "abstract": "Current therapy of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) involves the use of a combination of at least three antiviral drugs to inhibit Human immunodeficiency virus 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and 2, in short HIV) replication via targeting of viral reverse transcriptase and protease. However, all anti-HIV drugs give rise to the new retroviral resistant strains. Therefore, new therapeutic agents against the emerging resistant HIV strains without secondary effects are very much needed. In HIV infection, the integration of viral DNA obtained from RNA genome into the chromosome of the host cell by viral integrase (IN) is essential for an effective viral replication. Moreover, no cellular IN has been found in the cells suggesting that viral IN appears to be one of the best candidates for the development of an antiviral drug. In recent years, promising results have proved that IN inhibitors are useful for treatment of retroviral infections. In this review, we briefly introduce IN and summarize potential inhibitors of IN, which are classified into several groups according to their origin and chemical structure. The resistance to the IN inhibitors is also discussed. Currently, several IN inhibitors are either being used in the clinical treatment or tested in clinical trials. Nevertheless, a great effort must be made to elicit wide knowledge with respect to the design of better viral inhibitors and the synthesis of new chemical derivatives with an anti-HIV activity.",

One of the explanations for why can be the composition of respiratory tract microbiota. In this article, we review studies linking respiratory tract microbiome and its changes during COVID-19 infection. The respiratory tract microbiome helps shape immunity and it is assumed that it can affect the outcome of several viral infections. Several studies show differences in the microbial composition of the respiratory tract between COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals. The diversity of the respiratory tract microbiome is reduced with increasing severity of COVID-19.",

Its realization enabled monitoring of the impact of booster vaccination doses and the spread of the Omicron variant in a defined group of people. The total seropositivity of the involved SAS employees in autumn 2022 was 96.04%. In the group of vaccinated participants (1,189) the seropositivity rate was 99.5%, while among unvaccinated participants (176) it was 72.73%. By October 2022, when the study was conducted, 65.05% (888) of the participants have had a positive PCR/Ag test for SARS-CoV-2 at least once. Based on the presence of antibodies against the nucleoprotein (NCP) of SARS-CoV-2 it was proven, that 27.39% of participants (25.12% of vaccinated; 51.22% of non-vaccinated) who have never had a positive PCR/Ag test for SARS-CoV-2, overcame the COVID-19. According to self-assessment of the disease course, it was shown that a severe course occurred in 6.31% of the participants who overcame the disease without prior vaccination and in 1.44% of the participants who overcame COVID-19 after completing the baseline vaccination scheme. The most significant finding of the study is the evidence of significantly lower levels of specific antibodies after overcoming the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, and thus its reduced immunogenicity compared to ancestral virus and earlier variants of concern.",

The amplified PCR products were then subcloned and sequenced using a Sanger sequence analysis. As a result, 19 types of spliced DNA were identified, 11 of which were assumed to be putative novel spliced DNA. These spliced DNA were doubly spliced with varied splice donor sites and splice acceptor sites. In addition to the frequently detected HBV SP1, SP2, and SP4, we also identified 11 putative novel spliced DNA in the serum.

    "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has a highly variable course that is dependent on the host immune system reaction. Lung tissue damage, endothelial dysfunction, and microthrombosis in severe COVID-19 is linked to neutrophilia and the production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Previous studies have shown that NETs are involved in the pathology of COVID-19 and that the virus itself induces NET formation, although the underlying mechanisms are not clear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the induction of NETs by SARS-CoV-2 in vitro . We have found that both, infectious and heat-inactivated virus induce NETs formation. Surprisingly, cell culture media derived from uninfected Vero cells exhibit similar potency. This suggests that NET inducers other than the virus might be involved. Mitochondria released from dying cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection acting as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) were identified as potential contributors to neutrophil activation and NET formation. Our findings point to an important source of bias when analyzing NETs induction by SARS-CoV-2 in vitro , but also the immune reaction to viruses in general. Further implications for the understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis remain to be elucidated.",

Anti-N IgG antibodies were measured using rapid serological tests (UNscience ® ). The population was divided into four Cohorts, according to the history of SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination status with the whole inactivated virus vaccine BBIBP-CorV (Vero Cell ® , Sinopharm), as follows: Cohort I—confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, not vaccinated with the BBIBP-CorV vaccine; Cohort II—without confirmed SARS- CoV-2 infection, vaccinated with the BBIBP-CorV vaccine; Cohort III—confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccinated with the BBIBP-CorV vaccine; Cohort IV—without confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, not vaccinated with the BBIBP-CorV vaccine (silent immunization). Cohorts I and IV included patients vaccinated with vaccines other than the BBIBP-CorV vaccine. The results showed that the overall prevalence of anti-N IgG antibodies was 56.5%, with the highest seroprevalence in Cohort III at 85.8%. In Cohort IV, the prevalence of anti-N IgG antibodies was 40.7%, attributed to silent immunization. The results also suggest that the prevalence of anti-N IgG antibodies decreased over time but remained detectable for more than 12 months in Cohort I. Since currently, there is no data on silent infection frequency in our country, these findings may provide insight into the extent of silent infections in the Serbian population.",

    "abstract": "Since the last century, the spread of the genotype 2 classical swine fever virus (CSFV) has caused significant issues for the pig breeding industries. Ideal strategies for controlling CSFV include vaccination and keeping farms free of CSFV. For vaccination, several attenuated CSFV viruses originating from genotype 1 are widely used; for the latter, accurate diagnosis is required for detection of the CSFV infection. Nucleic acid testing for CSFV usually uses tonsil samples, which requires an inconvenient sampling operation that injures pigs. Commercial serological tests for CSFV antibodies or antigens are unable to distinguish the genotype for originating virus. In this study, 20 mAbs were developed from the mice hybridoma cells. Four of the mAbs were identified to have the ability to only recognize the peptides derived from sub-genotype 2.1 strain, and two of them, MM1 and MM5, were further studied to identify critical binding sites (epitopes) on the E2 protein of CSFV. A total of 353 genotype 2 collections were made worldwide in GeneBank, 90.9% of which contained MM1 or MM5 epitopes. Moreover, 95.1% of sub-genotype 2.1 isolations contained MM5 epitope. Therefore, MM1 and MM5 have the potential to be developed as a diagnostic tool for detection of genotype 2 virus antigen by indirect ELISA or antibodies by competitive ELISA.",

We showed that pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1) infection significantly upregulates TFG expression in infected cells at an early stage. We speculated that PPMV-1 would inhibit IFN activation by upregulating a negative regulator of the IFN pathway. This hypothesis was proved when TFG protein expression was knocked down by RNAi and the replication level of PPMV-1 virus decreased, which indicated that TFG upregulation in the early infection stage benefit virus replication. We next used the IFN-β promoter reporter system to evaluate the role of the TFG in the IFN pathway. The results showed that the TFG inhibited the IFN-β expression stimulated by RIG-I, MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein) and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), but did not inhibit IFN-β activated by the interferon regulatory transcription factor 3 (IRF3), indicating that TFG may affect the function of TBK1, which play an important role in phosphorylation of the IRF3. Further experiments showed that the TFG inhibited the phosphorylation of TBK1, resulting in IRF3 being unable to be phosphorylated. Subsequent experiments on IFN pathway activation confirmed that the IRF3 phosphorylation level was significantly downregulated after overexpression of TFG, while the IFN-β promoter reporting experiment showed that TFG did not directly inhibit the IFN response activated by IRF3. This confirmed that TFG protein negatively regulates the IFN-β pathway by inhibiting TBK1 phosphorylation.",

    "abstract": "Effective control and monitoring the spread of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) relies upon rapid and accurate laboratory detection of FMD virus (FMDV). Therefore, in this report, a multiplex TaqMan probe-based one-step RT-qPCR assay simultaneously targeting FMDV 5′UTR and 3Dpol regions, and 18S rRNA housekeeping gene (as an internal control) in a single reaction tube was developed and evaluated. The multiplex one-step RT-qPCR assay specifically detected viral genome in both FMDV-infected cell culture suspensions and clinical samples collected from known-FMD infected animals. The assay could detect FMDV RNA in the archived FMDV cell culture isolates ( n = 120) collected during the last two decades in India. In addition, the new assay could also detect viral RNA in the FMD suspected clinical samples (n = 740) collected from various field outbreaks. At a cut-off Ct-value of &amp;lt;38, the assay could detect at least 20 and 10 copies of FMDV 3Dpol and 5′UTR genes, respectively. Further, the multiplex RT-qPCR assay proved to be robust, showing an inter-assay co-efficient of variations ranging from 1.3% to 3.03% for FMDV-3Dpol gene target, and from 1.44% to 4.69% for 5′UTR gene target. In addition, it was found that the new assay could be used to detect viral genome in a variety of samples (epithelium, saliva, OPF, milk and blood) without any significance difference in the detection limit of the assay. Hence, the multiplex one-step RT-qPCR assay could be considered a valuable tool for the detection of FMDV in India.",

    "abstract": "Rat hepatitis E virus (RHEV/HEV-C1, species Rocahepevirus ratti ) is an emerging zoonotic pathogen, posing an increasing threat to public health worldwide. This study was conducted for better understanding the epidemiology and evolution of RHEV. The isolates sampled so far can be divided into two major genotypes designated a and b. According to the phylogeography, while type a has been detected in four continents, type b is restricted to East and Southeast Asia. Recombination analysis identified three chimeric isolates. Bayesian coalescent analysis suggested that RHEV began to expand around 1956 and was evolving at a high rate. Codon usage bias analysis revealed that RHEV genes are rich in G/C and have additional bias independent of compositional constraints. In codon usage, RHEV is both similar to and different from the major host Norway rat ( Rattus norvegicus ). Furthermore, unlike many other mammalian RNA viruses, RHEV does not mirror hosts’ marked suppression of “CG” and “TA”.",

The aim of this study was to analyze this phenomenon in more detail using a Chinese vaccine strain (S191) of MV. Flow cytometry confirmed apparent downregulation of SLAM in the virus-infected cells and in the cells transfected with a plasmid expressing viral H. Moreover, a similar effect was obtained by incubation of the cells with UV-inactivated virus or soluble viral H. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that the SLAM mRNA level remained stable during the virus infection, and Western blot analysis demonstrated that the SLAM content of total membrane proteins did not change change after the virus infection. Thus we conclude that SLAM expression is stable during the MV infection and that its apparent downregulation reported earlier and confirmed also in this study was just the result of masking of the antibody recognition sites on SLAM with MV H during the flow cytometry assay.",

NPC is relatively sensitive to radiotherapy, but the prognosis of patients in late stage is poor. The development of NPC is closely related to genetic background, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and life style. EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is an oncoprotein, which plays important roles in the tumorigenesis of NPC. LMP1 was reported to be involved in the regulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs) by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and other surface marker staining methods, but not shown by aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH-1) functional assay yet. In this study, we overexpressed LMP1 in two NPC cell lines and found elevated level of cytokeratin 19 (CK19) expression. CK19 is an undifferentiated keratin and a stem cell marker. We also have found an increased number of ALDH positive cells along with LMP1 overexpression in both cell lines. Our data demonstrate that LMP1 regulates the maintenance of ALDH-1 positive NPC cancer stem cells, thus shedding light on target therapy of NPC in clinical application.

    "abstract": "The use of live attenuated vaccine (LAV) is the main method for controlling infectious bronchitis (IB). It is advisable to develop a LAV using a dominant serotype in the region in the case of vaccine failure. Since 793/B serotype is one of the most predominant circulating IB viruses in Iran, attenuation of three Iranian 793/B isolates (IR/773/2001, IR/794/2002 and IR/520/2002) was done by serial passaging in specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs up to 90 passages to assess the degree of their attenuation to achieve a native LAV in the future. Virulence and pathogenicity of passage levels 15 and 90 of isolates 773 and 794 were compared using histopathology, ciliostasis and potency tests. The results showed a decrease in the virulence and pathogenicity of the isolates at passage 90 compared to passage 15, although this decrease in pathogenicity was very mild and viruses after passage 90 were not adequately attenuated. Each isolate underwent some amino acid changes at passage 90. In case of isolate 773 it was 5 aa changes, while in isolate 794 it was 19 aa changes. Some amino acid changes resulted in change into amino acid with different hydrophobicity characteristics. No amino acid change was found at passage level 15 compared to wild type viruses. Interestingly, we did not find previously reported change in amino acid 95 in passage levels 15 and 90.

We have converted alphasatellite into gene-silencing vector (modified alphasatellite (∆DNA 1)) by deleting its A-rich region that does not affect the replication nor the movement of the helper virus. Insertion of a transgene green florescence protein (GFP) into ∆DNA 1 resulted in the silencing g of the cognate gene in Nicotiana benthamiana. The silencing persisted for more than one and half month and was associated with the decreased level of mRNA of the target gene. This satellite-like DNA vector induced gene silencing (VIGS) promises to be applicable to other begomovirus/alphasatellite systems, thereby providing the powerful approach to gene discovery and the analysis of gene functions in malvaceous crops.

To date, the replicative cycle of this virus is not completely known, and the events as well as the role of cellular and viral proteins that participate in the infectious cycle of RSV are still a matter of intense research. An important protein that is a control point for many viruses is the helicase eIF4AI, which participates at the beginning of the cap-dependent translation of eukaryotes and cap-independent translation of certain viral mRNAs. Recently, eIF4AI has been considered as a potential viral therapeutic target. In order to understand the role of eIF4AI during the infectious cycle of RSV, we evaluated the effect of eIF4AI knockdown on the amount of positive-strand viral RNA and viral progeny of this virus. Our results showed a decrease for both parameters, suggesting a possible involvement of eIF4AI during replicative cycle of RSV. In addition, using confocal microscopy, it was observed that eIF4AI colocalized with RSV viral protein, supporting the possible participation of eIF4AI during the replicative cycle of RSV.

The CMV primers showed specific amplification, but the Tobamovirus and Potyvirus primers did not. We further cloned and sequenced the 2b, MP and CP genes of the CMV-Ah isolate.

It is considered a major health issue due to its high prevalence and the life-threatening consequences of chronic infection, including liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite widespread vaccination against HBV, millions of people live with chronic HBV infection. Existing antiviral therapies fail to achieve full HBV elimination, so most patients with the disease require lifelong treatment. The search for new antiviral therapy strategies is hindered by the limited availability of in vitro HBV infection models that are able to support the full HBV life cycle. Therefore, the development and optimization of cellular models are crucial to the search for drugs effective against HBV. In this study, we optimized an in vitro HBV infection model consisting of two cell lines: HepAD38 cells, which are able to produce infectious HBV; and HepG2-NTCP cells, which are susceptible to HBV infection. We showed that prolonged production of HBV in the donor cells and HBV inoculation of the acceptor cells simultaneously with seeding improves the established procedure. This modified protocol was proven effective in experiments involving compounds with known activity against HBV, suggesting its utility for future high-throughput screening.

In this study, we evaluate multiple HIV-1 Gag-specific lymphoproliferative responses and find their connection with cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T cell count and viral load from chronically HIV-1-infected patients. We further search for the correlation between multiple Gag-specific lymphoproliferative responses and changes in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen. We found correlation between Gag-specific responses and higher CD4+ T cells nadir and low HIV-1 viral load. Additionally, we observed that HIV-1-infected subjects did not need to change HAART regimen, when multiple Gag responses are present. We concluded that the start of HAART when CD4+ T cell nadir is the highest as possible may promote Gag-specific cellular responses conservation. Multiple Gag responses must be important to suppress HIV-1 replication. Preserved Gag-specific responses reduce HIV-1 viral load and are associated with stability of HAART regimen.

Preparations of L-cell culture interferon, dialysed and purified by carboxymethyl-Sephadex (G-25) column chromatography, showed an inhibitory effect on exogenous colony formation by bone marrow cells. The results suggested the presence in crude interferon preparations of a substance either inhibiting the anticellular effect of interferon or stimulating colony formation. The factor produced by thymus cells following their treatment with antilymphocyte serum inhibited colony formation by bone marrow cells and, unlike interferon, possessed no antiviral activity when tested in cell cultures.",

Desensitization phases were observed with the 2 shorter polypeptides. Sensitization was much faster and sensitivity maxima were considerably higher for the polyornithines than for the polylysines. Poly-D-lysine of AMW 160000 sensitized cells slightly faster than poly-L-lysine of AMW 140000, but gave about the same sensitivity maximum. Analysis of the slow cell sensitization by poly-L-lysine of AMW 140000 revealed 2 steps: a fast step 1 (attachment) and a slow step 2 (processing).",

Clear-cut stages of irritation and paralysis were distinguished in the course of infection of mice. The diagnosis of chronic rabies in mice was confirmed by immunofluorescence and isolation of virus by i.c. inoculation of mice. Electron microscopic examination of the Ammon's horn of mice revealed a slow development of morphological changes connected with the formation of virus-specific structures. The gradual increase in the number and size of aggregates of viral ribonucleoprotein was followed by the appearance of membranous and tubular structures. Along with the latter, typical bullet-shaped particles of rabies virus were found in some neurons on the 43rd day of infection.",

CAP-treated cells show a wide variety of mitochondrial alterations, frequently involving swelling of the organelle and loss of cristae orientation. IMV are generally severely disrupted, particularly in peripheral regions. In such configurations, strand-like material radiates in a spokelike fashion from the shell zone to adjacent cristae-matrix area. EB-treated cells also display considerable mitochondrial distortion evidenced primarily by the formation of small, localized multimembrane regions. IMV exposed to EB, however, are less structurally damaged than CAP-treated ones. The relative incidence of IMV production is enhanced approximately fourfold in EB-treated cells compared to CAP-treated ones, suggesting that virion synthesis may be under nuclear, rather than mitochondrial, control.",
