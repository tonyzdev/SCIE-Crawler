    "abstract": "In this paper, a new and facile approach for molybdate loading in the brown algae of Sargassum angustifolium is introduced. The molybdate ions were entered into the algae body during a short cultivation to produce algae-Mo as a novel adsorbent for eliminating phosphate ions from synthetic and real wastewaters. Results of the surface analysis showed that molybdate loading onto the algae was successfully performed. Herein, basic variables, such as initial solution pH, adsorbent dosage, contact time, phosphate concentration, and temperature, were investigated in detail to assess the phosphate adsorption performance of algae-Mo. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model fitted our acquired experimental kinetic data most appropriately, in comparison to the use of a pseudo-first-order model. The Langmuir model appeared to fit the adsorption data more desirably than that of Freundlich and Dubnin-Radushkevich models, with a maximum phosphate adsorption capacity of 149.25 mg/g at 25 °C. The finding of the thermodynamic study revealed that the phosphate adsorption onto algae-Mo was spontaneous, feasible, and endothermic in nature. The study on Mo2+ ions leaching strongly suggested that the risk of Mo2+ leakage during phosphate adsorption was negligible at a wide pH range of 3-9. The adsorption efficiency attained was 53.4% at the sixth cycle of reusability. Two real wastewaters with different qualities were successfully treated by the algae-Mo, suggesting that the algae-Mo could be ordered for practical wastewater treatment.",

    "abstract": "The need to overcome human threats from pathogenic microbes, development of nanomaterials have been provoked for a new generation of antimicrobials. In the present study, biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was acquired using Comamonas acidovorans extract within 72 h under static condition. Electron microscopy studies revealed that the size of AgNPs was ranging from 6-53 nm and had spherical, oval and irregular shapes with smooth surfaces. Prepared AgNPs interacted with proteins, carbohydrates and other aromatic molecules. Biosynthesized AgNPs were bactericidal, which significantly inhibited pathogenic microbes, i.e., Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Higher concentrations of AgNPs (20 μg ml-1) inhibited 92-98% growth of all tested bacteria within 24 h. AgNPs-protein network studies carried out to recognize the protein interactions with AgNPs and to understand probable bactericidal mechanisms. AgNPs may penetrate into cell through membrane proteins and damage them by modifying amino acids. Due to AgNPs-protein interactions, dysfunctions in enzymes obstruct certain metabolic processes, which cause the bacteria to die eventually. In certain pathogenic microbes, cue and cus systems detoxify Ag+ ions, transport through transporter proteins and expel them to the extracellular space, which are mainly responsible for Ag resistance.",

    "abstract": "Xylitol production was compared in fed batch fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains overexpressing xylose reductase (XR) genes from Candida tropicalis, Pichia stipitis, Neurospora crassa, and an endogenous gene GRE3. The gene encoding a xylose specific transporter (SUT1) from P. stipitis was cloned to improve xylose transport and fed batch fermentation was used with glucose as a cosubstrate to regenerate NADPH. Xylitol yield was near theoretical for all the strains in fed batch fermentation. The highest volumetric (0.28 gL-1 h-1) and specific (34 mgg-1 h-1) xylitol productivities were obtained by the strain overexpressing GRE3 gene, while the control strain showed 7.2 mgg-1 h-1 specific productivity. The recombinant strains carrying XR from C. tropicalis, P. stipitis, and N. crassa produced xylitol with lower specific productivity of 14.3, 6.8, and 6.3 mgg-1 h-1, respectively, than GRE3 overexpressing strain. The glucose fed as cosubstrate was converted to biomass and ethanol, while xylose was only converted to xylitol. The efficiency of ethanol production was in the range of 38-45 % of the theoretical maximum for all the strains. Xylitol production from the non-detoxified corncob hemicellulosic hydrolysate by recombinant S. cerevisiae was reported for the first time. Xylitol productivity was found to be equivalent in the synthetic xylose as well as hemicellulosic hydrolysate-based media showing no inhibition on the S. cerevisiae due to the inhibitors present in the hydrolysate. A systematic evaluation of heterologous XRs and endogenous GRE3 genes was performed, and the strain overexpressing the endogenous GRE3 gene showed the best xylitol productivity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Rice fields of Meghalaya especially in the coal mining belt receive water contaminated by effluents from mines that are known to carry harmful heavy metal ions such as Cu, Fe, Zn, Ni, Cd, As, Pb, Cr, etc. Cd exposure was analyzed in the cyanobacterium Nostoc muscorum Meg 1 isolated from a contaminated rice field in Sohra, Meghalaya, India. Toxicity study established 0.5 ppm on day 3 to be the LD 50 . At LD 50 chlorophyll a and total protein concentration was reduced by 50.9 and 52.5%, while nitrogenase and glutamine synthetase activities were inhibited by 40.8 and 38.4%. EDX and FTIR analyses confirmed Cd binding and participation of hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxyl and phosphate groups in biosorption of Cd onto the cell surfaces. SEM study established morphological changes. At pH 8.0 and temperature 25 ± 2 °C, the cyanobacterium removed 92% Cd within 24 h. Of this, 91% Cd was adsorbed on the cell surface while 4% was internally accumulated. The energy required for internal accumulation of Cd was partly provided in the form of ATP synthesized during active photosynthesis. The Langmuir isotherm was found best fitted with a R 2 value 0.98 when compared to Freundlich and Temkin adsorption isotherms. The maximum sorption capacity, Q max, of the organism was 71.4 mg of Cd per g of biomass. R L value of 0.29 indicated favorable interaction between cyanobacterial biomass and Cd. The adsorption intensity, n value 7.69 g/L obtained from Freundlich isotherm showed that the organism possessed high Cd sorption capacity.",

Total flavonoids and total phenolics were also evaluated spectrophotometrically. The ethyl acetate fraction contained the highest total flavonoid and total phenolic content and exhibited the highest antioxidant activities (185.2 ± 14.5 and 208.7 ± 17.5 mg/g dry extract for FRAP and CUPRAC values, respectively). The total phenolic and total flavonoid content ranged from 58.2 ± 1.4 to 102.4 ± 8.6 and 19.6 ± 0.5 to 64.3 ± 0.8 mg/g dry extract, respectively. The results of DPPH assay showed that ethyl acetate fractions had the least IC50 values (0.12 ± 0.002, 0.04 ± 0.0006, in mg/mL for orange and hallabong samples, respectively) followed by the hexane fraction (0.19 ± 0.007 mg/mL) of the orange sample. For all fractions, the antioxidant activity and contents of total phenolics and total flavonoids correlated well with each other. In vitro investigation of the antiplatelet effect showed that ethyl acetate fraction has the highest inhibition (84.3 ± 5.8 to 96.1 ± 1.8 %). Hexane and MeOH fractions of hallabong and orange samples inhibited platelet aggregations by less than or equal to 41 %.",

    "abstract": "Abstract To analyze the intestinal microbiota diversity of several important economic fishes in the Loudi area and its correlation with the microbiota of water environment, the high-throughput sequencing based on the bacteria 16S rRNA was used to analyze the intestinal microbiota diversity in fish intestines and water. The results revealed that half of the OTUs in the water sample could be detected in the fish intestine, the proportion of shared OTUs in the intestines of Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and water samples was only 22%, and the unique OTU in the LC group was relatively the highest in the fish intestinal group. It can be seen from the analysis in NMDS analysis, the distance between Hypophthalmichthys molitrix group and water group is relatively farthest. Ctenopharyngodon idellus has the highest microbiota richness and diversity ( P &lt; 0.05), while the water samples have the lowest microbiota richness ( P &lt; 0.05). Firmicutes, Methylocaldum and Bacillus are the prevalent taxonomic unit in the Aristichthys nobilis and Carassius auratus groups, Anaerospora is the prevalent genera in the Hypophthalmichthys molitrix group, Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria have a high relative abundance ratio in the Ctenopharyngodon idellus group, and the prevalent taxonomic unit in the water sample group are Phenylobacterium , Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. In conclusion, fish species have different prevalent microbiota. There are a strong correlation between fish intestinal microbiota and the water environment, and the fish with a weak correlation is Hypophthalmichthys molitrix . Results of this study will contribute to the prevention and treatment of fish diseases and the fish ecological culturing in Loudi area.",

    "abstract": "Abstract MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of small noncoding RNA molecules with significant capacity to regulate the gene expression at the post-transcriptional level in a sequence-specific manner either through translation repression or mRNA degradation triggering a fine-tuning biological impact. They have been implicated in several processes, including cell growth and development, signal transduction, cell proliferation and differentiation, metabolism, apoptosis, inflammation, and immune response modulation. However, over the last few years, extensive studies have shown the relevance of miRNAs in human pathophysiology. Common human parasitic diseases, such as Malaria, Leishmaniasis, Amoebiasis, Chagas disease, Schistosomiasis, Toxoplasmosis, Cryptosporidiosis, Clonorchiasis, and Echinococcosis are the leading cause of death worldwide. Thus, identifying and characterizing parasite-specific miRNAs and their host targets, as well as host-related miRNAs, are important for a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of parasite-specific diseases at the molecular level. In this review, we have demonstrated the impact of human microRNAs during host−parasite interaction as well as their potential to be used for diagnosis and prognosis purposes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Plant-derived nanomaterials (PDNM) have gained significant attention recently due to their potential pharmacological applications against pathogenic microbes, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and certain metabolic diseases. This review introduces the concept of PDNMs and their unique properties, including their small size, high surface area, and ability to penetrate biological barriers. Besides various methods for synthesizing PDNMs, such as green synthesis techniques that utilize plant extracts and natural compounds, the advantages of using plant-derived materials, such as their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and low toxicity, were elucidated. In addition, it examines the recent and emerging trends in nanomaterials derived from plant approaches to combat antimicrobial resistance and metabolic diseases. The sizes of nanomaterials and their surface areas are vital as they play essential roles in the interactions and relationships between these materials and the biological components or organization. We critically analyze the biomedical applications of nanoparticles which include antibacterial composites for implantable devices and nanosystems to combat antimicrobial resistance, enhance antibiotic delivery, and improve microbial diagnostic/detection systemsIn addition, plant extracts can potentially interfere with metabolic syndrome pathways; hence most nano-formulations can reduce chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, lipid profile, and antimicrobial resistance. As a result, these innovative plant-based nanosystems may be a promising contender for various pharmacological applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Oleanolic acid (OA) is a triterpenoid that occurs naturally and may be isolated from various plants. Analogs of oleanolic acid can be produced artificially or naturally. The current treatments have limited selectivity and may also impact normal cells. OA and its derivatives provide a promising cancer treatment platform with greater selectivity and less toxic effects. As a result of their enhanced sensitivity, selectivity, and low toxicity, they are great options for focusing on particular biological pathways and reducing the growth of tumor cells. The effects of OA and derivatives of OA on various cancer types have been investigated. However, breast and hepatocellular malignancies are the most studied cancers. In breast cancer, derivatives such as saikosaponin A (SSa), saikosaponin B (SSb), and SZC014 influence key pathways such as the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT), protein kinase-B (Akt), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathways, inhibiting metastasis, angiogenesis, and cell migration, respectively. When a para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)/nitric oxide (NO) derivative of OA is administered to HepG2 cells, the reactive oxygen species (ROS)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated mitochondrial pathway causes apoptosis. Nanoformulations incorporating OA, such as OA-paclitaxel (PTX), show potential for suppressing tumor progression by inhibiting drug efflux mechanisms. Thus, exploring the interactions of OA and a few of its derivatives with various cellular pathways offers a promising approach to combating different types of cancer. This review delves into the potential of oleanolic acid and its derivatives in retarding cancer progression through their interactions with diverse cellular pathways.",

Utilizing high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing and the PICRUSt2 pipeline, the research assessed the influence of plant species, organ (leaf/root), and fertilizer type on these microbial communities. Findings revealed that plant species and organ type significantly shaped endophytic bacterial community composition and diversity. Onion communities were distinct, and roots exhibited higher diversity and richness compared to leaves. Fertilizer type significantly impacted overall bacterial diversity, with CF farms showing higher diversity than OF. Microbial network analysis identified keystone taxa, including network hubs like Serratia and Streptomyces , and module hubs like Solirubrobacter , Corynebacterium , and Mycobacterium . Functional predictions indicated diverse metabolic capabilities, with organ type significantly affecting pathway abundance (leaves enriched in carbohydrate degradation, roots in nutrient metabolism/degradation). OF farms showed higher predicted abundance of some potential virulence pathways, while CF farms had higher abundance of certain biotechnological pathways. Vegetable nutrient content significantly correlated with both bacterial community composition and predicted metabolic pathways. This study highlights the complex interplay between farming practices, plant factors, endophytic microbiomes, and their functional potential, underscoring implications for vegetable microbiological quality and potential human health.",

    "abstract": "Molecular typing of 377 female date palm trees belonging to 18 Libyan cultivars and representing common genotypes in the central Libyan oasis of Al Jufrah was performed using 16 highly polymorphic microsatellite or SSR loci. A total of 110 alleles with an average of 6.88 alleles per locus were scored indicating the high level of polymorphism existing among the cultivars thus allowing their genetic fingerprinting. Moreover 28 alleles out of 110 were fixed. All the cultivars were characterized by negative values of the Fixation Index (F) due to an excess of heterozygotes with respect to HW equilibrium. The pattern of genetic diversity among cultivars was estimated by codominant genetic distances and presented by principal coordinates analysis (PCoA). The observed pattern evidences the genetic diversity existing among cultivars that allow distinguishing them easily. The average dissimilarity internal to each cultivar ranged from 0 to 21. Seven cultivars showed value zero indicating no genetic difference within cultivar in agreement with their Fixation Index (F = 1). A varietal identification key was also built using multiloci genotyping with only three microsatellite loci that identified 23 alleles in total. The possibility to attribute the unknown male plant to a cultivar was also considered and male parentage analysis was performed. Fifty-five male plants out of 63 were assigned to a definite cultivar with high confidence level. The positive result obtained in identifying males confirmed the suitability of SSR for clone fingerprinting and cultivar identification, thus opening new prospects for date palm breeding.",

Clinical failure of clindamycin therapy has been reported due to multiple mechanisms that confer resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and Streptogramin B (MLSB) antibiotics. In vitro routine tests for clindamycin susceptibility may fail to detect inducible clindamycin resistance due to erm genes, resulting in the treatment failure. Although data from the developed countries have shown to be enormity of the problem, data from the developing countries are lacking. The aim of the study was to distinguish different resistance phenotypes in erythromycin-resistant S. aureus by a simple double-disc diffusion test (D test). A total of 153 S. aureus isolates were subjected to routine antibiotic susceptibility testing, including cefoxitin disc (30 μg) and by oxacillin screen agar. Inducible clindamycin resistance was tested by 'D test' as per CLSI guidelines. Odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) were calculated. P values were calculated using SPSS (version 18). Among 153 S. aureus isolates, 42 (27.45 %) were resistant to methicillin, whereas 111 (72.54 %) were methicillin susceptible. Out of the 63 (41.17 %) erythromycin-resistant S. aureus isolates, 14 (9.15 %) showed inducible resistance [P = 0.0002, odds ratio (OR) 18.30; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 8.72-25.77), 20 (13.07 %)] showed constitutive resistance (P = 0.002, OR 14.38, 95 % CI 5.33-21.49), while the remaining 29 (18.95 %) showed inducible phenotype. Inducible and constitutive resistance was found to be higher in MSSA when compared with MRSA. Clinical laboratories should perform D test routinely to guide the clinicians about the inducible clindamycin resistance and to prevent misuse of antibiotics.",

The produced biosurfactant has showed active emulsification and surface-active properties. From the kinetic growth modeling, the specific growth rate was calculated on sawdust and it was 1.12 day-1. The maximum estimated value of product yield on biomass growth (Yp/x) was 1.02 g/g. The important medium components identified by the Plackett-Burman method were sawdust and glycerol along with culture parameter pH. Box-Behnken response surface methodology was applied to optimize biosurfactant production. The obtained experimental result concludes that Box-Behnken designs are very effective statistical tools to improve biosurfactant production. These results may be useful to develop a high efficient production process of biosurfactant. In addition, this type of kinetic modeling approach may constitute a useful tool to design and scaling-up of bioreactors for the production of biosurfactant.",

    "abstract": "Arid regions pose a serious problem for crop production by suppressing plant growth. The use of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) as bioinoculant may be promising to enhance the crop yield in arid conditions. In the present investigation, four strains of cultivable bacteria associated with the rhizosphere of Saccharum L. grown in arid region were isolated using N-free media. Assessment of their nitrogen-fixing ability through amplification of nifH gene showed the presence of nifH gene (390 bp) in only one (MDB4) of the four isolates. The nitrogen-fixing potential of this isolate was confirmed by the presence of nitrogenase activity determined using acetylene reduction assay. The diazotrophic MDB4 isolate also exhibited other PGPR traits, such as the production of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and ammonia. In pot experiments, inoculation of Bt-cotton seeds with MDB4 enhanced the growth of plants as shown by significant increase in plant height (68.41 %), shoot dry weight (58.44 %) and root dry weight (64.81 %) over untreated control. The MDB4 strain was Gram negative and identified as Brevundimonas sp. on the basis of phenotypic, biochemical, phylogenetic and 16S rRNA gene sequencing data. It is concluded that the MDB4 bacterial strain having different plant growth promoting activities can be considered as a beneficial microbe for sustainable agriculture in arid regions.",

    "abstract": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain (NOD) receptors are pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and play crucial role in innate immunity. In addition to PAMPs, PRRs recognize endogenous molecules released from damaged tissue or dead cells [damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)] and activate signaling cascades to induce inflammatory processes. In the aquatic environment, large variation in seasonal and diurnal water temperature causes heat and cold stresses in fish, resulting in tissue injury and mortality of fish. In the Indian subcontinent, catla (Catla catla) is an economically important freshwater fish species and is prone to thermal stresses. To investigate the response of pattern recognition receptors in thermal stress, we analyzed TLRs (TLR2, TLR4 and TLR5) and NOD (NOD1 and NOD2) receptors gene expression in catla following heat and cold stress. Analysis of tissue samples (gill, liver, kidney and blood) of the thermal stressed and control fish by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay revealed significant (p < 0.05) induction of TLR2, TLR4 and NOD2 gene expression in majority of the tested tissues of the treated fish as compared to the control. The expression of TLR5 and NOD1 gene was also induced in the heat and cold stressed fish, but mostly restricted in the blood. The downstream signaling molecule of TLR and NOD signaling pathway viz., MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88) and RICK (receptor interacting serine-threonine protein kinase-2) was also induced in the thermal stressed fish suggesting the engagement of TLR and NOD signaling pathway during thermal stress.",

Optimization has been carried out in two stages using statistical experimental design, viz. medium optimization and optimization of fermentation parameters. For medium optimization, Plackett-Burman design followed by central composite design (CCD) was used, while for optimization of fermentation parameters one-variable-at-a-time method followed by CCD was used. Carbon and nitrogen sources in the medium have been revealed to be the significant factors for enzyme production (carboxymethylcellulose 18.05 g/L; yeast extract 8 g/L and peptone 2 g/L). The inorganic salts have been found to be insignificant components of medium. Optimum fermentation parameters for optimized medium were: initial medium pH 5.65, incubation temperature = 40 °C, shaking speed = 120 rpm, and inoculum size = 6.96 %, v/v. Interestingly, the influence of all four parameters was almost independent with no interlinks. Secondly, the overall effect of all parameters was also low, as indicated by linear, square and interaction regression coefficients that were at least one order of magnitude lower than the intercept in the model equation. These results essentially meant that medium components dominate overall enzyme production process in comparison to fermentation parameters.",

In present study, the efficiency of pure isolates, i.e., Geobacillus thermoparaffinivorans IR2, Geobacillus stearothermophillus IR4 and Bacillus licheniformis MN6 and mixed consortium on degradation of long-chain n -alkanes C 32 and C 40 was investigated by batch cultivation test. Biodegradation efficiencies were found high for C 32 by mixed consortium (90%) than pure strains, while the pure strains were better in degradation of C 40 than mixed consortium (87%). In contrast, the maximum alkane hydroxylase activities (161 µmol mg −1 protein) were recorded in mixed consortium system that had supplied with C 40 as sole carbon source. Also, the alcohol dehydrogenase (71 µmol mg −1 protein) and lipase activity (57 µmol mg −1 protein) were found high. Along with the enzyme activities, the hydrophobicity natures of the bacterial strains were found to determine the degradation efficiency of the hydrocarbons. Thus, the study suggested that the hydrophobicity of the bacteria is a critical parameter to understand the biodegradation of n -alkanes.",

Biosurfactant production was performed using bacteria associated with Callyspongia diffusa, a marine sponge inhabiting the southern coast of India. A total of 101 sponge-associated bacteria were isolated on different media, of which 29 isolates showed positive result for biosurfactant production. Among the 29 positive isolates, four were selected based on highest emusification activity and were identified based on 16S rDNA sequence analysis. These isolates were identified as Bacillus subtilis MB-7, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens MB-101, Halomonas sp. MB-30 and Alcaligenes sp. MB-I9. The 16S rDNA nucleotide sequences were deposited in GenBank with accession numbers KF493730, KJ540939, KJ414418 and KJ540940, respectively. Based on the highest oil displacement activity and effective surface tension reduction potential, the isolate B. amyloliquefaciens MB-101 was selected for further optimization and structural delineation. The production of biosurfactant by the isolate was significantly enhanced up to 6.76 g/l with optimal concentration values of 2.83 % for glycerol, 2.65 % for peptone, 20.11 mM for ferrous sulfate and 74 h of incubation by employing factorial design. The structural features of the purified biosurfactant from B. amyloliquefaciens MB-101 showed similarity with lipopeptide class of biosurfactant. In conclusion, the present study emphasizes the utilization of marine sponge-associated bacteria for the production of biosurfactant that may find various applications.",

Fusarium is one of the important phytopathogenic genera associated with dieback symptoms of olive trees. The objective of the present study was to confirm the pathogenicity of Fusarium spp. isolated from several olive-growing areas in Tunisia. According to the pathogenic test done on young olive trees (cv. Chemlali), 23 out of 104 isolates of Fusarium spp. were found to be pathogenic and the others were weakly or not pathogenic. The pathogenic Fusarium spp. isolates were characterized using molecular methods based on ITS PCR. Isolation results revealed the predominance of Fusarium solani (56.5%) and F. oxysporum species (21.7%) compared to F. chalmydosporum (8.7%), F. brachygibbosum (8.7%) and F. acuminatum (4.34%). Based on pathogenicity test, disease severity was highly variable among the 23 pathogenic isolates tested (P < 0.05) where F. solani was the most aggressive dieback agent. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that shows that Fusarium spp. might be a major agent causing dieback disease of olive trees in Tunisia.",

Establishment of a highly efficient plant regeneration system from shoot apex explants applicable to many cultivars of indica rice will accelerate the application of transformation technology in breeding programs and functional genomics study. We established an efficient shoot multiplication and plant regeneration system from shoot apices of indica rice using thidiazuron (TDZ) as a plant growth regulator. Shoot apices cultured on MS basal medium devoid of plant growth regulators formed solitary shoots in 90% of cultures. Addition of TDZ or benzylaminopurine to regeneration medium significantly influenced formation of multiple shoots directly from shoot apex explants without an intervening callus stage. Best shoot proliferation response (10.3 shoots per explant) was recorded when shoot apices were cultured on media supplemented with 4 mg/l TDZ. No synergistic effect on shoot proliferation was observed when indole-3-acetic acid and indole-3-butyric acid were supplemented to media containing 4 mg/l TDZ. The regeneration system was efficient in evoking multiple shoot proliferation in eight different cultivars of indica rice. Shoots were rooted in MS basal medium and plantlets were acclimatized with 100% survival rate. The shoot apex explants of all the eight cultivars of indica rice were found competent to Agrobacterium-mediated transformation while explants from IR-64 showed highest transient GUS expression.

The high cellulose content of cotton stalks can be converted to fermentable sugars by fungal delignification pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass and enzymatic saccharification. The effect of particle size, moisture content, and media supplements was studied for delignification of cotton stalks by Daedalea flavida MTCC 145 (DF-2) in solid-state fermentation. The highest lignolytic enzyme activities, optimal lignin degradation 29.88 ± 0.97% (w/w) with cellulose loss 11.70 ± 1.30% (w/w), were observed in cotton stalks at particle size 5 mm with 75% moisture content after 20 days. Cellulolytic enzyme activity increased with decrease in particle size and increased moisture content. The addition of Cu2+, gallic acid, and veratryl alcohol enhanced the lignolytic enzyme production and the lignin degradation. In addition to increased laccase activity, Cu2+ inhibited the cellulolytic activity. Supplements Cu2+ at 0.5 mM/g gave the best results of lignin degradation 33.74 ± 1.17% (w/w) and highest selectivity value (SV) 3.15 after pretreatment. The glucose yield increased to 127.44 ± 4.56 mg/g from 20 day pretreated cotton stalks with Cu2+ supplements, ~threefolds higher than untreated cotton stalks.

    "abstract": "The main objective of this study was to obtain chitin in pure form from a new crustacean waste material for industrial applications. Black tiger shrimp shell wastes are a rich source of protein and valuable bioactive carbohydrate polymers such as chitin. After removal of carotenoid, Black tiger shrimp shell wastes (BTSHWs) were treated with chemicals and protease enzyme to extract chitin. Box-Behnken response surface methodology was applied to optimize the deproteinization process to obtain chitin. At optimal pH (8.82), temperature (50.05 °C), agitation speed (100.98 rpm), enzyme substrate ratio of 1:8 (wv-1) and 72 h of incubation with Paenibacillus woosongensis TKB2 crude protease cocktail, 80 % deproteinization was found along with 77.28 % recovery of chitin. The valuable oligopeptides were determined by MALDI-TOF analysis and analysis of adequate amount of free amino acids in protein hydrolysate from BTSHW, indicating a high nutritional value used for food, feed or as a nitrogen source in growth medium for microorganisms. The chitin obtained was compared with the commercial chitin using scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, X-ray diffraction and 13C CP/MAS-NMR. Chitin obtained from crude protease treatment showed comparable physicochemical and structural properties to those of the commercial chitin. The carotenoid obtained after treatment can be used for medicinal purpose.",

The second stage of RSM using CCD consisted of optimizing the concentrations of the variables. Here, 0.49 g/100 ml concentration of succinic acid, pH 7.08 and temperature of 27.80 °C yielded the maximum (68.41 %) siderophore units. All the significant components exhibited quadratic effect on siderophore production. The F value of 28.63, multiple correlation coefficient (R 2) of 0.9626, percent coefficient of variation of 8.81 values indicated that the model was significant and that the experimental data was satisfactorily adjusted to the quadratic model. During validation of these experiments, 6.10 % increase in siderophore yield was obtained. Scale-up of this protocol optimized at shake flask level up to 5 L-capacity reactor further enhanced the siderophore yield.

The synthesized silver nanoparticles were characterized by using UV-visible spectrum analysis, X-ray diffraction, Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and FT-IR analysis. The synthesized silver nanoparticles showed a peak around 420 nm. TEM analysis revealed that the size of silver nanoparticles was in the range of 10-20 nm. Silver nanoparticles carry a charge of -39.86 mV, which confirmed the stability of silver nanoparticles. The biologically synthesized silver nanoparticles showed antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and fungi.

The main aim of the study was to optimize significant medium nutrient parameters for maximization of cellulase and xylanase by multi-objective optimization strategy using biomass. Process parameters such as the nutrient concentrations (pods, sucrose, and yeast extract) and pH were investigated to improve cellulase and xylanase activities by one factor at a time approach, single response optimization and multi-objective optimization. At the corresponding optimized process parameters in single response optimization, the maximum cellulase activity observed was 3055.65 U/L where xylanase highest activity was 422.16 U/L. Similarly, the maximum xylanase activity, 444.94 U/L, was observed with the highest cellulase activity of 2804.40 U/L. The multi-objective optimization finds a tradeoff between the two objectives and optimal activity values in between the single-objective optima were achieved, 3033.74 and 439.13 U/L for cellulase and xylanase, respectively.",

It regulates blood sugar, prevents hypertension and tooth decay as well as used in treatment of skin disorders having high medicinal values, and hence there is a need for generating the plant on large scale. We have developed an efficient micropropagation protocol on half strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) media, using two-stage culture procedures. Varying concentrations of cytokinins, i.e., benzylaminopurine, kinetin and thidiazuron (TDZ) were supplemented in the nutrient media to observe their effects on shoot development. All the cytokinins promoted shoot formation, however, best response was observed in the TDZ (0.5 mg/l). The shoots from selected induction medium were sub-cultured on the multiplication media. The media containing 0.01 mg/l TDZ produced maximum number of shoot (11.00 ± 0.40) with longer shoots (7.17 ± 0.16) and highest number of leaves (61.00 ± 1.29). Rooting response was best observed in one-fourth strength on MS media supplemented with indole-3-butyric acid (1.0 mg/l) and activated charcoal (50 mg/l) with (11.00 ± 0.40) number of roots. The plantlets thus obtained were hardened and transferred to the pots with soil and sand mixture, where the survival rate was 80 % after 2 months. Quantitative analysis of stevioside content in leaves of in vivo mother plant and in vitro plantlets was carried out by high performance liquid chromatography. A remarkable increase in stevioside content was noticed in the in vitro-raised plants as compared to in vivo grown plants. The protocol reported here might be useful in genetic improvement and high stevioside production.",

There is restricted data regarding the structure and dynamics of microbial communities in several ecosystems because only a little fraction of microbial diversity is accessible by culture methods. Owing to limitations of traditional enrichment methods and pure culture techniques, microbiological studies have offered a narrow portal for investigating microbial flora. The bacterial community represented by the morphological and nutritional criteria failed to provide a natural taxonomic order according to the evolutionary relationship. Genetic diversity among the isolates recovered from mushroom compost has not been widely studied. To understand genetic diversity and community composition of the mushroom compost microflora, different approaches are now followed by taxonomists, to characterize and identify isolates up to species level. Molecular microbial ecology is an emerging discipline of biology under molecular approach which can provide complex community profiles along with useful phylogenetic information. The genomic era has resulted in the development of new molecular tools and techniques for study of culturable microbial diversity including the DNA base ratio (mole% G + C), DNA–DNA hybridization, DNA microarray and reverse sample genome probing. In addition, non-culturable diversity of mushroom compost ecosystem can be characterized by employing various molecular tools which would be discussed in the present review.",

These catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphomonoester bonds in phytate, thereby releasing lower forms of myo-inositol phosphates and inorganic phosphate. Addition of phytase to plant-based foods can improve its nutritional value and increase mineral bioavailability by decreasing nutritional effect of phytate. In the present investigation, 43 phytase positive bacteria on PSM plates were isolated from different sources and characterized for phytase activity. On the basis of phytase activity and zone of hydrolysis, two bacterial isolates (PSB-15 and PSB-45) were selected for further characterization studies, i.e., pH and temperature optima and stability, kinetic properties and effect of modulators. The phytases from both isolates were optimally active at the pH value from 3 to 8 and in the temperature range of 50–70 °C. Further, the stability of isolates was good in the pH range of 3.0–8.0. Much variation was observed in temperature and storage stability, responses of phytases to metal ions and modulators. The K m and V max values for PSB-15 phytase were 0.48 mM and 0.157 μM/min, while for PSB-45 these were 1.25 mM and 0.140 μM/min, respectively. Based on 16S rDNA gene sequence, the isolates were identified as Serratia sp. PSB-15 (GenBank Accession No. KR133277) and Enterobacter cloacae strain PSB-45 (GenBank Accession No. KR133282). The novel phytases from these isolates have multiple characteristics of high thermostability and good phytase activity at desirable range of pH and temperature for their efficient use in food and feed to facilitate hydrolysis of phytate-metal ion complex and in turn, increased bioavailability of important metal ions to monogastric animals.",

Fourteen different organisms were isolated, identified and screened for activity against Pythium myriotylum and human clinical pathogens. Among these, Nocardiopsis sp. ZoA1 was found to have highest inhibition with excellent antibacterial effects compared to standard antibiotics. Remarkable antibiofilm property was also shown by the extract of ZoA1. Its antifungal activity against Pythium and other common phytopathogens was also found to be promising as confirmed by scanning electron microscopic analysis. By PCR-based sequence analysis of phz E gene, the organism was confirmed for the genetic basis of phenazine biosynthesis. Further GC–MS analysis of Nocardiopsis sp. revealed the presence of various compounds including Phenol, 2,4-bis (1,1-dimethylethyl) and trans cinnamic acid which can have significant role in the observed result. The current study is the first report on endophytic Nocardiopsis sp. from ginger with promising applications. In vivo treatment of Nocardiopsis sp. on ginger rhizome has revealed its inhibition towards the colonization of P. myriotylum which makes the study to have promises to manage the severe diseases in ginger like rhizome rot.",

In this study, 2-week-old seedlings were subjected to water deficit by 7 days drought stress, whereas control plants were regularly irrigated. After withdrawing water, plants exposed to drought for 7 days and control plants at the same developmental stage were included in quantitative proteomic analysis using two-dimensional electrophoresis gels of proteins in combination with mass spectrometry. Over 300 proteins were detected by 2-DE, 50 differentially expressed proteins were detected by t test and 30 proteins were successfully identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF, in which 25 proteins were clearly downregulated and five proteins were upregulated. The quantified proteins were grouped into five functional groups, mainly regulatory proteins (46.7%), energy metabolism (23.3%), cell cytoskeleton (6.7%), other functions (20%) and unknown function (3.3%). Chitinase was upregulated under drought, suggesting that it was an important part of the plant defense system, playing an important role in stress resistance. 50S ribosomal protein was upregulated under drought, suggesting its role in protecting plants against stress by re-establishing normal protein conformations. The abundance of proteins involved in protein synthesis such as chitinase, Bet protein and glutamate–glyoxylate aminotransferase was upregulated under drought stress. These proteins could play important roles in drought tolerance and contribute to the relatively stronger drought tolerance of \"Ga da dou\".",

Fermentation was carried out with Trichoderma koeningi isolate using untreated and pretreated corn cob supplemented with pineapple peel powder showed higher production of xylanase 2,869.8 ± 0.4 (IU/g) and extracellular protein 7.6 ± 0.2 (mg/g) of corn cob, in the latter than the former yielding 1,347.2 ± 0.7 (IU/g) and 4.9 ± 0.1 (mg/g) of corn cob, respectively, at pH 6.5 and incubation period for 96 h. In the FT-IR spectrum, the bands at 1,155, 1,252 and 1,738 cm-1 had disappeared. This indicates the depolymerization of hemicellulose and the band at 1,053 cm-1 shows the presence of β (1-4)-xylan in the pretreated corn cobs. The pretreated biomass hydrolysed with a xylanase concentration of 14 U and 6 h incubation showed mainly xylose and its oligosaccharides, which were quantified using HPLC. From the results we can conclude that pretreated energy-value and cheaply available agro-residues can be effectively used as substrates for the enhanced production of xylanase.",

Externally applied pesticides may alter the bioavailability of these metal ions to plants through the coordinating ability of these pesticides with metal ions. In current study a series of metal complexes containing atrazine (Atr) group(s) attached to metal(II) (M) frame, with the formula; [M(Atr)n.xH2O.yCl] (where M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu or Zn; n = 1 or 2; x = 1-4; y = 1-2), have been synthesized for the first time to check the interactions of atrazine with transition metal ions. More importantly, all the complexes were synthesized at neutral pH in aqueous medium. The major differences among the FTIR spectra were observed between 3,700-2,800 and 1,800-1,350 cm-1. On the basis of FTIR, CHN and computational study, it was observed that Mn, Ni and Cu formed complexes in 1:2 and Fe, Co and Zn in 1:1. The obtained results were supported by 3D molecular modeling using GAMESS computations as a package of ChemBio3D Ultra14 program. The FTIR spectral analysis and 3D molecular modeling suggests that the Atr can show coordination through the nitrogen (in between two side chains) of ring as well as nitrogen (non steric amine) of side chain with different metal ions.",

    "abstract": "Biosynthesis of plant-mediated silver nanoparticles is gaining significant importance due to environmentally safe 'green method' and it is an efficient alternative method. In the present study, silver nanoparticles were synthesized by using root extract of Glycyrrhiza glabra an important medicinal plant. The AgNPs are characterized by spectral analysis; the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak of AgNPs showed maximum absorption at 445 nm. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) data show that the O–H hydroxyl groups, carboxylic acids, ester and ether groups and C–O stretching of alcohols have been utilized in the formation of AgNPs. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) data reveal that the AgNPs are face-centered cubic (fcc) in structure. The size was determined by particle size analyzer and atomic force microscope (AFM); the results reveal that AgNPs were spherical in shape and the average grain size is determined as 41.5–46.5 nm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs obtained show that AgNPs were roughly spherical and well dispersed with the sizes ranging from 10 to 45 nm ± 5 nm. The biofabricated AgNPs are extremely stable due to its high negative zeta potential −34.1 mV which indicates that the nanoparticles are polydispered in nature. The cytotoxic studies of AgNPs on human CD34 +ve stem cells in microcarrier culture reveal excellent growth at different concentrations of biosynthesized AgNPs. This is the first report of microcarrier culture of CD34 +ve stem cells on biosynthesized AgNPs.",

Symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) also helps in transporting P from the soil to plant and Pht proteins play an important role in it. To understand this phenomenon in Finger Mille plant, we have cloned four Pht genes from Finger millet, which shares the homology with Pht1 protein family of cereals. Expression pattern analysis during the AM infection indicated that EcPT4 gene was AM specific, and its expression was higher in roots where AM colonization percentage was high. The expression level of EcPT1-4 gene under the phosphorous (Pi) stress in seedlings was found to be consistent with its role in acquisition of phosphorus. Homology study of the EcPt proteins with Pht proteins of cereals shows close relationship. The findings of the study indicate that Pht1 family genes from finger millet can serve to be an important resource for the better understanding of phosphorus use efficiency.",

A total of 56,354 and 49,308 reads were generated from leaf and root tissues, respectively, and clustered into 6,313 and 5,858 unigenes. The differentially expressed unigenes that showed up-regulation (≥2-fold) or down-regulation (2≤-fold) were considered for further analysis. A total of 3,517 unigenes were differentially expressed in both tissues. The 1,528 genes specific to leaves and 1,128 specific to roots were obtained. The 28 biological pathways in two tissues were found to respond significantly to drought stress. A total of 289 in leaf and 277 in root unknown (novel) unigenes were found to be remarkably regulated by drought stress. Some key regulatory genes involved in abiotic stress such as WRKY, ERF, AP2 EREBP, MYB, and LEA were highly expressed in leaves. The genes RHD3, LBD, and transcription factor WRKY75, known for root development under various stress conditions, were expressed specifically in root. The genes related to chlorophyll a/b binding protein and photosystem-related proteins showed significant higher expression in roots and as compared to leaves. It can be concluded that cotton leaves are distinct from roots in terms of molecular mechanisms for responses to drought stress.",

The volatile bioactive metabolites produced by these isolates were identified by GC–MS analysis of the fungal crude extracts. Understanding of the metabolites produced by endophytes is also important in the context of raw consumption of ginger as medicine and spice. A total of fifteen isolates were identified from the four varieties studied. The various genera identified were Acremonium sp., Gliocladiopsis sp., Fusarium sp., Colletotrichum sp., Aspergillus sp., Phlebia sp., Earliella sp., and Pseudolagarobasidium sp. The endophytic community was unique to each variety, which could be due to the varying host genotype. Fungi from phylum Basidiomycota were identified for the first time from ginger. Seven isolates showed activity against Pythium , while only two showed antibacterial activity. The bioactive metabolites identified in the fungal crude extracts include tyrosol, benzene acetic acid, ergone, dehydromevalonic lactone, N -aminopyrrolidine, and many bioactive fatty acids and their derivatives which included linoleic acid, oleic acid, myristic acid, n -hexadecanoic acid, palmitic acid methyl ester, and methyl linoleate. The presence of these varying bioactive endophytic fungi may be one of the reasons for the differences in the performance of the different ginger varieties.",

The optimum temperature and pH were 60 °C and 5.5 retaining 76 and 85 % of activity after 3 h, respectively. It showed stability between pH 4.5–6.0 and temperature between 50–70 °C indicating thermostability. Endo β-1,4-d-glucanase was activated by Ca2+ and Mg2+ but inhibited by Hg2+, Pb2+ and Cd2+. The effect of thiol reagents, metal chelators, oxidizing agents and surfactants on enzyme activity has been studied. Purified endo β-1,4-d-glucanase exhibited highest specificity towards carboxymethyl cellulose. Kinetic analysis showed the K m, V max and K i (cellobiose inhibitor) of 2.5 mg/mL, 83.75 U/mg and 0.066 M, respectively. The storage stability of purified endo β-1,4-d-glucanase showed a loss of mere 13 % over a period of 60 days. The hydrolysis efficiency of purified endo β-1,4-d-glucanase mixed with cocktail was demonstrated over commercial enzyme. Optimized enzymatic hydrolysis of sweet sorghum and sugarcane bagasse released 5.2 g/g (36 h) and 6.8 g/g (48 h) of reducing sugars, respectively. Separate hydrolysis and fermentation of sweet sorghum bagasse yielded 4.3 g/L bioethanol (16 h) confirmed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Morphological and structural changes were assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Elemental analysis was carried out by SEM equipped with energy dispersive X-ray technique. These unique properties prove the potentiality of enzyme for biomass conversion to biofuel and other industrial applications.",

A potential xylanolytic fungal isolate Aspergillus niger was isolated from forest soils of Tirumala, AP, India, and its crude enzyme was checked for its potential in paper bleaching. Under submerged fermentation, production of xylanase, cellulase, biomass, total protein and sugar released were analysed after 7 days of incubation at room temperature. Maximum enzyme activity was recorded on the fifth day of incubation, biomass after the seventh day, total protein and sugar released on the sixth day of incubation. Enzyme pretreatment of paper reduced 3.5 points in kappa number, 3.1 points increase in brightness and removal of chromophores and hydrophobic compounds. The FTIR and SEM analysis of enzyme-treated sample had shown modification in surface morphology and functional groups. These results clearly demonstrated that the xylanase produced by A. niger was effective as a pulp biobleaching agent which can be used on an industrial scale.",

    "abstract": "The rapid detection of pathogens in food is becoming increasingly critical for ensuring the safety of consumers, since the majority of food-borne illnesses and deaths are caused by pathogenic bacteria. Hence, rapid, sensitive, inexpensive and convenient approaches to detect food-borne pathogenic bacteria is essential in controlling food safety. In this study, a multiplex PCR assay for the rapid and simultaneous detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes was established. The invA, stx and hlyA genes specifically amplified DNA fragments of 284, 404 and 510 bp from Salmonella spp., L. monocytogenes and E. coli O157:H7, respectively. The 16S rRNA gene was targeted as an internal control gene in the presence of bacterial DNA. The specificity and sensitivity of the multiplex PCR were performed by testing different strains. The multiplex PCR assay was able to specifically simultaneously detect ten colony-forming unit/mL of each pathogen in artificially inoculated samples after enrichment for 12 h. The whole process took less than 24 h to complete, indicating that the assay is suitable for reliable and rapid identification of these three food-borne pathogens, which could be suitable in microbial epidemiology investigation.",

Therefore, it is desirable to clone and express novel cry genes from several new isolates of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). In the present study, 28 Bt strains were characterized at morphological and molecular level. All these strains are Gram positive, endospore forming and had shown different crystal morphologies when viewed under the microscope. The ARDRA (16S rDNA PCR-RFLP technique) with AluI, HaeIII, HinfI and TaqI produced unique and distinguishable restriction patterns used for the molecular characterization of these isolates. Based on UPGMA clustering analysis, Bt strains showed significant molecular diversity and the dendrogram obtained differentiated 28 Bt strains into 1 major cluster at a similarity coefficient 0.56. PCR analysis demonstrated that the Bt strains showed diverse cry gene profiles with several genes per strain. The Bt strain G3C1 showed the presence of maximum cry-type genes by PCR. The toxicological characterization of these cry genes will have huge importance in transgenic technology and will be useful in transgenesis of crop plants for better resistance management.",

Different strains of Agrobacterium rhizogenes (A4, ATCC15834 and LBA 9402) were used for induction of hairy roots in in vitro grown tissues of the plant. Hairy root initiation was observed after 25-30 days of infection. Optimum transformation frequency of 61% was achieved on leaf explants with ATCC15834 strain. Infection time of 30 min resulted in greater transformation frequency compared to 10 and 20 min, respectively. The hairy roots cultured in growth regulator-free semi-solid woody plant medium differentiated into callus. Whole shoots infected with ATCC 15834 were found to produce more transformants upon co-cultivation for 4 (65%) and 5 (67%) days. Induction of hairy roots in stem explants infected with ATCC 15834 was lower (52%) compared to leaves (62%) after 4 days of co-cultivation. In A4 and LBA9402 strains transformation efficiency was 49 ± 2.8% and 36 ± 5.7% in shoots after 4 days of co-cultivation. Transformation frequency was higher in ATCC15834 strain, irrespective of explants. The hairy roots of S. anacardium elongated slowly upon transfer to half-strength liquid medium. After 3-4 passages in liquid medium slender hairy roots started differentiating which were separated from the original explants. Visible growth of the roots was observed in hormone-free liquid medium after 2-3 months of culturing. Polymerase chain reaction with gene-specific primers from rol A, B and C genes confirms the positive transformation events.",

    "abstract": "Populus davidiana is native to the Korean Peninsula and is one of the most dominant and abundantly growing forest trees in eastern Asia. Compared to other Populus species such as P. trichocarpa, P. euphratica, and P. tremula, relatively little is known about P. davidiana. Here, we performed transcriptomic analysis of P. davidiana under drought stress induced by 10% polyethylene glycol. A total of 12,403 and 12,414 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were successfully annotated with the P. trichocarpa reference genome after 6 and 12 h of treatment, respectively. Of these, a total of 404 genes (238 up-regulated and 166 down-regulated) after 6 h and 359 genes (187 up-regulated and 172 down-regulated) after 12 h of treatment were identified as transcription factors. Transcription factors known to be key genes for drought stress response, such as AP2-EREB, WRKY, C2H2, and NAC, were identified. This results suggesting that early induction of these genes affected initiation of transcriptional regulation in response to drought stress. Quantitative real-time PCR results of selected genes showed highly significant (R = 0.93) correlation with RNA-Seq data. Interestingly, the expression pattern of some transcription factors was P. davidiana specific. The sequence of P. davidiana ortholog of P. trichocarpa gene POPTR_0018s10230, which plays an important role in plant response to drought, was further analyzed as our RNA-Seq results showed highly significant changes in the expression of this gene following the stress treatment. Sequence of the gene was compared to P. trichocarpa gene sequence using cloning-based sequencing. Additionally, we generated a predicted 3D protein structure for the gene product. Results indicated that the amino acid sequence of P. davidiana-specific POPTR_0018s10230 is different at six different positions compared to P. trichocarpa, resulting in a significantly different structure of the protein. Identifying the transcription factors expressed in P. davidiana under drought stress will not only offer clues for understanding the underlying mechanisms involved in drought stress physiology but also serve as a basis for future molecular studies on this species.",

The aim of the present study was to reveal if the inoculated Lactic acid bacteria widely used in silage could provide beneficial safety to guarantee dairy feedstuffs and fresh milk. Organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) degradation in whole corn silage was investigated. Two OPPs, chlorpyrifos and phorate, were added to the whole corn, which was inoculated with L. plantarum 1.0315, L. plantarum 1.0624, L. plantarum 1.0622 and their combination at room temperature for 10 weeks. OPPs residues in the whole corn silage at different weeks were analyzed by gas chromatography after OPPs extraction and purification. The degradation rate constants were calculated according to the OPPs residues results at different fermentation stage. The data showed that the inoculated microorganisms and strain combination exhibited obvious acceleration on OPPs degradation as the wild microorganisms did, and resulted in decreased levels of OPPs from 24.9 to 33.4 %. Strains combination brought about greater OPPs degradation than single strain or the wild microorganisms. Compared to phorate, clorpyrifos had lower degradation rate constants (0.0274-0.0381 vs. 0.0295-0.0355 week-1) and was more stable. The present result indicates safety benefit of lactic acid bacteria on corn silage besides lactic acid fermentation.",

A 7.9-fold increase in lipase-specific activity was recorded after purification by DEAE Sepharose ion exchange and Sephadex G200 column chromatography. The apparent molecular mass of this enzyme was revealed as 50 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The optimal lipase activity was recorded at pH 4 and 37 °C. The enzyme revealed broad specificity towards different vegetable oils. The K m and V max of the lipase on olive oil was found to be 330.4 mg and 53,690 U/ml/min, respectively. The lipase activity was stable in the presence of surfactants such as cetrimonium bromide, sodium dodecyl sulphate and Tween 80, and metal ions and reagents such as Ca2+, Ba2+ and 2-mercaptoethanol. However, the activity was greatly reduced in the presence of organic solvents such as chloroform. The stain removal potential of the crude lipase was determined on polycotton fabric pieces stained with peanut oil. Lipase added to cold water alone significantly enhanced the removal of stain by 152 %. The addition of lipase also improved the stain removal efficiency of a commercially available detergent in the presence of either cold (25 ± 2 °C) or hot (65 ± 2 °C) water. The current findings suggest the potentiality of this enzyme for energy-efficient biocatalytic application.",

Chlorpyrifos (CP) is one such organophosphorous insecticide most widely used against various insects, termites, and beetles throughout the globe. In the present work, the effect of CP on soil microbial population was assessed by the cultivable method. The fertile soil which does not have a history of any pesticide application was treated with 100 and 200 µg/g of CP along with control which received only sterile water and incubated for 1, 7, and 14 days. The soil amended with the insecticide showed decrease in the number of colony forming units (CFU) of bacteria and fungi. However, Streptomyces sp. HP-11 which tolerated high concentration and also inhibited fungal population was further selected for biodegradation studies. After 14 days of incubation in Mineral salt media (MSM), the strain HP-11 biotransformed CP into 3, 5, 6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP) and Diethyl Phosphorothioate (DETP), and its formation was confirmed by the m/z peak of LC-MS analysis, which was later metabolized to unknown polar metabolites. The results obtained highlights that the application of chlorpyrifos favored the Actinomycete growth in the soil, thereby inhibiting other microorganisms and the strain HP-11 harbors metabolic pathway for detoxification of CP and its hydrolysis product TCP into polar metabolites, thus suggesting the strain HP-11 will be a potential bioaugmenting agent for the bioremediation of chlorpyrifos contaminated soil and water.",

The study was carried out using sugarcane varieties Co 86032 and Q117. Callus cultures of both the varieties were optimized using six different callus induction media. After screening the growth response of callus on six different callus induction media, it was observed that medium no. VI supplemented with 500 mg l-1 of each PVP, Casein hydrolysate and MES buffer showed high amounts of callus in Co 86032 (79.66 ± 0.44%) and Q117 (82.83 ± 1.69%). Addition of PEG 8000 at 2.5% to this medium had a profound impact on inducing somatic embryogenesis in Co 86032 (54.66 ± 1.76%) and Q117 (66.66 ± 2.60%) as compare to control (24.33 ± 1.76%) and (27.33 ± 2.73%), respectively. Cell suspension cultures were established by culturing embryogenic calli in liquid medium showed well established suspension cultures with fever cell aggregates. There was negligible cell division during initial 2 days of incubation and cell count increased rapidly between 2 and 8 days. Further incubation beyond 8 days resulted in a decrease in cell viability. Enhanced callus proliferation in Q117 while enhanced shoot regeneration in Co 86032 was observed from cell suspension culture. The clonal fidelity of in vitro regenerated plants was assessed by using RAPD and ISSR markers. Analysis of the ten RAPD markers indicated that 90.48 and 86.95% true-to-type regenerated plantlets in Co 86032 and Q117, respectively. However, in the ISSR markers, Co 86032 did not show any polymorphism and in the Q117, 92.18% true-to-type plantlets were found. These results confirmed that somaclonal variation occurs during the process of indirect organogenesis and RAPD and ISSR marker based molecular analysis is a suitable method for an early detection of variation in sugarcane.",

The PCR amplification results showed the presence of both these lipopeptide genes in isolate YSPMK11. Iturin A as antifungal compound was identified as major components of fraction through GC/MS. In field experiments, the application of strain YSPMK11 cell suspension (108 CFU/ml) suppressed disease severity by 93% and increased curd yield by 36% which was more that of commercially used fungicide in farmer practices under mid-hills of Himachal Pradesh. Conclusively, our study is first to demonstrate the effect of B. pumilus strain YSPMK11 in suppression of SSR under field conditions and would be employed as an efficient biocontrol agent to replace commercial fungicides in cauliflower cropping system. In addition, the presence of both lipopeptide genes (ItuD and SrfC) and iturin A in this isolate makes him potent strain for biological control application in agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this study, strain BAPb.1 was isolated from lead mining area and used as an adsorbent to remove lead(II) ions from aqueous solution. The physicochemical characteristics, heavy metal resistance and antibiotic sensitivity of strain BAPb.1 were investigated. Biosorption capacity was evaluated by batch biosorption experiments, and isothermal characteristics were discussed. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) were conducted to explore the mechanism for lead(II) adsorption. Based on morphological and physiological characteristics as well as the phylogenetic analysis of 16S rDNA sequences, strain BAPb.1 was identified as a member of the genus Alcaligenes . It exhibited high resistances to multiple heavy metals such as lead(II), copper(II), zinc(II), nickel(II) and chromium(VI), and to antibiotics such as kanamycin, ampicillin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline. The optimum conditions for maximum biosorption rate of 85.2% and maximum capacity of 56.8 mg g −1 were found at pH of 5, adsorbent dosage of 1.5 g L −1 (dry weight), initial lead(II) concentration of 100 mg L −1 , and contact time of 30 min at 30 °C. Biosorption isotherms were well fitted with Langmuir isotherm model. Mechanism analysis reveals that the lead(II) ions may exchange with sodium and potassium ions, and the hydroxyl, carbonyl and phosphate groups on the cell surface can chelate the lead(II) ions, therefore, surface adsorption play significant role in the biosorption process.",

This study demonstrates the extra-cellular synthesis of stable silver nanoparticles using the white rot fungus, Schizophyllum radiatum with GenBank Accession no HE 863742.1. The supernatant of the seed media obtained after separating the cells has been used for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles. The morphology and structure of synthesized silver nanoparticles were characterized using FT-IR, XRD, UV-visible spectrum of the aqueous medium containing silver ion showed a peak in the range of 420-430 nm corresponding to the Plasmon absorbance of silver nanoparticles. Scanning electron microscopy micrograph showed formation of well-dispersed silver nanoparticles in the range of 10-40 nm. The effect of different carbon sources and the time taken for formation particles and the anti-microbial activity of synthesized nanoparticles were carried and compared with silver nitrate solution and with standard streptomycin. The process of reduction being extra-cellular and fast may lead to the development of an easy bioprocess for synthesis of silver nanoparticles.",

Instead of satisfactory surface sterilization approaches, repeatedly occurring bacterial growth on in vitro rootstock cultures of peach and pear was identified and isolated as endophytic bacteria in our present study. Five different isolates from peach rootstocks were molecularly identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing as Brevundimonas diminuta, Leifsonia shinshuensis, Sphingomonas parapaucimobilis Brevundimonas vesicularis, Agrobacterium tumefaciens while two endophytic isolates of pear were identified as Pseudoxanthomonas mexicana, and Stenotrophomonas rhizophilia. Identified endophytes were also screened for their potential of plant growth promotion according to indoleacetic acid (IAA) production, nitrogen fixation, solubilization of phosphate and production of siderophore. All seven endophytic isolates have shown positive results for IAA, nitrogen fixation and phosphate solubilization tests. However, two out of seven isolates showed positive results for siderophore production. On the basis of these growth promoting competences, isolated endophytes can be presumed to have significant influence on the growth of host plants. Future studies required to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility profile and potential application of these isolates in biological control, microbial biofertilizers and degradative enzyme production.",

Recent evidences suggest that the antimicrobial activities exhibited by biosurfactants make them promising molecules for the application in the field of therapeutics. Marine microbes are well known for their unique metabolic and functional properties; however, few reports are available till date regarding their biosurfactant production and antimicrobial potential. In an ongoing survey for bioactive microbial metabolites from microbes isolated from diverse ecological niches, a marine Staphylococcus saprophyticus SBPS 15 isolated from the petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated coastal site, Puducherry, India, was identified as a promising biosurfactant producer based on multiple screening methods. This bacterium exhibited growth-dependent biosurfactant production and the recorded yield was 1.345 ± 0.056 g/L (on dry weight basis). The biosurfactant was purified and chemically characterized as a glycolipid with a molecular mass of 606.7 Da, based on TLC, biochemical estimation methods, FT-IR spectrum and MALDI-TOF-MS analysis. Further, the estimated molecular mass was different from the earlier reports on biosurfactants. This new glycolipid biosurfactant exhibited a board range of pH and temperature stability. Furthermore, it revealed a promising antimicrobial activity against many tested human pathogenic bacterial and fungal clinical isolates. Based on these observations, the isolated biosurfactant from the marine S. saprophyticus revealed board physicochemical stabilities and possess excellent antimicrobial activities which proves its significance for possible use in various therapeutic and biomedical applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a biosurfactant from the bacterium, S. saprophyticus.",

The viscosity of the PCL and nHA/PCL with different concentrations of nHA was measured and the morphology of the electrospun membranes was compared using a field emission scanning electron microscopy. The water contact angle of the nanofiber determined the wettability of the membranes of different concentrations. The surface roughness of the electrospun nanofibers fabricated from pure PCL and nHA/PCL was determined and compared using atomic force microscopy. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to study the chemical bonding of the composite electrospun nanofibers. Beadless nanofibers were achieved after the incorporation of nHA with a diameter of 200-700 nm. Results showed that the fiber diameter and the surface roughness of electrospun nanofibers were significantly increased after the incorporation of nHA. In contrast, the water contact angle (132° ± 3.5°) was reduced for PCL membrane after addition of 10% (w/w) nHA (112° ± 3.0°). Ultimate tensile strengths of PCL membrane and 10% (w/w) nHA/PCL membrane were 25.02 ± 2.3 and 18.5 ± 4.4 MPa. A model drug tetracycline hydrochloride was successfully loaded in the membrane and the membrane demonstrated good antibacterial effects against the growth of bacteria by showing inhibition zone for E. coli (2.53 ± 0.06 cm) and B. cereus (2.87 ± 0.06 cm).",

    "abstract": "Our study aimed to elucidate the plant growth-promoting characteristics and the structure and composition of Sphingomonas sp. LK11 genome using the single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology of Pacific Biosciences. The results revealed that LK11 produces different types of gibberellins (GAs) in pure culture and significantly improves soybean plant growth by influencing endogenous GAs compared with non-inoculated control plants. Detailed genomic analyses revealed that the Sphingomonas sp. LK11 genome consists of a circular chromosome (3.78 Mbp; 66.2% G+C content) and two circular plasmids (122,975 bps and 34,160 bps; 63 and 65% G+C content, respectively). Annotation showed that the LK11 genome consists of 3656 protein-coding genes, 59 tRNAs, and 4 complete rRNA operons. Functional analyses predicted that LK11 encodes genes for phosphate solubilization and nitrate/nitrite ammonification, which are beneficial for promoting plant growth. Genes for production of catalases, superoxide dismutase, and peroxidases that confer resistance to oxidative stress in plants were also identified in LK11. Moreover, genes for trehalose and glycine betaine biosynthesis were also found in LK11 genome. Similarly, Sphingomonas spp. analysis revealed an open pan-genome and a total of 8507 genes were identified in the Sphingomonas spp. pan-genome and about 1356 orthologous genes were found to comprise the core genome. However, the number of genomes analyzed was not enough to describe complete gene sets. Our findings indicated that the genetic makeup of Sphingomonas sp. LK11 can be utilized as an eco-friendly bioresource for cleaning contaminated sites and promoting growth of plants confronted with environmental perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Alkaline proteases are important enzymes in many industrial applications, especially as additives in laundry detergent industry. Though there are a number of Bacillus species which are reported to be producing proteases, the efficiency of a protease produced by a novel strain has to be studied in comparison to the others. Hence, in this study, an alkaline serine protease produced by a novel species Bacillus caseinilyticus was purified and characterized for its possible usage in detergent industry. Ammonium sulphate, dialysis and DEAE column chromatographic methods were used for purification of the isolated alkaline protease. The molecular weight of the protease was determined by SDS-PAGE and it was found to be 66 kDa. Peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) was carried out using MALDI-TOF-TOF mass spectrometry and the peptides were found to be similar to that of subtilisin protease. Specific activity of purified protein was found to be 89.2 U/mg. Optimum pH and temperature for enzyme activity were at pH 8 and 60 °C, respectively, showing stability with 10 mM CaCl2. Phenyl methyl sulphonyl fluoride (PMSF) at both 5 and 10 mM concentrations completely inhibited the enzyme activity suggesting its serine nature. EDTA, metal ions Mg2+ and Ca2+ increased the enzyme activity. The one factor at a time optimisation of the protease production was carried to identify the important factors that affect its production. After optimisation, the protease was produced at lab scale, purified and characterised. This alkali, thermotolerant serine protease was found to be significantly stable in the presence of various surfactants and H2O2. Also, it was successfully able to remove blood stain when used as an additive along with commercial detergent suggesting its potential application in the laundry detergent industry.",

The capacity this with respect to biomass production, lipid yield and lipid content was evaluated. The influence of inoculum size, carbon sources, variations in glucose concentration, nitrogen sources, C/N ratio, pH, temperature, agitation, and aeration rate and incubation period were investigated. Inoculum size of 10% v/v, glucose as a carbon source at 50 g/L glucose, 0.50 g/L yeast extract and 0.31 g/L (NH4)2SO4, C/N ratio of 120, pH 5.5, incubation temperature of 30 °C, 225 rpm, 0.2 as aeration ratio and 144 h of incubation were found to be optimum conditions for lipid production. Then the yeast was grown in a batch bioreactor by combining the different optimized parameters together. Under the optimized conditions, the yeast gave maximum biomass (15.34 ± 1.47 g/L), lipid yield (8.60 ± 0.81 g/L) and lipid content (56.06 ± 1.70%). The dominant fatty acids exhibited in order of their relative abundance (%w/w), were oleic, palmitic, linoleic, stearic, linolenic and palmitoleic acids. The concentration of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids adds up 78.63 ± 2.19%. This suggests that this strain could be used as a good feedstock for biodiesel production.",

As many of the medicinal properties of plants are in tandem with the associated microorganisms residing within the plant tissues, it is advisable to explore the endophytic potential of such plants. In the present study, diversity of culturable bacteria isolated from medicinal plants Ferula songorica collected from Hebukesaier, Xinjiang were analyzed. A total of 170 endophytic bacteria belonging to three phyla, 15 orders, 20 families and 27 genera were isolated and characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The phylum Actinobacteria constitutes a major portion of the endophytic microbes isolated from the plant Ferula songorica (107 isolates). Overall endophytic species richness of the sample was 58 taxa while the sample has statistical values of 4.02, 0.97, 0.65 and 16.55 with Shannon's, Simpson, Species evenness and Margalef, respectively. Root tissues were found to be more suitable host for endophytes as compared to leaf and stem tissues. Among these endophytic strains, 88 % can grow on nitrogen-free media, 19 % solubilize phosphate, while 26 and 40 % are positive for production of protease and cellulase, respectively. The results confirm that the medicinal plant Ferula songorica represents an extremely rich reservoir for the isolation of diverged bacteria with potential for growth promoting factors and biologically active compounds including enzymes.",

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis of biosurfactant compound revealed that the isolated biosurfactant is in lipopeptide nature. The 1H-NMR of the extracted biosurfactant from B. licheniformis has a doublet signal at 0.8-0.9 ppm corresponding to six hydrogen atoms suggests the presence of a terminal isopropyl group. The spectra showed two main regions corresponding to resonance of α-carbon protons (3.5-5.5 ppm) and side-chain protons (0.25-3.0 ppm). All the data suggests that the fatty acid residue is from lipopeptide. From the biodegradation studies, it concluded that the biosurfactant produced by B. licheniformis further can add to its value as an ecofriendly and biodegradable product.",

The feathers are composed of approximately 90% of keratin which is an important ingredient of cosmetics, shampoos and hair treatment creams. This study aimed to determine the optimum conditions for the extraction of keratin from chicken feathers. The extraction of keratin using various reducing agents was studied using statistical experimental design. In the extraction process, pH, temperature, ratio of reducing agents, mass of chicken feathers and incubation time were analyzed. The keratin in the total extracted protein was purified by size exclusion chromatography, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and further characterized using amino acids profile analysis. The surface morphology and chemical composition were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. Sodium sulfide (Na 2 S) yielded 84.5% of keratin as compared to sodium hydroxide (43.8), urea mixture (50.6), mixture of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and sodium bisulfite (18.3) and a mixture of Na 2 S and sodium hydroxide (41.5%) under optimized conditions. The optimum yield of keratin was achieved at 80.9 °C in 9.5 h with 0.05 M sodium sulfide using response surface methodology (RSM). Among the five parameters screened, pH was found not to be significant because the p value was greater than 0.05.",

Hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass using high acid concentration results in decomposition of sugars into fermentative inhibitors. Thus, the main aim of this work was to investigate the optimum hydrolysis conditions for sorghum brown midrib IS11861 biomass to maximize the pentose sugars yield with minimized levels of fermentative inhibitors at low acid concentrations. Process parameters investigated include sulfuric acid concentration (0.2–1 M), reaction time (30–120 min) and temperature (80–121 °C). At the optimum condition (0.2 M sulfuric acid, 121 °C and 120 min), 97.6% of hemicellulose was converted into xylobiose (18.02 mg/g), xylose (225.2 mg/g), arabinose (20.2 mg/g) with low concentration of furfural (4.6 mg/g). Furthermore, the process parameters were statistically optimized using response surface methodology based on central composite design. Due to the presence of low concentration of fermentative inhibitors, 78.6 and 82.8% of theoretical ethanol yield were attained during the fermentation of non-detoxified and detoxified hydrolyzates, respectively, using Pichia stipitis 3498 wild strain, in a techno-economical way.",

    "abstract": "Benzo[a]pyrene is considered as a priority pollutant because of its carcinogenic, teratogenic and mutagenic effects. The highly recalcitrant nature of Benzo[a]pyrene poses a major problem for its degradation. White-rot fungi such as Pleurotus ostreatus can degrade Benzo[a]pyrene by enzymes like laccase and manganese peroxidase. The present investigation was carried out to determine the extent of Benzo[a]pyrene degradation by the PO-3, a native isolate of P. ostreatus, in the presence of heavy metals and ligninolytic enzyme mediators. Modified mineral salt medium was supplemented with 5 mM concentration of different heavy metal salts and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Vanillin and 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (1 and 5 mM) were used to study the effect of mediators. Results indicated that P. ostreatus PO-3 degraded 71.2 % of Benzo[a]pyrene in the presence of copper ions. Moderate degradation was observed in the presence of zinc and manganese. Both biomass formation and degradation were severely affected in the presence of all other heavy metal salts used in the study. Copper at 15 mM concentration supported the best degradation (74.2 %), beyond which the degradation progressively reduced. Among the mediators, 1 mM 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) supported 78.7 % degradation and 83.6 % degradation was observed under the influence of 5 mM vanillin. Thus, metal ion like copper is essential for better biodegradation of Benzo[a]pyrene. Compared to synthetic laccase mediator like 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate), natural mediator such as vanillin may play a significant role in the degradation of aromatic compounds by white-rot fungi.",

Several methods are employed to clean up the environment from these kinds of contaminants, but most of them are costly and ineffective to yield optimum results. Phytoremediation is a natural green technology, which is eco-friendly for the removal of toxic metals from the polluted environment. Phytoremediation is a cost-effective technique through which the cleanup of contaminated soil laced with heavy metals is performed by wild weeds and small herbal plants. The phytoremediation technique provides a promising tool for hyperaccumulation of heavy metals; arsenic, lead, mercury, copper, chromium, and nickel, etc., by the wild weeds and that has been discussed here in detail in case of Cannabissativa, Solanum nigrum and Rorippa globosa. In general, weeds that have the intrinsic capacity to accumulate metals into their shoots and roots, have the ability to form phytochelates and formation of stable compound with ions. This behavior of accumulation along with chelate and stable compound formation is utilized as a tool for phytoremediation activity.",

Various microorganisms such as bacteria, yeast and fungi are generally used for the production of l-asparaginase as it is difficult to obtain the same from plants and animals. l-Asparaginase from bacteria causes anaphylaxis and other abnormal sensitive reactions due to low specificity to asparagine. Toxicity and repression caused by bacterial l-asparaginase shifted focus to eukaryotic microorganisms such as fungi to improve the efficacy of l-asparaginase. Clinically available l-asparaginase has glutaminase and urease that may lead to side effects during treatment of ALL. Current work tested 45 fungal strains isolated from soil and agricultural residues. Isolated fungi were tested using conventional plate assay method with two indicator dyes, phenol red and bromothymol blue (BTB), and results were compared. l-Asparaginase activity was measured by cultivating in modified Czapek–Dox medium. Four strains have shown positive result for l-asparaginase production with no urease or glutaminase activity, among these C7 has high enzyme index of 1.57 and l-asparaginase activity of 33.59 U/mL. l-Asparaginase production by C7 was higher with glucose as carbon source and asparagine as nitrogen source. This is the first report focussing on fungi that can synthesize l-asparaginase of the desired specificity. Since the clinical toxicity of l-asparaginase is attributed to glutaminase and urease activity, available evidence indicates variants negative for glutaminase and urease would provide higher therapeutic index than variants positive for glutaminase and urease.",

A relative molecular mass of purified PG was approximately 124.0 kDa. The pH and temperature optimum was found to be 4 and 50 °C, respectively. The k cat and K m value for degradation of PGA by the purified enzyme was found to be 194 s-1 and 2.3 mg/mL, respectively. Cu2+ was found to enhance the PG activity while Ag+ completely inhibited the enzyme activity. The application of the purified PG in orange juice clarification was elucidated.",

The GSLs, phenolic compound contents and transcript levels in hairy root cultures, as well as their antioxidant, antimicrobial and anticancer activity were studied in turnip. Transgenic hairy root lines were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription-PCR. GSLs levels (glucoallysin, glucobrassicanapin, gluconasturtiin, glucobrassicin, 4-methoxyglucobrassicin, neoglucobrassicin and 4-hydroxyglucobrassicin) and their gene expression levels (BrMYB28, BrMYB29, BrMYB34, BrMYB51, BrMYB122, CYP79 and CYP83) significantly increased in hairy roots compared with that in non-transformed roots. Furthermore, hairy roots efficiently produced several important individual phenolic compounds (flavonols, hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids). Colorimetric analysis revealed that the highest levels of total phenol, flavonoid contents, and their gene expression levels (PAL, CHI and FLS) in hairy roots than non-transformed roots. Our study provides beneficial information on the molecular and physiological active processes that are associated with the phytochemical content and biosynthetic gene expression in turnip. Moreover, antioxidant activity, as measured by DPPH scavenging activity, reducing potential, phosphomolybdenum and ferrous ion chelating ability assays was significantly higher in hairy roots. Hairy root extracts exhibited higher antimicrobial activity against bacterial and fungal species. The extract of hairy roots showed inhibition of human breast and colon cancer cell lines.",

The mycosynthesized AgNPs were characterized by means of spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The surface plasmon resonance found at 430 nm confirmed the formation of stable AgNPs for several weeks at room temperature. Also, the results revealed the formation of spherical and monodispersed AgNPs with an average size of 14.8 ± 1.2 nm. The FT-IR spectrum suggested that the fungal extracellular proteins and secondary metabolites had the role in Ag reduction and AgNPs capping of which protein Ag nanoconjugates were formed. Furthermore, the mycosynthesized AgNPs exhibited potent antifungal activity against different pathogenic isolates of the same Alternaria solani fungus, the causal pathogen of tomato early blight disease. The antifungal efficiency of the AgNPs at 1, 5 and 10 ppm were evaluated for 8 days after incubation by measuring the inhibition rate of fungal radial growth. The results were further supported by investigating fungal hyphae morphology alteration by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Treated fungal hyphae showed formation of pits and pores. Also, the mycosynthesized AgNPs were able to pass and distribute throughout the fungal cell area and interact with the cell components.",

Peach waste of these obtained from fruit juice industry was utilized as the substrate for laccase production by Pleurotus eryngii under solid state bioprocessing (SSB). Its chemical composition was determined and this bioprocess was carried out under stationary conditions at 28 °C. The effects of different compounds; copper, iron, Tween 80, ammonium nitrate and manganese, and their variable concentrations on laccase production were investigated in detail. The optimum production of laccase (43,761.33 ± 3845 U L −1 ) was achieved on the day of 20 by employing peach waste of 5.0 g and 70 µM Cu 2+ , 18 µM Fe 2+ , 0.025% (v/v) Tween 80, 4.0 g L −1 ammonium nitrate, 750 µM Mn 2+ as the inducers. The dye decolorization also researched to determine the degrading capability of laccase produced from peach culture under the above-mentioned conditions. Within this scope of the study, methyl orange, tartrazine, reactive red 2 and reactive black dyes were treated with this enzyme. The highest decolorization was performed with methyl orange as 43 ± 2.8% after 5 min of treatment when compared to other dyes. Up to now, this is the first report on the induction of laccase production by P. eryngii under SSB using peach waste as the substrate.",

Photoautotrophic cultivation of microorganisms is a boon and considered as a potential biological treatment for remediation of wastewater as it sequesters CO2 during growth. Photoautotrophs viz. cyanobacteria, micro-algae and macro-algae can photosynthetically assimilate the excessive pollutants present in the wastewater. The present review emphasizes on the achievability of microorganisms to bestow wastewater as the nutrient source for biomass production, which can further be reused for feed, food and fertilizers. To support this, various case studies have been cited that prove phycoremediation as a cost-effective and sustainable process over conventional wastewater treatment processes that requires high chemical load and more energy inputs.",

Pyrene is a high-molecular weight PAH, which has human health concerns. In the present study, a bacterial consortium, PBR, was developed from a long-term polluted site, viz., Amlakhadi, Ankleshwar, Gujarat, for effective degradation of pyrene. The consortium effectively metabolized pyrene as a sole source of carbon and energy. The consortium comprised three bacterial species, Pseudomonas sp. ASDP1, Burkholderia sp. ASDP2, and Rhodococcus sp. ASDP3. The maximum growth rate of consortium was 0.060/h and the maximum pyrene degradation rate was 16 mg/l/day. The organic and inorganic nutrients along with different surfactants did not affect pyrene degradation, but degradation rate moderately increased in the presence of sodium succinate. The significant characteristic of the consortium was that it possessed an ability to degrade six other hydrocarbons, both independently and simultaneously at 37 °C, in BHM (pH 7.0) under shaking conditions (150 rpm) and it showed resistance towards mercury at 10 mM concentration. Phthalic acid as one of the intermediates during pyrene degradation was detected through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The efficiency of consortium for pyrene degradation was validated in simulated microcosms' study, which indicated that 99% of pyrene was metabolized by the consortium under ambient conditions.",

    "abstract": "Coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) is one of the important palms grown both as a homestead and plantation crop in countries and most island territories of tropical regions. Different DNA-based marker systems have been utilized to assess the extent of genetic diversity in coconut. Advances in genomics research have resulted in the development of novel gene-targeted markers. In the present study, we have used a simple and novel marker system, start codon targeted polymorphism (SCoT), for its evaluation as a potential marker system in coconut. SCoT markers were utilized for assessment of genetic diversity in 23 coconut accessions (10 talls and 13 dwarfs), representing different geographical regions. Out of 25 SCoT primers screened, 15 primers were selected for this study based on their consistent amplification patterns. A total of 102 scorable bands were produced by the 15 primers, 88 % of which were polymorphic. The scored data were used to construct a similarity matrix. The similarity coefficient values ranged between 0.37 and 0.91. These coefficients were utilized to construct a dendrogram using the unweighted pair group of arithmetic means (UPGMA). The extent of genetic diversity observed based on SCoT analysis of coconut accessions was comparable to earlier findings using other marker systems. Tall and dwarf coconut accessions were clearly demarcated, and in general, coconut accessions from the same geographical region clustered together. The results indicate the potential of SCoT markers to be utilized as molecular markers to detect DNA polymorphism in coconut accessions.",

The purified enzyme was obtained with a specific activity of 0.226 U mg−1 protein and a final yield of 13.5 %. The enzyme was found to be a monomeric protein with a molecular mass of ~75 kDa as estimated by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and further confirmed with zymogram analysis. The optimal pH and temperature of the laccase was recorded to be 5.5 and 40 °C, respectively. The metal ions Hg2+ and Ag+ were found to drastically inhibit the activity of laccase at the rate of 96.6 and 96.5 %, respectively. Nevertheless, Fe3+ was found to inhibit laccase activity at 40 %. Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) strongly inhibited the laccase activity, and additives viz, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and sodium chloride (NaCl) were known to follow the earlier pattern of enzyme inhibition. The values of kinetic parameters K m and V max for purified laccase were noted at 3.03 mM and 5 μmol min−1, respectively, for guaiacol as substrate. The textile dyes were decolorized at a range of 72–76 % and 88–93 % when treated with Marasmius sp. BBKAV79 and purified laccase, respectively. Based on the outcome of the present investigation, it could be, therefore, inferred that laccase isolated from Marasmius sp.

    "abstract": "Abstract In latest years, various techniques and chemicals have been used for the control of microbial influenced corrosion (MIC) of metals. The application of botanical-based biocides is one of the effective and practical techniques in the fight against MIC. In the present study, the role of aqueous extract of ginger ( Zingiber officinale ) (GIE) as green biocide to control MIC of mild steel 1010 (MS) in a cooling water system was investigated. Biocorrosion behavior of Bacillus thuringiensis EN2 on MS and its control by GIE was analyzed by electrochemical measurements. Polarization, electrochemical studies (ES), weight loss measurements (WL), and surface analysis (XRD, X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, and FTIR, Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy) were performed under various incubation periods up to 4 weeks. We observed that EN2 forms a thick biofilm on the MS metal surface at the end of the incubation period and the WL significantly increased to 993 mg at fourth week when compared to the initial immersion period (194 ± 2 mg). In contrast, with addition of GIE, WL was reduced about 41 ± 2 mg over biotic system (993 ± 2 mg). GC–MS analysis confirmed the adsorption of active component of GIE (β-turmerone) on the metal surface as a protective layer to prevent the biofilm formation and thus leads to reduction of corrosion. The optimum 20 ppm of GIE was found to be effective corrosion inhibition efficiency which was about 80%. From the results of WL, ES, XRD, FTIR, and GC–MS, GIE was identified as biocide and thus inhibits the bacterial growth on MS metal surface and it leads to control MIC. XRD showed that the GIE with EN2 resulted in less formation of corrosion products over biotic and abiotic systems. Overall, this research first shed light on the antibacterial activity of GIE inhibiting biofilm formation, thus reducing the corrosion of MS in cooling water systems.",

To prevent the solubility of polysaccharides in the DNA extract, high salt concentration (1.4 M) was used in the extraction buffer. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was used for the removal of polyphenols as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) inhibitors. Proteins like various enzymes were degraded by proteinase K and removed by centrifugation from plant extracts during the isolation process resulting in pure DNA and RNA ready to use in downstream applications including PCR, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), ligation, restriction and sequencing. This protocol yielded a high molecular weight DNA and RNA isolated from leaves and roots of recalcitrant plants which was free from contamination and color. The average yields of total RNA from roots and shoot of Betula and Grape ranged from 285 to 364 ng/µl with A260/A280 between 1.9 and 2.08. The RNA isolated with this protocol was verified to be suitable for PCR, quantitative real-time PCR, semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, cDNA synthesis and expression analysis. This protocol shown here is reproducible and can be used for a broad spectrum of plant species which have polyphenols and polysaccharide compounds.",

The two forest types with different dominant tree species differ in litter quality and root exudates, thereby exerting species-specific impact on soil properties and microbial activity. This study aims to examine the influence of forest type or dominant tree species on soil physico-chemical properties and its relationship with microbial characters in temperate and dry deciduous forest types. We assessed soil physico-chemical properties among five different sites located within the selected forest stand covered by different dominant species. The soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC), nitrogen (MBN) and phosphorous (MBP) were recorded high in oak soil, i.e., the MBC/TOC ratio was significantly higher in dry deciduous forest. Basal respiration was recorded highest at oak-mixed soil while qCO2 was comparatively high in oak soil. Temperate forest displayed the highest MBC/MBN ratio, while dry deciduous forest had the highest MBC/MBP ratio. Moreover, the MBN/TN ratio was found high in dry deciduous forest, whereas MBP/TP ratio was high in temperate forest. Additionally, the enzyme activities were significantly higher in an oak-mixed soil among all the sites. The results displayed that the soil microbial characters and soil physico-chemical uniqueness are interrelated, and were significantly influenced by specific forest type and climatic variables.",

    "abstract": "In the recent years, nanotechnology has attained much attention in the every field of science. The synthesis, characterisation and applications of metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) have become an important branch of nanotechnology. In the current study, MNPs were synthesised through polyols process and applied in vitro to study their effect on medicinally important plant : Artemisia absinthium. The current study strives to check the effect of MNPs, i.e., Ag, Cu and Au on seed germination, root and shoot length, seedling vigour index (SVI) and biochemical profiling in A. absinthium. The seeds were inoculated on MS medium supplemented with various combinations of MNPs suspension. The seed germination was greatly influenced upon the application of MNPs and was recorded highest for the silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) suspensions. The best result for seed germination (98.6%) was obtained in MS medium supplemented with AgNPs as compared to control (92.9%) and other nanoparticles, i.e., copper (69.6%) and gold (56.5%), respectively, after 35 days of inoculation. Significant results were obtained for root length, shoot length and SVI in response to application of AgNPs as compared to copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). These nanoparticles (NPs) could induce stress in plants by deploying the endogenous mechanism. In response to these stresses, plants produce various defence compounds. Total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) were significant in the MS medium supplemented with AgNPs as compared to other NPs, while DPPH radical scavenging assay (RSA) was highest in AuNPs treated plantlets. The MNPs showed higher toxicity level and enhanced secondary metabolites production, total phenolic content, total flavonoid content, antioxidant activity, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and total protein content.",

    "abstract": "Siderophore facilitates iron availability in soil, but its assistance in iron transportation to different plant parts is not reported till date. Therefore, it is worthwhile to study the effect of siderophore produced by Pseudomonas for iron acquisition in the presence and absence of iron. To study these effects, two siderophore-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains RSP5 and RSP8 were selected. RSP5 and RSP8 produced the highest and lowest amounts of siderophore, respectively. Iron (Fe) concentration of stem, leaf, seed, and shoot length, root length, cob length, and number of grains parameters were analysed. It was observed that the plants treated with RSP5 were sturdier and taller than RSP5 + Fe > RSP8 > RSP8 + Fe > Fe > Control plants. Iron content of RSP8 vs. RSP8 + Fe, RSP8 + Fe vs. Control, and RSP8 + Fe vs. RSP5 + Fe was significantly different (P < 0.01). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) proves that RSP5 was able to transport higher amount of iron to maize plant than other treatments. Increase in shoot length, root length, cob length, grain number and iron content of stem, and leaf and seed of maize plant inoculated with RSP5 suggests that the strain can be used as an inoculant for increasing iron transportation in maize plant.

Metagenomic DNA was extracted from rice wine starter culture concocted by Ahom community of Assam and analyzed using a MiSeq® System. A total of 2,78,231 contigs, with an average read length of 640.13 bp, were obtained. Data obtained from the use of several taxonomic profiling tools were compared with previously reported microbial diversity studies through the culture-dependent and culture-independent method. The microbial community revealed the existence of amylase producers, such as Rhizopus delemar, Mucor circinelloides, and Aspergillus sp. Ethanol producers viz., Meyerozyma guilliermondii, Wickerhamomyces ciferrii, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida glabrata, Debaryomyces hansenii, Ogataea parapolymorpha, and Dekkera bruxellensis, were found associated with the starter culture along with a diverse range of opportunistic contaminants. The bacterial microflora was dominated by lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The most frequent occurring LAB was Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, Leuconostoc lactis, Weissella cibaria, Lactococcus lactis, Weissella para mesenteroides, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, etc. Our study provided a comprehensive picture of microbial diversity associated with rice wine fermentation starter and indicated the superiority of metagenomic sequencing over previously used techniques.",

Among the 19 isolates of actinobacteria tested, significant (p < 0.05) increase of minerals over the uninoculated control treatments was noticed on all the isolates for Fe (10-38 %), 17 for Zn (13-30 %), 16 for Ca (14-26 %), 9 for Cu (11-54 %) and 10 for Mn (18-35 %) and Mg (14-21 %). The increase might be due to the production of siderophore-producing capacity of the tested actinobacteria, which was confirmed in our previous studies by q-RT PCR on siderophore genes expressing up to 1.4- to 25-fold increased relative transcription levels. The chickpea seeds were subjected to processing to increase the mineral availability during consumption. The processed seeds were found to meet the recommended daily intake of FDA by 24-28 % for Fe, 25-28 % for Zn, 28-35 % for Cu, 12-14 % for Ca, 160-167 % for Mn and 34-37 % for Mg.

This has been invaluable in deciphering the normal and disease states in cell biology; the key shortcomings of it being suitability for translational or clinical correlations. The past decade has seen several major advances in organoid culture technologies and this has enhanced our understanding of mimicking organ reconstruction. The term organoid has generally been used to describe cellular aggregates derived from primary tissues or stem cells that can self-organize into organotypic structures. Organoids mimic the cellular microenvironment of tissues better than 2D cell culture systems and represent the tissue physiology. Human organoids of brain, thyroid, gastrointestinal, lung, cardiac, liver, pancreatic and kidney have been established from various diseases, healthy tissues and from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Advances in patient-derived organoid culture further provides a unique perspective from which treatment modalities can be personalized. In this review article, we have discussed the current strategies for establishing various types of organoids of ectodermal, endodermal and mesodermal origin. We have also discussed their applications in modeling human health and diseases (such as cancer, genetic, neurodegenerative and infectious diseases), applications in regenerative medicine and evolutionary studies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The aim of this study was to determine the malondialdehyde (MDA) level and superoxide dismutase ( SOD) activity in colchicine induced Alzheimer’s disease ( AD), resveratrol ( RS) treated and RS + donepezil (DPZ) treated rat models. The objective was to compare the MDA level and SOD activity among these rat models. The present study included 3 months old male albino Wistar rats, which were in-house bred and weighting about 220–250 g. The rats were divided into nine subgroups which included control, sham, AD induced, RS treated and DPZ treated groups in different doses and combinations. The lipid peroxidation product for MDA in the brain homogenate was measured by estimating the levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance. Estimation of SOD was done by the method of autoxidation of pyrogallol by Marklund and Marklund. There was a marked increase in the MDA levels in AD induced group in comparison to the control group ( p &lt; 0.05). The SOD activity was higher in the RS 10 and RS 20 treated groups in contrast to the AD group ( p &lt; 0.05). In DPZ + RS group, there was a substantial increase in the SOD activity ( p &lt; 0.05). It is also observed that the RS 20 treatment group showed higher SOD activity than the RS 10 group ( p &lt; 0.05). This study showed that, AD induced group had elevated levels of MDA, which indicates the poor oxidative stress–defence mechanism. The RS 10 and RS 20 groups showed higher SOD activity in comparison to the AD group, which indicated the improved oxidative stress–defence mechanism. The RS + DPZ group showed higher SOD activity, indicating a synergistic effect of DPZ and RS.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 was declared a global pandemic by WHO (World Health Organization) in March, 2020. Within 6 months, nearly 750,000 deaths are claimed by COVID-19 across the globe. This called for immediate social, scientific, technological, public and community interventions. Considering the severity of infection and the associated mortalities, global efforts are underway to develop preventive measures against SARS-CoV-2. Among the SARS-CoV-2 target proteins, Spike (S) glycoprotein (a.k.a S Protein) is the most studied target known to trigger strong host immune response. A detailed analysis of S protein-based epitopes enabled us to design a novel B-cell-derived T-cell Multi-epitope-based peptide (MEBP) vaccine candidate. This involved a systematic and comprehensive computational protocol consisting of prediction of dual-purpose epitopes and designing an MEBP vaccine construct. This was followed by 3D structure validation, MEBP complex interaction studies, in silico cloning and vaccine dose-based immune response simulation to evaluate the immunogenic potency of the vaccine construct. The dual-purpose epitope prediction protocol was designed such that the same epitope elicits both humoral and cellular immune response unlike the earlier designs. Further, the epitopes predicted were screened against stringent criteria to ensure selection of a potent candidate with maximum antigen coverage and best immune response. The vaccine dose-based immune response simulation studies revealed a rapid antigen clearance through antibody generation and elevated levels of cell-mediated immunity during repeated exposure of the vaccine. The favourable results of the analysis strongly indicate that the vaccine construct is indeed a potent vaccine candidate and ready to proceed to the next steps of experimental validation and efficacy studies.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogel-based matrix prepared using biopolymers is a new frontier of emerging platforms for enzyme immobilization for biomedical applications. Catalase (CAT) delivery can be effective in inhibiting reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated prolongation of the wound healing process. In this study, to improve CAT stability for effective application, gelatin(Gel)-alginate (Alg) biocompatible hydrogel (Gel-Alg), as immobilization support, was prepared using calcium chloride as an ionic cross-linker. High entrapment efficiency of 92% was obtained with 2% Gel and 1.5% Alg. Hydrogel immobilized CAT (CAT-Gel-Alg) showed a wide range of pH from 4 to 9 and temperature stability between 20 to 60 °C, compared to free CAT. CAT-Gel-Alg kinetic parameters revealed an increased Km (24.15 mM) and a decreased Vmax (1.39 µmol H2O2/mg protein min) × 104. CAT-Gel-Alg retained 52% of its original activity after 20 consecutive catalytic runs and displayed improved thermal stability with a higher t1/2 value (half-life of 100.43 vs. 46 min). In addition, 85% of the initial activity was maintained after 8 weeks' storage at 4 °C. At 24 h after thermal injury, a statistically significant difference in lesion sizes between the treated group and the control group was reported. Finally, our findings suggest that the superior CAT-Gel-Alg stability and reusability are resonant features for efficient biomedical applications, and ROS scavenging by CAT in the post-burn phase offers protection for local treatment of burned tissues with encouraging wound healing kinetics.",

The inherent defense mechanisms employed by plants, including metal sequestration into vacuoles, phytochelation, cell wall metal adsorption and an enhanced antioxidant system can be improved via various approaches to mitigate heavy metal toxicity. This review primarily outlines plants direct and indirect responses to HM stress and the tolerance mechanisms by which plants combat the toxic effects of metals and metalloids to understand the effective management of HMs and metalloids in the soil system. Furthermore, this review highlights measures to mitigate metal and metalloid toxicity and improve metal tolerance through various physio-biochemical, biological, and molecular approaches. This review also provides a comprehensive account of all the mitigative approaches by comparing physio-biochemical, biological and molecular approaches. Finally, we compared all the mitigative approaches used in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous to increase their metal tolerance. Although many studies have compared monocot and dicot plants based on metal toxicity and tolerance effects, comparisons of these mitigative approaches have not been explored.",

Key findings demonstrate that AI models, such as Naïve Bayes, Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), have significantly advanced the prediction of drug resistance patterns and the identification of novel antibiotics. These algorithms have effectively optimized antibiotic use, predicted resistance phenotypes, and identified new drug candidates. AI has also facilitated the detection of AMR-associated mutations, offering new insights into the spread of resistance and potential interventions. Despite data privacy and algorithm transparency challenges, AI presents a promising tool in combating AMR, with implications for improving patient outcomes, enhancing disease management, and addressing global public health concerns. However, realizing its full potential requires overcoming issues related to data scarcity, ethical considerations, and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration.",

Five bioreactors were biostimulated with either K(2)HPO(4), NH(4)NO(3), (NH(4))(2)SO(4), NPK, urea or poultry droppings while unamended (BUNa) and heat-killed (BAUT) treatments were controls. For each bioreactor, 1 kg (wet weight) sediment amended with 1 l seawater were spiked with 20 ml and 20 mg of crude oil and anthracene which gave a total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) range of 106.4-116 ppm on day 0. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in all spiked sediment slurry ranged from 96.6 to 104.4 ppm. TPH in each treatment was ≤14.9 ppm while PAH was ≤6.8 ppm by day 56. Treatment BNO(3) recorded highest heterotrophic bacterial count (9.8 × 10(8) cfu/g) and hydrocarbon utilizers (1.15 × 10(8) cfu/g). By day 56, the percentages of biodegradation of PAHs, as measured with GC-FID were BNK5 (97.93%), BNPK (98.38%), BUK (98.82%), BUNa (98.13%), BAUT (93.08%), BPD (98.92%), and BNO(3) (98.02%). BPD gave the highest degradation rate for PAH. TPH degradation rates were as follows: BNK5 (94.50%), BNPK (94.77%), BUK (94.10%), BUNa (94.77%), BAUT (75.04%), BPD (95.35%), BNO(3) (95.54%). Fifty-six hydrocarbon utilizing bacterial isolates obtained were Micrococcus spp. 5 (9.62%), Staphylococcus spp. 3 (5.78%), Pseudomonas spp. 7 (13.46%), Citrobacter sp. 1 (1.92%), Klebsiella sp. 1 (1.92%), Corynebacterium spp. 5 (9.62%), Bacillus spp. 5 (9.62%), Rhodococcus spp. 7 (13.46%), Alcanivorax spp. 7 (13.46%), Alcaligenes sp. 1 (1.92%), Serratia spp. 2 (3.85%), Arthrobacter spp. 7 (13.46%), Nocardia spp. 2 (3.85%), Flavobacterium sp. 1 (1.92%), Escherichia sp. 1 (1.92%), Acinetobacter sp. 1 (1.92%), Proteus sp. 1 (1.92%) and unidentified bacteria 10 (17%). These results indicate that the marine sediment investigated is amenable to bioreactor-based bioremediation and that abiotic factors also could contribute to hydrocarbon attenuation as recorded in the heat-killed (BAUT) control.",

Benzyladenine (BA) at 4.44 μM was found to be optimal in producing on maximum an average of 9.0 ± 1.0 axillary shoots per explant after 15 days of inoculation. A high multiplication rate was established through routine sub culturing of nodal sections explanted from in vitro shoot cultures. In vitro rooting of individual shoot culture was maximum (100%) on medium containing indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) at 2.85 μM along with indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) at 4.92 μM. Eighty percent of the rooted plants survived after being transplanted in the soil, provided that the potted plantlets were covered with clear polythene bags and kept in a shaded greenhouse for 15 days before exposure to ambient conditions. Fresh leaves of field grown tissue culture plants were analyzed for lutein, β-carotene, α-tocopherol, total carotenoids and chlorophyll content. Tissue culture-derived plants were found nutritionally superior over control plants to contain 13.2 and 14.7% higher amount α-tocopherol and total carotenoids, respectively. The result of present study will be useful for rapid clonal propagation of M. oleifera and production of nutritionally superior plant.",

They can be used by plants for defense in addition to the production of a wide variety of beneficial bioactive secondary metabolites. There are reports that microbial endophytes mimic the bioactive compounds as produced by the plant itself thus making them a promising source of novel compounds. During the present study, endophytes were isolated from the symptomless leaves and stem of the angiosperm, Digitalis lanata (foxglove). Digitalis lanata belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is an important medicinal plant known for the production of an important glycoside, digoxin having valuable medicinal importance. Glycosides from Digitalis have been reported to be cardiotonic and are widely used in the treatment of various heart conditions namely atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, heart failure, etc. Endophytic fungi were isolated from Digitalis to screen them for such glycosides as have been found in the plant itself. A total of 35 fungal endophytes were isolated and screened for the production of secondary metabolites. After preliminary analysis by thin layer chromatography for the presence of bioactive compounds, crude extracts of five fungal cultures were selected for HPLC. HPLC chromatograms revealed the production of glycoside digoxin from the five selected endophytic cultures, thus providing a novel, alternative and eco-friendly source for the production of such a pharmaceutically important and valuable drug.",

During RAPD analysis, amplification of genomic DNA of the 15 accessions by 22 primers generated 197 fragments, of which 187 were polymorphic with an average of 8.95 bands per primer. The amplified products varied in size from 2,200 to 250 bp. Twenty-five selected ISSR primers produced 284 bands across 15 accessions, of which 270 were polymorphic with an average of 10.80 bands per primer. The PIC value ranges from 0.363 to 0.908 for RAPD primers, while 0.419 to 0.836 in case of ISSR. The size of amplified bands ranged from 2,800 to 240 bp. Similarity index values ranged from 0.16 to 0.95 (RAPD), 0.18 to 0.98 (ISSR) and 0.179 to 0.945 for pooled ISSR and RAPD markers data. Mantel test revealed the similar distribution pattern of the polymorphism between RAPD and ISSR markers and the correlation co-efficient (r) was 0.71384. The results indicated that both of the marker systems RAPD and ISSR, individually or combined can be effectively used in determination of genetic relationship among B. Monnieri accessions collected from different parts of Central India. It could be concluded that the information of genetic similarities and diversity among Brahmi accessions is necessary for their conservation and breeding programs.",

    "abstract": "The water fern Azolla harbors nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Anabaena azollae as symbiont in its dorsal leaves and is known as potent N2 fixer. Present investigation was carried out to study the influence of fresh Azolla when used as basal incorporation in soil and as dual cropped with rice variety Mahsoori separately and together with and without chemical nitrogen fertilizer in pots kept under net house conditions. Results showed that use of Azolla as basal or dual or basal plus dual influenced the rice crop positively where use of fern as basal plus dual was superior and served the nitrogen requirement of rice. There was marked increase in plant height, number of effective tillers, dry mass and nitrogen content of rice plants with the use of Azolla and N-fertilizers alone and other combinations. The use of Azolla also increased organic matter and potassium contents of the soil.",

The isolate IC-76 produced indole acetic acid, siderophore, hydrocyanic acid, cellulase, protease, and β-1,3-glucanase. When the bacterium was evaluated individually for their PGP potential in the greenhouse on chickpea and in combination with five Streptomyces sp. (strains CAI-24, CAI-121, CAI-127, KAI-32, and KAI-90; demonstrated earlier as biocontrol potential against Fusarium wilt disease in chickpea), the traits, including nodule number and weight, shoot, and root weight, pod number and weight, seed number and weight, available phosphorus and % organic carbon were found significantly, enhanced over un-inoculated control. In the on-station and on-farm field conditions, IC-76 significantly enhanced nodule number and weight, shoot, and root weight, stover and grain yield and total dry matter. In the rhizosphere (0-15 cm soil), the bacterium also significantly enhanced the total nitrogen, available phosphorus and % organic carbon. The sequence of 16S rDNA gene of the IC-76 was matched with Pseudomonas geniculata in BLAST analysis. This study demonstrates that IC-76 has the potential for PGP in chickpea.",

Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that the purified alkaline protease (148.9 U/mg) is a monomeric enzyme with a molecular mass of 16 ± 1 kDa. This was confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The active enzyme degraded the co-polymerized gelatin. The protease demonstrated excellent stability at pH range 8.0-12.0 with optimum at pH 11.0. It was almost 100 % stable at 50 °C for 24 h, enhanced by Ca2+ and Mg2+, but inhibited by Hg2+, and strongly inhibited by phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride. It showed maximum activity against casein followed by gelatin; its Vmax was 12.8 U/ml with its corresponding KM of 5.4 mg/ml. The proteolytic activity was activated by Tween-80, Triton-100 and SDS, and remained unaltered in the presence of H2O2 and NaClO. The enzyme exhibited higher storage stability at 4, 28 and -20 °C. It was stable and compatible to the desired level in the local detergents. The addition of the protease to the Super wheel improved its blood stain removal. The isolated protease can thus be a choice option in detergent industry.",

In the present study, optimization of process parameters influencing melanin production was attempted using the response surface methodology (RSM) from Brevundimonas sp. SGJ. A Plackett–Burman design was used for screening of critical components, while further optimization was carried out using the Box–Behnken design. The optimum conditions observed were pH 5.31, tryptone 1.440 g l−1, l-tyrosine 1.872 g l−1 and CuSO4 0.0366 g l−1. Statistical analysis revealed that the model is significant with model F value 29.03 and R2 value 0.9667. The optimization of process parameters using RSM resulted in a 3.05-fold increase in the yield of melanin. The intermittent addition of l-tyrosine enhanced the melanin yield to 6.811 g l−1. The highest tyrosinase activity observed was 2,471 U mg−1 at the 18th hour of the incubation period with dry cell weight of 0.711 g l−1. The melanin production was confirmed by UV–Visible spectroscopy, FTIR and EPR analysis. Thus, Brevundimonas sp. SGJ has the potential to be a new source for the production of melanin.",

    "abstract": "Drought stress due to water deficit is a major problem of rice cultivation as a most drought-sensitive crop plant. A rice mutant line (MT58) was developed after mutagenesis of cv. Neda by ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) and selected for dwarfism (18 cm shorter than Neda). The extent of its molecular changes relative to parental cultivar was assessed by SSR and ISSR markers, and the response of the line along with parental cultivar and another mutant line (MTA) to mild and severe water deficit, was evaluated in a field experiment. A molecular assessment using 41 SSR markers showed that dwarf line MT58 had significant molecular difference with two other lines. ISSR assay also proved the considerable mutational effect of EMS on two mutant lines compared with the original wild line. Field experiments revealed that limited irrigation caused mild-to-severe decrease in all the studied traits, including chlorophyll contents. In mild water-stress mutant line, MT58 showed a low (3 %) yield loss as compared with cultivar Neda with a high (14 %) yield loss. Interestingly, in severe water-stress mutant line, MT58 showed a low (19 %) yield loss as compared with mutant line MTA and cv. Neda with high (33 and 31 %, respectively) yield loss. In severe stress, mutant MT58 had the highest values of panicle length, total kernels per panicle, fertile kernels, and chlorophyll contents, while cv. Neda had the highest values of plant height, tiller number, and plant yield, and reduction in chlorophyll content at drought stress condition was correlated with yield loss (0.64 and 0.697 for chl.a and chl.b, respectively). The results of this research obviously confirm that mutant line MT58 despite of its stunt figure shows a low yield loss due to drought stress and hence is a promising line for cultivation under drought condition.",

The biobleaching of kraft pulp with xylanase was the most effective at an enzyme dose of 10 IU/g oven dried pulp, pH 9.0 and 120 min incubation at 55 °C. Under the optimized conditions, xylanase pretreatment reduced Kappa number by 1.6 points and increased brightness by 1.9 points.

The pretreatment of pulp with xylanase resulted in 29.16 % reduction in chlorine consumption by maintaining the same brightness as in control. An improvement in pulp strength properties was also observed after bleaching of xylanase pretreated pulp. Scanning electron microscopy revealed loosening and swelling of pulp fibers after enzyme treatment. These results clearly demonstrated that the B. pumilus SV-85S xylanase was effective as a pulp biobleaching agent. The decrease in chlorine consumption by pretreatment of pulp with xylanase apparently made the biobleaching process not only economical but also eco-friendly.",

    "abstract": "A mathematical modeling of microalgae biomass is an essential step to optimize the biomass and lipid production rate and to reduce the cost of microalgal biodiesel production system. In the present study, kinetic studies were carried out to describe the growth and neutral lipid production of two marine microalgae Chlorella salina and Nannochloropsis oculata under the nitrogen-repleted and -depleted conditions using logistic and Luedeking-Piret equations. This research paper provides the information on mathematically efficient procedure to predict suitable environment condition for biomass and lipid production. The predicted results were compared with experimental data, which showed that this model closely agreed with simulated results. From this investigation, it was found that nitrogen was an essential nutrient for algal growth, which increased under nitrogen-rich condition, whereas during nitrogen-limited condition some loss in growth was observed but with increased lipid content. Since metabolic changes occurred under nitrogen- depleted state, the protein and carbohydrate pathways were shifted to lipid biosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Sanitary landfilling is the most common way to dispose solid urban waste; however, improper landfill management may pose serious environmental threats through discharge of high strength polluted wastewater also known as leachate. The treatment of landfill leachate to fully reduce the negative impact on the environment, is nowadays a challenge. In this study, an aerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) was proposed for the treatment of locally obtained real landfill leachate with initial ammoniacal nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration of 1800 and 3200 mg/L, respectively. ASBR could remove 65 % of ammoniacal nitrogen and 30 % of COD during seven days of treatment time. Thereafter, an effective adsorbent, i.e., zeolite was used as a secondary treatment step for polishing the ammoniacal nitrogen and COD content that is present in leachate. The results obtained are promising where the adsorption of leachate by zeolite further enhanced the removal of ammoniacal nitrogen and COD up to 96 and 43 %, respectively. Furthermore, this combined biological–physical treatment system was able to remove heavy metals, i.e. aluminium, vanadium, chromium, magnesium, cuprum and plumbum significantly. These results demonstrate that combined ASBR and zeolite adsorption is a feasible technique for the treatment of landfill leachate, even considering this effluent's high resistance to treatment.",

    "abstract": "Aspergillus terreus NCFT4269.10 was implemented in solid-state (SSF) and liquid static surface fermentation (LSSF) for biosynthesis of pectinase. Amongst various substrates, like, mustard oil cake, neem oil cake, groundnut oil cake, black gram peels, green gram peels, chickling vetch peels/grass pea peels wheat bran, pearl millet residues, finger millet waste, broken rice, banana peels (BP), apple pomace (AP) and orange peels, banana peel (Musa paradisiaca L.; Family: Musaceae) was most suitable for pectinase biosynthesis (LSSF: 400 ± 21.45 Uml-1; SSF: 6500 ± 1116.21 Ug-1). Optimization of process parameters using one-variable-at-a-time method revealed that an initial medium pH of 5.0 at 30 °C and 96 h of incubation along with mannitol, urea, ammonium persulfate and isoleucine have positive influence on pectinase production. Further, K+ (1 mM), Riboflavin (10 mg 100 ml-1) and gibberellic acid (0.025 %, w/v) supported in enhanced pectinase production. Banana peels and AP at a ratio of 9:1, moisture content of 90 % with 2 % inoculum size were suitable combinations for production of pectinase. Similarly, 96 h of soaking time with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) is essential for pectinase recovery. Purification to electrophoretic homogeneity revealed 1.42 fold purification with 8.08 % yield and a molecular weight of 24.6 kDa. Scaling up of various fermentation parameters and supplementing BP as the substrate for pectinase production with better recovery could make it promising for different industrial exploitation.",

To understand the functional proteins of cypermethrin degradation in Bacillus thuringiensis strain SG4, a comparative proteomic analysis was performed in the presence/absence of cypermethrin after 5 days of incubation in minimal medium. More than 450 spots corresponding to different proteins were recorded by 2D electrophoresis. We report expression of 223 and 250 unique proteins under normal and induced conditions (cypermethrin stress), respectively. Identified proteins were categorized into different functional groups on the basis of their biological functions, viz., catabolic enzymes, translational and stress proteins, etc. Characterization of cypermethrin-specific proteins in a bacterial strain will help in biodegradation practices in situ.",

We characterized a xylanase from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain SK-3 and studied it for kraft pulp bleaching. The purified enzyme had a molecular weight of ~50 kDa with optimal activity at pH 9.0 and 50 °C. The enzyme showed good activity retention (85%) after 2 h incubation at 50 °C and pH 9.0. This enzyme obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with regard to beechwood xylan with K m and V max values of 5.6 mg/ml, 433 μM/min/mg proteins, respectively. The enzyme activity was stimulated by Mn2+, Ca2+ and Fe2+ metal ions. Further, it also showed good tolerance to phenolics (2 mM) in the presence of syringic acid (no loss), cinnamic acid (97%), benzoic acid (94%) and phenol (97%) activity retention. The thermostability of xylanase was increased by 6.5-fold in presence of sorbitol (0.75 M). Further, pulp treated with 20U/g of xylanase (20IU/g) alone and with sorbitol (0.75M) reduced kappa number by 18.3 and 23.8%, respectively after 3 h reaction. In summary, presence of xylanase shows good pulp-bleaching activity, good tolerance to phenolics, lignin and metal ions and is amenable to thermostability improvement by addition of polyols. The SEM image showed significant changes on the surface of xylanase-treated pulp fiber as a result of xylan hydrolysis.",

The biofilm chemical composition and its correlation with the genotypes were also analysed. Staphylococcus epidermidis (59%) was found to be the most prevalent CoNS species. Most of the CoNS isolates harboring biofilm gene showed carbohydrate-protein-eDNA biofilm, whereas carbohydrate-protein biofilms were also observed. High percentage of multiple drug resistance, and biofilm gene frequency among these CoNS isolates point towards the need of periodic surveillance as CoNS are recently identified to cause difficult to treat infections.",

Having paramount industrial significance, lactic acid should be highly pure, devoid of any contaminants. Hence, development of minimum steps of platform technologies to purify it needs urgent attention. The article proposed a novel and simple process for separation of lactic acid from a potential substrate Zizyphus oenophlia, based on ion exchange chromatography. The process herein involves two steps of purification; firstly a weak anion exchange resin was used to separate lactic acid from other anions present in the broth. This was followed by use of strong cation exchanger which washes out the target molecule (lactic acid) while trapped other cations present in the solution. The selected ion exchangers were Amberlite IRA 96 and Amberlite IR 120. Amberlite IRA 96 retained the lactic acid from the broth while washing away other anions. Maximum binding capacity of the resin was found to 210.46 mg lactic acid/g bead. After the simple two-step purification process, the purity of lactic acid improves up to 99.17 % with a recovery yield of 98.9 %. Upon characterization, formation of only levo rotatory form of lactic acid confirms its easy metabolism by the human system, thus triggering its application towards biomaterial sector.",

The actinobacterial isolates were screened for heavy metal resistance by qualitative, semiquantitative assays and Cr(VI) biosorption was determined by analytical techniques such as atomic absorption spectrophotometry and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR). All the tested actinobacterial isolates (n = 20) showed resistance toward K2Cr2O7, NiCl2, ZnCl2, CuSO4 and PbNO3 at 20 mg L-1 concentration. The maximum tolerance concentration values were found to be 200-250 mg L-1 for K2Cr2O7, 100-250 mg L-1 for PbNO3 and <50-250 mg L-1 for NiCl2, ZnCl2 and CuSO4. Among the five tested heavy metals, Cr(VI) was resisted by 95 % of the tested actinobacterial cultures up to 250 mg L-1 concentration; particularly, the isolate LD22 exhibited a high degree of tolerance to all the tested heavy metals. Thus, the isolate was justifiably chosen for Cr(VI) biosorption study and the biosorption efficacy was found maximum at 100 mg L-1 of metal ion concentration (3 g L-1 of biomass dosage and pH 7.0). FT-IR spectrum revealed the chemical interactions between the hydroxyl, amine and carboxyl groups of the biomass and the metal ions. On the basis of phenotypic, physiological, biochemical and molecular characteristics the isolate LD22 was identified as Streptomyces werraensis LD22 (JX524481) which could be used to develop a biosorbent for adsorbing Cr(VI) metal ions.",

    "abstract": "This research employs draft genome sequence data of Klebsiella pneumoniae AWD5 to explore genes that contribute to the degradation of polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and stimulate plant growth, for rhizosphere-mediated bioremediation. Annotation analysis suggests that the strain AWD5 not only possess gene clusters for PAH utilization, but also for utilization of benzoate, fluorobenzoate, phenylacetate (paa), hydroxyphenylacetic acid (hpa), 3-hydroxyphenyl propionate (mhp). A comparative genome analysis revealed that the genome of AWD5 was highly similar with genomes of environmental as well as clinical K. pneumoniae isolates. The artemis output confirmed that there are 139 different genes present in AWD5 which were absent in genome of clinical strain K. pneumoniae ATCC BAA-2146, and 25 genes were identified to be present in AWD5 genome but absent in genome of environmental strain K. pneumoniae KP-1. Pathway analyzed using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enzyme database revealed the presence of gene clusters that code for enzymes to initiate the opening of aromatic rings. The polyaromatic hydrocarbon and benzoate degradation were found to be metabolized through ortho-cleavage pathway, mineralizing the compounds to TCA cycle intermediates. Genes for plant growth promoting attributes such as Indole acetic acid (IAA) synthesis, siderophore production, and phosphate solubilization were detected in the genome. These attributes were verified in vitro, including IAA (14.75 µg/ml), siderophore production (13.56%), phosphate solubilization (198.28 ng/ml), and ACC deaminase (0.118 mM α-ketobutyrate/mg) in the presence of pyrene, and also compared with results obtained in glucose amended medium. K. pneumoniae AWD5 enhanced the growth of Jatropha curcas in the presence of pyrene-contaminated soil. Moreover, AWD5 harbors heavy metal resistance genes indicating adaptation to contaminants. The study revealed the genomic attributes of K. pneumoniae AWD5 for its catabolic characteristics for different aromatic compounds, which makes it suitable for rhizoremediation of PAH-contaminated soil.",

    "abstract": "It has been reported that acrylamide, a potential carcinogen, is formed from the reaction of L-asparagine (L-Asn) and reducing sugars contained in foods during heating processes and free asparagine is a limiting factor for acrylamide formation. It has been reported that potato products such as potato chips, which are made through heating processes, contain high levels of acrylamide. To decrease the amount of L-Asn in potatoes using L-asparaginase, effective treatment conditions of sliced potatoes with the enzyme have been investigated. By treating sliced potatoes with Bacillus subtilis L-asparaginase II (BAsnase; 4 U/g potato), appriximately 40 % of L-Asn in the sliced potatoes was converted into L-aspartic acid (L-Asp). To make this enzyme more effective, prior to enzymatic treatment, sliced potatoes were freeze-thawed, dried at 90 °C for 20 min, and vacuum treated for 10 min under decompressed condition, resulting in the hydrolysis of approximately 90 % of L-Asn to L-Asp. The acrylamide content of BAsnase-treated fried potato chips decreased to below 20 % of that of BAsnase-untreated fried potato chips. Treatment conditions examined in this study were found to be effective to suppress the formation of acrylamide in fried potato chips.",

    "abstract": "The strain VUK-A was isolated from a sediment sample of the Coringa mangrove ecosystem was identified as Streptomyces cheonanensis based on morphological, physiological, biochemical and molecular properties. Chemical investigation of the secondary metabolites of the strain Streptomyces cheonanensis VUK-A has led to the segregation of two bioactive compounds, namely 2-Methyl butyl propyl phthalate (1) and Diethyl phthalate (2) using column chromatography. The chemical structure of the active compounds was established on the basis of spectroscopic analysis, including 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopies, FTIR and EIMS. The antimicrobial activity of the bioactive compounds produced by the strain was tested against a wide variety of bacteria and fungi and expressed in terms of minimum inhibitory concentration. The compounds (1&2) were active against all the bacteria tested, and the best activity of compound 1 was recorded against Proteus vulgaris (4 µg/ml). Compounds (1&2) were active against dermatophytes and fungi but compound 1 displayed high antifungal activity against Candida albicans (8 µg/ml) and Fusarium solani (16 µg/ml) compared to standard antifungal agents. The cytotoxicity of the bioactive compound 1 was tested against MDA-MB-231, OAW-42, HeLa, and MCF-7 cell lines. The highest activity of 100 µM by compound 1 was recorded against HeLa cancer cell lines. In fact, this is the first report of 2-Methyl butyl propyl phthalate from the genus Streptomyces.",

In this study, phenolic compounds, in vitro anti-oxidant activity and anti-microbial properties have been investigated in five Himalayan medicinal plants, (e.g., Acorus calamus, Habenaria intermedia, Hedychium spicatum, Roscoea procera and Valeriana jatamansi) in different solvent systems. R. procera exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) higher phenolics; while H. spicatum was rich in flavonoids and V. jatamansi in anti-oxidant activity. Also, R. procera and H. spicatum were found rich in gallic acid; V. jatamansi in catechin, hydroxylbenzoic acid and caffeic acid and H. intermedia in hydroxyl benzoic acid. Solvent systems showed species specific response for extraction of total flavonoids and anti-oxidant activity. All the extracts were found effective against different bacterial and fungal strains in a dose dependent manner and maximum antimicrobial activity was found in R. procera as compared to other species. All the plant extracts showed greater activity against bacterial strains as compared to fungal strains. The results of this study suggest that extract of these species can be used as natural anti-oxidant to reduce free radical mediated disorders and as natural alternative for food preservation.",

The results revealed that highest cellulase production was achieved on the 8th day of incubation, at 30 °C, keeping solid-to-liquid ratio 1:2 when two discs of inoculum were used per gram of the substrate. The optimized inoculum age was 96 h for CMCase and 120 h for FPase. On studying the enhancing effect of different carbon and nitrogen sources, lactose and ammonium molybdate were found suitable, respectively. The optimized concentration of lactose for the highest CMCase and FPase activities was 1.5 and 1%, respectively. Ammonium molybdate was best at 1% concentration for both CMCase and FPase. Maximum CMCase and FPase activities obtained were 20.49 and 2.42 U/gds, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Mycotoxins are unavoidable contaminants of food grains, feeds, medicinal herbs, and spices, posing as health threat to animals and humans. The objective of this study was to screen medicinal herbs and spices for fungi and mycotoxin contamination and evaluate their safety. Sixty-three samples were examined for fungal contamination and fungal load determined using standard microbiological method. Aflatoxin and citrinin were detected using thin layer chromatography and high-performance chromatography technique. Fifty-eight out of the 63 samples were contaminated, while five were free from fungal contamination. Analysis revealed that 47 % of the samples had a fungal load above 1 × 103 cfu/g which is the permissible limit set by World Health Organization. The samples Mesua ferrea-II and Terminalia chebula-III had the highest fungal load, i.e., 5.0 × 104 cfu/g. A total of 187 fungi were isolated, out of which 28 were toxigenic which included 19 aflatoxin-producing Aspergillus flavus and 9 citrinin-producing Penicillium citrinum. The natural contamination with aflatoxin B1 was detected only in one sample, i.e., Arachis hypogaea (groundnut) which was present beyond the permissible limit. Though toxigenic fungi were isolated, mycotoxins were not detected from any of the medicinal herbs and spices. Medicinal herbs and spices are susceptible to toxigenic fungi; however, they also possess intrinsic factors that inhibit mycotoxin contamination. This study provides a basis in assessing the degree of fungal and potential mycotoxin contamination in medicinal herbs and spices.",

All the cultivars revealed higher free radical scavenging activity in the range of 73.80 ± 0.152 to 82.40 ± 0.004 % confirming antioxidant potentials. The HPLC analysis of purified residue procured from solvent partitioning depicted AT with highest concentration of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) i.e., 154.7 ± 4.949 mg/g followed by Kashmir and Uttarakhand GT cultivars. The present study revealed that Assam GT could be a potent herbal candidate with multiple nutraceutical applications.

Nature of production medium influenced the duration of lag- and log-phase of the growth, rate of fungal dry-mass and enzyme production. The volumetric and specific productivity of cellulase under submerged fermentation of grass were 1.7-20-folds higher than sugarcane-bagasse, corncob and commercially available purified substrates. Nonetheless, solid state fermentation (SSF) of crude substrates also yielded high volumetric productivity of EG and BGL. The studies on characterization of enzymes showed that EG was more thermostable than BGL with an optimum activity at 70 °C and a melting temperature of 76 °C. A 1.2-1.5-folds increase in EG activity was observed in the presence of K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+, whereas, the EG and BGL activities remained unaffected in the presence of EDTA. Both the enzyme activities performed optimally under acidic range of pH.",

Therefore, efforts were made to analyse the molecular marker based genetic diversity of 20 Annona genotypes from five different species of family Annonaceae. During analysis, a set of 11 RAPD primers yielded a total of 152 bands with 80.01 % polymorphism and PIC for RAPD ranged from 0.86 to 0.92 with a mean of 0.89. With 93.05 % polymorphism, 12 SSR primers produced 39 amplicons. The PIC for SSRs ranged from 0.169 to 0.694 with of average of 0.339. The dendrogram produced from pooled molecular data of 11 RAPD and 12 SSR primers showed seven clusters at a cutoff value of 0.78. The dendrogram discriminated all the Annona genotypes suggesting that significant genetic diversity was present among the genotypes. Proximate fruit composition study of nine fruiting genotypes of Annona revealed that A. squamosa possessed significantly higher amount of most of studies biochemical which gives an opportunity to fruit breeders to improve the other Annona species. Likewise, A. muricata being rich in seed oil content can be exploited in oil industries.",

Fermentations were carried out in a stirred-tank bioreactor with useful volume of 3L. Stirring rate (40, 50, and 60 rpm) and aeration (1, 2 and 3 vvm) were the variables studied for bioherbicide production. Fermented broth was fractioned with different solvents to identify the molecules produced by the fungus in a multi-dimensional gas chromatograph system. Bioherbicide showed 100% inhibition of germination of both species in the pre-emergence tests. From detached leaves tests were verified yellowish lesions in Cucumis sativus and necrotic lesions on leaves of Sorghum bicolor. Post-emergence test presented variation of the phytotoxicity from 25 to 66% for the species C. sativus and from 32 to 58% by S. bicolor. The metabolites produced by submerged fermentation of Phoma sp. presented activity in pre-emergence, post-emergence, and detached leaves of C. sativus and S. bicolor and it could be an alternative in the future for weed control.",

SUK isolated from salt-stressed soil exhibited ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate) deaminase activity with IAA (indole acetic acid), siderophore, ammonia, hydrogen cyanide production, 2% salt tolerance and fungal cell wall degrading enzyme production (cellulase, protease). The isolate also showed a poultry feather degrading activity which is the main waste material of poultry industry and opulent source of proteins, amino acids, nitrogen, phosphorous, calcium, potassium, manganese, zinc and copper. Application of feather-degraded lysate with the degrading isolate, C. gleum sp. SUK denotes triple role of bioformulation to surmount salinity stress, management of poultry waste disposal and utilization of feathers degraded products as a biostimulant for better growth of plants as well as strain SUK having multifarious plant growth promoting traits. Wheat crops exposed to salt stressor were inoculated with studied bioformulation. Results of plant analysis showed improvement in root and shoot length, fresh and dry weight, chlorophyll, proteins, amino acids, phenolics, flavonoids content and decreased level of proline. In addition, Na + uptake was decreased and K + uptake was increased. Therefore, application of novel bioformulation could increase the yield of crops by ameliorating growth of plants and alleviating the salinity stress.",

Commercial production of lignocellulosic bioethanol mainly depends on cost of cellulase production, efficient pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis process. In the present study cellulase production from Aspergillus niger under submerged fermentation (SmF) was optimized using coconut water as natural medium. Maximum cellulase production (0.53 IU/mL) was achieved within 3 days of incubation using 8 % (w/v) waste paper and 0.07 % (w/v) glucose. The produced cellulase was applied for enzymatic hydrolysis of thermo chemically (dilute acid and alkaline) pretreated biomass (equal mixture of wheat straw and cotton stalk). Optimization of dilute acid and dilute alkaline pretreatment showed dilute alkaline pretreatment was more effective for higher reducing sugar production. Maximum reducing sugar yield of 398.0 mg/g dry biomass was obtained from dilute alkaline pretreated biomass (using 0.5 M sodium hydroxide, 8 % substrate concentration, 120 °C temperature and 20 min of incubation time). The presence of difference sugars (glucose, xylose, mannose, maltose) in the saccharified sample was confirmed by thin layer chromatographic analysis. The effectiveness of dilute alkaline pretreatment was further confirmed by biochemical composition (cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin) and structural (furrier transformed infrared spectroscopic and scanning electron microscopic) analysis. The above result can be useful for commercial production of lignocellulosic bioethanol.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is instigated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of March 13, 2021, more than 118.9 million cases were infected with COVID-19 worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA beta-CoV. Most COVID-19 infected individuals recover within 1–3 weeks. Nevertheless, approximately 5% of patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome and other systemic complications, leading to death. Structural genetic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 have shown genomic resemblances but a low evolutionary correlation to SARS-CoV-1 responsible for the 2002–2004 outbreak. The S glycoprotein is critical for cell adhesion and the entrance of the virus into the host. The process of cell entry uses the cellular receptor named angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Recent evidence proposed that the CD147 as a SARS-CoV-2′s potential receptor. The viral genome is mainly held by two non-structural proteins (NSPs), ORF1a and ORF1ab, along with structural proteins. Although NSPs are conserved among the βCoVs, mutations in NSP2 and NSP3 may play critical roles in transmitting the virus and cell tropism. To date, no specific/targeted anti-viral treatments exist. Notably, more than 50 COVID-19 candidate vaccines in clinical trials, and a few being administered. Preventive precautions are the primary strategy to limit the viral load transmission and spread, emphasizing the urgent need for developing significant drug targets and vaccines against COVID-19. This review provides a cumulative overview of the genomic structure, transmission, phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 from Indian clusters, treatment options, updated discoveries, and future standpoints for COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Wearable sensors have drawn considerable interest in the recent research world. However, simultaneously realizing high sensitivity and wide detection limits under changing surrounding environment conditions remains challenging. In the present study, we report a wearable piezoresistive pressure sensor capsule that can detect pulse rate and human motion. The capsule includes a flexible silicon cover and is filled with different PVA/MXene (PVA-Mx) composites by varying the weight percentage of MXene in the polymer matrix. Different characterizations such as XRD, FTIR and TEM results confirm that the PVA-Mx silicon capsule was successfully fabricated. The PVA-Mx gel-based sensor capsule remarkably endows a low detection limit of 2 kPa, exhibited high sensitivity of 0.45 kPa-1 in the ranges of 2-10 kPa, and displayed a response time of ~ 500 ms, as well as good mechanical stability and non-attenuating durability over 500 cycles. The piezoresistive sensor capsule sensor apprehended great stability towards changes in humidity and temperature. These findings substantiate that the PVA/MXene sensor capsule is potentially suitable for wearable electronics and smart clothing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is known for wide applications, biocompatibility, and degradability; however, it cannot be commercialized due to conventional recovery using solvents. The present study employed mechanical cell-disruption methods, such as Pestle and mortar, sonication, and glass bead vortexing, for solvent-free extraction of PHA from Bacillus sp. Different time intervals were set for grinding (5, 10, 15 min), sonicating (1, 3 and 5 min), and vortexing (2, 5 and 8 g glass beads with 5, 10 and 15 min each) hence studying their effect on cell lysis to release PHA. Tris buffer containing phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM PMSF) was employed as a lysis buffer to study its action over Bacillus cells. Its presence was checked with the above methods in cell lysis. Sonicating cells for 5 min in the presence of lysis buffer achieved a maximum PHA yield of 45%. Cell lysis using lysis buffer yielded 35% PHA when vortexing with 5 g glass beads for 15 min. Grinding cells for 15 min showed a maximum yield of 34% but lacked a lysis buffer. The overall results indicated that the action of lysis buffer and physical extraction methods improved PHA yield by %. Therefore, the study sought to evaluate the feasibility of applying laboratory methods for cell disruption. These methods can showcase possible opportunities in large-scale applications. The polymer yield results were compared with standard sodium hypochlorite extraction. Confirmation of obtained polymers as polyhydroxy butyrate (PHB) was made through FTIR and 1 HNMR characterization.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Glioblastoma (GBM) (grade IV glioma) is the most fatal brain tumor, with a median survival of just 14 months despite current treatments. Temozolomide (TMZ), an alkylating agent used with radiation, faces challenges such as systemic toxicity, poor absorption, and drug resistance. To enhance TMZ effectiveness, we developed poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) liposomes co-loaded with TMZ and O6-benzylguanine (O6-BG) for targeted glioma therapy. These liposomes, prepared using the thin-layer hydration method, had an average size of 146.33 ± 6.75 nm and a negative zeta potential (−49.6 ± 3.1 mV). Drug release was slower at physiological pH, with 66.84 ± 4.62% of TMZ and 69.70 ± 2.88% of O6-BG released, indicating stability at physiological conditions. The liposomes showed significantly higher cellular uptake (p &lt; 0.05) than the free dye. The dual drug-loaded liposomes exhibited superior cytotoxicity against U87 glioma cells, with a lower IC 50 value (3.99µg/mL) than the free drug combination, demonstrating enhanced anticancer efficacy. The liposome formulation induced higher apoptosis (19.42 ± 3.5%) by causing sub-G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. The novelty of our study lies in co-encapsulating TMZ and O6-BG within PEGylated liposomes, effectively overcoming drug resistance and improving targeted delivery for glioma treatment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study is aimed at evaluating the neurotoxic effects of chronic exposure of sodium fluoride (NaF) in developmental stages in rat using prenatal models. NaF (100 ppm, orally) dosing via drinking water was given to pregnant rats in disease group. In the treatment groups, Metformin &amp; Dehydrozingerone (DHZ) (200 mg/kg) were administered orally along with NaF, and the dosing was continued throughout the gestation and lactation periods to the pups until the end of experiment. Behavioural studies like Novel Object Recognition Test (NORT), Open Field &amp; Actophotometer test and biochemical estimations like Acetylcholinesterase (AchE), Glutathione (GSH), Malondialdehyde (MDA) were conducted on animals followed by histopathological image analysis. It was observed that NaF exposure significantly decreased learning, memory and locomotor ability (at p &lt; 0.05, p ≤ 0.01) in rat pups and was also able to induce anxiety like behavior. Levels of AchE (p ≤ 0.001) and MDA (p ≤ 0.01, p ≤ 0.001) was found to be significantly elevated and GSH levels were significantly decreased (p ≤ 0.01, p ≤ 0.001) in hippocampus and frontal cortex in the disease group. Histopathological image analysis showed presence of degenerated neurons in hippocampus of disease group. From this study, it was observed that treatment with Metformin and DHZ, was able to significantly ameliorate the cognitive impairments, improve the condition of oxidative stress and decrease neuronal degeneration in NaF fed rat pups. These results established the protective role of Metformin and DHZ in NaF induced neurodevelopmental toxicity with particular emphasis on their antioxidant properties.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study investigated the potential of tender coconut water as a natural alternative to potassium chloride (KCl) to crosslink κ-carrageenan hydrogels. κ-Carrageenan hydrogels crosslinked with tender coconut water, KCl, and their combination were formulated with diclofenac sodium as model drug, and their morphology, chemical bonding, compressive strength, water uptake capacity, degradation resistance, and cytotoxicity were assessed. The results showed that crosslinking κ-carrageenan hydrogels with both tender coconut water and KCl increased their compressive strength by up to 450%, provided excellent water retention capacity, and resulted in only 5% degradation after 20 days. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that crosslinking the hydrogel with both tender coconut water and KCl compacted its morphological structure, which remained biocompatible when tested with 3T3 cells. Infrared analysis confirmed that incorporated diclofenac sodium remained inert during preparation of the hydrogel matrices. Furthermore, the in vitro release behavior and antimicrobial properties of the hydrogels were assessed. The drug release profile from hydrogels crosslinked with both tender coconut water and KCl was sustained over 24 h. Such hydrogels also showed a unique antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) and Escherichia coli ( E. coli )—with the activity against E. coli being more pronounced. In conclusion, these results confirm that crosslinking with tender coconut water and KCl is a superior alternative to just with KCl for κ-carrageenan hydrogels.",

    "abstract": "AUNIP (Aurora kinase A[Aurora-A] and ninein-interacting protein), is a key factor regulating the end-state of DNA cleavage. It has been reported that AUNIP affects the progression of some tumors; however, the molecular functions involved in AUNIP remain unknown. We employed some databases, such as TCGA, GTEx, TIMER, GEPIA2, cBioportal, and GSCALite, to study AUNIP gene expression, prognosis, gene variation, and drug sensitivity. The relationship between AUNIP and clinicopathological information was explored using Wilcoxon test. The association between AUNIP and TMB, MSI, immunocyte infiltration, and immune checkpoints were analyzed using Spearman correlation analysis. We employed GSEA to research the functional mechanisms involved in AUNIP for pan-cancer. Moreover, we conducted immunohistochemistry (IHC) to investigate AUNIP difference expression between liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) and normal tissues. The Chisq test was used to study the correlation of AUNIP with clinical characteristics. AUNIP was highly expressed in majority of tumors and IHC analysis demonstrated that AUNIP expression was higher in LIHC than normal tissues. AUNIP overexpression had adverse outcomes in adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), brain lower grade glioma (LGG), LIHC, mesothelioma (MESO), and sarcoma (SARC). Furthermore, high AUNIP expression led to unfavorable prognosis in LIHC. AUNIP was associated with T stage, N stage, and clinicopathological analysis in several cancers and AUNIP expression had a correlation with histologic grade in LIHC by IHC. Mutation analysis showed that AUNIP was the highest frequency of genetic changes in cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL). AUNIP was negatively associated with 30 small-molecule drugs that inhibit tumor development. AUNIP expression had association with TMB, MSI, immune cell infiltration, and immune checkpoints for various tumors. GSEA results suggested that AUNIP mainly participated in the cell cycle, DNA replication, mismatch repair, and homologous recombination.Pan-cancer study considered AUNIP as a potential prognostic marker and high latent diagnostic biomarker.",

Following non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT), 55 participants with stage III or IV periodontitis were administered either S. salivarius M18 lozenges (test group) or a placebo for 12 weeks. Clinical assessments, including pocket probing depth (PPD), clinical attachment loss (CAL), bleeding on probing (BoP), and plaque index (PI), were performed at baseline (before treatment), immediately after treatment, and during post-treatment follow-ups at 12 and 24 weeks. Microbial analysis was conducted on the subgingival plaque samples collected. The test group demonstrated significantly improved PPD, BoP, and PI compared to the placebo group at post-treatment follow-ups, although no significant difference was observed in CAL. Microbiological analysis revealed a reduction in periodontal pathogens or a shift in the subgingival microbiota toward a decreased pathogenic profile in the test group. This trial is the first to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of S. salivarius M18 as an adjunctive treatment for periodontitis, supporting its potential for broader clinical use in managing periodontal health.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study investigated the synergistic cytotoxic effects of benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) and caffeic acid (CA) on human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cells. Cell viability assays (MTT) revealed that BITC induces reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated cell death, while CA alone exhibited minimal cytotoxicity. Notably, their combination selectively enhanced MCF-7 cell death with limited effects on human fibroblasts. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated MAPK pathway activation and apoptosis induction, supported by altered expression of GST, p38, p-ERK, ERK 1/2, Nrf-2, and Bcl-2 proteins. Fluorometric analysis revealed significant disruption of redox homeostasis, including changes in ROS, glutathione (GSH), and caspase-3/7 activity. Molecular docking studies confirmed stable binding interactions (binding energies: –4.9 to –6.8 kcal/mol) of BITC and CA with key cancer-related proteins (ERK2, p38 MAPK, Bcl-2, Keap1-Nrf2, GST). Furthermore, Multiple Ligand Simultaneous Docking (MLSD) demonstrated the cooperative binding of BITC and CA to shared and distinct residues within the same protein targets, revealing enhanced binding affinity and potential synergistic inhibition of oncogenic pathways. These results highlight the synergistic potential of BITC and CA to modulate the MAPK pathway, disrupt cellular homeostasis, and induce apoptosis, underscoring their promise for combination cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Cellulose is a major constituent of renewable lignocellulosic waste available in large quantities and is considered the most important reservoir of carbon for the production of glucose, for alternative fuel and as a chemical feedstock. Over the past decade, the emphasis has been on the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose to glucose and the efficiency of which depends on source of cellulosic substrate, its composition, structure, pretreatment process, and reactor design. In the present study, efforts were made to produce cellulase enzyme using rice straw. The produced enzyme was used for the hydrolysis of selected lignocellulosic substrate, i.e., sorghum straw. When rice straw was used as a substrate for cellulase production under solid state fermentation, the highest enzyme activity obtained was 30.7 FPU/gds, using T. reesei NCIM 992. 25 FPU/g of cellulase was added to differently treated (native, alkali treated, alkali treated followed by 3% acid treated and alkali treated followed by 3 and 5% acid treated) sorghum straw and hydrolysis was carried out at 50 °C for 60 h. 42.5% hydrolysis was obtained after 36 h of incubation. Optimization of enzyme loading, substrate concentration, temperature, time and buffer yielded a maximum of 546.00 ± 0.55 mg/g sugars (54.60 ± 0.44 g/l) with an improved hydrolysis efficiency of 70 ± 0.45%. The enzymatic hydrolyzate can be used for fermentation of ethanol by yeasts.",

In the present study, physiological responses and antioxidant potential under salinity stress were investigated in callus cultures of S. persica to evaluate its use as a source of antioxidant. The callus cultures were grown on MS medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/l each of 2,4,5-T and BAP, which could be established successfully by regular subcultures of slow growing callus on this medium for several months. Increased dry weight, soluble proteins, proline, soluble carbohydrates and CAT activity were recorded under NaCl stress in comparison to control cultures. The DPPH and FRAP antioxidant activities were gradually elevated in NaCl-treated callus, whereas SOD quenching was recorded maximum at 200 mM. A significant correlation between antioxidant capacity and phenol content was observed, indicating that phenolic compounds are the major contributors to the antioxidant potential in S. persica. These findings suggest that increased salinity stress caused elevated antioxidant potentials and the plants grown in such conditions may serve as potential source of antioxidant.",

    "abstract": "Thermostable and alkalitolerant xylanases have got intense research focus due to their vast applications in various industries including pulp and paper, food, feed, textile, biofuel, etc. In the present investigation, a Penicillum sp. SS1 isolated from degrading woody material was found to produce moderately thermoactive and alkalistable endo-β-1,4-xylanase (xylanase). Maximum xylanase production was observed after fourth day of fermentation (43.84 IU/ml). The organism produced substantial quantities of xylanase using agricultural residues like wheat bran (20.6 IU/ml), rice bran (21.8 IU/ml) and sawdust (10.7 IU/ml) as carbon sources. The enzyme preparation was totally free of filter paper activity (FPase) and possessed negligible carboxymethyl cellulase (CMCase) activity; this could be an important feature of enzyme if the intended application of enzyme is in pulp and paper industries. Among nitrogen sources examined, yeast extract supported maximum xylanase production (45.74 IU/ml), and was followed by soybean meal (22.2 IU/ml) and ammonium sulphate (20 IU/ml). Maximum xylanase production was observed at initial medium pH 9 (25.6 IU/ml); however, at pH 8 and 10 also significantly high enzyme titre was observed (24 and 21.2 IU/ml, respectively). Thus, Penicillium sp. SS1 displayed capability of growing and producing xylanase at high alkaline pH (8–10). Maximum xylanase activity was reported at 50 °C, however, significantly high activity was observed at 60 °C (65.4%), however, at 70–80 °C activity was lost considerably. At 50–60 °C the enzyme retained very high activity up to 30–60 min (91–100%), however, prolonged incubation (90 min) caused considerable activity reduction (residual activity 63–68%).",

We produced graphene oxide by pyrolysing the silk cocoon in an inert atmosphere. The collected raw carbon is oxidized by nitric acid that readily produces multilayer graphene oxide with nano carbon particulates. Structural properties of the graphene oxide were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The oxidized sample shows remarkable fluorescence, multi-photon imaging and magnetic properties. On increasing the excitation wavelength, the fluorescence emission intensity of the graphene oxide also increases and found maximum emission at 380 nm excitation wavelength. On studying the two photon absorption (TPA) property of aqueous graphene oxide using Z-scan technique, we found significant TPA activity at near infrared wavelength. In addition, the graphene oxide shows ferromagnetic behavior at room temperature. The observed fluorescence and magnetic property were attributed to the defects caused in the graphene oxide structure by introducing oxygen containing hydrophilic groups during the oxidation process. Previously silk cocoon has been used extensively in deriving silk-based tissue engineering materials and as gas filter. Here we show a novel application of silk cocoon by synthesizing graphene oxide based magnetic-fluorophore for bio-imaging applications.",

A three-level Box–Behnken factorial design with four factors (enzyme concentration, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT) concentration, dye concentration and reaction time) combined with response surface methodology was applied to optimize AO51 decolorization. A mathematical model was developed showing the effect of each factor and their interactions on color removal. The model predicted that Acid Orange 51 decolorization above 87.87 ± 1.27 % could be obtained when enzyme concentration, HBT concentration, dye concentration and reaction time were set at 1 U/mL, 0.75 mM, 60 mg/L and 2 days, respectively. The experimental values were in good agreement with the predicted ones and the models were highly significant, the correlation coefficient (R2) being 0.9. Then the desirability function was employed to determine the optimal decolorization condition for each dye and minimize the process cost simultaneously. In addition, germination index assay showed that laccase-treated dye was detoxified; however in the presence of HBT, the phytotoxicity of the treated dye was increased. By using cheap agro-industrial wastes, such as sawdust, a potential laccase was obtained. The low cost of laccase production may further broaden its application in textile wastewater treatment.",

Mineral salt medium was supplemented with different surfactants, growth factors and trace elements. Effects of incubation period and inoculum volume were also studied. Results indicated that the streptokinase yield was higher in the presence of non-ionic surfactants, where Tween 80 supported maximum enzyme production (0.178 U/ml). Growth factors such as glycine and thiamine supplementation resulted in better enzyme production. Trace elements in the form of magnesium sulphate and ferrous sulphate when added in lesser quantity aided higher streptokinase synthesis. Enzyme production was severely affected in the presence of higher concentrations of these inorganic salts. A constant decrease in the enzyme production was observed beyond 48 h of incubation. Among the different inoculum sizes used, 1 % v/v inoculum facilitated highest streptokinase production (0.360 U/ml).

Therefore, net house bioinoculation experiment was performed to determine the effectiveness of inoculation of strain S10724 on the growth enhancement of native green gram (Vigna radiata L. Wilczek). The strain significantly (p < 0.05) stimulated the growth of roots (45.3 %) and shoots (45.6 %) of green gram plants. Furthermore, other growth related parameters viz. fresh and dry weight was also found to be increased significantly. Treated plants typically showed more obvious modifications in their biochemical status also. The total chlorophyll and nitrate reductase activity was increased in S10724 inoculated plant as compared to the control one. Moreover, in vitro seed germination assay revealed that the germination was increased in S10724 strain treated seeds by 22 % at 25 °C while 25 % at 12 °C unlikely to respective controls. The results suggest that P.migulae S10724 strain is a potential plant growth promoting bacterium for legume under fluctuating temperature ranges and therefore, could be used effectively as a low cost bioinoculant in Himalayan agricultural belt successfully.",

Most of the current methods involve known protocols which employ toxic chemicals and hazardous byproducts. This greatly limits their use in biomedical fields, particularly in clinical applications. Recent research has been focused on green synthesis methods to produce different nanoparticles with suitable commercial viability. The biosynthesis of monodispersed GNPs using the spent cultures of Klebsiella pneumoniae as reducing and stabilizing agent has been reported. The gold salt concentration to improve monodispersity and stability of GNPs has been optimized. Synthesized GNPs were characterized by UV-Visible spectroscopy showed absorption spectra in the range of 530-560 nm at different concentrations of HAuCl4. At the optimum reaction concentration of 1.5 mM HAuCl4, absorption peak was obtained at 535 nm. The GNPs have been further characterized by X-ray diffraction, FTIR, DLS and TEM analysis. The DLS graph showed that the particles were more monodispersed. The TEM image showed the formation of spherical shaped GNPs in the range of 4-10 nm. The effect of gold salt concentration on dispersity, size and stability of the biosynthesized GNPs has been reported.",

Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria are originally defined as root-colonizing bacteria, i.e., Bacillus that cause either plant growth promotion or biological control of plant diseases. The study aims at the isolation of novel Bacillus species and to assess the biotechnological potential of the novel species as a biofertilizer, with respect to their plant growth promoting properties as efficient phosphate-solubilizing bacteria. Seven different strains of Bacillus were isolated from cotton rhizosphere soil near boys' hostel of Palamuru University which belongs to Deccan plateau. Among seven isolated strains, Bacillus strain-7 has shown maximum support for good growth of eight cotton cultivars. This bacterial species is named Bacillus sp. PU-7 based on the phenotypic and phylogenetic analysis. Among eight cotton cultivars, Mahyco has shown high levels of IAA, proteins, chlorophyll, sugars and low level of proline. Efficacy of novel Bacillus sp. PU-7 with Mahyco cultivar has been checked experimentally at field level in four different cotton grown agricultural soils. The strains supported plant growth in almost all the cases, especially in the deep black soil, with a clear evidence of maximum plant growth by increased levels of phytohormone production and biochemical analysis, followed by shallow black soil. Hence, it is inferred that the novel isolate can be used as bioinoculant in the cotton fields.",

Crude cellulase of Aspergillus niger, produced on the pretreated sawdust with highest cellulose content, was further tested for the release of soluble and reducing sugars during the saccharification process of same pretreated saw dust. The saccharification process of the pretreated sawdust with enzyme was optimized for pH, temperature, and substrate concentration and proceeded optimally at pH of 5.0, 50 °C and 0.5 % pretreated sawdust. The rate of saccharification with crude enzyme of A. niger on alkali-treated sawdust was found to be maximum (23 %) as against 5.4 % on native sawdust under optimal conditions after 48 h. The present study indicates NaOH-treated sawdust as a potential raw material for both production of cellulase and saccharification in a large scale.",

Their cultivation in these habitats is strongly influenced by various biotic and abiotic stresses and therefore, there must be a selection of RKB associated microorganisms that are adapted to these harsh conditions. Seven cold adaptive diazotrophs from the same rhizosphere were isolated in our previous study to reveal the low-temperature associated proteins and mechanisms. However, the diversity and phylogenetic affiliations of these rhizosphere diazotrophs are still unknown. In this study, RKB rhizospheric soil from two different agro-ecosystems of WIH namely S1 (Chhiplakot, 30.70°N/80.30°E) and S2 (Munsyari, 30.60°N/80.20°E) were explored for the assessment of nitrogenase reductase gene (nifH) diversity by plating respective clone libraries SN1 and SN2. The RKB rhizosphere diazotroph assemblage was very diverse and apparently consists mainly of the genera Rhizobium, followed by unknown diazotrophic microorganisms. Deduced amino acid sequence analysis revealed the presence of diverse nifH sequences, affiliated with a wide range of taxa, encompassing members of the Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. Members of cyanobacteria, methanotrophs and archaea were also detected. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first major metagenomic effort that revealed the presence of diverse nitrogen-fixing microbial assemblages in indigenous RKB rhizospheric soil which can further be explored for improved crop yield/productivity.",

Storage at low temperature (0–5 °C) is a common strategy used to slow the ripening processes and to extend shelf life. However, if susceptible varieties are held too long at a low temperature, they will not ripen properly and will develop chilling injury (CI) symptoms like mealiness (M), flesh browning (FB), and flesh bleeding (FBL). Understanding the genetic control of these traits to produce CI resistant cultivars will greatly benefit producers, shippers and consumers. In this study, we evaluated a population of 51 individuals from Pop-DG across 4 years with CI traits observed in one or two time points to detect molecular marker association with selected 960 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 1,536 SNPs chip. Genotypic and phenotypic data were analyzed by general linear model and mixed linear model to see comparative results from both analyses. Among 960 SNPs used, 22 SNPs were found associated with CI susceptibility traits like M, FB, and FBL. Many SNP markers were located in or close to previously reported quantitative trait loci mapped by linkage analysis.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic seed technology is an exciting and rapidly growing area of research as deals with conservation and storage of rare, endangered and desirable genotypes along with its easy handling and transportation. As propagation of many ornamental and medicinally important plant species is labour intensive, application of different growth retardants and osmotica in simple artificial seed system would dramatically reduce labour requirement by storing the germplasm in vitro. Moreover, the primary aim of developing in vitro storage methods is to reduce the frequent demands of subculturing and preserving the unique genetic constituent of the germplasm. Dendrobium nobile is a pharmaceutically important orchid mostly used in the Chinese herbal drug industry for its medicinal property. Commercial exploitation of this species has considerably depleted their population in wild. Hence, for conserving this valuable germplasm, short term in vitro storage of Protocorm-Like Bodies (PLBs) of D. nobile was carried out using different osmotica (sucrose and mannitol). It was observed that incorporation of low sucrose and mannitol (3 and 5 %) in the encapsulating matrix showed almost similar results with that of control. In all these cases, more than half of PLBs burst out from the matrix thus making these concentrations of sucrose and mannitol along with control not suitable for storage studies. However, with the increase in concentration to 7.5 and 12.5 % in the encapsulating matrix, no outburst of encapsulated PLBs was recorded till 60 days of storage; hence it can be concluded that these concentrations play an important role in minimizing the growth of PLBs during storage condition.",

A significant increase in levels of ALP (809.65 ± 145.97 IU/L) was observed in stage IV of the disease. The logistic regression study gave a significant result (P < 0.001) when we compared the group of ALP level (>500 IU/L) with metastatic presentation.

An arabinogalactan (A), one partly methyl esterified galacturonic acid (B) and a neutral glucan (C) were isolated. The glucan is made up of β-(1 → 3)-linked glucopyranosyl residues and has a molecular mass of 7 kDa. The arabinogalactan is highly branched and has an average molecular mass of 40 kDa. The in vitro antioxidant capacity of the fractions was studied by ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assays. The arabinogalactan (A) showed the highest potential followed by the uronic acid (B) and glucan (C). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that these polysaccharides could be used as natural antioxidants by the food industry.",

The organism had a free cyanide degradation efficiency of 80 and 32 % from an initial concentration of 250 and 450 mg CN−/L, respectively. Additionally, the organism was able to degrade thiocyanate, achieving a degradation efficiency of 78 and 98 % from non- and free cyanide spiked cultures, respectively. The organism was capable of heterotrophic nitrification but was unable to denitrify aerobically. The organism was unable to degrade free cyanide in the absence of a carbon source, but it was able to degrade thiocyanate heterotrophically, achieving a degradation efficiency of 79 % from an initial concentration of 250 mg SCN−/L. Further increases in thiocyanate degradation efficiency were only observed when the cultures were spiked with free cyanide (50 mg CN−/L), achieving a degradation efficiency of 98 % from an initial concentration of 250 mg SCN−/L. This is the first study to report free cyanide and thiocyanate degradation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The higher free cyanide and thiocyanate tolerance of the isolate STK 03, which surpasses the stipulated tolerance threshold of 200 mg CN−/L for most organisms, could be valuable in microbial consortia for the degradation of cyanides in an industrial setting.",

Ultrafiltered enzymes caused 12.5% reduction in kappa number at reduced enzyme dose of xylanase-pectinase (4.0-0.8 IU) per gram of pulp under optimized conditions at pH 8.5, temperature 55 °C, and treatment period of 2 h. Using this methodology, amount of Cl2-ClO2 consumption can be reduced up to 30 and 28.86%. Significant improvement in physical and optical properties of pulp was obtained along with an additional reduction in BOD and COD values up to 18.13 and 21.66% using this novel biodelignification approach. This is the first report showing the advantages of using ultrafiltered xylanase-pectinase over crude enzymes in enhancing the bleaching capacity of pulp. This study focussing on the development of good quality paper with less pollution generating strategy will definitely prove a boon for industries.",

    "abstract": "Tinospora cordifolia is a prioritized medicinal plant and having an immense medicinal importance especially in Indian medicinal system. But this plant needs a regeneration protocol for its rapid propagation. An efficient regeneration protocol was developed for T. cordifolia using nodal explants. High frequency of multiple shoot formation was induced when the nodal segments were cultured on MS medium supplemented with BAP (1.0 mg L-1) and 2-iP (0.5 mg L-1). The highest mean number of shoots per nodal explant (7.9 ± 0.45) with highest shoot length (9.3 ± 0.48 cm) and 86% response were achieved on this media and hormonal concentration. The optimum rooting was obtained on ½ strength of MS medium augmented with IBA (0.5 mg L-1) with 8.3 ± 0.46 cm root length and 89% response. Micropropagated plantlets were found to be identical with the mother plant when clonal fidelity of these plantlets were analyzed with inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) marker. The berberine content was analyzed through LCMS QToF and the highest amount was found in in vitro callus (19.8 µg/gm) followed by stem (9.3 µg/gm) and leaves of field-grown plants (8.4 µg/gm). Further, presence of berberine was confirmed by ESI-MS spectra with protonated molecular ions ([M + H]+) at m/z 336. Furthermore, MS-MS fragmentation pattern confirmed for the presence of berberine in both the samples. Both the spectra (standard and samples) showed common peaks for berberine in the form of protonated molecular ions ([M + H]+) at m/z 320, m/z 304, m/z 292, m/z 278 in MS/MS mode. The study revealed that developed protocol is potent for rapid mass propagation of this plant species with high accumulation of important secondary metabolite berberine.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The last two decades had witnessed extensive investigation on bacterial degradation of carbazole, an N -heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. Specifically, previous studies have reported the primary importance of angular dioxygenation, a novel type of oxygenation reaction, which facilitates mineralization of carbazole to intermediates of the TCA cycle. Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria are the predominant bacterial phyla implicated in this novel mode of dioxygenation, while anthranilic acid and catechol are the signature metabolites. Several studies have elucidated the degradative genes involved, the diversity of the car gene clusters and the unique organization of the car gene clusters in marine carbazole degraders. However, there is paucity of information regarding the environmental fate as well as industrial and medical importance of carbazole and its derivatives. In this review, attempt is made to harness this information to present a comprehensive outlook that not only focuses on carbazole biodegradation pathways, but also on its environmental fate as well as medical and industrial importance of carbazole and its derivatives.",

The RSM was used to optimize xylanase production by implementing the Central composite design. Statistical analysis of the results showed that the linear, interaction and quadric terms of these variables had significant effects. However, only the linear effect of X4, X5, interaction effect of X1X7, X1X8, X2X3, X2X8, X3X6, X3X8, X4X6, X4X7, X5X7, X5X8 and quadratic effect of X 32 , X 52 and X 72 found to be insignificant terms in the quadratic model and had no response at significant level. The minimum and maximum xylanase production obtained was 331.50 U/g DBP and 1027.65 U/g DBP, respectively. The highest xylanase activity was obtained from Run No. 30, which consisted of yeast extract (X1), 1.00 g (%); NH4NO3 (X2), 0.20 g (%); peptone (X3), 1.00 g (%); urea (X4), 10 mg (%); CMC (X5), 1.00 g (%); Tween 20 (X6), 0.02 mL (%); CaCO3 (X7), 0.50 g (%) and MgSO4 (X8), 9.0 g (%). The optimization resulted in 3.1-fold increase of xylanase production, compared with the lowest xylanase production of 331.50 U/g DBP after 72 h of incubation in stationary flask experiment. Application of cellulase-free xylanase in pulp biobleaching from C. cellulans CKMX1 under C-EP-D sequence has been shown to bring about a 12.5 % reduction of chlorine, decrease of 0.8 kappa points (40 %), and gain in brightness was 1.42 % ISO points in 0.5 % enzyme treated pulp as compared to control.",

Compared with other natural sources such as plants, fungi are highly diverse but understudied. However, research on Cladosporium cladosporioides revealed the existence of bioactive products such as p-methylbenzoic acid, ergosterol peroxide (EP) and calphostin C as well as enzymes including pectin methylesterase (PME), polygalacturonase (PG) and chlorpyrifos hydrolase. p-Methylbenzoic acid has ability to synthesise 1,5-benzodiazepine and its derivatives, polyethylene terephthalate and eicosapentaenoic acid. EP has anticancer, antiangiogenic, antibacterial, anti-oxidative and immunosuppressive properties. Calphostin C inhibits protein kinase C (PKC) by inactivating both PKC-epsilon and PKC-alpha. In addition, calphostin C stimulates apoptosis in WEHI-231 cells and vascular smooth muscle cells. Based on the stimulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress in some types of cancer, calphostin C has also been evaluated as a potential photodynamic therapeutic agent. Methylesterase (PME) and PG have garnered attention because of their usage in the food processing industry and significant physiological function in plants. Chlorpyrifos, a human, animal and plant toxin, can be degraded and eliminated by chlorpyrifos hydrolase.",

However, transferability of SSR markers varies greatly between species, genera and families of plant species. We assessed confamiliar transferability of SSR markers from cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) and jute (Corchorus olitorius) to 22 species distributed in different taxonomic groups of Malvaceae. All the species selected were potential industrial crop species having little or no genomic resources or SSR database. Of the 14 cotton SSR loci tested, 13 (92.86 %) amplified in G. arboreum and 71.43 % exhibited cross-genera transferability. Nine out of 11 jute SSRs (81.81 %) showed cross-transferability across genera. SSRs from both the species exhibited high polymorphism and resolving power in other species. The correlation between transferability of cotton and jute SSRs were highly significant (r = 0.813). The difference in transferability among species was also significant for both the marker groups. High transferability was observed at genus, tribe and subfamily level. At tribe level, transferability of jute SSRs (41.04 %) was higher than that of cotton SSRs (33.74 %). The tribe Byttnerieae exhibited highest SSR transferability (48.7 %). The high level of cross-genera transferability (>50 %) in ten species of Malvaceae, where no SSR resource is available, calls for large scale transferability testing from the enriched SSR databases of cotton and jute.",

The study revealed the association of 10 different Fusarium species known trichothecene producers such as Fusarium acuminatum, F. avenaceum, F. crookwellense, F. culmorum, F. equiseti, F. graminearum, F. nivale, F. poae, F. sambucinum and F. sporotrichioides along with non-trichothecene producers like F. anthophilum, F. oxysporaum, F. proliferatum, F. semitectum, F. solani, and F. verticillioides. All the ten isolated potential trichothecene producing Fusarium species were analyzed for their ability to produce trichothecenes by using thin layer chromatography method. The highest infection of Fusarium spp. in maize was by F. verticillioides with PI of (2.95 %), with RD of (15.16 %) and highest Fr was by F. graminearum (79.24 %) and the lowest was F. avenasium with PI of (0.13 %). For sorghum maximum PI was by F. verticillioides (3.02 %), with F. graminearum having highest RD (14.39 %) and with F. verticillioides highest Fr. (72.22 %). In paddy highest PI was by F. verticillioides (3.21 %) and the least was by F. avenaceum (0.09 %). Similarly in wheat the highest PI was by F. verticillioides (2.76 %) while lowest was by F. avenaceum (0.10 %). The highest Fr was with F. graminearum (79.62 %) while the lowest was by F. avenaceum (3.70 %) and the highest RD was by F. graminearum (22.04 %) and lowest was by F. solani (0.72 %). The manually identified Fusarium spp. were further confirmed by PCR-based detection using ITS1 and ITS4 primers followed by sequencing of the PCR amplicons. PCR studies confirmed that all the tested fungal isolates belongs to Fusarium spp. with the amplicon size of 600 bp. Sequencing and the blast data from NCBI data base confirmed the sequence similarity of 99 % to the genus Fusarium and accession numbers were obtained. Chemotyping studies showed that the isolated Fusarium species are known to produce different types of trichothecenes. The study revealed the diversity in phytopathogenic Fusarium spp. in major cereal crops growing in different agro-climatic regions of Karnataka, India.",

This study was aimed to investigate the feasibility of using SSF and optimize the conditions of production of phytase by Aspergillus ficuum from potato waste. Different parameters including pH of the potato waste, inoculum level, moisture content, incubation period, temperature, and supplementary nitrogen and carbon sources were evaluated. The results indicated that pH, inoculum level, and moisture content did not significantly vary phytase production. However, different incubation periods, incubation temperatures, nitrogen sources, and carbon sources changed the phytase production significantly. The ideal and economic conditions for phytase production consisted of a normal moisture content (79%) of potato waste, 1.0 ml inoculum size, and normal pH 6.1 at room temperature for 144 h incubation time. The highest phytase activity (5.17 ± 0.82 U/g ds) was obtained under the aforementioned optimized conditions. When (NH4)2SO4 was used as a nitrogen source in the substrate, the phytase activity increased to 12.93 ± 0.47 U/g ds, which was a 2.5-fold increase compared to the control treatment. This study proposed a novel and economical way to convert food processing waste to highly valuable products and investigated the optimal conditions of the production of phytase during SSF in potato waste.",

Predicting optimal conditions, including enzyme and substrate concentration, temperature and pH can improve conversion efficiency. In this study, the production of sugar monomers from apple pomace using commercial enzyme preparations, Celluclast 1.5L, Viscozyme L and Novozyme 188 was investigated. A limited number of experiments were carried out and then analysed using an artificial neural network (ANN) to model the enzymatic hydrolysis process. The ANN was used to simulate the enzymatic hydrolysis process for a range of input variables and the optimal conditions were successfully selected as was indicated by the R 2 value of 0.99 and a small MSE value. The inputs for the ANN were substrate loading, enzyme loading, temperature, initial pH and a combination of these parameters, while release profiles of glucose and reducing sugars were the outputs. Enzyme loadings of 0.5 and 0.2 mg/g substrate and a substrate loading of 30% were optimal for glucose and reducing sugar release from apple pomace, respectively, resulting in concentrations of 6.5 g/L glucose and 28.9 g/L reducing sugars. Apple pomace hydrolysis can be successfully carried out based on the predicted optimal conditions from the ANN.",

With the standardized condition, the maximum conversion efficiency was 95.68 %. The immobilized beads, even after ten cycles of repeated usage showed high stability in the presence of methyl acetate and no loss of lipase activity. The microalgal biodiesel composition was analyzed using gas chromatography. The current study was efficient in using immobilized lipase for the interesterification process, since the method was cost-effective and eco-friendly, no solvent was involved and the enzyme was encapsulated in a natural polymer.",

Among various variables screened along with wheat bran and deproteinized acid cheese whey as major growth substrate, corn steep liquor and MgSO4 were found to be most significant. The optimum concentrations of these significant parameters were determined employing the response surface central composite design, revealing corn steep liquor concentration (2 mL) and magnesium sulphate (50 mg) per 5 g of wheat bran and 20 mL of deproteinized acid cheese whey for highest enzyme production (15,936 U/gds).

This study investigated the effect of hyphal morphology on cellulase production in the hyper-cellulolytic mutant, T. reesei DES-15. With a distinct morphology, T. reesei DES-15 was obtained through Diethyl sulfite (DES) mutagenesis. The hyphal morphology of DES-15 batch-cultured in a 5-L fermentor was significantly shorter and more branched than the parental strain RUT C30. The cellulase production of DES-15 during batch fermentation was 66 % greater than that of RUT C30 when cultured the same conditions. DES-15 secreted nearly 50 % more protein than RUT C30. The gene expression level of a set of genes (cla4, spa2, ras2, ras1, rhoA, cdc42, and racA) known to be involved in hyphae growth and hyphal branching was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. The transcriptional analysis of these genes demonstrated that a decrease in gene expressions might contribute to the increased hyphal branching seen in DES-15. These results indicated that the highly branching hyphae in DES-15 resulted in increased cellulase production, suggesting that DES-15 may be a good candidate for use in the large-scale production of cellulase.",

The present investigation was aimed to evaluate the toxicity, anti-diabetic activity along with in vitro antioxidant activity of the leaf of B. balcooa in alloxan-induced diabetic rats and also identify active compounds by using HPLC. The acute toxicity test of aqueous extract of B. balcooa leaf revealed that the median lethal dose (LD 50 ) of B. balcooa aqueous extract (BAQE) was 5.18 g/kg body weight in mice. Administration of BAQE at 100 and 200 mg/kg in alloxan-induced diabetic rats showed significant reduction in fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin while plasma insulin level was elevated compared to diabetic control. Both the doses were effective when compared to diabetic glibenclamide rats. The BAQE treated diabetic rats showed significant increase in the endogenous antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and decrease in malondialdehyde levels. HPLC analysis of BAQE showed the presence of rutin, gallic acid and β sitosterol. Thus, it can be inferred from this study that BAQE possess antidiabetic and in vivo antioxidant activity. The overall activity might be possibly due to the presence of potential antioxidants.",

    "abstract": "Stenotrophomonas maltophilia OG2 was isolated from the intestine of cockroaches that was collected from a cow barn contaminated some pesticides belong to pyrethroid and organochlorine groups. OG2 was able to degrade α-endosulfan in non sulfur medium (NSM) as a sole sulfur source for growth within 10 days of incubation. The effects of some growth parameters on endosulfan biodegradation by OG2 was studied and found that the biodegradation was significantly affected by the endosulfan concentrations, pH and temperature. Experimental results obtained in different conditions show that the optimum concentration of α-endosulfan, pH and temperature were 100 mg/L, 8.0 and 30 °C, respectively. Under these conditions, the bacterium degraded 81.53% of the α-endosulfan after 10 days. The concentration of α-endosulfan and its metabolites was determined by HPLC. Endosulfan ether, endosulfan lactone and endosulfan diol were the main metabolites in culture, but did not produce toxic metabolite, endosulfan sulfate. These results suggested that S. maltophilia OG2 degrades α-endosulfan via a hydrolysis pathway. The present study indicates that strain OG2 may have potential use in the biodegradation of pesticides contaminated environments.",

    "abstract": "The present outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, epicentered in China in December 2019, has spread to many other countries. The entire humanity has a vital responsibility to tackle this pandemic and the technologies are being helpful to them to a greater extent. The purpose of the work is to precisely bring scientific and general awareness to the people all around the world who are currently fighting the war against COVID-19. It's visible that the number of people infected is increasing day by day and the medical community is tirelessly working to maintain the situation under control. Other than the negative effects caused by COVID-19, it is also equally important for the public to understand some of the positive impacts it has directly or indirectly given to society. This work emphasizes the various impacts that are created on society as well as the environment. As a special additive, some important key areas are highlighted namely, how the modernized technologies are aiding the people during the period of social distancing. Some effective technological implications carried out by both information technology and educational institutions are highlighted. There are also several steps taken by the state government and central government in each country in adopting the complete lockdown rule. These steps are taken primarily to prevent the people from COVID-19 impact. Moreover, the teachings we need to learn from the quarantine situation created to prevent further spread of this global pandemic is discussed in brief and the importance of carrying them to the future. Finally, the paper also elucidates the general preventive measures that have to be taken to prevent this deadly coronavirus, and the role of technology in this pandemic situation has also been discussed.",

Elemental and crystalline natures of the AgNPs were identified from EDX and XRD pattern, respectively. Spherical morphology and the mono-disparity were revealed from TEM and AFM images. The particle size ranged from 5 to 30 nm and average size of 17 nm was consistent in XRD, TEM and AFM measurements. Possible reduction and stabilizing agents, viz., phenolics, flavonoids and proteins were identified from the characteristic FTIR peaks representing their functional groups. The strong antibacterial activity of synthesized AgNPs against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria exhibited the potential for the formulation of synergistic bactericides by combining antibacterial properties of Couroupita flower buds extract and silver salts for biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "Grape marc seeds contain large amounts of different polyphenolic compounds so they can be used for the recovery of these classes of compounds. A new green extraction method for the recovery of phenols from the grape seeds was developed. To provide a high quality extract sourced from natural product by using enzymes as alternative solvents and spending less energy, it is impeccable to call this method \"green\". Furthermore, this method was optimized by finding out which conditions provide the best possible results and achieving the maximum recovery of polyphenols from grape seeds. The optimization of the enzyme-assisted extraction of phenols was conducted using the commercially available oenological enzyme preparations with respect to the enzyme dosage, temperature, extraction time, pH value and enzyme preparation by applying the response surface methodology. Optimal conditions were determined using the enzyme preparation Lallzyme EX-V, at the extraction temperature of 48 °C, extraction time of 2 h and 43 min, pH 3.5 and enzyme dosage of 20.00 mg g−1. The new optimized extraction method is less expensive, simple, fast, precise and selective for the recovery of simple phenols (monomeric and dimeric form) and since it is based on the environmentally friendly extraction solvent it may provide a valuable alternative to the conventional extraction methods. The obtained extracts can be used for the application in pharmaceutical, food and cosmetic industry.",

In this study, Rhamnus frangula was selected as a protease inhibitor source. The maximum recovery of the protease inhibitor against trypsin was recorded in the crude extract made in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and isolated from the mature leaves. Then, the protease inhibitor designated as RfIP1 was purified to homogeneity by Sephadex G50 with an apparent molecular mass of 22.5 kDa and its N-terminal sequence exhibited a high degree of homology with known serine protease inhibitor sequences. The RfIP1 displayed maximal activity at pH 7 and 37 °C. It maintained almost 80% of its maximal activity through a large pH range. The thermo-stability of RfIP1 was markedly enhanced by BSA, CaCl 2, and sorbitol, whereas the addition of Mg 2+ , Zn 2+ , NaTDC, SDS, DTT, and β-ME significantly promoted inhibitory activity. The protease inhibitor displayed high inhibitory activity toward some known proteases (cathepsin B, chymotrypsin, collagenase, thrombin, and trypsin) that have more importance in pharmaceutical industry and it acted as potent inhibitor of some commercially proteases from Aspergillus oryzae , Bacillus sp, and Bacillus licheniformis . The protease inhibitor also possessed an appreciable antibacterial effect against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.",

The microarray data of the dataset E-MTAB-8871 were retrieved from the ArrayExpress database. Pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment study, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, modules, target gene-miRNA regulatory network, and target gene-TF regulatory network have been performed. Subsequently, the key genes were validated using an analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. In SARS-CoV-2 infection, a total of 324 DEGs (76 up- and 248 down-regulated genes) were identified and enriched in a number of associated SARS-CoV-2 infection pathways and GO terms. Hub and target genes such as TP53, HRAS, MAPK11, RELA, IKZF3, IFNAR2, SKI, TNFRSF13C, JAK1, TRAF6, KLRF2, CD1A were identified from PPI network, target gene-miRNA regulatory network, and target gene-TF regulatory network. Study of the ROC showed that ten genes (CCL5, IFNAR2, JAK2, MX1, STAT1, BID, CD55, CD80, HAL-B, and HLA-DMA) were substantially involved in SARS-CoV-2 patients. The present investigation identified key genes and pathways that deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and could be used for SARS-CoV-2 infection as diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers.",

A marked reduction in swarming, swimming, and twitching ability of the bacteria is demonstrated in presence of PbLE. The biofilm and pyocyanin production also shows a marked reduction in presence of PbLE, though it does not affect the bacterial growth. Thus, the studies hint on the possible effect of the bioactive components of PbLE on reducing the virulent ability of the bacteria; identification of bioactive compounds should be investigated further.",

    "abstract": "This study reports an industrially applicable non-sterile xylitol fermentation process to produce xylitol from a low-cost feedstock like corn cob hydrolysate as pentose source without any detoxification. Different immobilization matrices/mediums (alginate, polyvinyl alcohol, agarose gel, polyacrylamide, gelatin, and κ-carrageenan) were studied to immobilize Candida tropicalis NCIM 3123 cells for xylitol production. Amongst this calcium alginate, immobilized cells produced maximum amount of xylitol with titer of 11.1 g/L and yield of 0.34 g/g. Hence, the process for immobilization using calcium alginate beads was optimized using a statistical method with sodium alginate (20, 30 and 40 g/L), calcium chloride (10, 20 and 30 g/L) and number of freezing-thawing cycles (2, 3 and 4) as the parameters. Using optimized conditions (calcium chloride 10 g/L, sodium alginate 20 g/L and 4 number of freezing-thawing cycles) for immobilization, xylitol production increased significantly to 41.0 g/L (4 times the initial production) with corn cob hydrolysate as sole carbon source and urea as minimal nutrient source. Reuse of immobilized biomass showed sustained xylitol production even after five cycles.",

    "abstract": "Two bacterial strains phylogenetically identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains RM1 and SK1 displayed extensive degradation ability on waste engine oil (SAE 40W) in batch cultures. Spectrophotometric analysis revealed the presence of various heavy metals such as lead, chromium and nickel in the waste engine oil. The rate of degradation of waste engine oil by the isolates, for the first 12 days and the last 9 days were 66.3, 31.6 mg l−1 day−1 and 69.6, 40.0 mg l−1 day−1 for strains RM1 and SK1, respectively. Gas chromatographic (GC) analyses of residual waste engine oil, revealed that 66.58, 89.06 % and 63.40, 90.75 % of the initial concentration of the waste engine oil were degraded by strains RM1 and SK1 within 12 and 21 days. GC fingerprints of the waste engine oil after 12 days of incubation of strains RM1 and SK1 showed total disappearance of C15, C23, C24, C25 and C26 hydrocarbon fractions as well as drastic reductions of C13, C14, C16 and PAHs fractions such as C19-anthracene and C22-pyrene. At the end of 21 days incubation, total disappearance of C17-pristane, C22-pyrene, one of the C19-anthracene and significant reduction of C18-phytane (97.2 %, strain RM1; 95.1 %, strain SK1) fractions were observed. In addition, <10 % of Day 0 values of medium fraction ranges C13, and C16 were discernible after 21 days. This study has established the potentials of P. aeruginosa strains RM1 and SK1 in the degradation of aliphatic, aromatic and branched alkane components of waste engine oils.",

    "abstract": "Aspergillus terreus FBCC 1369 was grown in solid-state culture under statistically optimized conditions. β-Mannanase was purified to apparent homogeneity by ultrafiltration, anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. A purification factor of 10.3-fold was achieved, with the purified enzyme exhibiting specific activity of 53 U/mg protein. The purified β-mannanase was optimally active at pH 7.0 and 70 °C and displayed stability over a broad pH range of 4.0-8.0 and a 30 min half-life at 80 °C. The molecular weight of β-mannanase was calculated as ~49 kDa by SDS-PAGE. The enzyme exhibited K m and V max values of 5.9 mg/ml and 39.42 µmol/ml/min, respectively. β-Mannanase activity was stimulated by β-mercaptoethanol and strongly inhibited by Hg2+. The β-Mannanase did not hydrolyze mannobiose and mannotriose, but only mannotetraose liberating mannose and mannotriose. This indicated that at least four mannose residues were required for catalytic activity. Oligosaccharide with a degree of polymerization (DP) three was the predominant product in the case of locust bean gum (16.5 %) and guar gum (15.8 %) hydrolysis. However, the enzyme liberated DP4 oligosaccharide (24 %) exclusively from konjac gum. This property can be exploited in oligosaccharides production with DP 3-4. β-Mannanase hydrolyzed pretreated lignocelluloses and liberated reducing sugars (% theoretical yield) from copra meal (30 %). This property is an important factor for the bioconversion of the biomass.",

Degradation performance of the system was evaluated by measuring the changes in chemical oxygen demand (COD) and level of phenolic compounds in the wastewater samples during the microbial treatment. The microbial treatment reduced initial COD level and concentration of phenolic compounds by 95 % or more, demonstrating the excellent efficacy of immobilized AKG1 and AKG2 strains in treating petroleum wastewater in continuous mode of operation. The present study demonstrates the potential of immobilized AKG1 and AKG2 in treating petroleum wastewater in fluidized bed bioreactors.",

Elite source was identified based on the chemical potency to accumulate the optimum level of CPT. Different types and concentrations of plant growth regulators were used to study their effect on inducing multiple shoots from the explants regenerated from embryos of N. nimmoniana. Of these, a combination of N6-benzyladenine (0.2 mg L−1) and Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) (0.1 mg L−1) proved optimum for differentiating multiple shoots in 90.6 % of the cultures with an average of 10.24 shoots per explant obtained within 8 weeks of inoculation. Nearly, 92 % of the excised in vitro shoots rooted on half strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 0.05 % activated charcoal, supplemented with 1-naphthaleneacetic acid and IBA at 0.1 mg L−1 each. The micropropagated plants were evaluated for their genetic fidelity by employing inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) markers. Ten individuals, randomly chosen from a population of 145 regenerants, were compared with the donor plant. The regenerated plants were also evaluated for their chemical potency using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of CPT content. The true-to-type nature of the micropropagated plants was confirmed based on their monomorphic banding profiles with that of the mother plants using ISSR markers. Besides, HPLC evaluation of the CPT content confirmed the existence of chemical uniformity among the regenerated plants and the elite mother plant.",

(cv Grand Rapids) was transformed by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation with rol C gene. Transgene integration and expression was confirmed through PCR and semiquantitative RT-PCR. The transformed extracts were evaluated for their in vitro antioxidant and in vivo analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antidepressant activities in rats. The transformed plants showed 53-98 % increase in total phenolic and 45-58 % increase in total flavonoid contents compared with untransformed plants. Results of total reducing power and total antioxidant capacity exhibited 90-118 and 61-75 % increase in transformed plants, respectively. In contrast to control, DPPH, lipid peroxidation and DNA protection assay showed up to 37, 20 and 50 % enhancement in transformed plants, respectively. The extracts showed similar but significant enhancement behavior in hot plate analgesic and carrageenan-induced hind paw edema test. The transformed extracts showed 72.1 and 78.5 % increase for analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities, respectively. The transformants of rol C gene exhibited prominent antidepressant activity with 64-73 % increase compared with untransformed plants. In conclusion, the present work suggests that transformation with rol C gene can be used to generate lettuce with enhanced medicinally important properties, such as antioxidant, analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antidepressant potential.",

The resources of Trichoderma spp. in the grassland and forest ecosystems of northern Xinjiang were explored in this study. A total of 634 soil samples was collected, and 312 strains assigned to 23 species of Trichoderma spp. were identified. T. harzianum was the dominant species with 28.2% from all isolates. The principal components analysis indicated that ecosystem was the most dominant impact factor among longitude, latitude, altitude and ecosystems for the species diversities of Trichoderma spp. with the decreasing trend from the north to the south of northern Xinjiang (e.g., from Altay, followed by Yili, Changji, Bayingolin and finally Urumqi). Overall, Trichoderma spp. were more frequently encountered in forest ecosystems (coniferous forest and coniferous and broadleaf mixed forest) than in grassland ecosystems (desert steppe and temperate steppe). Frequency of Trichoderma spp. was significantly decreased along with increased altitude and only a few strains were isolated from altitudes above 3000 m. The results provided essential information on Trichoderma occurrence and distribution, which should benefit the application of Trichoderma in agriculture.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on the camelid nanobodies as a revolutionary therapy that can guide efforts to discover new drugs for Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The small size property makes nanobodies capable of penetrating efficiently into tissues and recognizing cryptic antigens. Strong antigen affinity and stability in the gastrointestinal tract allow them to be used via oral administration. In fact, the use of nanobodies as inhalant can be directly delivered to the target organ, conferring high pulmonary drug concentrations and low systemic drug concentrations and minimal systemic side effects. For that, nanobodies are referred as a class of next-generation antibodies. Nanobodies permit the construction of multivalent formats that may achieve ultra-high neutralization potency and then may prevent mutational escape and can neutralize a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Due to their distinctive characteristics, nanobodies can be of great use in the development of promising treatment or preventive strategies against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this review, the state-of-the-art of camel nanobodies design strategies against the virus including SARS-CoV-2 are critically summarized. The application of general nanotechnology was also discussed to mitigate and control emerging SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Rhizosphere bioremediation of pyrethroid pesticides will offer an attractive and potentially inexpensive approach for remediation of contaminated soil. The present study was done with the aim of establishment of highly effective remediation method using plant with degradative rhizosphere and isolation of naturally occurring rhizosphere associated potential degrader providing the possibility of both environmental and insitu detoxification of cypermethrin contamination. The remediation efficacy of Pennisetum pedicellatum was investigated using green house pot culture experiments in cypermethrin amended potting soil mix (10, 25, 50, 75 and 100 mg/kg) for periodic evaluation of changes in concentration. Total proportion of cypermethrin degraders was found to be higher in rhizosphere soil compared to bulk soil. The cypermethrin degrading strain associated with rhizosphere capable of surviving at higher concentrations of cypermethrin was designated as potential degrader. On the basis of morphological characteristics, biochemical tests and 16S rDNA analysis, isolate was identified as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia MHF ENV 22. Bioremediation data of cypermethrin by strain MHF ENV22 examined by HPLC and mass spectroscopy, indicated 100, 50 and 58 % degradation within the time period of 72, 24 and 192 h at concentrations 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg, respectively. This is the first report of effective degradation of cypermethrin by Stenotrophomonas spp. isolated from rhizosphere of Pennisetum pedicellatum. Rhizoremediation strategy will be of immense importance in remediation of cypermethrin residues to a level permissible for technogenic and natural environment.",

Out of the total isolates, 32% of them showed strong antagonistic activity against P. aphanidermatum under in vitro condition and subsequently 20 best isolates were selected based on their mycelial inhibition capacity against P. aphanidermatum for further analysis. Different biocontrol mechanisms such as protease, chitinase, β-1,3-glucanase activity, cellulase and production of volatile and non-volatile compounds were also assayed. Based on their relative biocontrol potency, only three indigenous Trichoderma isolates (T73, T80 and T105) were selected for pot culture experiment against damping-off diseases in common beans. In greenhouse experiment, Trichoderma isolates T-105 significantly reduced the pre- and post-emergence damping-off disease incidence under artificial infection with P. aphanidermatum and showed highest disease control percentage.",

    "abstract": "Microsatellite markers containing simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are a valuable tool for genetic analysis. Our objective was to identify microsatellite markers that could be used to differentiate between male and female date palm (Phoenix dactylifera). The date palm is a dioecious plant whose sex cannot be determined until it reaches a reproductive age between 5 and 10 years. An early selection and/or differentiation of young seedlings into males and females could enhance breeding and assist research programs for genetic improvements of the date palm. Here, we report on the use of microsatellites for determining the sex of immature date palm. Using 14 microsatellite primer pairs with 129 date palm leaves and tissue culture samples from 34 cultivars which represent the major date palm diversity of Qatar, 254 microsatellite loci were detected, of these, 22 microsatellite loci could be used to identify 9 out of 12 male date palm samples (75%). The data also indicated that the heterozygous allele with the size 160/190 produced by the primer mPdCIR048 reoccurred 4 times exclusively in the 12 individual male samples but not in any of the 117 female date palm samples tested, and hence it is a promising candidate marker to detect male sex in date palm. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) of 12 male samples with 7 female Khasab cultivars produced 2 autonomous groups of males and females and similar results were observed with 13 female Shishi cultivars. Our results suggest that the SSR markers described here have potential in sex identification of date palm.",

The addition of anthraquinone-2-sulphonic acid (AQS) to culture O. intermedium BCR400 significantly enhanced its chromium reduction rate. The activation energy of AQS-mediated Cr(VI) reduction (120.69 KJ/mol) was 1.1-fold lower than non-mediated Cr(VI) reduction. An increase in the activities of quinone reductase and chromate reductase in cells grown in presence of AQS/AQS + Cr(VI) suggests their role in reduction of Cr(VI) by O. intermedium. Both chromate reductase and quinone reductase activities were FAD independent, required NADH as reductant, displayed maximum activity at pH (7.0) and temperature (30 °C). Thus Cr(VI) bioremediation potential of O. intermedium can be enhanced by augmentation of system with AQS as redox mediator.",

In present study, these shortcomings associated with FA were overcome by fabricating FA-encapsulated poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide)/polyethylene oxide (PLGA/PEO) blend nanofibers using electrospinning technique. FESEM and fluorescence microscopic analysis imitates the smooth morphology and even distribution of FA within the polymeric nanofibers at optimum 2 wt% concentration of FA. The average diameters were recorded to be 150 ± 47.4 and 200 ± 79 nm for PLGA/PEO and FA-encapsulated PLGA/PEO nanofibers, respectively. The encapsulation, compatibility, and physical state of FA within the nanofibers were further confirmed by FTIR, TGA and XRD analysis. In vitro drug delivery studies demonstrated initial burst liberation of FA within 24 h followed by a sustained release for the subsequent time. MTT assay revealed the effectiveness of FA-encapsulated nanofibers against human breast carcinoma cells (MCF-7) cells as compared to control. FESEM and fluorescence microscopic analysis further confirmed the apoptotic effect of FA-encapsulated PLGA/PEO nanofibers against MCF-7. These fabricated nanofibers hold enormous potential to be used as a therapeutic agent for various biomedical applications.",

The primer pairs targeted against 16S rRNA resulted into amplification of 1.2 kb PCR product. However, sets of primers targeted against different regions of 'iap' produced 371 and 660 bp PCR products, respectively. The primer pair targeted against 'prf' gene could produce 508 bp product. Three primer pairs targeted against different regions of 'hly', i.e., 'hly', 'hly A' and 'hly K9' were able to amplify 713, 276 and 384 bp products, respectively. The PCR conditions were also optimized in respect of two internal sets of primers falling within 'iap' and 'hly' genes that amplified 119 and 188 bp products to verify the PCR results obtained with respective external sets of primers. Three different combinations involving four sets of primers based on 16S rRNA, 'iap', 'hly' and 'prf' were explored in respective multiplex PCR assays in order to select a suitable combination. Combination 1 and 3 worked successfully as revealed by amplification of all the four bands of expected sizes on agarose gel. However, while optimizing the different parameters for developing a functional multiplex PCR, it was observed that in both these combinations, only two of the amplified products, i.e., 1.2 kb and 713 bp could be invariably detected. Hence, these two primers were combined in the multiplex PCR and the conditions were optimized for application in dairy foods for detection of Listeria monocytogenes.",

Traditionally these are manufactured by wet chemical methods which require toxic and flammable chemicals. We report for the first time an economic and eco-friendly green synthesis of silver nanoparticles using Strychnos potatorum aqueous leaf extract from 3 mM silver nitrate solution. Nanoparticles thus formed are confirmed and characterized by using UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, SEM and XRD measurements. The XRD and SEM analysis showed the average particle size of nanoparticles as 28 nm as well as revealed their (mixed, i.e., cubic and hexagonal) structure. Further, these green synthesized nanoparticles showed bactericidal activity against multidrug-resistant human pathogenic bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Cholesterol ester lipase (LIPA; EC 3.1.1.13) and cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H; EC 1.14.99.48) play essential role in cholesterol metabolism in the body by hydrolysing cholesteryl esters and triglycerides within lysosomes (LIPA) and catalysing the formation of 25-hydroxycholesterol from cholesterol (CH25H) which acts to repress cholesterol biosynthesis. Bioinformatic methods were used to predict the amino acid sequences, structures and genomic features of several vertebrate LIPA and CH25H genes and proteins, and to examine the phylogeny of vertebrate LIPA. Amino acid sequence alignments and predicted subunit structures enabled the identification of key sequences previously reported for human LIPA and CH25H and transmembrane structures for vertebrate CH25H sequences. Vertebrate LIPA and CH25H genes were located in tandem on all vertebrate genomes examined and showed several predicted transcription factor binding sites and CpG islands located within the 5' regions of the human genes. Vertebrate LIPA genes contained nine coding exons, while all vertebrate CH25H genes were without introns. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the distinct nature of the vertebrate LIPA gene and protein family in comparison with other vertebrate acid lipases and has apparently evolved from an ancestral LIPA gene which predated the appearance of vertebrates.

Results showed that cultivation of cells under dark conditions at room temperature (25 ± 2 °C) enhanced the cell biomass from 100 to 625 g l-1. The pigment production was also found to be increased in dark conditions at room temperature. Alkaline pH found to have positive effect on pigment yield.

All of the Streptomyces sp. strains exhibited enhanced nodule number, nodule weight, root weight and shoot weight at 30 days after sowing (DAS) and pod number, pod weight, leaf area, leaf weight and stem weight at 60 DAS in both seasons over the un-inoculated control.

Microcosms were constructed of sediment and seawater collected from Bayou La Batre located in coastal Alabama on the Gulf of Mexico. We used an amplicon pyrosequencing approach on microcosm sediment metagenome targeting the V3-V5 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Overall, we identified a shift in the bacterial community in three distinct groups. The first group was the early responders (orders Pseudomonadales and Oceanospirillales within class Gammaproteobacteria), which increased their relative abundance within 2 weeks and were maintained 3 weeks after oil treatment. The second group was identified as early, but transient responders (order Rhodobacterales within class Alphaproteobacteria; class Epsilonproteobacteria), which increased their population by 2 weeks, but returned to the basal level 3 weeks after oil treatment. The third group was the late responders (order Clostridiales within phylum Firmicutes; order Methylococcales within class Gammaproteobacteria; and phylum Tenericutes), which only increased 3 weeks after oil treatment. Furthermore, we identified oil-sensitive bacterial taxa (order Chromatiales within class Gammaproteobacteria; order Syntrophobacterales within class Deltaproteobacteria), which decreased in their population after 2 weeks of oil treatment. Detection of alkane (alkB), catechol (C2,3DO) and biphenyl (bph) biodegradation genes by PCR, particularly in oil-treated sediment metacommunity DNA, delineates proliferation of the hydrocarbon degrading bacterial community. Overall, the indigenous bacterial communities in our salt-marsh sediment in vitro microcosm study responded rapidly and shifted towards members of the taxonomic groups that are capable of surviving in an MC252 oil-contaminated environment.",

In this study, lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosus (Lecitase Ultra™) was used to catalyze the synthesis of flavor esters, i.e., methyl butanoate and methyl benzoate by esterification of the acids with methanol in a microfluidic system. Maximum reaction rates of 195 and 115 mM min-1 corresponding to catalytic efficiencies (k cat/K M) of 0.30 and 0.24 min-1 mM-1 as well as yield conversion of 54 and 41 % were observed in methyl butanoate and methyl benzoate synthesis, respectively. Catalytic turnover (k cat) was higher for methyl butanoate synthesis. Rate of synthesis and yield decreased with increasing flow rates. For both esters, increase in microfluidic flow rate resulted in increased advective transport over molecular diffusion and reaction rate, thus lower conversion. In microfluidic synthesis using T. lanuginosus lipase, the following reaction conditions were 40 °C, flow rate 0.1 mL min-1, and 123 U g-1 enzyme loading found to be the optimum operating limits. The work demonstrated the application of enzyme(s) in a microreactor system for the synthesis of industrially important esters.",

Mass production of microalgal oil faces a number of technical barriers that make the current production of biodiesel economically unfeasible. Small size (≈1-20 μm) and negatively charged surface of the microalgal cells pose difficulties in the process of harvesting. This leads to significant increase in the overall cost of biomass production. The present study explored different methods and conditions for harvesting of Chlorella sp. MJ 11/11 and Synechocystis PCC 6803. A customized air-lift reactor was used for the cultivation of biomass under photoautotrophic condition. Significant improvement in the rate of productivity of biomass was observed. Maximum biomass productivity of 0.25, 0.14 g L-1 d-1 for Chlorella sp. MJ 11/11 and Synechocystis PCC 6803, respectively, were obtained. Various flocculation techniques viz. auto-flocculation, inorganic, chitosan and electrolytic flocculation were used for the recovery of biomass. Among all the techniques, electro-flocculation showed high flocculation efficiency (98 %) and floatation of floc causing easy harvesting. Moreover, low-cost and easy control of the process justify electro-flocculation as a most suitable and promising technique for the recovery of microalgal cells.",

However, they had no effect on hyperhydricity, tissue browning and precocious rooting. Shoots of 4.5-6.0 cm in length were isolated and transferred onto hormone-free media for elongation and rooting. After 3 months, the developed plantlets were successfully transplanted in a glasshouse and over 90 % survived acclimatization.",

    "abstract": "The present study reports the production of high-level cellulase-free xylanase from Penicillium citrinum isolate HZN13. The variability in xylanase titers was assessed under both solid-state (SSF) and submerged (SmF) fermentation. SSF was initially optimized with different agro-waste residues, among them sweet sorghum bagasse was found to be the best substrate that favored maximum xylanase production (9643 U/g). Plackett-Burman and response surface methodology employing central composite design were used to optimize the process parameters for the production of xylanase under SSF. A second-order quadratic model and response surface method revealed the optimum conditions for xylanase production (sweet sorghum bagasse 25 g/50 ml; ammonium sulphate 0.36 %; yeast extract 0.6 %; pH 4; temperature 40 °C) yielding 30,144 U/g. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed a high correlation coefficient (R 2 = 97.63 %). Glutaraldehyde-activated calcium-alginate-immobilized purified xylanase showed recycling stability (87 %) up to seven cycles. Immobilized purified xylanase showed enhanced thermo-stability in comparison to immobilized crude xylanase. Immobilization kinetics of crude and purified xylanase revealed an increase in K m (12.5 and 11.11 mg/ml) and V max (12,500 and 10,000 U/mg), respectively. Immobilized (crude) enzymatic hydrolysis of sweet sorghum bagasse released 8.1 g/g (48 h) of reducing sugars. Xylose and other oligosaccharides produced during hydrolysis were detected by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography. The biomass was characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy, Energy Dispersive X-ray and Fourier Transformation Infrared Spectroscopy. However, this is one of the few reports on high-level cellulase-free xylanase from P. citrinum isolate using sweet sorghum bagasse.",

The A. agilis A17 cells were immobilized in calcium alginate for the production of IAA. Optimization of process parameters for IAA production was carried out to enhance IAA production using immobilized cells. The maximal production of IAA was 520 mg/L under the following optimal conditions: 1% mannitol, 30 °C, pH 8.0, and 24 h incubation. It was determined that the immobilized cells could be reused (13 times) for the production of IAA.",

Fifty-one plant species belonged to 22 families, 2 monocots, and 20 eudicots; a maximum number of species being legumes and grasses were collected. To authenticate the morphological identification of the wild plant taxa, rbcL and matK regions were used in the study. The primer universality and discriminatory power of rbcL is 100%, while it is 35% for matK locus for these plant species. The sequences were submitted to GenBank; accession numbers were obtained for all the rbcL sequences and for 6 of matK sequences. We suggest rbcL as a promising barcode locus for the tested group of 51 plants. In the present study, an inexpensive, simple method of identification of rare desert plant taxa through rbcL barcode is being reported.",

Therefore, natural resource (soil) was explored to search a potential candidate for biodegradation of endosulfan. A soil bacterium was enriched and isolated by applying a strong nutritional selection pressure, using a non-sulfur medium supplemented with endosulfan as sole source sulfur. The microbial strain was found to degrade endosulfan as well as its equally toxic metabolite endosulfan sulfate to non-toxic metabolites (endodiol and endosulfan lactone) very efficiently (up to 94.2 %) within 7 days, estimated qualitatively by thin layer chromatography and quantitatively by gas chromatography-electron capture detection methods. The isolate was characterized for its morphological, physiological, biochemical and 16S rRNA sequencing and identified as a new strain of Bacillus subtilis with strain designation AKPJ04, which was deposited with accession number Microbial Type Culture Collection and Gene Bank (MTCC) 8561, at MTCC, Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh, India. The partial 16S rRNA sequence was submitted to Genbank, Maryland, USA, with the accession number EU 258611. The primary investigation for endosulfan degrading gene(s) localization suggested its location on chromosomal DNA.",

Thus, identification, characterization and documentation of the gene pool of medicinal plants are essential for this purpose. Genomic information of many a medicinal plant species has increased rapidly since the past decade and genetic resources available for domestication and improvement programs include genome sequencing, expressed sequence tags sequencing, transcript profiling, gene transmit, molecular markers in favor of mapping and breeding. In recent years, multiple endeavors have been undertaken for genomic characterization of medicinal plant species with the aid of molecular markers for sustainable utilization of gene pool, its conservation and future studies. Recent advancement in genomics is so fast that only some researches have been published till date and to a large extent documentation is restricted to electronic resources. Whole genome profiling of the identified medicinal plant species, carried out by several researchers, based on the DNA fingerprinting, is well documented in the present review. This review will facilitate preparing a database of the widely used, economically important medicinal plant species, based on their genomic organization.",

    "abstract": "Disulfide bonds occurred in majority of secreted protein. Formation of correct disulfide bonds are must for achieving native conformation, solubility and activity. Production of recombinant proteins containing disulfide bond for therapeutic, diagnostic and various other purposes is a challenging task of research. Production of such proteins in the reducing cytosolic compartment of E. coli usually ends up in inclusion bodies formation. Refolding of inclusion bodies can be difficult, time and labor consuming and uneconomical. Translocation of these proteins into the oxidative periplasmic compartment provides correct environment to undergo proper disulfide bonds formation and thus achieving native conformation. However, not all proteins can be efficiently translocated to the periplasm with the help of bacterial signal peptides. Therefore, fusion to a small well-folded and stable periplasmic protein is more promising for periplasmic production of disulfide bonded proteins. In the past decades, several full-length proteins or domains were used for enhancing translocation and solubility. Here, protein fusion tags that significantly increase the yields of target proteins in the periplasmic space are reviewed.",

The approximate molecular weight of the purified PG was found to be 43.0 kDa as revealed by SDS-PAGE. The pH optimum of the purified enzyme was found to be 10.0 and was stable in the pH range of 7–10. The optimum temperature of purified PG was found to be 30 °C. The Km and Kcat of the purified enzyme were 2.4 mg/ml and 44 s−1, respectively, and the metal ions Cu2+ and K+ were found to enhance the enzyme activity while Ag+, Ca2+ and Hg2+ were inhibitory in nature. Based on its alkaline nature, the potential of purified PG in retting of natural fiber Crotalaria juncea was elucidated in the absence of EDTA.

After preliminary screening, selected clones were sequenced. In silico analysis of the clones was done, which documented 83.33 % similarities with unculturable sequence database and more than 70 % similarity with culturable bacterial database. Detailed sequence analysis of 24 nifH clones showed similarity to the corresponding genera of diazotrophs belonging to alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-proteobacteria. The prominent diazotrophs were Azotobacter spp., Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Methylococcus capsulatus, Geobacter bemidjiensis, Dechloromonas aromatica, Burkholderia xenovorans, Xanthobacter autotrophicus and Sideroxydans lithotrophicus, respectively.

Medium supplemented with 0.5 % chitin and peptone, at initial pH 8.0, when incubated at 35 °C for 72 h favored highest chitinase production. The enzyme was purified 25.1-fold to homogeneity. The chitinase was found to be thermostable and alkali-tolerant with maximum activity at pH 8.0 and 70 °C for 1 h. The molecular weight of chitinase was found to be 64 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Mg2+, Co2+, Ca2+ and Mn2+ improved the chitinase activity. The K m and V max values of the enzyme were 0.13 mg/ml and 38.23 U/ml, respectively. When subjected to dual plate assay, the bacterium showed 45 % antagonism against F. oxysporum. Thus, it could be inferred that cultural conditions strongly affected the chitinase production by B. pumilus JUBCH08. The enzyme being thermostable and best functional under alkaline conditions could be useful for the feed industry and related biotechnological applications. Inhibition of F. oxysporum by the culture through lytic mechanism indicates its potentiality as a biocontrol agent.",

A second-order polynomial model produced a satisfied fit for experimental data with regard to the production of the bioactive metabolites. Regression analysis showed that high R 2 values of all the five responses are significant and adjusted R 2 values showed good agreement with the experimental and predicted values. The present model was used to evaluate the direct interaction and quadratic effects to optimize the physico-chemical parameters for the production of bioactive metabolites that inhibit the pathogenic microorganisms measured in terms of zones of inhibition (responses).

Out of 30 isolates, 07 isolates were positive for HCN production, 15 isolates were positive for H2S production, and all the isolates were positive for siderophore production. Among all the isolates, RFP-22 showed the maximum percent inhibition of mycelium (46.66 %) of Rhizoctonia solani, the pathogen, and the remaining isolates showed the moderate to least inhibition of mycelium growth of R. solani. The 16S rRNA analysis confirmed that the antibiotic positive isolates belonged to genus Pseudomonas.

Here, we identified 115 putative rice J-proteins and classified them into nine major clades (I-IX) according to their phylogenetic relationships. Gene-structure analysis revealed that each member of the same clade has same or similar exon-intron structure, and most rice J-protein genes of clade VII were intronless. Chromosomes mapping suggested that tandem duplication was occurred in evolution. Expression profile showed that the 61 rice J-protein genes were expressed in at least one tissue. The result implied that they could be involved in the process of rice growth and development. The RNA-sequencing data identified 96 differentially expressed genes, 59.38% (57/96), 67.71% (65/96), and 62.50% (60/96) genes were induced by heat stress, drought stress, and salt stress, respectively. The results indicated that J-protein genes could participated in rice response to different stresses. The findings in this study would provide a foundation for further analyzing the function of J-proteins in rice.",

Date palm is a dioecious and slow flowering and is very difficult to identify the gender of the trees until it reaches the reproductive age (5-10 years). A total of 12 microsatellite primers were used with 30 date palm samples, 14 parents (8 male + 6 females) and 16 progeny (developed from parents breeding) which showed that microsatellites were highly polymorphic, having a great number of alleles. A total of 124 alleles were characterized in 12 SSR loci. On average, there are 9.08 alleles per locus, with a range from 5 to 16 alleles, for primers mpdCIR15 and mpdCIR57, respectively. These primers produced 15 polymorphic loci specifically in male date palm samples and the seedlings harboring the unique fragments were further characterized as male plants. Increasingly, 38.46 % of these loci were scored as homozygous alleles while 61.53 % heterozygous allelic loci were determined. Primer mpdCIR48 produced a specific locus (250/250) in all male samples whereas the same locus was absent in female samples. Similarly, a locus of 300/310 bp reoccurred in 5 date palm male samples using marker DP-168 which indicated that these are the promising candidate marker to detect the sex in date palm seedlings at early stage. The data resulted from combination of 12 primers enabled the 16 seedling samples progeny (developed from parents breeding) of date palm cultivars to divide into two groups i.e., male and female regarding their sex expression comparative to the parents (male + female) using the principle coordinate analysis.",

In the present study, a fipronil degrading bacterium was isolated from fipronil contaminated soil, i.e. rhizospheric zone of Zea mays. Morphological, biochemical and molecular characterization of strain indicated that it clearly belongs to Stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila (accession no. KJ396942). A three-factor Box–Behnken experimental design combined with response surface modeling was employed to predict the optimum conditions for fipronil degradation. The optimum pH, temperature and total inocula biomass for the degradation of fipronil were 7.5, 35 °C and 0.175 g L−1, respectively. The bacterial strain was able to metabolize 25 mg L−1 fipronil with 86.14 % degradation in Dorn's broth medium under optimum conditions. Metabolites formed as a result of fipronil degradation were characterized with gas liquid chromatograph. A novel fipronil degradation pathway was proposed for S. acidaminiphila on the basis of metabolites formed. Non-sterilized soil inoculated with S. acidaminiphila was found to follow first order kinetics with a rate constant of 0.046 d−1. Fipronil sulfone, sulfide and amide were formed as the metabolites and were degraded below the quantifiable limit after 90 days of time period. Given the high fipronil degradation observed in the present study, S. acidaminiphila may have potential for use in bioremediation of fipronil contaminated soils.",

In this study, polycaprolactone (PCL) and PCL/gelatine (Ge) (70:30) nanofibrous scaffolds were fabricated using a less toxic and common solvent, formic acid and an electrospinning technique. Nanofibrous scaffolds were coated with silver (Ag) in different concentrations of silver nitrate (AgNO3) aqueous solution (1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 %) by using dipping method, drying and followed by ultraviolet (UV) photoreduction. The PCL/Ge (70:30) nanofibrous scaffold had an average fibre diameter of 155.60 ± 41.13 nm. Characterization showed that Ag was physically entrapped in both the PCL and PCL/Ge (70:30) nanofibrous scaffolds. Ag+ ions release study was performed and showed much lesser release amount than the maximum toxic concentration of Ag+ ions in human cells. Both scaffolds were non-toxic to cells and demonstrated antibacterial effects towards Gram-positive Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) and Gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli). The Ag/PCL/Ge (70:30) nanofibrous scaffold has potential for tissue engineering as it can protect wounds from bacterial infection and promote tissue regeneration.",

The recombinant protein containing His-tag was expressed as inclusion bodies in Esherichia coli BL21DE3 cells, using pET-23a as expression vector. Expressed protein purified from the inclusion bodies demonstrated ~22 kDa protein band on 12 % SDS-PAGE. It exhibited specific activity of 0.49 U mg−1 and % yield of 8.58. Interestingly, the lipase displayed activity at wide range of pH and temperature, i.e., 9.0–14.0 pH and 30–80 °C, respectively. It further demonstrated ~100 % enzyme activity in presence of various organic solvents. Enzyme activity was strongly inhibited in the presence of β-ME. Additionally, the serine and histidine modifiers also inhibited the enzyme activities strongly at all concentrations that suggest their role in the catalytic center. Enzyme could retain its activity in presence of various detergents (Triton X-100, Tween 20, Tween 40, SDS). Sequence and structural analysis employing in silico tools revealed that the lipase contained two highly conserved sequences consisting of ITITGCGNDL and NLYNP, arranged as parallel β-sheet in the core of the 3D structure. The function of these conserve sequences have not fully understood.",

On the basis of aforesaid premise, the present study deals with the optimization and fabrication of gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) using easily available bio-resource, Delonix regia leaf extract. The use of practically nontoxic natural extracts and water allows the synthesis pathways presented to be considered as ''green'' and so permitting the synthesized Au-NPs to be used in sensitive areas, such as bioremediation. Various characterization techniques are adopted for the evaluation of size, stability, morphology, crystal nature, and purity of nanoparticles. Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy analysis showed a surface Plasmon resonance peak for prepared Au-NPs at 542 nm, and its absorbance increased with increasing the interaction time. Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that the particles were spherical and 4-24 nm in size. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis displayed a 2.2 keV peak corresponding to the pure phase gold nanocrystal. X-ray diffraction analysis proved the fabrication of crystalline Au-NPs with face-centered cubic geometry within 10 min. Furthermore, ζ potential (-15 mV) and Fourier transform infrared data suggested the role of polar polyphenolic compounds of leaf extract in fabrication and stabilization process. Biofabricated nanoparticles are demonstrated to have catalytic activity for the reduction of toxic nitro-organic pollutant o-nitroaniline. Therefore, the present study offers a straightforward, cost-efficient, eco-friendly, and sustainable alternative for the fabrication of catalytically active Au-NPs.",

It has been seen that the factors such as temperature and pH influence the biodegradation process. The role of plasmid was studied in the degradation process by plasmid curing method. The PCZ acts as the sole carbon source and as energy substrate which can be utilized by the strain for its growth in Mineral salt medium and degraded 8.89 µg ml-1 of PCZ at 30 °C and pH 7 within 4 days. During the bioconversion process of PCZ, three metabolite were formed such as 1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl) ethanone, 1-[2-(4-chlorophenyl) ethyl]-1H-1,2,4-triazole and 1-ethyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole. The LD50 value of BBK_9 strain was determined with acridine orange which resulted in 40 µg ml-1 at cell density of 0.243 at 660 nm. Furthermore, plasmid curing was done using LD50 concentration and from that three plasmids got cured in the sixth generation. It was found that, cured strain was able to degrade 7.37 µg ml-1 of PCZ, indicating the plasmid encoded gene were not responsible for the PCZ degradation. On the source of these outcomes, strain BBK_9 can be used as potential strain for bioremediation of contaminated sites.",

Enzyme immobilization provides an excellent base for increasing availability of enzyme to the substrate with greater turnover over a considerable period of time. Several natural and synthetic supports have been assessed for their efficiency for enzyme immobilization. Nowadays, immobilized enzymes are preferred over their free counterpart due to their prolonged availability that curtails redundant downstream and purification processes. Future investigations should endeavor at adopting logistic and sensible entrapment techniques along with innovatively modified supports to improve the state of enzyme immobilization and provide new perspectives to the industrial sector.",

    "abstract": "Second-generation bioethanol can be produced from various lignocellulosic biomasses such as wood, agricultural or forest residues. Lignocellulosic biomass is inexpensive, renewable and abundant source for bioethanol production. The conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to bioethanol could be a promising technology though the process has several challenges and limitations such as biomass transport and handling, and efficient pretreatment methods for total delignification of lignocellulosics. Proper pretreatment methods can increase concentrations of fermentable sugars after enzymatic saccharification, thereby improving the efficiency of the whole process. Conversion of glucose as well as xylose to bioethanol needs some new fermentation technologies to make the whole process inexpensive. The main goal of pretreatment is to increase the digestibility of maximum available sugars. Each pretreatment process has a specific effect on the cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin fraction; thus, different pretreatment methods and conditions should be chosen according to the process configuration selected for the subsequent hydrolysis and fermentation steps. The cost of ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass in current technologies is relatively high. Additionally, low yield still remains as one of the main challenges. This paper reviews the various technologies for maximum conversion of cellulose and hemicelluloses fraction to ethanol, and it point outs several key properties that should be targeted for low cost and maximum yield.",

    "abstract": "Modern agriculture faces challenges, such as loss of soil fertility, fluctuating climatic factors and increasing pathogen and pest attacks. Sustainability and environmental safety of agricultural production relies on eco-friendly approaches like biofertilizers, biopesticides and crop residue return. The multiplicity of beneficial effects of microbial inoculants, particularly plant growth promoters (PGP), emphasizes the need for further strengthening the research and their use in modern agriculture. PGP inhabit the rhizosphere for nutrients from plant root exudates. By reaction, they help in (1) increased plant growth through soil nutrient enrichment by nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, siderophore production and phytohormones production (2) increased plant protection by influencing cellulase, protease, lipase and β-1,3 glucanase productions and enhance plant defense by triggering induced systemic resistance through lipopolysaccharides, flagella, homoserine lactones, acetoin and butanediol against pests and pathogens. In addition, the PGP microbes contain useful variation for tolerating abiotic stresses like extremes of temperature, pH, salinity and drought; heavy metal and pesticide pollution. Seeking such tolerant PGP microbes is expected to offer enhanced plant growth and yield even under a combination of stresses. This review summarizes the PGP related research and its benefits, and highlights the benefits of PGP rhizobia belonging to the family Rhizobiaceae, Phyllobacteriaceae and Bradyrhizobiaceae.",

Several plant-derived anti-cancer agents including taxol, vinblastine, vincristine, the campothecin derivatives, topotecan, irinotecan and etoposide are in clinical use all over the world. Other promising anti-cancer agents include flavopiridol, roscovitine, combretastatin A-4, betulinic acid and silvestrol.

Flavonoids present in human diet comprise many polyphenolic secondary metabolites with broad-spectrum pharmacological activities including their potential role as anti-cancer agents. A positive correlation between flavonoids-rich diet (from vegetables and fruits) and lower risk of colon, prostate and breast cancers lead to a question that whether flavonoids mediate the protective effects as chemopreventive agents or can interact with different genes and proteins to play role in chemotherapy. The current review emphasizes onto the therapeutic potential of flavonoids and their synthetic analogs as anti-cancer agents by providing new insights into the factors, regulation and molecular mechanisms along with their significant protein interactions.",

    "abstract": "The hunt for alternative sources of energy generation that are inexpensive, ecofriendly, renewable and can replace fossil fuels is on, owing to the increasing demands of energy. One approach in this direction is the conversion of plant residues into biofuels wherein lignocellulose, which forms the structural framework of plants consisting of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, is first broken down and hydrolyzed into simple fermentable sugars, which upon fermentation form biofuels such as ethanol. A major bottleneck is to disarray lignin which is present as a protective covering and makes cellulose and hemicellulose recalcitrant to enzymatic hydrolysis. A number of biomass deconstruction or pretreatment processes (physical, chemical and biological) have been used to break the structural framework of plants and depolymerize lignin. This review surveys and discusses some major pretreatment processes pertaining to the pretreatment of plant biomass, which are used for the production of biofuels and other value added products. The emphasis is given on processes that provide maximum amount of sugars, which are subsequently used for the production of biofuels.",

The multiple biological activities including antiproliferation, hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, antiatherosclerotic, oxidative DNA damage protective, antiperoxidative, cardioprotective, as well as folk medicinal uses of M. oleifera (MO) are attributed to the presence of functional bioactive compounds, such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, alkaloids, phytosterols, natural sugars, vitamins, minerals, and organic acids. The low molecular weight of M. oleifera cationic proteins (MOCP) extracted from the seeds is very useful and is used in water purification, because of its potent antimicrobial and coagulant properties. Also, the M. oleifera methyl esters (MOME) produced from the oil of the seeds meet the major specifications of the biodiesel standard of Germany, Europe, and United States (US). Thus, MO is emerging as one of the prominent industrial crops for sustainable biodiesel production in tropical and subtropical countries. In view of the high nutritional, nutraceutical, and industrial values, it is important to compile an updated comprehensive review on the related aspects of this multipurpose and miracle tree. Hence, the present study is focused on the nutritionally significant bioactives and medicinal and biological properties, to explore the potential applications of MO in nutritionally rich food preparations. Furthermore, water coagulation, proteins, and fatty acid methyl esters from the MO seeds are reviewed, to explore their possible industrial applications in biodiesel production and water purification.

The last decade has witnessed the overwhelming interest of western research fraternity in pharmaceutical potential of mushrooms. The chief medicinal uses of mushrooms discovered so far are as anti-oxidant, anti-diabetic, hypocholesterolemic, anti-tumor, anti-cancer, immunomodulatory, anti-allergic, nephroprotective, and anti-microbial agents. The mushrooms credited with success against cancer belong to the genus Phellinus, Pleurotus, Agaricus, Ganoderma, Clitocybe, Antrodia, Trametes, Cordyceps, Xerocomus, Calvatia, Schizophyllum, Flammulina, Suillus, Inonotus, Inocybe, Funlia, Lactarius, Albatrellus, Russula, and Fomes. The anti-cancer compounds play crucial role as reactive oxygen species inducer, mitotic kinase inhibitor, anti-mitotic, angiogenesis inhibitor, topoisomerase inhibitor, leading to apoptosis, and eventually checking cancer proliferation. The present review updates the recent findings on the pharmacologically active compounds, their anti-tumor potential, and underlying mechanism of biological action in order to raise awareness for further investigations to develop cancer therapeutics from mushrooms. The mounting evidences from various research groups across the globe, regarding anti-tumor application of mushroom extracts unarguably make it a fast-track research area worth mass attention.",

It is the crucial region for learning and memory; its sub-regions aid in the generation of episodic memory. However, the hippocampus is one of the brain areas affected by Alzheimer's (AD). In the early stages of AD, the hippocampus shows rapid loss of its tissue, which is associated with the functional disconnection with other parts of the brain. In the progression of AD, atrophy of medial temporal and hippocampal regions are the structural markers in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Lack of sirtuin (SIRT) expression in the hippocampal neurons will impair cognitive function, including recent memory and spatial learning. Proliferation, differentiation, and migrations are the steps involved in adult neurogenesis. The microglia in the hippocampal region are more immunologically active than the other regions of the brain. Intrinsic factors like hormones, glia, and vascular nourishment are instrumental in the neural stem cell (NSC) functions by maintaining the brain's microenvironment. Along with the intrinsic factors, many extrinsic factors like dietary intake and physical activity may also influence the NSCs. Hence, pro-neurogenic lifestyle could delay neurodegeneration.",

Clonal propagation and preservation of elite genotypes, selected for their superior characteristics, require high degree of genetic uniformity amongst the regenerated plants. However, plant tissue culture may generate genetic variability, i.e., somaclonal variations as a result of gene mutation or changes in epigenetic marks. The occurrence of subtle somaclonal variation is a drawback for both in vitro cloning as well as germplasm preservation. Therefore, it is of immense significance to assure the genetic uniformity of in vitro raised plants at an early stage. Several strategies have been followed to ascertain the genetic fidelity of the in vitro raised progenies comprising morpho-physiological, biochemical, cytological and DNA-based molecular markers approaches. Somaclonal variation can pose a serious problem in any micropropagation program, where it is highly desirable to produce true-to-type plant material. On the other hand, somaclonal variation has provided a new and alternative tool to the breeders for obtaining genetic variability relatively rapidly and without sophisticated technology in horticultural crops, which are either difficult to breed or have narrow genetic base. In the present paper, sources of variations induced during tissue culture cycle and strategies to ascertain and confirm genetic fidelity in a variety of in vitro raised plantlets and potential application of variants in horticultural crop improvement are reviewed.",

Xylan is the major hemicellulosic constituent found in soft and hard food. It is the next most abundant renewable polysaccharide after cellulose. Xylanases and associated debranching enzymes produced by a variety of microorganisms including bacteria, actinomycetes, yeast and fungi bring hydrolysis of hemicelluloses. Despite thorough knowledge of microbial xylanolytic systems, further studies are required to achieve a complete understanding of the mechanism of xylan degradation by xylanases produced by microorganisms and their promising use in pulp biobleaching.

In this review, we have focused on the studies of structural composition of xylan in plants, their classification, sources of xylanases, extremophilic xylanases, modes of fermentation for the production of xylanases, factors affecting xylanase production, statistical approaches such as Plackett Burman, Response Surface Methodology to enhance xylanase production, purification, characterization, molecular cloning and expression. Besides this, review has focused on the microbial enzyme complex involved in the complete breakdown of xylan and the studies on xylanase regulation and their potential industrial applications with special reference to pulp biobleaching, which is directly related to increasing pulp brightness and reduction in environmental pollution.",

    "abstract": "Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are considered as chemically inert materials and, therefore, being extensively applied in the areas of imaging, targeting, drug delivery and biosensors. Their unique properties such as low toxicity, biocompatibility, potent magnetic and catalytic behavior and superior role in multifunctional modalities have epitomized them as an appropriate candidate for biomedical applications. Recent developments in the area of materials science have enabled the facile synthesis of Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) offering easy tuning of surface properties and surface functionalization with desired biomolecules. Such developments have enabled IONPs to be easily accommodated in nanocomposite platform or devices. Additionally, the tag of biocompatible material has realized their potential in myriad applications of nanomedicines including imaging modalities, sensing, and therapeutics. Further, IONPs enzyme mimetic activity pronounced their role as nanozymes in detecting biomolecules like glucose, and cholesterol etc. Hence, based on their versatile applications in biomedicine, the present review article focusses on the current trends, developments and future prospects of IONPs in MRI, hyperthermia, photothermal therapy, biomolecules detection, chemotherapy, antimicrobial activity and also their role as the multifunctional agent in diagnosis and nanomedicines.",

Production of siderophore was estimated in percent siderophore unit by both the methods. It was observed that data obtained by both methods correlated positively with each other proving the correctness of microplate method. By the modified microplate method, siderophore production by several bacterial strains can be estimated both qualitatively and quantitatively at one go, saving time, chemicals, making it very less tedious, and also being cheaper in comparison with the method currently in use. The modified microtiter plate method as proposed here makes it far easier to screen the plant-growth-promoting character of plant-associated bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Gradual increase in concentration of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in the atmosphere due to the various anthropogenic interventions leading to significant alteration in the global carbon cycle has been a subject of worldwide attention and matter of potential research over the last few decades. In these alarming scenario microalgae seems to be an attractive medium for capturing the excess CO 2 present in the atmosphere generated from different sources such as power plants, automobiles, volcanic eruption, decomposition of organic matters and forest fires. This captured CO 2 through microalgae could be used as potential carbon source to produce lipids for the generation of biofuel for replacing petroleum-derived transport fuel without affecting the supply of food and crops. This comprehensive review strives to provide a systematic account of recent developments in the field of biological carbon capture through microalgae for its utilization towards the generation of biodiesel highlighting the significance of certain key parameters such as selection of efficient strain, microalgal metabolism, cultivation systems (open and closed) and biomass production along with the national and international biodiesel specifications and properties. The potential use of photobioreactors for biodiesel production under the influence of various factors viz., light intensity, pH, time, temperature, CO 2 concentration and flow rate has been discussed. The review also provides an economic overview and future outlook on biodiesel production from microalgae.",

Three different concentrations (0, 50 and 75 ppm) of AgNPs were applied through foliar spray. After harvesting, shoot and root parameters were compared, and it was observed that wheat was relatively unaffected by all AgNP treatments. The optimum growth promotion and increased root nodulation were observed at 50 ppm treatment in cowpea, while improved shoot parameters were recorded at 75 ppm in Brassica. To observe the impact of AgNPs on soil bacterial community, sampling was carried out from the rhizosphere of these crops at 20 and 40 days after the spraying of AgNPS. The bacterial diversity of these samples was analyzed by both cultural and molecular techniques (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis). It is clearly evident from the results that application of AgNPs changes the soil bacterial diversity and this is further influenced by the plant species grown in that soil. Also, the functional bacterial diversity differed with different concentrations of AgNPs.",

These are grouped in multiple glycoside hydrolase families based on their catalytic and sequence characteristics. Most studies carried out on β-glucosidases are focused on their industrial applications rather than their endogenous function in the target organisms. β-Glucosidases performed many functions in bacteria as they are components of large complexes called cellulosomes and are responsible for the hydrolysis of short chain oligosaccharides and cellobiose. In plants, β-glucosidases are involved in processes like formation of required intermediates for cell wall lignification, degradation of endosperm's cell wall during germination and in plant defense against biotic stresses. Mammalian β-glucosidases are thought to play roles in metabolism of glycolipids and dietary glucosides, and signaling functions. These enzymes have diverse biotechnological applications in food, surfactant, biofuel, and agricultural industries. The search for novel and improved β-glucosidase is still continued to fulfills demand of an industrially suitable enzyme. In this review, a comprehensive overview on detailed functional roles of β-glucosidases in different organisms, their industrial applications, and recent cloning and expression studies with biochemical characterization of such enzymes is presented for the better understanding and efficient use of diverse β-glucosidases.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Grain legumes are a cost-effective alternative for the animal protein in improving the diets of the poor in South-East Asia and Africa. Legumes, through symbiotic nitrogen fixation, meet a major part of their own N demand and partially benefit the following crops of the system by enriching soil. In realization of this sustainability advantage and to promote pulse production, United Nations had declared 2016 as the “International Year of pulses”. Grain legumes are frequently subjected to both abiotic and biotic stresses resulting in severe yield losses. Global yields of legumes have been stagnant for the past five decades in spite of adopting various conventional and molecular breeding approaches. Furthermore, the increasing costs and negative effects of pesticides and fertilizers for crop production necessitate the use of biological options of crop production and protection. The use of plant growth-promoting (PGP) bacteria for improving soil and plant health has become one of the attractive strategies for developing sustainable agricultural systems due to their eco-friendliness, low production cost and minimizing consumption of non-renewable resources. This review emphasizes on how the PGP actinobacteria and their metabolites can be used effectively in enhancing the yield and controlling the pests and pathogens of grain legumes.",

The microbial degradation LDPE was analyzed by dry weight reduction of LDPE film, change in pH of culture media, CO2 estimation, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and fourier transform infrared FTIR spectroscopy of the film surface. SEM analysis revealed that both the strains were exhibiting adherence and growth with LDPE which used as a sole carbon source while FTIR images showed various surface chemical changes after 60 days of incubation. Bacterial isolates showed the depolymerization of biodegraded products in the extracellular media indicating the biodegradation process. BSM-2 exhibited better degradation than BSM-1 which proves the potentiality of these strains to degrade LDPE films in a short span of time.",

It belongs to enzymes, which have innate properties of reactive radical production, but its utilization in many fields has been ignored because of its unavailability in the commercial field. There are diverse sources of laccase producing organisms like bacteria, fungi and plants. In fungi, laccase is present in Ascomycetes, Deuteromycetes, Basidiomycetes and is particularly abundant in many white-rot fungi that degrade lignin. Laccases can degrade both phenolic and non-phenolic compounds. They also have the ability to detoxify a range of environmental pollutants. Due to their property to detoxify a range of pollutants, they have been used for several purposes in many industries including paper, pulp, textile and petrochemical industries. Some other application of laccase includes in food processing industry, medical and health care. Recently, laccase has found applications in other fields such as in the design of biosensors and nanotechnology. The present review provides an overview of biological functions of laccase, its mechanism of action, laccase mediator system, and various biotechnological applications of laccase obtained from endophytic fungi.",

    "abstract": "A few decades ago, drug discovery and development were limited to a bunch of medicinal chemists working in a lab with enormous amount of testing, validations, and synthetic procedures, all contributing to considerable investments in time and wealth to get one drug out into the clinics. The advancements in computational techniques combined with a boom in multi-omics data led to the development of various bioinformatics/pharmacoinformatics/cheminformatics tools that have helped speed up the drug development process. But with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), the conventional drug discovery process has been further rationalized. Extensive biological data in the form of big data present in various databases across the globe acts as the raw materials for the ML/DL-based approaches and helps in accurate identifications of patterns and models which can be used to identify therapeutically active molecules with much fewer investments on time, workforce and wealth. In this review, we have begun by introducing the general concepts in the drug discovery pipeline, followed by an outline of the fields in the drug discovery process where ML/DL can be utilized. We have also introduced ML and DL along with their applications, various learning methods, and training models used to develop the ML/DL-based algorithms. Furthermore, we have summarized various DL-based tools existing in the public domain with their application in the drug discovery paradigm which includes DL tools for identification of drug targets and drug-target interaction such as DeepCPI, DeepDTA, WideDTA, PADME DeepAffinity, and DeepPocket. Additionally, we have discussed various DL-based models used in protein structure prediction, de novo design of new chemical scaffolds, virtual screening of chemical libraries for hit identification, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) prediction, metabolite prediction, clinical trial design, and oral bioavailability prediction. In the end, we have tried to shed light on some of the successful ML/DL-based models used in the drug discovery and development pipeline while also discussing the current challenges and prospects of the application of DL tools in drug discovery and development. We believe that this review will be useful for medicinal and computational chemists searching for DL tools for use in their drug discovery projects.",

    "abstract": "Parthenium hysterophorus is a noxious weed in America, Asia, Africa and Australia. This weed is considered to be a cause of allergic respiratory problems, contact dermatitis, mutagenicity in human and livestock. Crop production is drastically reduced owing to its allelopathy. Also aggressive dominance of this weed threatens biodiversity. Eradication of P. hysterophorus by burning, chemical herbicides, eucalyptus oil and biological control by leaf-feeding beetle, stem-galling moth, stem-boring weevil and fungi have been carried out with variable degrees of success. Recently many innovative uses of this hitherto notorious plant have been discovered. Parthenium hysterophorus confers many health benefits, viz remedy for skin inflammation, rheumatic pain, diarrhoea, urinary tract infections, dysentery, malaria and neuralgia. Its prospect as nano-medicine is being carried out with some preliminary success so far. Removal of heavy metals and dye from the environment, eradication of aquatic weeds, use as substrate for commercial enzyme production, additives in cattle manure for biogas production, as biopesticide, as green manure and compost are to name a few of some other potentials. The active compounds responsible for hazardous properties have been summarized. The aim of this review article is to explore the problem P. hysterophorus poses as a weed, the effective control measures that can be implemented as well as to unravel the latent beneficial prospects of this weed.",

Through the current study, the presence of four different endophytic bacterial strains were identified from ginger rhizome. Among the various isolates, ZoB2 which is identified as Pseudomonas sp. was found to have the ability to produce IAA, ACC deaminase and siderophore. By considering these plant growth promoting properties, ZoB5 can expect to have considerable effect on the growth of ginger.",

The present study was undertaken to prepare chitosan from shrimp shell waste. The physiochemical properties like degree of deacetylation (74.82 %), ash content (2.28 %), and yield (17 %) of prepared chitosan indicated that that shrimp shell waste is a good source of chitosan. Functional property like water-binding capacity (1,136 %) and fat-binding capacity (772 %) of prepared chitosan are in total concurrence with commercially available chitosan. Fourier Transform Infra Red spectrum shows characteristic peaks of amide at 1,629.85 cm-1 and hydroxyl at 3,450.65 cm-1. X-ray diffraction pattern was employed to characterize the crystallinity of prepared chitosan and it indicated two characteristic peaks at 10° and 20° at (2θ). Scanning electron microscopy analysis was performed to determine the surface morphology. Heavy metal removal efficiency of prepared chitosan was determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Chitosan was found to be effective in removing metal ions Cu(II), Zn(II), Fe(II) and Cr(IV) from industrial effluent. Antibacterial activity of the prepared chitosan was also determined against Xanthomonas sp. isolated from leaves affected with citrus canker.",

    "abstract": "Bioremediation of hydrocarbon pollutants is advantageous owing to the cost-effectiveness of the technology and the ubiquity of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms in the soil. Soil microbial diversity is affected by hydrocarbon perturbation, thus selective enrichment of hydrocarbon utilizers occurs. Hydrocarbons interact with the soil matrix and soil microorganisms determining the fate of the contaminants relative to their chemical nature and microbial degradative capabilities, respectively. Provided the polluted soil has requisite values for environmental factors that influence microbial activities and there are no inhibitors of microbial metabolism, there is a good chance that there will be a viable and active population of hydrocarbon-utilizing microorganisms in the soil. Microbial methods for monitoring bioremediation of hydrocarbons include chemical, biochemical and microbiological molecular indices that measure rates of microbial activities to show that in the end the target goal of pollutant reduction to a safe and permissible level has been achieved. Enumeration and characterization of hydrocarbon degraders, use of micro titer plate-based most probable number technique, community level physiological profiling, phospholipid fatty acid analysis, 16S rRNA- and other nucleic acid-based molecular fingerprinting techniques, metagenomics, microarray analysis, respirometry and gas chromatography are some of the methods employed in bio-monitoring of hydrocarbon remediation as presented in this review.",

The presence of the toxic metal species above critical concentration not only harmfully affects human health but also the environment. Among existing strategies to remediate metal contaminates in soils, phytoremediation approach using metal accumulating plants is much convincing in terms of metal removal efficiency, but it has many limitations because of slow plant growth and decreased biomass owing to metal-induced stress. In addition, constrain of metal bioavailability in soils is the prime factor to restrict its applicability. Phytoremediation of metals in association with phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) considerably overcomes the practical drawbacks imposed by metal stress on plants. This review is an effort to describe mechanism of PSB in supporting and intensifying phytoremediation of heavy metals in soils and to address the developmental status of the current trend in application of PSB in this context.",

    "abstract": "Environmental protection has the foremost importance in the present day life of mankind. Scientists have been researching for technologies naturally available for enhancement of agriculture, management of agricultural waste, etc. Indigenous Microorganisms (IMO’s)-based technology is one such great technology which is applied in the eastern part of world for the extraction of minerals, enhancement of agriculture and waste management. Indigenous microorganisms are a group of innate microbial consortium that inhabits the soil and the surfaces of all living things inside and outside which have the potentiality in biodegradation, bioleaching, biocomposting, nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility and as well in the production of plant growth hormones. Without these microbes, the life will be wretched and melancholic on this lively planet for the survival of human race. That is why, environmental restoration and safeguarding target via the indigenous microbes in a native manner to turn out the good-for-nothing and useless waste into productive bioresources is the primary concern of this review. Based on the collection sites, the process of collection and isolation methods are different as they may vary from place to place. Ultimately, in this way to a meaningful and significant extent, we can bridge the gap between the horrifying environmental distress and the hostile activities that have been constantly provoked by human kind—by getting these indigenous microorganisms into action.",

    "abstract": "Six endophytic fungi were isolated from Cupressus torulosa D.Don and identified phenotypically and genotypically. The fungal cultures were further grown and the culture was extracted by two organic solvents methanol and ethyl acetate. The screening was carried out using the agar well diffusion method against human pathogen such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. Isolated strain of Pestalotiopsis sp. was showing prominent antibacterial activity. The crude methanol and ethyl acetate extract of Pestalotiopsis sp. showed MIC of 6.25 mg/mL for S. typhimurium and S. aureus which showed its efficacy as a potent antimicrobial. The phytochemical screening revealed the existence of a diverse group of secondary metabolites in the crude extracts of the endophytic fungi that resembled those in the host plant extracts. On the basis of phenotypic characteristics and rDNA sequencing of the ITS region of the endophyte was identified as P. neglecta which turned out to be a promising source of bioactive compounds. There is little known about endophytes from C. torulosa D.Don. In this paper we studied in detail the identification of isolated endophytic fungi P. neglecta from C. torulosa D.Don and characterization of its active metabolite compounds. The partially purified second fraction (PPF) extracted from the fungal culture supernatant was subjected to gas chromatography followed by mass spectrometry which revealed the presence of many phytochemicals. These results indicate that endophytic fungi P. neglecta isolated from medicinal plants could be a potential source for bioactive compounds and may find potential use in pharmaceutical industry.",

    "abstract": "A soil bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, isolated from the rhizosphere of Chilli, showed high antagonistic activity against Colletotrichum gloeosporioides OGC1. A clear inhibition zone of 0.5-1 cm was observed in dual plate assay. Microscopic observations showed a clear hyphal lysis and degradation of fungal cell wall. In dual liquid cultures, the B. subtilis strain inhibited the C. gloeosporioides up to 100 % in terms of dry weight. This strain also produced a clear halo region on chitin agar medium plates containing 0.5 % colloidal chitin, indicating that it excretes chitinase. The strain also produced other mycolytic enzymes-glucanase and cellulase, demonstrated by a clear zone of hydrolysis of yeast cell wall glucan (YCW 0.1 % v/v) and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC 0.1 % v/v). In liquid cultures, the strain showed appreciable levels of chitinase, glucanase and cellulase activities and hydrolytic activity with C. gloeosporioides OGC1 mycelia as the substrate. The role of the B. subtilis strain in suppressing the fungal growth in vitro was studied in comparison with a UV mutant of that strain, which lacked both antagonistic and hydrolytic activity. The mycolytic enzyme mediated antagonism of B. subtilis was further demonstrated by heat inactivation (70-100 °C), treatment with trypsin and TCA of the crude enzyme extract which lacked antifungal property also. Treatment of the chilli seeds with Bacillus sp. culture showed 100 % germination index similar to the untreated seeds. The treatment of the seed with co-inoculation of the pathogen with Bacillus sp. culture showed 65 % reduction in disease incidence by the treatment as compared to the seed treated with pathogen alone (77.5 %).",

    "abstract": "In recent times, several foodborne pathogens have become important and a threat to public health. Surveillance studies have provided data and a better understanding into the existence and spread of foodborne pathogens. The application of molecular techniques for detecting and typing of foodborne pathogens in surveillance studies provide reliable epidemiological data for tracing the source of human infections. A wide range of molecular techniques (including pulsed field gel electrophoresis, multilocus sequence typing, random amplified polymorphism deoxyribonucleic acid, repetitive extragenic palindromic, deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing, multiplex polymerase chain reaction and many more) have been used for detecting, speciating, typing, classifying and/or characterizing foodborne pathogens of great significance to humans. Farm animals including chickens, cattle, sheep, goats and pigs, and others (such as domestic and wild animals) have been reported to be primary reservoirs for foodborne pathogens. The consumption of contaminated poultry meats or products has been considered to be the leading source of human foodborne infections. Ducks like other farm animals are important source of foodborne pathogens and have been implicated in some human foodborne illnesses and deaths. Nonetheless, few studies have been conducted to explore the potential of ducks in causing foodborne outbreaks, diseases and its consequences. This review highlights some common molecular techniques, their advantages and those that have been applied to pathogens isolated from ducks and their related sources.",

Five bacterial endophytes were isolated and subsequently tested for minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) against different heavy metals. Amongst the five isolates, strain RM exhibited the highest resistance to copper (750 mg/l), followed by zinc (500 mg/l), lead (450 mg/l), and arsenic (400 mg/l). Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rDNA sequence suggested that strain RM was a member of genus Paneibacillus. Strain RM also had the capacity to produce secondary metabolites, indole acetic acid, siderophores, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase, and biosurfactant and solubilize phosphate. The growth kinetics of strain RM was altered slightly in the presence of metal stress. Temperature and pH influenced the metal removal rate. The results suggest that strain RM can survive under the high concentration of heavy metals and has been identified as a potential candidate for application in bioremediation of heavy metals in contaminated environments.",

    "abstract": "Biogas is a combination of methane, CO2, nitrogen, H2S and traces of few other gases. Almost any organic waste can be biologically transformed into biogas and other energy-rich organic compounds through the process of anaerobic digestion (AD) and thus helping in sustainable waste management. Although microbes are involved in each step of AD, knowledge about those microbial consortia is limited due to the lack of phylogenetic and metabolic data of predominantly unculturable microorganisms. However, culture-independent methods like PCR-based ribotyping has been successfully employed to get information about the microbial consortia involved in AD. Microbes identified have been found to belong mainly to the bacterial phyla of Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Among the archaeal population, the majority have been found to be methanogens (mainly unculturable), the remaining being thermophilic microbes. Thus, the AD process as a whole could be controlled by regulating the microbial consortia involved in it. Optimization in the feedstock, pH, temperature and other physical parameters would be beneficial for the microbial growth and viability and thus helpful for biogas production in AD. Besides, the biogas production is also dependent upon the activity of several key genes, ion-specific transporters and enzymes, like genes coding for methyl-CoM reductase, formylmethanofuran transferase, formate dehydrogenase present in the microbes. Fishing for these high-efficiency genes will ultimately increase the biogas production and sustain the production plant.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Microbial communities in hot springs at high elevations have been extensively studied worldwide. In this sense, the Indian Himalaya regions is valuable ecosystems for providing both the extreme ‘cold’ and ‘hot’ sites for exploring microbial diversity. In the present study, a total of 140 thermophilic bacteria were isolated from 12 samples collected from Manikaran and Yumthang hot springs of Indian Himalayas. The bacterial isolates were studied for phylogenetic profiling, growth properties at varying conditions and potential sources of extracellular thermostable hydrolytic enzymes such as protease, amylase, xylanase and cellulase. Based on production of extracellular hydrolases, 51 isolates from Manikaran (28) and Yumthang thermal springs (23 ) were selected and identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing which included 37 distinct species of 14 different genera namely Anoxybacillus, Bacillus, Brevibacillus, Brevundimonas, Burkholderia, Geobacillus, Paenibacillus, Planococcus, Pseudomonas, Rhodanobacter, Thermoactinomyces, Thermobacillus, Thermonema and Thiobacillus . Out of 51 hydrolase producing bacteria, 24 isolates showed stability at wide range of temperature and pH treatments. In present investigation, three thermotolerant bacteria namely, Thermobacillus sp NBM6, Paenibacillus ehimensis NBM24 and Paenibacillus popilliae NBM68 were found to produced cellulase-free xylanase. These potential extracellular thermostable hydrolytic enzymes producing thermophilic bacteria have a great commercial prospect in various industrial, medical and agriculture applications.",

As food productivity has its limits, the prospecting of unutilized or underutilized flora as food candidates is collectively recognized as a sustainable option. In the past decade, a number of obscure plants have been identified to be rich in dietary components and deemed fit for integration into the food platter. This review discusses a candidate Salicornia, belonging to family Amaranthaceae. This halophyte has a broad geographical distribution, and phytochemical profiling has indicated its food relevance. An array of functional nutrients as fibers, polyphenols, and flavonoids have been detected in Salicornia. Though high salt, oxalate and saponin content in the plants are anti-nutrients, they can be removed to justify usage of Salicornia as a 'sea vegetable'. Apart from culinary relevance, medicinal attributes like immunomodulatory, lipid-lowering, antiproliferative, osteoprotective, and hypoglycemic render this lesser-known marsh plant significant for phytochemical studies. This appraisal is expected to be useful towards further research and popularization of this extremophile halophyte.",

Composting is an age old practice for the biological conversion of organic waste to a humus-like substance which can enhance physical, chemical and biological soil properties. To explore the effect of microorganisms in the composting process, three potent bacterial isolates were selected. Their morphological, cultural and biochemical characteristics were identified, and 16S rDNA studies identified isolates B1U/1 and D3L/1 as Bacillus subtilis and isolate RAT/5 as Pseudomonas sp. Common organic wastes were composted using the selected isolates individually and as a consortium. The C/N ratio of each substrate reduced gradually to 25–30:1 within 120 days and remained constant thereafter. The reduction in NH 4 + and NO 3 − ion concentrations also indicated compost maturity after 120 days. The pH of the mature compost was typically 7.0 ± 0.2, and the PO 4 −3 ion concentration was high throughout the decomposition process. This study describes the optimization of the composting process using a consortium of isolates from composted soil.",

Bamboo is an economically important member of the grass family Poaceae, under the subfamily Bambusoideae. India has the second largest bamboo reserve in Asia after China. It is commonly known as “poor man’s timber”, keeping in mind the variety of its end use from cradle to coffin. There is a wide genetic diversity of bamboo around the globe and this pool of genetic variation serves as the base for selection as well as for plant improvement. Thus, the identification, characterization and documentation of genetic diversity of bamboo are essential for this purpose. During recent years, multiple endeavors have been undertaken for characterization of bamboo species with the aid of molecular markers for sustainable utilization of genetic diversity, its conservation and future studies. Genetic diversity assessments among the identified bamboo species, carried out based on the DNA fingerprinting profiles, either independently or in combination with morphological traits by several researchers, are documented in the present review. This review will pave the way to prepare the database of prevalent bamboo species based on their molecular characterization.",

The use of thermo- and alkali-tolerant bacterial laccases is considered to be important biological alternative to chemical processing. Laccases from Bacillus species have shown promise in this respect but their intracellular/spore bound presence make their industrial application economically unfeasible. We report here on a novel extracellular active thermo-alkali-stable laccase (SN4 laccase) which is active at 90 °C and pH 8.0 using 2,6-dimethoxyphenol as substrate from Bacillus tequilensis SN4. SN4 laccase retained 27 % activity for 5 min at 100 °C and more than 80 % activity for 24 h at 70 °C. The enzyme is also stable at a higher pH (9.0-10.0). Enzyme production was optimized by submerged fermentation. Relatively high yields (18,356 nkats ml-1) of SN4 laccase was obtained in a medium containing 650 μM MnSO4, 350 μM FeSO4, and 3.5 % ethanol. A 764-fold increase in laccase activity was observed under optimal conditions. In addition, reduction in kappa number and increase in brightness of softwood pulp by 28 and 7.6 %, respectively, were observed after treatment with SN4 laccase without a mediator. When N-hydroxybenzotriazole was used as a mediator, the kappa number was decreased to 47 % and brightness was increased to 12 %.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is known to be a multi-step process, which involves different stages including initiation, promotion, progression and metastasis. Chemical carcinogens including most trace elements can change any of these processes to induce their carcinogenic effects. Various studies confirm that cancer arises from the accumulation of irreversible DNA damage, which results from multiple mutations in critical genes in the body organ. Chemical carcinogens most often directly or after xenobiotic metabolism, act as genotoxic causes to induce DNA damage. Genotoxic carcinogen refers to a group of chemicals capable of producing cancer by directly altering the genetic material of target cells. Other carcinogens are however classified as non-genotoxic, which represents chemicals that are capable of producing cancer by some secondary mechanism not related to direct gene damage. They act as tumor promoters, endocrine-modifiers, receptor mediators, immunosuppressant, or inducers of tissue-specific toxicity and inflammatory responses. The diversity of modes of action, of non-genotoxic carcinogens, the tissue and species specificity and the absence of genotoxicity makes it extremely hard to predict their carcinogenic potential. The roles of trace metals (some of which are either genotoxic or non-genotoxic) in cancer development and inhibition have a complex character and have raised many questions because of their essential and toxic effects on people's health. Trace metals such as cadmium, nickel, arsenic, beryllium and chromium (VI) have been recognized as human or animal carcinogens by International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). The Carcinogenic capability of these metals depends mainly on factors such as oxidation states and chemical structures. The oxidative concept in metal carcinogenesis proposes that complexes formed by these metals, in vivo, in the vicinity of DNA, catalyze redox reactions, which in turn oxidize DNA. The most significant effect of reactive oxygen species in the carcinogenesis progression is DNA damage, which results in DNA lesions like strand breaks and the sister-chromatid exchange. This article reviews the carcinogenicity of various trace elements.",

Thermodynamic parameters, Ea, ΔH°, ΔS° and ΔG°, have found to be 62.15, -67.95, -0.068 and -20.05 kJ mol-1 according to the Coats-Redfern equation. Analysis of interaction of 1 with BSA protein was done by using the UV-Vis and FTIR spectroscopic methods. The observed binding constants was 1.12 (±0.09) × 104 M-1. The biological effect of 1 was checked on different plant growth-promoting (PGPR) strains such as Rhizobium leguminosarum, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Arthrobacter citreus, Bacillus brevis and Salmonella typhimurium and compared with parent molecule acephate where 1 has shown less toxicity against PGPRs as compared to acephate. The experimental results for geometric parameters and values of peak position in IR spectra have found to match excellently with the computational studies performed by GAMESS software package. Theoretically, twelve new analogs of 1 were prepared and their comparative reactivity (HOMO-LUMO energy) and biodecomposition (on the basis of polarizability) is discussed.",

In spite of beneficial effects, non-judicious use of pesticides imposes harmful effect on human health as their residues reach different food materials and ground water via leaching, percolation and bioaccumulation. Looking into the potential of microbial degradation of toxic compounds under natural environment, a cypermethrin-degrading Bacillus sp. was isolated from pesticide-contaminated soil of a rice field of Distt. Udham Singh Nagar, Uttarakhand, India. The bacteria degraded the compound up to 81.6 % within 15 days under standard growth conditions (temperature 32 °C pH 7 and shaking at 116 rpm) in minimal medium. Analysis of intermediate compounds of biodegraded cypermethrin revealed that the bacteria opted a new pathway for cypermethrin degradation. GC–MS analysis of biodegraded cypermethrin showed the presence of 4-propylbenzoate, 4-propylbenzaldehyde, phenol M-tert-butyl and 1-dodecanol, etc. which was not reported earlier in cypermethrin metabolism; hence a novel biodegradation pathway of cypermethrin with Bacillus sp. strain SG2 is proposed in this study.",

But the enzymes that possess a significant role in the breakdown of biomass remain relatively unexplored. Thermophilic microorganisms are of special interest as a source of novel thermostable enzymes. Many thermophilic microorganisms possess properties suitable for biotechnological and commercial use. There is, indeed, a considerable demand for a new generation of stable enzymes that are able to withstand severe conditions in industrial processes by replacing or supplementing traditional chemical processes. This manuscript reviews the pertinent role of thermophilic microorganisms as a source for production of thermostable enzymes, factors afftecting them, recent patents on thermophiles and moreso their wide spectrum applications for commercial and biotechnological use.",

The endophytic fungus was identified as Aspergillus versicolor ENT7 based on 18S rRNA gene sequencing (NCBI Accession number KF493864). The AgNPs synthesized were characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), particle size analyzer, and zeta potential measurements. The UV-Vis absorption spectra showed the peak at 429 nm which confirmed the synthesis of AgNPs. TEM analysis revealed that the AgNPs were spherical in shape with 3-40 nm in size; similar results were also obtained by Horiba particle size analyzer with 5-40 nm in size. The synthesized AgNPs were highly stable due to their high negative zeta potential value of -38.2 mV. XRD studies showed (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) planes of the face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice, indicating the crystalline nature of the AgNPs. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the AgNPs showed five circular fringes which were in accordance with XRD data and confirmed the formation of high crystalline nature of AgNPs. FTIR measurements indicated the peaks at 3273, 2925, 1629, 1320, and 1020 cm-1 corresponding to different functional groups possibly involved in the synthesis and stabilization of AgNPs. The synthesized AgNPs exhibited effective free radical scavenging activity with the IC50 value of 60.64 µg/ml. The synthesized AgNPs were found to be highly toxic against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and also showed a very good antifungal activity.",

    "abstract": "Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using nest extract of paper wasp (Polistes sp) was investigated in this work. The AgNPs were characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and evaluated for antibacterial, antifungal, dye degradation, blood anticoagulation, and blood clot dissolution (thrombolytic) activities. The crystalline polydispersed AgNPs with size range of 12.5-95.55 nm absorbed maximally at 428 nm and showed anisotropic structures of sphere, triangle, hexagon, rod, and rhombus. The FTIR data showed prominent peaks at 3426 and 1641 cm-1, which indicate the involvement of phenolics compounds and proteins in the synthesis of AgNPs. The prominence of Ag in the EDX spectra showed that indeed, AgNPs were formed. The AgNPs showed potent antibacterial activities (12-35 mm) against three multi-drug strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella granulomatis. While the growth of Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger was completely suppressed, the AgNPs produced growth inhibition of 75.61 % against Aspergillus fumigatus at 100 µg/ml. Furthermore, the AgNPs degraded malachite green to the tune of 93.1 %. The AgNPs also prevented coagulation of blood, while it completely dissolved preformed blood clots within 5 min showing the potent anticoagulation and thrombolytic activities. This study, which is the first of its kind to use nest extract of paper wasp for the synthesis of nanoparticles, has shown that the biosynthesized AgNPs could be deployed for biomedical and catalytic applications.",

Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) are well known for their antibacterial effect due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Therefore, their release into the environment is expected to raise major concern towards ecotoxicity. In the present study, we have studied the toxic effect of ZnO NPs on Deinococcus radiodurans, which is well known to show extraordinary resistant from the damaging effects of radiation. Result showed that ZnO NPs are significantly internalized into the bacterial cells and induce concentration-dependent toxicity with membrane damage. Genotoxicity studies revealed that ZnO exposure induces significant DNA damage to bacterial cells. All the observations evidenced that ZnO NPs induce significant ROS generation, protein oxidation and DNA damage with concomitant thiol depletion. Further, gene expression analysis showed that several DNA repair genes and metabolic pathway-related genes are downregulated upon ZnO NP exposure, with simultaneous increase in the expression of DNA damage response genes. Thus, the present study on toxicity of ZnO NPs on a model organism, D. radiodurans, inflicts the possible mechanism behind ZnO NP-mediated toxic effects on various other microbial organisms.",

The extracellular extract consisting of mixture of these cyclic lipopeptides exhibited very good emulsification activity as well as excellent emulsion stability. The culture accumulated maximum surfactant up to 48 h of growth during batch fermentation in Luria broth. The emulsion of hexane, heptane and octane prepared using 48-h-old culture supernatant of B. subtilis K1 remained stable up to 2 days while emulsion of four stroke engine oil remained stable for more than a year. The critical micelle concentration of crude lipopeptide biosurfactant extracted by acid precipitation from 48-h-old fermentation broth of B. subtilis K1 was found to be 20.5 μg/mL. The biosurfactant activity was found to be stable at 100 °C for 2 h, over a pH range of 6–12 h and over an NaCl concentration up to 10 % (w/v). The application of biosurfactant on laboratory scale sand pack column saturated with four stroke engine oil resulted in ~43 % enhanced oil recovery, suggesting its suitability in microbially enhanced oil recovery.",

The extracellular laccase was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from copper sulphate induced solid-state fermentation medium by ammonium sulphate precipitation and ion-exchange chromatography. The enzyme was determined to be monomeric protein with an apparent molecular mass of 68,420 kDa, and an isoelectric point (pI) of 3.5. The inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy showed a presence of iron, zinc and copper in the purified enzyme. The absorption spectrum in the range of 200-700 nm showed the maximum absorption at 610 nm characteristic of fungal laccase and corresponding to the presence of type I copper atom. The laccase was stable at different temperatures up to 70 °C and retained 61 % activity at 50 °C. The enzyme reaction was inhibited by cysteine; sodium azide and EDTA. The enzyme oxidized various known laccase substrates, its lowest Km value being for ortho-dianisidine and highest Kcat and Kcat/Km for ABTS. The purified laccase exhibited different pH optima for different substrates. The N-terminal sequence did not show any similarity with N-terminal sequence of other species of genera Pleurotus.",

Enzymes which degrade carrageenans are called k-, ι-, and λ-carrageenases. They all are endohydrolases that cleave the internal β-(1–4) linkages of carrageenans yielding products of the oligo-carrageenans. These enzymes are produced only by bacteria specifically gram negative bacteria. Majority of the marine bacteria produce these enzymes extracellularly and their activity is in wide range of temperature. They have found potential applications in biomedical field, bioethanol production, textile industry, as a detergent additive and for isolation of protoplast of algae etc. A comprehensive information shall be helpful for the effective understanding and application of these enzymes. In this review exhaustive information of bacterial carrageenases reported till date has been done.

    "abstract": "This study investigated simultaneous heavy metals removal and anthracene biodegradation by Rhodococcus opacus at different initial anthracene concentrations in the range 50–200 mg L−1. The heavy metals tested were Fe(III), Cu(II), Zn(II), Cd(II), Ni(II), and Pb(II) at 10 mg L−1 initial concentration: The organism was found to be well capable of removing the heavy metals along with high anthracene biodegradation efficiency. However, anthracene biodegradation rate by the organism was reduced due to these heavy metals. In addition, the heavy metals effect on R. opacus biomass growth followed the order: Cd > Ni > Pb > Cu > Zn > Fe. The total time to anthracene biodegradation increased from 144 to 216 h in the presence of Fe, Zn, Cu, or Pb, and it was up to 240 h in the presence of Cd or Ni. Compared with 70.2% (w/w) lipid accumulation by the bacterium in the absence of these heavy metals, a significant decline in the same was observed in the presence of the different heavy metals. These values were 41.2, 44.1, 52.1, 54.1, 58.6, and 63.1% (w/w) for Cd, Ni, Pb, Cu, Zn, and Fe, respectively. Field emission scanning electron microscopy integrated with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy of the biomass grown in the presence and absence of these heavy metals further confirmed a change in morphology of the bacterium due to the heavy metals. Fourier transmission infrared spectroscopy spectra of the biomass obtained during its growth in the presence and absence of the heavy metals confirmed the involvement of N–H, C–H bend, –CH2–(C=O), C–N stretch, C–H and O–H bending, and –C–Cl groups on the biomass for heavy metal uptake by the bacterium.",

We synthesized Nano curcu by sonication method. The synthesis of Nano curcu was assessed for their solubility in water and by UV–visible spectrophotometry. Further, the nanoparticles were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking and analysis, and zeta potential analysis. In vitro antibacterial activity of Nano curcu was evaluated against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The cream containing Nano curcu was found to be effective against human bacterial pathogens and hence can be used for treatment of bacterial diseases.",

In this study, we used 17 different heat-killed isolates as postbiotics and evaluated their anti-inflammatory potential on the expression of proinflammatory mediators and cellular signaling pathways of murine macrophage, RAW 264.7 cells. Bifidobacterium bifidum MG731 showed the high 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity (90.6%), followed by Bifidobacterium lactis MG741 (59.6%). The Bi. lactis MG741 showed the high ABTS free radical scavenging activity (99.5%), followed by Lactobacillus plantarum MG989 (98.9%), Lactobacillus salivarius MG242 (97.1%), and Bi. bifidum MG731 (96.1%). In addition, Bi. bifidum MG731 showed the lowest nitric oxide production (4.28 µM), followed by B. lactis MG741 (10.80 µM), L. salivarius MG242 (14.60 µM), and L. plantarum MG989 (19.60 µM). The selected strains showed a decreased nitric oxide production via downregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase 2, which were upregulated via LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) including acetic, propionic, and butyric acid were produced by four strains. The Bi. bifidum MG731 showed total SCFAs production (4998.6 µg/g), Bi. lactis MG741 (2613.9 µg/g), L. salivarius MG242 (1456.1 µg/g), and L. plantarum MG989 (630.2 µg/g).

    "abstract": "A variety of multidimensional anthropogenic activities, especially of industrial level, are contaminating our aquatic and terrestrial environments with a variety of metallic and non-metallic pollutants. The metallic and non-metallic pollutants addressed specifically in this review are heavy metals and various compound forms of sulfates, respectively. Direct and indirect deleterious effects of the both types of pollutants to all forms of life are well-known. The treatment of such pollutants is therefore much necessary before their final discharge into the environment. This review summarizes the productive utility of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) for economical and concomitant treatment of the above mentioned wastes. Utilization of agro-industrial wastes and some environmental contaminants including hydrocarbons, as economical growth substrates for SRB, is also suggested and proved efficient in this review. Mechanistically, SRB will utilize sulfates as their terminal electron acceptors during respiration while utilizing agro-industrial and/or hydrocarbon wastes as electron donors/carbon sources and generate H2S. The biogenic H2S will then react vigorously with dissolved metals present in the wastewaters thus forming metal sulfide. The metal sulfide being water insoluble and heavier than water will settle down in the water as precipitates. In this way, three types of pollutants i.e., metals, sulfates and agro-industrial and/or hydrocarbon wastes will be treated simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Emblica officinalis Gaertn. syn. Phyllanthus emblica L., universally known as ‘Amla’ or ‘Aonla’ or ‘Indian gooseberry’, is a popular fruit tree belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae and order Geraniales. It is said to be the very first tree that originated on earth, as claimed by age-old Indian mythology. Almost all parts of the tree i.e., root, bark, leaf, flower, fruit and seed are utilized in Ayurvedic and Unani medicinal formulations to improve the overall digestive process, decrease fever, act as a blood purifier, relieve asthma and cough, improve heart health, etc. This tree contains major secondary metabolites like emblicanin-A and emblicanin-B, and also is an affluent source of vitamin-C. Additionally, some other secondary metabolites like tannins, gallic acid, pyrogallol, and pectin are also present in significant amounts. Conventional propagation has been improved via suitable interventions of agrotechnology both in production and protection areas. However, the rate of propagation remains slower; therefore, attempts have been made for biotechnological advancements on E. officinalis . The present review makes an attempt to highlight the botanical description, geographical distribution, ethnopharmacological importance, conventional propagation and protection of this medicinal tree, describing the in vitro-based plant organ and tissue culture methods like direct and indirect organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis along with interventions of molecular marker-based biotechnology and nanotechnology. Further, the prospect of the yet-to-be-explored biotechnological methods for secondary metabolite enhancement like cell suspension, protoplast culture, genetic transformation, etc. and their potential for enhanced emblicanin production have also been discussed in this appraisal.",

    "abstract": "The Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in outbreak of global pandemic, fatal pneumonia in human referred as Coronavirus Disease-2019 (Covid-19). Ayurveda, the age old practice of treating human ailments in India, can be considered against SARS-CoV-2. Attempt was made to provide preliminary evidences for interaction of 35 phytochemicals from two plants (Phyllanthus amarus and Andrographis paniculata used in Ayurveda) with SARS-CoV-2 proteins (open & closed state S protein, 3CLpro, PLpro and RdRp) through in silico docking analysis. The nucleotide analogue remdesivir, being used in treatment of SARS-CoV-2, was used as a positive control. The results revealed that 18 phytochemicals from P. amarus and 14 phytochemicals from A. paniculata shown binding energy affinity/dock score < − 6.0 kcal/mol, which is considered as minimum threshold for any compound to be used for drug development. Phytochemicals used for docking studies in the current study from P. amarus and A. paniculata showed binding affinity up to − 9.10 kcal/mol and − 10.60 kcal/mol, respectively. There was no significant difference in the binding affinities of these compounds with closed and open state S protein. Further, flavonoids (astragalin, kaempferol, quercetin, quercetin-3-O-glucoside and quercetin) and tannins (corilagin, furosin and geraniin) present in P. amarus have shown more binding affinity (up to − 10.60 kcal/mol) than remdesivir (up to − 9.50 kcal/mol). The pharmacokinetic predictions suggest that compounds from the two plants species studied in the current study are found to be non-carcinogenic, water soluble and biologically safe. The phytochemicals present in the extracts of P. amarus and A. paniculata might have synergistic effect with action on multiple target sites of SARS-CoV-2. The information generated here might serve as preliminary evidence for anti SARS-CoV-2 activity of phytochemicals present from P. amarus and A. paniculata and the potential of Ayurveda medicine in combating the virus.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Drought stress remains one of the most detrimental environmental constraints that hampers plant growth and development resulting in reduced yield and leading to economic losses. Studies have highlighted the beneficial role of carbon-based nanomaterials (NMs) such as multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), graphene, fullerene, and metal-based nanoparticles (NPs) (Ag, Au, Cu, Fe 2 O 3 , TiO 2 , and ZnO) in plants under unfavorable conditions such as drought. NPs help plants cope with drought by improving plant growth indices and enhancing biomass. It improves water and nutrient uptake and utilization. It helps retain water by altering the cell walls and regulating stomatal closure. The photosynthetic parameters in NP-treated plants reportedly improved with the increase in pigment content and rate of photosynthesis. Due to NP exposure, the activation of enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants has reportedly improved. These antioxidants play a significant role in the defense system against stress. Studies have reported the accumulation of osmolytes and secondary metabolites. Osmolytes scavenge reactive oxygen species, which can cause oxidative stress in plants. Secondary metabolites are involved in the water retention process, thus improving plant coping strategies with stress. The deleterious effects of drought stress are alleviated by reducing malondialdehyde resulting from lipid peroxidation. Reactive oxygen species accumulation is also controlled with NP treatment. Furthermore, NPs have been reported to regulate the expression of drought-responsive genes and the biosynthesis of phytohormones such as abscisic acid, auxin, gibberellin, and cytokinin, which help plants defend against drought stress. This study reviewed 72 journal articles from 192 Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and PubMed papers. In this review, we have discussed the impact of NP treatment on morphological, physio-biochemical, and molecular responses in monocot and dicot plants under drought conditions with an emphasis on NP uptake, transportation, and localization.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Durability and affordability are two main reasons for the widespread consumption of plastic in the world. However, the inability of these materials to undergo degradation has become a significant threat to the environment and human health To address this issue, bioplastics have emerged as a promising alternative. Bioplastics are obtained from renewable and sustainable biomass and have a lower carbon footprint and emit fewer greenhouse gases than petroleum-based plastics. The use of these bioplastics sourced from renewable biomass can also reduce the dependency on fossil fuels, which are limited in availability. This review provides an elaborate comparison of biodegradation rates of potential bioplastics in soil from various sources such as biomass, microorganisms, and monomers. These bioplastics show great potential as a replacement for conventional plastics due to their biodegradable and diverse properties.",

In this study, we provide a critical review of methods for extracting, purifying, characterizing, and estimating the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of endophytic fungi metabolites. While many endophytes produce metabolites similar to those found in plants with established symbiotic associations, we also highlight the existence of novel metabolites with potential scientific interest. Additionally, we discuss how advancements in nanotechnology have opened new avenues for exploring nanoformulations of endophytic metabolites in future studies, offering opportunities for diverse biological and industrial applications.",

    "abstract": "It has been reported that phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB) are the most promising bacteria among the plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR); which may be used as biofertilizers for plant growth and nutrient use efficiency. Moreover, these soil micro-organisms play a significant role in regulating the dynamics of organic matter decomposition and the availability of plant nutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and other nutrients. Through this study, the management of nutrient use efficiency by the application of PSB was targeted in order to make the applied nutrients more available to the plants in the rice (Oryza sativa) and yardlong bean (Vigna unguiculata) cultivation. Results have shown that the treatments with PSB alone or in the form of consortia of compatible strains with or without the external application of chemical NPK gave more germination index (G. I.) from 2.5 to 5 in rice and 2.7 to 4.8 in bean seeds. They also showed a higher growth in both shoot and root length and a higher biomass as compared to the control. This gives us an idea about the potentiality of these PSB strains and their application in rice and yardlong bean cultivation to get a better harvest index. Their use will also possibly reduce the nutrient runoff or leaching and increase in the use efficiency of the applied fertilizers. Thus, we can conclude that the NPK uptake and management can be improved by the use of PSB in rice and yardlong bean cultivation, and their application may be much more beneficial in the agricultural field.",

However, the residues such as grape wastes are potential source of phenolic compounds which are widely known for their high antioxidant activity. Bioprocesses such as enzyme technology represent an alternative for production of those bioactive compounds from agro-industrial byproducts. In this study, different types of commercial enzymes such as Celluclast® 1.5 L, Pectinex® Ultra and Novoferm® were used to release phenolic compounds from grape wastes. The hydrolysates were analyzed in their total phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity with Folin–Ciocaletu test and DPPH· radical-scavenging assay, respectively. A good correlation was obtained between antioxidant activity and phenolics released. The highest antioxidant activities registered were 86.8 ± 0.81, 82.9 ± 0.31 and 90 ± 0.37 % at 12 h for Celluclast® 1.5 L, Pectinex® Ultra and Novoferm®, respectively. Novoferm® had the strongest effect on phenolic release from grape waste, followed by Pectinex® Ultra and Celluclast® 1.5 L. High performance liquid chromatography–electrospray–mass spectrometry clearly revealed that the increment of antioxidant activity is associated with the release of O-coumaric acid.",

Interestingly, fish by-products provide an excellent nutrient source for microbial growth useful in enzyme production process, which is largely governed by the cost related to the growth media. Fish wastes (heads, viscera, chitinous material, wastewater, etc.) were prepared and tested as growth substrates for microbial enzymes production such as protease, lipase, chitinolytic and ligninolytic enzymes. This new approach described in this review can reduce environmental problems associated with waste disposal and, simultaneously, lower the cost of microbial enzyme production.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to assess the antibacterial efficacy of lactobacilli isolated from curd and human milk samples. Identities of thirty-one different lactobacilli (20 from curd and 11 from human milk) were confirmed by genus-specific PCR and 16S rRNA-based sequencing. These strains belonged to five species, Lactobacillus casei, L. delbrueckii, L. fermentum, L. plantarum, and L. pentosus. Antibacterial activities of cell-free supernatants (CFSs) of all the Lactobacillus isolates were estimated through standard agar-well diffusion assay, against commonly occurring food-borne and clinically important human pathogens. None of the lactobacilli cell-free supernatant (CFS) exhibited inhibitory activity against four pathogens, namely Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Bacillus cereus, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, and Shigella flexneri were moderately inhibited by majority of CFSs, whereas, weak activity was observed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. CFS of some of the curd isolates displayed antagonistic activity against Streptococcus mutans; however, human milk lactobacilli did not displayed any inhibitory activity against them. As expected, Nisin (Nisaplin®) showed inhibitory activity against Gram-positive, S. aureus, B. cereus, and L. monocytogenes. Interestingly, few of the examined CFSs exhibited inhibitory activities against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. Findings from this study support the possibility to explore the tested lactobacilli and their CFSs as natural bio-preservatives, alone or in combination with approved bacteriocins in food and pharma formulations after validating their safety.",

Effect of these two NPs on plant physiology, reactive oxygen scavenging enzyme system (ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase), proline content and lipid peroxidation has been estimated in leaves as well as root tissues. Bioaccumulation of NPs has also been evaluated in the current study and the interrelated cascade of the enzymatic system with H2O2 production was identified. The uptake of NPs in plant leaves was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. Plant growth was found to be diminished with elevated levels of CuO NPs whereas TiO2 NPs had shown an opposite effect. The plant species accumulated lower concentration of NPs and displayed considerable tolerance against stress, probably due to well-organized and coordinated defense system at the root and shoot level by the intonation of antioxidative enzymes.",

    "abstract": "Used engine oil (UEO) constitutes a serious environmental problem due to the difficulty of disposal off or reuse. Ten bacterial strains with biodegradation potential were isolated from UEO-contaminated soil sample using enrichment technique. Two strains which exhibited the highest degradation %, 51 ± 1.2 and 48 ± 1.5, respectively, were selected. Based on the morphological, biochemical characteristics and 16S rRNA sequence analysis, they were identified as Ochrobactrum anthropi HM-1 (accession no: KR360745) and Citrobacter freundii HM-2 (accession no: KR360746). The different conditions which may influence their biodegradation activity, including UEO concentration (1–6 %, v/v), inoculum size (0.5–4 %, v/v), initial pH (6–8), incubation temperature (25–45 °C), and rotation speed (0–200 rpm), were evaluated. The optimum conditions were found to be 2 % UEO, 2 % inoculum size, pH 7.5, incubation temperature 37 °C, and 150 rpm. Under the optimized conditions, strains HM-1, HM-2, and their mixture efficiently degraded UEO, they achieved 65 ± 2.2, 58 ± 2.1, and 80 ± 1.9 %, respectively, after 21 days of incubation. Biodegradation of UEO was confirmed by employing gas chromatography analysis. Gamma radiation (1.5 kGy) enhanced the degradation efficiency of irradiated bacterial mixture (95 ± 2.1 %) as compared to non-irradiated (79 ± 1.6 %). Therefore, strains HM-1 and HM-2 can be employed to develop a cost-effective method for bioremediation of used engine-oil-polluted soil.",

Reactors in batch mode resulted in a better performance (4.2 g/L glucose and 16.8 g/L reducing sugar, 75 % yield for both) than fed-batch (3.2 g/L glucose and 14.6 g/L reducing sugar, 65.5 and 73.1 % yield respectively) in 72 h. The addition of Novozyme 188 to the core mixture of Viscozyme L and Celluclast 1.5L resulted in the doubling of glucose released.

Dried and sieved soils were contaminated with 5 ml each of crude oil with replicates and inoculated with earthworms and monitored daily for 12 weeks. Physicochemical parameters such as pH, total organic carbon, sulfate, nitrate, phosphate, sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium were determined using standard procedures. Total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) was determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS), while BTEX constituents and earthworms tissues were analyzed using Gas Chromatography with Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID). The results showed that the earthworm significantly enhanced the physicochemical parameters of the contaminated soil resulting in a decrease of the total organic carbon (56.64 %), sulfate (57.66 %), nitrate (57.69 %), phosphate (57.73 %), sodium (57.69 %), potassium (57.68 %), calcium (57.69 %) and magnesium (57.68 %) except pH (3.90 %) that slightly increased. There was a significant decrease in the TPH (84.99 %), benzene (91.65 %), toluene (100.00 %), ethylbenzene (100.00 %) and xylene (100.00 %). Analyses of the tissues of the earthworm at the end of the experiment showed that the earthworms bioaccumulated/biodegraded 57.35/27.64 % TPH, 38.91/52.73 % benzene, 27.76/72.24 % toluene, 42.16/57.85 % ethylbenzene and 09.62/90.38 % xylene. The results showed that the earthworms H. africanus could be used to bioremediate moderately polluted soil with crude oil contamination in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria.",

In the present study, we have reported a green method for synthesis of SNPs from aqueous stem bark extract of Syzygium alternifolium, an endemic medicinal plant of South Eastern Ghats. These green-synthesised nanoparticles are characterised by colour change pattern, and the broad peak obtained at 448 nm with UV–Vis surface plasmon resonance studies confirm that the synthesised nanoparticles are SNPs. FT-IR spectroscopic studies confirm that phenols and proteins of stem bark extract is mainly responsible for capping and stabilisation of synthesised SNPs. Crystallographic studies from XRD indicates, the SNPs are crystalline in nature owing to 44 nm size. EDAX analysis shows 19.28 weight percentage of Ag metal in the sample indicates the purity of sample. AFM, SEM and TEM microscopic studies reveal that the nanoparticles are spherical in shape with sizes ranging from 4 to 48 nm. Antimicrobial studies of the synthesised SNPs on clinically isolated microbes showed very toxic effects. It indicates that stem bark extract of S. alternifolium is suitable for synthesising stable silver nanoparticles which act as excellent antimicrobial agents.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cell-free extracts of twenty terrestrial cyanobacteria were evaluated for their antioxidant properties in terms of free-radical scavenging (DPPH and ABTS) and metal chelating activity and deoxyribose protection. Extract of Anabaena constricta was the most prominent antioxidant agent (IC 50 for DPPH activity 0.91 mg ml −1 , ABTS 0.23 mg ml −1 , deoxyribose protection 0.63 mg ml −1 and Fe +2 -ion chelating 0.9 mg ml −1 ). The extracts of cyanobacterial species contained high quantity of total phenol and total flavonoid that were supposed to impart prominent antioxidant properties. Cyanobacterial species also showed fairly high PAL activity. We reported varied quantities of polyphenolics gallic, chlorogenic, caffeic, vanillic and ferulic acids and flavonoids rutin, quercetin and kaempferol in cyanobacterial extracts. The presence of these polyphenolics was linked with the free radical scavenging, metal chelating and antioxidative damage protecting properties of the organisms. Cyanobacteria are the most feasible, promising and alternative candidates for searching out new chemical leads for industrial applications in pharmaceuticals, neutraceuticals and biomolecules of importance. Presence of biomolecules such as polyphenolics and their connection with the prominent biological functions (e.g., antioxidant properties) make these organisms a potential source of secondary metabolites with predominant biological activities. Additionally, dominant presence of polyphenols as antioxidant agents in cyanobacterial species may reflect their adaptation strategies against abiotic stresses for their ecological success in different habitats.",

In this study, in vitro regeneration of D. strictus through nodal culture has been attempted. Murashige and Skoog's medium supplemented with 4 mg/l BAP was found to be most effective in shoot regeneration with 3.68 ± 0.37 shoots per explant. The effect of Kn was found to be moderate. These hormones also had considerable effect on the shoot length. The highest shoot length after 6 weeks (3.11 ± 0.41 cm) was noted with 5 mg/l BAP followed by 3.07 ± 0.28 cm with 5 mg/l Kn, while decrease in the shoot length was noted with other treatments. The effect of IBA and NAA individually or in combination at different concentrations on rooting was evaluated. The highest number of root (1.36 ± 0.04) was regenerated on full-strength MS medium supplemented with 3 mg/l NAA, while maximum length of 1.64 ± 0.03 cm of roots was recorded with combination of 1 mg/l IBA and 3 mg/l NAA. Tissue-cultured plants thus obtained were successfully transferred to the soil. The clonal fidelity among the in vitro-regenerated plantlets was assessed by RAPD and ISSR markers. The ten RAPD decamers produced 58 amplicons, while nine ISSR primers generated a total of 66 bands. All the bands generated were monomorphic. These results confirmed the clonal fidelity of the tissue culture-raised D. strictus plantlets and corroborated the fact that nodal culture is perhaps the safest mode for multiplication of true to type plants.",

The enzyme was immobilized successfully on k-carrageenan-alginate gel carrier (CA) with 93 % immobilization yield. The immobilization process significantly improved the enzyme specific activity 2.6-fold compared to the free form. The significant factors influencing the immobilization process such as enzyme protein concentration and loading time were studied. Distinguishable characteristics of optimum pH and temperature, stability at different temperatures and NaCl tolerance for free and immobilized enzyme were studied. The immobilization process improved optimum temperature from 35 to 45 °C. The immobilized enzyme retained 76.70 % of its activity after 2 h at 75 °C compared to complete loss of activity for the free enzyme. The reusability test proved the durability of the CA gel beads for 28 cycles without losing its activity.",

Factors affecting transformation efficiency, such as age of explants, Agrobacterium concentration, and effect of acetosyringone, pre-cultivation, infection and co-cultivation time of Agrobacterium were examined. The pre-cultured hypocotyls from young seedlings prior to exposure to Agrobacterium showed higher shoot regeneration. The plant transformation with the modest A. tumefaciens concentrations (0.8 OD) and the 3 days co-cultivation periods increased transformation efficiency. Plant growth hormones [1-naphthyl acetic acid (NAA) and 6-benzyl amino purine (BAP)] were essential for callus and shoot formation. Root formation was effective in half strength MS medium without supplementation of root-inducing hormones. To maintain selection pressure, plant subculture was carried out every 2 weeks with selective antibiotics. The putative transgenic plants were acclimatized in the greenhouse. Polymerase chain reaction was performed to confirm the integration of T-DNA into the genome of transgenic plants. A transformation efficiency of 15 % was obtained. This protocol allows effective transformation and indirect regeneration of Brassica rapa.",

During the study, the effect of various reactor parameters such as hydraulic retention time (HRT), biogenetic substrate concentration, loading rate, and initial substrate concentration on the removal efficiency of 4-CP was investigated. Bioreactor showed a maximum removal rate of 16.59 mg/L/h at the optimum conditions of 24 h HRT, 400 mg/L initial 4-CP, and 0.2 g/L peptone. The optimum HRT found was 24 h after that the washout occured, and the degradation efficiency almost dropped to 50 % at 18 h HRT. Effect of peptone showed that lower concentration of peptone improves 4-CP removal efficiency of the bioreactor. Also, the mixed consortium had utilized 4-CP as a carbon source, as evidenced by the increasing biomass concentration with 4-CP at constant peptone concentration. The presence of 5-chloro 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde in the reactor infers that the mixed consortium has followed the meta-cleavage pathway for 4-CP degradation.",

    "abstract": "Pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis play a critical role in the economic production of sugars and fuels from lignocellulosic biomass. In this study, we evaluated diverse pilot-scale pretreatments and different post-pretreatment strategies for the production of fermentable sugars from sugarcane bagasse. For the pretreatment of bagasse at pilot-scale level, steam explosion without catalyst and combination of sulfuric and oxalic acids at low and high loadings were used. Subsequently, to enhance the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis of the pretreated bagasse, three different post-pretreatment process schemes were investigated. In the first scheme (Scheme 1), enzymatic hydrolysis was conducted on the whole pretreated slurry, without treatments such as washing or solid–liquid separation. In the second scheme (Scheme 2), the pretreated slurry was first pressure filtered to yield a solid and liquid phase. Following filtration, the separated liquid phase was remixed with the solid wet cake to generate slurry, which was then subsequently used for enzymatic hydrolysis. In the third scheme (Scheme 3), the pretreated slurry was washed with more water and filtered to obtain a solid and liquid phase, in which only the former was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis. A 10 % higher enzymatic conversion was obtained in Scheme 2 than Scheme 1, while Scheme 3 resulted in only a 5–7 % increase due to additional washing unit operation and solid–liquid separation. Dynamic light scattering experiments conducted on post-pretreated bagasse indicate decrease of particle size due to solid–liquid separation involving pressure filtration provided increased the yield of C6 sugars. It is anticipated that different process modification methods used in this study before the enzymatic hydrolysis step can make the overall cellulosic ethanol process effective and possibly cost effective.",

The presence of these functional groups on a carbon matrix conferred on the C-dots the ability to conduct and transfer electrons. Formation of silver nanoparticles from silver nitrate upon addition of C-dots confirmed their reducing ability. DREAM assay using a mixed microbial culture containing C-dots showed a 172% increase in electron transfer activity and thus confirmed the involvement of C-dots in supplementing redox activity of a microbial culture. Addition of C-dots as a suspension in the anode chamber of an MFC resulted in a 22.5% enhancement in maximum power density. C-dots showed better performance as electron shuttles than methylene blue, a conventional electron shuttle used in MFCs.",

To investigate the possibility of phytoplasma etiology, PCR assays were performed using universal primer pairs (P1/P7 followed by 3Far/3Rev) specific to the phytoplasma 16Sr RNA gene. First round PCR amplification with primer pair P1/P7 did not yield expected 1.8 kb product of 16S rRNA region from any of the 17 symptomatic samples. However, 1.3 Kb amplicons were observed in nested PCR assays with 3Far/3Rev primer pair in symptomatic leaf samples of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis L. (Pune isolate), Saponaria officinalis L. (Pune isolate), and Allamanda cathartica L. (Delhi isolate). No amplifications were observed in any of the other tested symptomatic and non-symptomatic plant samples either in first round or second round of nested PCR assays with phytoplasma specific primer pairs. Pairwise sequence comparison of 16S rDNA sequences of the five positive phytoplasma strains of A. catharica, H. rosa-sinensis, and S. officinalis in the present study revealed 99–100% sequence identities with strains of 'clover proliferation' (16SrVI) group. Phylogenetic and virtual RFLP analysis of 16S rDNA sequences of the five identified phytoplasma strains belonging to three ornamental species further confirmed their clustering and grouping with member strains of 'clover proliferation' subgroup D. This is the first record of the phytoplasma association of 'clover proliferation' subgroup D with H. rosa-sinensis, S. officinalis, and A. cathartica in the world.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, a total of 35 S. aureus isolates collected from two different geographical locations viz., Germany and Hungary were tested for their methicillin-resistant phenotype which revealed a high incidence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus. The quantitative test for biofilm production revealed that 73.3% of isolates were biofilm producers. The isolates were further characterized using a set of biochemical and genotypic methods such as amplification and analysis of S. aureus species-specific sequence and mecA gene. The 33 mecA positive isolates were then characterized by the amplification of SCCmec and pvl toxin genes. Further, based on the biofilm-forming phenotype, 15 isolates were selected and characterized through PCR-RFLP of coa gene, polymorphism of spa gene and amplification of biofilm-associated genes. The dendrogram prepared from the results of both biochemical and genotypic analyses of the 15 isolates showed that except for the isolates SA G5 and SA H29, the rest of the isolates grouped themselves according to their locations. Thus, the two isolates were selected for further characterization through whole-genome sequencing. Comparative genome analysis revealed that SA G5 and SA H29 have 97.20% ANI values with 2344 gene clusters (core-genome) of which 16 genes were related to antibiotic resistance genes and 57 genes encode virulence factors. The highest numbers of singleton genes were found in SA H29 that encodes proteins for virulence, resistance, mobile elements, and lanthionine biosynthesis. The high-resolution phylogenetic trees generated based on shared proteins and SNPs revealed a clear difference between the two strains and can be useful in distinguishing closely related genomes. The present study demonstrated that the whole-genome sequence analysis technique is required to get a better insight into the MRSA strains which would be helpful in improving diagnostic investigations in real-time to improve patient care.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Considering the cognitive impairment induced by temozolomide (TMZ) in glioblastoma survivors, the present study was aimed to evaluate the protective effect of dehydrozingerone (DHZ) against TMZ-induced cognitive impairment (chemobrain) and C6 cell line-induced glioma in male Wistar rats. In both chemobrain and glioma models, TMZ was administered at a dose of 18 mg/kg i.v every 5th day and DHZ at a dose of 100 mg/kg p.o. daily. Additionally, glioma was induced by intracerebral injection of 5 × 10 4 C6 rat glioma cells in the cortex in the glioma model. Upon disease induction and treatment with TMZ + DHZ, spatial memory was assessed by the Morris water maze (MWM) test and episodic memory by the novel object recognition test (NORT). The induction of glioma was confirmed by histology of the cortex. Hippocampus and frontal cortex were subjected to antioxidant evaluation. Significant loss of spatial and episodic memory was observed with TMZ treatment which was significantly restored by DHZ. DHZ showed significant improvement in oxidative stress markers reversed the histopathological features in the cortex. TMZ-induced elevation of the glutathione level was also reversed by DHZ, indicating the role of DHZ in the reversal of TMZ resistance. In the glioma model, the improvement in cognition by DHZ correlated with the decrease in tumor volume. Altogether, the study results reveal the role of TMZ in worsening the memory and DHZ in reversing it, besides, improving its anticancer potential.",

    "abstract": "Abstract An investigation was carried out to identify and characterize the phytoplasma and viruses associated with the chickpea varieties showing severe stunting, leaf reddening, yellowing and phyllody symptoms during the summer season of 2018–2019 and 2019–2020 in eight states of India. The average disease incidence was recorded from 3 to 32% in different states. The presence of chickpea chlorotic dwarf virus (CpCDV) was confirmed in thirty-seven chickpea samples by amplification of CpCDV coat protein gene and sequence comparison analysis. No record of association of luteovirus, polerovirus and cucumovirus could be detected in any of the symptomatic chickpea samples by RT-PCR assay. Brassica nigra , B. juncea, Lens culinaris , two weeds ( Heteropogan contartus, Aeschynomene virginica ) and one leafhopper ( Amarasca biguttula ) were identified as new putative hosts for CpCDV. Association of peanut witches’ broom phytoplasma was confirmed in twenty-eight chickpea samples, Sesamum indicum , five weeds hosts and two leafhopper species ( Exitianus indicus, Empoasca motti ) using nested PCR assays with primer pairs P1/P7 and R16F2n/R16Rn. The results of phytoplasma association in plants and leafhopper samples were further validated by using five multilocus genes ( sec A, rp, imp, tuf and sec Y) specific primers. Sequence comparison, phylogenetic and virtual RFLP analysis of 16S rRNA gene and five multilocus genes confirmed the identity of association of 16SrII-C and 16SrII-D subgroups of phytoplasmas strain with chickpea samples collected from Andhra Pradesh (AP), Telangana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and New Delhi. Mixed infection of phytoplasma (16SrII-D) and CpCDV was also detected in symptomatic chickpea samples from AP and Telangana. The reports of association of 16SrII-C subgroup phytoplasma in chickpea and 16SrII-D subgroup phytoplasma in C. sparsiflora and C. roseus are the new host records in world and from India, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The post-coronavirus disease (COVID-19) mucormycosis is a deadly addition to the pandemic spectrum. Although it's a rare, aggressive, and opportunistic disease, the associated morbidity and mortality are significant. The complex interplay of factors aggravating CAM is uncontrolled diabetes, irrational and excessive use of antibiotics, steroids, and an impaired immune system. Recently, India has been witnessing a rapid surge in the cases of coronavirus disease-associated mucormycosis (CAM), since the second wave of COVID-19. The devastating and lethal implications of CAM had now become a matter of global attention. A delayed diagnosis is often associated with a poor prognosis. Therefore, the rapid and early diagnosis of infection would be life-saving. Prevention and effective management of mucormycosis depend upon its early and accurate diagnosis followed by a multimodal therapeutic approach. The current review summarizes an array of detection methods and highlights certain evolving technologies for early and rapid diagnosis of CAM. Furthermore, several potential management strategies have also been discussed, which would aid in tackling the neglected yet fatal crisis of mucormycosis associated with COVID-19.",

Identification of potent inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 NSP12 (RNA polymerase) were screeened from FDA approved drugs by virtual screening for therapeutic applications in treatment of COVID-19. In this study, virtual screening of 1749 antiviral drugs was executed using AutoDock Vina in PyRx software. Binding affinities between NSP12 and drug molecules were determined using Ligplot+ and PyMOL was used for visualization of docking between interacting residues. Screening of 1749 compounds resulted in 14 compounds that rendered high binding affinity for NSP12 target molecule. Out of 14 compounds, 5 compounds which include 3a (Paritaprevir), 3d (Glecaprevir), 3h (Velpatasvir), 3j (Remdesivir) and 3l (Ribavirin) had a binding affinity of − 10.2 kcal/mol, −9.6 kcal/mol, − 8.5 kcal/mol, − 8.0 kcal/mol and − 6.8 kcal/mol, respectively. Moreover, a number of hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding between these 5 compounds and NSP12 active site were observed. Further, 3l (Ribavirin) was docked with 6M71 and molecular dynamic simulation of the complex was also performed to check the stability of the conformation. In silico analysis postulated the potential of conventional antiviral drugs in treatment of COVID-19. However, these finding may be further supported by experimental data for its possible clinical application in present scenario.",

    "abstract": "Immobilization is a key technology that improves the operational stability of enzymes. In this study, alginate-gelatin (Alg-Gel) hydrogel matrix was synthesized and used as immobilization support for Mucor racemosus lipase (Lip). Enzyme catalyzed ultrasound-assisted hydrolysis of olive oil was also investigated. Alg-Gel matrix exhibited high entrapment efficiency (94.5%) with a degradation rate of 42% after 30 days. The hydrolysis of olive oil using Alg-Gel-Lip increased significantly (P < 0.05) as compared to free Lip. Optimum pH and temperature were determined as pH 5.0 and 40 °C, respectively. The Vmax values for free and immobilized Lip were determined to be 5.5 mM and 5.8 mM oleic acid/min/ml, respectively, and the Km values were 2.2 and 2.58 mM/ml respectively. Thermal stability was highly improved for Alg-Gel-Lip (t1/2 650 min and Ed 87.96 kJ/mol) over free Lip (t1/2 150 min and Ed 23.36 kJ/mol). The enzymatic activity of Alg-Gel-Lip was preserved at 96% after four consecutive cycles and 90% of the initial activity after storage for 60 days at 4 °C. Alg-Gel-Lip catalyzed olive oil hydrolysis using ultrasound showed a significant (P < 0.05) increase in hydrolysis rate compared to free Lip (from 0.0 to 58.2%, within the first 2 h). In contrast to traditional methodology, using ultrasonic improved temperature-dependent enzymatic catalyzed reactions and delivered greater reaction yields. Results suggest that Alg-Gel-Lip biocatalyst has great industrial application potential, particularly for free fatty acid production. In addition, the combined use of enzyme and ultrasound has the potential of eco-friendly technology.",

    "abstract": "The degradation of C.I. Direct red 80, a polyazo dye, was investigated using Bacillus firmus immobilized by entrapment in tubular polymeric gel. This bacterial strain was able to completely decolorize 50 mg/L of C.I. Direct red 80 under anoxic conditions within 12 h and also degrade the reaction intermediates (aromatic amines) during the subsequent 12 h under aerobic conditions. The tubular gel harboring the immobilized cells consisted of anoxic and aerobic regions integrated in a single unit which was ideal for azo dye degradation studies. Results obtained show that effective dye decolorization (97.8%), chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction (91.7%) and total aromatic amines removal were obtained in 15 h with the immobilized bacterial cell system whereas for the free cells, a hydraulic residence time of 24 h was required for an equivalent performance in a sequential anoxic and aerobic process. Repeated-batch experiments indicate the immobilized cells could decolorize C.I. Direct red 80 and reduce medium COD in five successive batch runs with enhanced activity obtained after each consecutive run, thus suggesting its stability and potential for repeated use in wastewater treatment. UV-visible spectrophotometry and HPLC analysis were used to confirm the partial mineralization of the dye. Data from this study could be used as a reference for the development of effective industrial scale biotechnological process for the removal of dyes and their metabolites in textile wastewater.",

Although protein structures often provide clues about the biological function of a target, once the three-dimensional structures have been determined, bioinformatics and proteomics-driven strategies can be employed to derive their biological activities and physiological roles. This article reviews the current status of SP methods for the structure determination pipeline, including target selection, isolation, expression, purification, crystallization, diffraction data collection, structure solution, refinement and functional annotation.",

Compared to unoptimized conditions [2,154 U/gds (Unit per gram of dry substrate)], the optimization process resulted in a 17.3-fold increase in laccase production (37,423 U/gds). The laccase produced was evaluated for its potential to decolorize a recalcitrant synthetic dye, malachite green. Laccase at dosage of 30 U/ml in presence of 1 mM of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT) almost completely decolorized 100 and 200 mg/l of malachite green in 16 and 20 h, respectively, at 30 °C, pH 5.5 and 150 rpm. While, higher dyes concentrations of 300, 400 and 500 mg/l were decolorized to 72, 62 and 55 % in 24, 28 and 32 h, respectively, under similar conditions. Furthermore, it was observed that the decolorized malachite green was less toxic towards the growth of five white-rot fungi tested viz. Crinipellis sp. RCK-1, Ganoderma sp. rckk-02, Coriolopsis Caperata RCK 2011, Phanerochaete chrysosporium K3 and Pycnoporous cinnabarinus PB.

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus, a natural inhabitant of nasopharyngeal tract, survives mainly as biofilms. Previously we have observed that S. aureus ATCC 12600 grown under anaerobic conditions exhibited high rate of biofilm formation and l-lactate dehydrogenase activity. Thus, the concentration of pyruvate plays a critical role in S. aureus, which is primarily catalyzed by pyruvate kinase (PK). Analyses of the PK gene sequence (JN645815) revealed presence of PknB site in PK gene indicating that phosphorylation may be influencing the functioning of PK. To establish this hypothesis the pure enzymes of S. aureus ATCC 12600 were obtained by expressing these genes in PK 1 and PV 1 (JN695616) clones and passing the cytosolic fractions through nickel metal chelate column. The molecular weights of pure recombinant PK and PknB are 63 and 73 kDa, respectively. The enzyme kinetics of pure PK showed K M of 0.69 ± 0.02 µM, while the K M of PknB for stpks (stpks = NLCNIPCSALLSSDITASVNCAK) substrate was 0.720 ± 0.08 mM and 0.380 ± 0.07 mM for autophosphorylation. The phosphorylated PK exhibited 40 % reduced activity (PK = 0.2 ± 0.015 μM NADH/min/ml to P-PK = 0.12 ± 0.01 μM NADH/min/ml). Elevated synthesis of pyruvate kinase was observed in S. aureus ATCC 12600 grown in anaerobic conditions suggesting that the formed pyruvate is more utilized in the synthesis phase, supporting increased rate of biofilm formation.",

    "abstract": "Viral diseases affecting sweetpotato are the most devastating and cause up to 98 % yield loss. In this paper, we report, meristem culture, graft transmission and virus indexing for management of viral pathogens in seven elite sweetpotato cultivars. Plantlets were developed in vitro from the apical meristematic dome with one to two leaf primordia. Mericlones were grafted on virus-sensitive indicator plant Ipomoea setosa and no viral disease symptoms were seen on I. setosa leaves in most cases. This indicates that no viruses translocated from meristem-derived scions to the virus-sensitive root stock. On the other hand, most of the non-tested traditional planting material induced distinct disease symptoms upon grafting, which revealed the presence of one or more viruses in it. About 85 % of mericlones recovered from 0.3–0.5 mm size meristem were tested as virus free, whereas it is difficult to culture meristems smaller than 0.3 mm due to dissection damage and too small a size. Virus-tested mericlones were further micropropagated and transferred to the field. Only few plants were found to be diseased in the R1 field trial. Root yield in the R2 generation was increased significantly when compared with non-tested control plants. During field exposure, only a low percentage of healthy plants were found infected with viruses when managed in a net house. This implies that viral vectors were present during the growing season and reinfection could be effectively reduced by net house management. We concluded that this low-cost technique of producing virus-tested planting material would significantly boost the yield through efficient removal of yield-reducing pathogens.",

The endophytic bacterium was tested for minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) against As. The endophytic strain RPT exhibited the highest resistance to As(V) (400 mg/l). Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA sequence suggested that strain RPT was a member of genus Citrobacter. The As transformation assay revealed As(III) oxidation and As(V) reduction potential of Citrobacter sp. RPT. The As resistance mechanism was further confirmed by amplification of arsC and aoxB genes. The growth kinetics of strain RPT was altered slightly in the presence of different concentration (100-400 mg/l) of As stress. Temperature and pH influenced the As removal rate. The maximum As removal was observed at pH 7.0 (74%) and 37 °C (70.9%). The results suggest that strain RPT can survive under the As stress and has been identified as a potential candidate for application in bioremediation of As in contaminated environments.",

The impact of different culture media on biosynthesis of antimicrobial metabolites was tested by disc diffusion assay. Polyketide synthase gene (PKS) of the endophytic fungus was investigated using three pairs of degenerate primers LC1-LC2c, LC3-LC5c and KS3-KS4c by PCR. TLC-bioautography method was employed to detect the antimicrobial metabolites. Antimicrobial metabolites fractionated with ethyl acetate extract showed significant antimicrobial activity against the test bacteria and fungi. Biosynthesis of antimicrobial metabolites was optimum as depicted by zone of inhibition from ethyl acetate extract cultured in potato dextrose broth. Strain CBR-15 was identified as Phomopsisliquidambaris and PKS genes of the fungus were amplified with LC3-LC5c and KS3-KS4c sets of degenerate primers. These findings suggest that endophytic P.liquidambaris CBR-15 harbor iterative type I fungal PKS gene domain which indicates the biosynthetic potential of endophytic fungi as producers of natural antimicrobial metabolites. The study also demonstrates the utilization and optimization of different culture media which best supports for the biosynthesis of the antimicrobial metabolites from P.liquidambaris.",

    "abstract": "While lignocellulosic biomass excels as a cheap, renewable resource for biofuel production, it does present some challenges such as generation of microbial inhibitory compounds. The mode of selective inhibition of acetone–butanol–ethanol (ABE) production (as opposed to cell growth) by syringaldehyde on Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 was examined. C. beijerinckii 8052 grown in syringaldehyde-supplemented P2 medium had a comparable growth rate (μ = 0.34) at acidogenic growth phase to that of C. beijerinckii 8052 grown in control P2 medium (μ = 0.30). The addition of syringaldehyde into P2 medium inhibited solvent production by C. beijerinckii 8052 and increased butyric and acetic acid accumulation in the fermentation broth. Analysis of coenzyme A transferase (CoAT) using cell-free extracts of C. beijerinckii 8052 showed decreased expression and activity in the presence of syringaldehyde. These results indicate that C. beijerinckii 8052 CoAT is negatively affected by syringaldehyde and thus, hampers the ability of the microorganism to metabolize butyric and acetic acid for ABE production as evidenced by the accumulation of butyric and acetic acid in the fermentation broth.",

    "abstract": "Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is an acute infection which involves the upper respiratory tract: nose, sinuses, tonsils and pharynx. URT infections are caused mainly by pathogenic bacteria like Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus. Conventionally, β-lactam antibiotics are used to treat URT infections. Penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) catalyze the cell wall synthesis in bacteria. β-Lactam antibiotics like Penicillin, Cephalosporins, Carbapenems and Monobactams inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding with PBPs. Pathogenic bacteria have efficiently evolved to resist these β-lactam antibiotics. New generation antibiotics are capable of inhibiting the action of PBP due to its new and peculiar structure. New generation antibiotics and Penicillin derivatives are selected in this study and virtually compared on the basis of interaction studies. 3-Dimensional (3D) interaction studies between Lactivicin, Cefuroxime, Cefadroxil, Ceftaroline, Ceftobiprole and Penicillin derivatives with PBPs of the above-mentioned bacteria are carried out. The aim of this study was to suggest a potent new generation molecule for further modification to increase the efficacy of the drug for the URTI.",

    "abstract": "Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) is an ancient oilseed crop known for its nutty seeds and high-quality edible oil. It is an unexplored crop with a great economic potential. The present study deals with assessment of genetic diversity in the crop. Twenty two RAPD and 18 SSR primers were used for analysis of the 47 different sesame accessions grown in different agroclimatic zones of India. A total of 256 bands were obtained with RAPD primers, of which 191 were polymorphic. SSR primers gave 64 DNA bands, of which all of were polymorphic. The Jaccard's similarity coefficient of RAPD, SSR, and pooled RAPD and SSR data ranged from 0.510 to 0.885, 0.167 to 0.867, and 0.505 to 0.853, respectively. Maximum polymorphic information content was reported with SSRs (0.194) compared to RAPDs (0.186). Higher marker index was observed with RAPDs (1.426) than with SSRs (0.621). Similarly, maximum resolving power was found with RAPD (4.012) primers than with SSRs (0.884). The RAPD primer RPI-B11 and SSR primer S16 were the most informative in terms of describing genetic variability among the varieties under study. At a molecular level, the seed coat colour was distinguishable by the presence and absence of a group of marker amplicon/s. White and brown seeded varieties clustered close to each other, while black seeded varieties remained distanced from the cluster. In the present study, we found higher variability in Sesamum indicum L. using RAPD and SSR markers and these could assist in DNA finger printing, conservation of germplasm, and crop improvement.",

Magnetosomes have been exploited for a broad range of biomedical and biotechnological applications. Due to their enormous potential in the biomedical field, its safety assessment is necessary. Detailed research on the toxicity of the magnetosomes was not studied so far. This study focuses on the toxicity assessment of magnetosomes in various models such as Human RBC’s, WBC’s, mouse macrophage cell line (J774), Onion root tip and fish ( Oreochromis mossambicus ). The toxicity in RBC models revealed that the RBC’s are unaltered up to a concentration of 150 µg/ml, and its morphology was not affected. The genotoxicity studies on WBC’s showed that there were no detectable chromosomal aberrations up to a concentration of 100 µg/ml. Similarly, there were no detectable morphological changes observed on the magnetosome-treated J774 cells, and the viability of the cells was above 90% at all the tested concentrations. Furthermore, the magnetosomes are not toxic to the fish ( O. mossambicus ), as no mortality or behavioural changes were observed in the magnetosome-treated groups. Histopathological analysis of the same reveals no damage in the muscle and gill sections. Overall, the results suggest that the magnetosomes are safe at lower concentration and does not pose any potential risk to the ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Several technologies are being applied for treatment of palm oil mill wastes. Among them, the biological treatments (vermicomposting) have widely been recognized as one of the most efficient and eco-friendly methods for converting organic waste materials into valuable products. The present study focuses on vermicomposting of acidic palm oil mill effluent (POME) mixed with the palm pressed fibre (PPF) which are found difficult to decompose in the environment. The industrial waste (POME) was vermicomposted using Lumbricus rubellus under laboratory conditions for a period of 45 days. A significant improvement in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium content was monitored during vermicomposting process. In addition, the decline in C:N ratio of vermicompost (up to 17.20 ± 0.60) reflects the degree of stabilization of POME–PPF mixture. Different percentages of the vermicompost extract obtained from POME–PPF mixture were also examined for the germination of mung bean ( Vigna radiata) seed. The results showed that 75% vermicompost extract demonstrated better performance for the seed germination. On the basis of significant findings, POME–PPF mixture can be successfully used as a feeding material for the earthworms, while on the other hand, it can also be used as a cost-effective fertilizer for the germination and the proper growth of mung bean.",

    "abstract": "Glutenin is a major protein fraction contributing to the functional properties of gluten and dough. The glutenin constitutes 30-40% of the protein in wheat flour and about half of that in gluten. It is essential to identify correct glutenin alleles and to improve wheat quality by selecting alleles that exert favorable effects. Moroccan wheat cultivars are unique in West Asia and North Africa region, since many of them possess resistance to Hessian fly, a pest, which is becoming important in other countries in the region. Hence, these cultivars are being used as donor for the resistance in the breeding program. Here, we determine the allelic variation in high-molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) and low-molecular weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS) in Moroccan cultivars of bread and durum wheat using the gene-specific PCR markers. In 20 cultivars of bread wheat, 9 different allele variants were detected at HMW-GS and 13 different allele variants were detected at LMW-GS, in which the alleles Glu-A1b (2*), Glu-B1i (17 + 18), Glu-B1c (7*/7 + 9), Glu-D1d (5 + 10), Glu-A3c, Glu-B3 h, and Glu-D3b were the most frequents. In 26 cultivars of durum wheat, less allelic variation was found: seven different allele variants at HMW-GS and six different allele variants at LMW-GS were identified, in which the major alleles were Glu-A1c (null), Glu-B1b (7 + 8), Glu-B1e (20), Glu-A3c, and Glu-B3d. The mean value of the genetic diversity for the glutenin loci was 0.502 in bread wheat and 0.449 in durum wheat. Most of the glutenin alleles carried by Moroccan bread wheat cultivars impart good bread-making quality. Most of the durum wheat glutenin alleles were related to low strength dough or poor quality and need to be improved. To improve quality of Moroccan durum wheat, essentially, Glu-A1c and Glu-B3d alleles of the genes should be replaced with the better alleles through breeding.",

Because of increasing demand of the drug, this plant species has been over-exploited. As a consequence, many unrelated plants are being sold by the crude drug dealers in India in the name of “Shankhpushpi”. Information on its existing gene pool is currently lacking. We developed molecular (Random Amplification of Polymorphic DNA) and chemical (high performance liquid chromatography) markers that could distinguish the genuine plant species from its adulterants. Molecular characterization confirmed higher genetic variation at inter-zonal level as compared to intra-zonal populations. A total of 37 reproducible amplicons were generated of which 22 were polymorphic. The number of amplicons was in the range of 6–11 and genetic distance for the studied primers ranged from 0.07 to 0.34. Fifty nine per cent polymorphism was obtained across different geographical locations. Dendrogram studied through unweighted pair group method of arithmetic analysis differentiated all the genotypes into two major clusters, Cluster I had the single population of Rajasthan and Cluster II was represented by genotypes of Delhi, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. The Kaempferol content ranged from 0.07 to 0.49 mg/g and Delhi population was the highest accumulator.",

    "abstract": "Strain tolerance to toxic metabolites remains an important issue in the production of biofuels. Here we examined the impact of overexpressing the heterologous groESL chaperone from Clostridium acetobutylicum to enhance the tolerance of Escherichia coli against several stressors. Strain tolerance was identified using strain maximum specific growth rate (μ) and strain growth after a period of solvent exposure. In comparison with control strain, the groESL overexpressing strain yielded a 27 % increase in growth under 0.8 % (v/v) butanol, a 9 % increase under 1 % (v/v) butanol, and a 64 % increase under 1.75 (g/l) acetate. Moreover, after 10 h, groESL overexpression resulted in increase in relative tolerance of 58 % compared with control strain under 0.8 % (v/v) butanol, 56 % increase under 1 % (v/v) butanol, 42 % increase under 1 % (v/v) isobutanol, 36 % increase under 4 % (v/v) ethanol, 58 % increase under 1.75 (g/l) acetate. These data demonstrate that overexpression of the groESL from C. acetobutylicum in E. coli increased tolerance to several stressors. Solvent tolerant strain of E. coli was developed to be used as a basic strain for biofuel production.",

The present study delineates functional responses of two thermophilic SRB species (Desulfotomaculum reducens-HA1 and Desulfotomaculum hydrothermale-HA2) to toxic metals. Bacterial activity was assessed in terms of sulphate reduction and metal precipitation employing four concentrations (1, 5, 10 and 15 ppm) of three dissolved toxic metals (Cu, Cr and Ni) independently. Both sulphidogenic bacterial species showed results in a very narrow range of fluctuations. In general, bioprecipitation and sulphate reduction were pronounced at lower concentrations (1 and 5 ppm) and got inhibited at higher concentrations (10 and 15 ppm). The order of precipitation and sulphate reduction for the subject metals was Ni > Cr > Cu. The findings of this study will be helpful in developing economical and environmental friendly bioremediation process(es) tending to operate at extreme conditions around the concentrations in indicated suitable metals-loaded effluents.",

In all, 253 alleles were identified using 77 polymorphic SSRs, and polymorphism information content ranged from 0.31 to 0.97 with a mean of 0.79. Cluster analysis grouped the genotypes into three clusters at a genetic similarity of 0.26–0.75. Wild accessions grouped together in cluster-I, indica cultivars formed cluster-II, and aromatic, japonica and aus types came under cluster-III. Principal component analysis also showed similar results. The genotypic data was analyzed using STRUCTURE, and genotypes were grouped into four populations. RM1018 on chromosome 4, RM8009 on chromosome 7, and RM273 on chromosome 12 amplified alleles specific to wild accessions. The information obtained from core set markers would help in selecting diverse parents including wild accessions and for tracking alleles in mapping or breeding populations.",

The specific activity of the purified CGTase was 45 U/mg compared to crude 0.9 U/mg. This resulted in a 50-fold purification of the enzyme with 33 % yield. The molecular weight of the purified enzyme was found to be 27.72 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE. Non-denaturing gel electrophoresis and activity staining confirmed the presence of CGTase in crude and the ammonium sulfate precipitate fraction. The purified CGTase has a pI value of 4.2. The optimum pH of 6.0 and 60 °C temperature were found to be the best for CGTase activity. Purified CGTase showed 5.18 kcal/mol activation energy (Ea). The CGTase activity was increased in the presence of metal ions (5 mM): Ca+2 (130 %), Mg+2 (123 %), Mn+2 (119 %) and Co+2 (116 %). The enzyme activity was strongly inhibited in the presence of Hg+2 (0.0 %), Cu+2 (0.0 %) and Fe+2 (3.8 %). Inhibitor N-bromosuccinimide (5 mM) showed the highest 96 % inhibition of CGTase activity. SDS and triton X-100 among different detergents and surfactants (1.0 %, w/v) tested showed 92 % inhibition. Among the organic solvents checked for their effect on enzyme activity, 5 % (v/v) toluene resulted in 48 % increased activity. Polyethylene glycol-6000 showed a 26 % increase in the CGTase activity.

Developments in cotton genome sequencing and assembly provide powerful tools for dissecting the genetic and molecular bases of agronomically important traits and establishing regulatory networks on these processes, which leads to molecular breeding. Here, we briefly review these advances, emphasizing their implications in the genetic improvement of cotton with a particular focus on fiber quality and yield.

    "abstract": "Xanthine oxidase is a key enzyme responsible for hyperuricemia, a pre-disposing factor for Gout and oxidative stress-related diseases. Only two clinically approved xanthine oxidase inhibitors Allopurinol and Febuxostat are currently used for treatment of hyperuricemia. However, owing to their side effects there is a need for new non-purine-based selective inhibitors of xanthine oxidase. In the process of exploring novel xanthine oxidase inhibitors and anti-oxidants, we screened the culture filtrate of 07 novel species of Muscodor, a sterile endophytic fungi isolated from Cinnamomum and Aegle marmelos. Chloroform extract of M. darjeelingensis exhibited the maximum xanthine oxidase inhibition in the qualitative and quantitative assays. The IC50 of chloroform extract of M. darjeelingensis was 0.54 µg/ml which was much lower to Allopurinol but higher when compared to Febuxostat. 88% reduction in uric acid production was recorded by M. darjeelingensis chloroform extract which was similar to allopurinol. The maximum anti-oxidant activity was exhibited by M. indica against the gallic acid standard in the DPPH-free radical assay. Anti-oxidant activity index of M. indica was 7.7, which was followed by M. kashayum with 5.4. M. darjeelingensis exhibited a moderate anti-oxidant activity with anti-oxidant activity index of 1.63 in the DPPH assay. The present study is the very first report of Muscodor species exhibiting xanthine oxidase inhibitory and anti-oxidant activity together. Chloroform extract of M. darjeelingensis and M. indica stand out as potential candidates for isolation and characterization of the xanthine oxidase inhibitor and anti-oxidant compound, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Response surface methodology was used to enhance the production of α-galactosidase from Fusarium moniliforme NCIM 1099 in solid-state fermentation. Plackett-Burman design was employed for selection of critical media constituents which were optimized by central composite rotatable design. Wheat bran, peptone and FeSO4·7H2O were identified as significant medium components using PB design. Further CCRD optimized medium components as wheat bran; 4.62 μg, peptone; 315.42 μg, FeSO4·7H2O; 9.04 μg. RSM methodological optimization increased the enzyme production from 13.17 to 207.33 U/g showing 15.74-fold enhancement. The α-galactosidase was purified by 70% fractionation followed by DEAE anion exchange column chromatography which yields 23.33% with 28.68-fold purification. The molecular weight of α-galactosidase was 57 kDa which was determined by SDS-PAGE analysis. Purified enzyme has optimum pH of 4.0 and was found to be stable in wide pH range of 3.0-9.0. Its optimum temperature was 50 °C, whereas its activity remains above 50% up to 2 h at 75 °C. Hg2+ was found to be a potent inhibitor and Mg2+ acted as an activator of enzyme. No significant change was observed in enzyme activity for galactose concentration, ranging from 1 to 100 mM. The K m values of enzyme for substrates p-nitrophenyl-α-D-galactopyranoside, melibiose and raffinose were 0.20, 1.36, and 3.66 mM, respectively. Low K m and stability to various physiological conditions of enzyme represents its potential which can be exploited in various industrial applications.",

    "abstract": "Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) being an eco-friendly bioinsecticide is effectively used in pest management strategies and, therefore, isolation and identification of new strains effective against a broad range of target pests is important. In the present study, new indigenous B. thuringiensis strains were isolated and investigated so that these could be used as an alternative and/or support the current commercial strains/cry proteins in use. For this, 159 samples including soil, leaf and spider webs were collected from ten districts of Kashmir valley (India). Of 1447 bacterial strains screened, 68 Bt strains were identified with 4 types of crystalline inclusions. Crystal morphology ranking among the Bt strains was spherical (69.11%) > spore attached (8.82%) > rod (5.88%) = bipyramidal (5.88%) > spherical plus rod (4.41%) > spherical plus bipyramidal (2.94%) = cuboidal (2.94%). SDS-PAGE investigation of the spore-crystal mixture demonstrated Bt strains contained proteins of various molecular weights ranging from 150 to 28 kDa. Insecticidal activity of the 68 indigenous Bt strains against Spodoptera litura neonates showed that Bt strain SWK1 strain had the highest mortality. Lepidopteron active genes (cry1, cry2Ab, cry2Ab) were present in six Bt strains. Further, analysis of a full-length cry2A gene (~1.9 kb) by PCR-RFLP in strain SWK1 revealed that it was a new cry2A gene in Bt strain SWK1 and was named as cry2Al1 (GenBank Accession No. KJ149819.1) using the Bt toxin nomenclature ( http://www.btnomenclature.info ). Insect bioassays with neonate larvae of S. litura and H. armigera showed that the purified Cry2Al1 is toxic to S. litura with LC50 2.448 µg/ml and H. armigera with LC50 3.374 µg/ml, respectively. However, it did not produce any mortality in third instar larvae of Aedes aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus and Anopheles stephensi larvae/pupae insects (100 µg/ml) at 28 ± 2 °C and 75 to 85% relative humidity under a photoperiod of 14L:10D.",

Mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) linked to SDS help developing resistant soybean germplasm through molecular marker-assisted selection strategy. QTL for SDS presented herein are from a high-density SNP-based genetic linkage map of MD 96-5722 (a.k.a 'Monocacy') by 'Spencer' recombinant inbred line using SoySNP6K Illumina Infinium BeadChip genotyping array. Ninety-four F5:7 lines were evaluated for 2 years (2010 and 2011) at two locations (Carbondale and Valmeyer) in southern Illinois, USA to identify QTL controlling SDS resistance using disease index (DX). Composite interval mapping identified 19 SDS controlling QTL which were mapped on 11 separate linkage group (LG) or chromosomes (Chr) out of 20 LG or Chr of soybean genome. Many of these significant QTL identified in one environment/year were confirmed in another year or environment, which suggests a common genetic effects and modes of the pathogen. These new QTL are useful sources for SDS resistance studies in soybean breeding, complementing previously reported loci.",

A multiplex PCR protocol has been developed for the simultaneous, specific and rapid identification of R. solanacearum and X. perforans in plant materials. Species-specific primers RS-F-759 and RS-R-760 for R. solanacearum, RST2 and RST3 for X. perforans were used for identification of both pathogens at primer concentrations of 1:4 by optimization of multiplex PCR at annealing temperature of about 61 ± 1 °C. With these primer sets, specific amplification of 281- and 840-bp PCR products was obtained for R. solanacearum and X. perforans, respectively. The multiplex PCR assay was validated with susceptible plants mechanically inoculated with both the pathogens; specific PCR products confirmed the presence of R. solanacearum and X. perforans. The multiplex PCR is valuable in identification as well as primary screening of cultivars of both pathogens. The present study is a rapid and easy method for early identification of pathogens from asymptomatic and symptomatic plant materials.",

Among tested methods of immobilization, co-cross-linking method with bovine serum albumin was superior to the other methods in terms of sensitivity, limit of detection, response time, and operating and thermal stability. Biosensor response reached steady state within 3 min and exhibited maximum activity at 45 °C and pH 6.8. The sensitivity of the ortho-substituted phenols for the test biosensor developed with co-cross-linking method of immobilization using bovine serum albumin as the protein-based stabilizing agent was in the order: 2-aminophenol > guaiacol(2-methoxyphenol) > catechol(2-hydroxyphenol) > cresol(2-methyl phenol) > 2-chlorophenol. Validation of the newly developed biosensor by comparison with HPLC showed good agreement in the results. A newly developed biosensor was applied for quantification of ortho-substituted phenols in simulated effluent samples.",

Despite huge pharmacological potential, the reprogramming of aconites production is limited due to lack of understanding on their biosynthesis. To address this problem, we have proposed here the complete atisine biosynthetic pathway for the first time connecting glycolysis, MVA/MEP, serine biosynthesis and diterpene biosynthetic pathways. The transcript profiling revealed phosphorylated pathway as a major contributor towards serine production in addition to repertoire of genes in glycolysis (G6PI, PFK, ALD and ENO), serine biosynthesis (PGDH and PSAT) and diterpene biosynthesis (KO and KH) sharing a similar pattern of expression (2-4-folds) in roots compared to shoots vis-à-vis atisine content (0–0.37 %). Quantification of steviol and comparative analysis of shortlisted genes between roots of high (0.37 %) vs low (0.14 %) atisine content accessions further confirmed the route of atisine biosynthesis. The results showed 6-fold increase in steviol content and 3–62-fold up-regulation of all the selected genes in roots of high content accession ascertaining their association towards atisine production. Moreover, significant positive correlations were observed between selected genes suggesting their co-expression and crucial role in atisine biosynthesis. This study, thus, offers unprecedented opportunities to explore the selected candidate genes for enhanced production of atisine in cultivated plant cells.",

The bacterium reduced Cr(VI) up to 86 % in a 60-day trial of incubation in the soil bioreactor. The nitrogenase activity of the bacterium yielded up to 486 nmol of ethylene/mL/h after an incubation period of 40 days when it was optimally cultured in growth medium at neutral pH and 30 °C. Although the nitrogen-fixing ability of the bacterium reduced significantly in the presence of 1000 ppm of Cr(VI), yet, the bacterium was proved to be a potential bio-fertilizer for enhancing nitrogen contents of the contaminated soil even under the higher chromium stress, together with the metal reduction. In the biologically treated soil, higher values of wheat growth variables were achieved. Application of metal-resistant B. megaterium-ASNF3 in selected situations rendered chromium-laden soils arable with significant increment in crop-yield parameters.",

    "abstract": "Artemisinin and its derivatives are still one of the most effective drugs for the treatment of malaria. Artemisia pallens commonly known as Dhavanam, is an aromatic herb belonging to the family Asteraceae. Increasing the artemisinin content of A. pallens by genetic engineering would improve the availability of this much needed drug. In the present study, Agrobacterium rhizogenes (strain NCIM 5140) mediated genetic transformation of Artemisia pallens were carried out for hairy root induction. The effect of different media (Half MS, MS, MS along with BAP 0.5 mg/l and MS along with Kinetin 0.5 mg/l) and type of explants (leaf and stem) on hairy root induction and culture were also studied. Maximum transformation efficiency (70.0 %) was observed in case of stem explants when it was co-cultivated with Agrobacterium rhizogenes and kept on half strength MS media. Artesunate is a derivative of artemisinin, was quantified using HPLC from dried aerial extract and hairy roots. The content of artesunate in hairy roots was increased up to twofold as compared to aerial part of Artemisia pallens. The maximum amount of artesunate found in hairy roots was 5.62 ± 0.16 μg/g of dry weight. Apart from artesunate the other phytochemicals like alkaloids, polyphenols, and flavonoids are important because they impart the medicinal properties in this plant. Therefore, we have also quantified total alkaloids, flavonoids and polyphenolic content in the aerial part of the plants. The total alkaloids and flavonoids content were found 1.72 ± 0.00 mg/g dry weight in aqueous extract and 3.8 ± 0.00 mg/g in methanolic extract in terms of colchicine and rutin equivalents, respectively. Similarly, total phenolic content is 3.70 ± 0.01 mg/g in ethanolic extract in terms of tannic acid equivalent.",

    "abstract": "Sweet sorghum bagasse (SSB) from food processing and agricultural industry has attracted the attention for uses in production of biofuel, enzymes and other products. The alteration in lignocellulolytic enzymes by use of supplements in fungal pretreatment of SSB to achieve higher lignin degradation, selectivity value and enzymatic hydrolysis to fermentable sugar was studied. Fungal strain Coriolus versicolor was selected for pretreatment due to high ligninolytic and low cellulolytic enzyme production resulting in high lignin degradation and selectivity value. SSB was pretreated with supplements of veratryl alcohol, syringic acid, catechol, gallic acid, vanillin, guaiacol, CuSO4 and MnSO4. The best results were obtained with CuSO4, gallic acid and syringic acid supplements. CuSO4 increased the activities of laccase (4.9-fold) and polyphenol oxidase (1.9-fold); gallic acid increased laccase (3.5-fold) and manganese peroxidase (2.5-fold); and syringic acid increased laccase (5.6-fold), lignin peroxidase (13-fold) and arylalcohol oxidase (2.8-fold) resulting in enhanced lignin degradations and selectivity values than the control. Reduced cellulolytic enzyme activities resulted in high cellulose recovery. Enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated SSB yielded higher sugar due to degradation of lignin and reduced the crystallinity of cellulose. The study showed that supplements could be used to improve the pretreatment process. The results were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric/differential thermogravimetric analysis of SSB.",

    "abstract": "The present study documents a simultaneous production and comparative assessment of extracted vasicinone from in vivo (leaves and stems) and in vitro (leaves, stems and calli) plant parts of Adhatoda vasica Nees, a well-known medicinal plant. High-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) analysis of the above-mentioned plant parts, collected at their 60-day-old growth stage, was performed via methanolic extraction and with the aid of toluene:butanol:butyl acetate (9:0.5:0.5; v/v/v) solvent system. The method was validated with the help of aluminium sheet precoated with silica gel 60 F254 TLC plates, following the ICH guidelines in order to maintain accuracy, precision and repeatability. Correlation coefficient, limit of detection and limit of quantification values were found to be reasonable. The outcome revealed a linearity that ranged between 2 and 6 µg/spot. During the comparison of estimated vasicinone quantity from in vivo and in vitro plant parts, it was evident that in vitro samples produced relatively higher vasicinone than that of the in vivo counterparts. Maximum vasicinone (6.402 ± 0.010% of dry weight) production was quantified from in vitro leaves followed by calli (5.222 ± 0.092% of dry weight) and in vitro stems (2.007 ± 0.041% of dry weight). On the other hand, in vivo leaves and stems produced comparatively lower quantities of vasicinone (2.412 ± 0.139 and 1.933 ± 0.046% of dry weight, respectively) suggesting the in vitro clonal propagation as a superior approach in comparison to in vivo propagation. Nonetheless, simultaneous production from both the sources (in vivo and in vitro plant parts) provides a new avenue for augmented production of vasicinone.",

    "abstract": "Primers having suboptimal amplification efficiencies were shown to falsely represent fold change expression of the N-methyltransferases gene family involved in caffeine biosynthesis in Coffea canephora. To study this phenomenon, the role of stability of the internal reference gene, as well as the amplification efficiency correction of the primers was investigated. GAPDH and Ubiquitin exhibited a good stability for studying the ontogeny of endosperm tissue, as well as the leaf transcriptome during stress from salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, PEG-mediated drought and sudden exposure to light. Ubiquitin manifested low variation in Cq under all these stress regimes and in endosperm ontogeny with 30.1–30.9 in the best dataset and 28.8–30.9 in the most deviating dataset. It was observed that problems arising due to improper amplification efficiency of the target or reference genes or both could lead to misinterpretation of gene expression levels. Quantitative RT-PCR performed at a sub-optimal efficiency of GAPDH reference gene at 1.68 led to the faulty interpretation of 2.007 folds upregulation by the 2−ΔΔCt method and 1.705 folds upregulation by Efficiency method for the first NMT (Xanthosine methyltransferase), which actually is repressed during dark acclimatization of coffee plants. Efficiency correction improved the reliability of the expression data and also indicated a downregulation of this gene by 0.485 folds and 0.474 folds using 2−ΔΔCt and E method, respectively, in concordance to earlier reports. Hence, efficiency correction of the primers having suboptimal efficiencies is an absolute prerequisite for the accurate calculation of fold change using quantitative RT-PCR.",

    "abstract": "Azole antifungal agents are widely used as active ingredients in antifungal pharmaceuticals and agricultural fungicides. An increase in the use of azole antifungals has resulted in an increase in the concentration of these compounds in wastewater and surface water, with potential implications for agriculture. In the present study, bifonazole (BIF) and clotrimazole (CTZ) were selected for investigation because of their widespread use in topical formulations and persistence in the environment. The mycoremediation capacity of BIF and CTZ by mycelia of Lentinula edodes in in vitro culture was evaluated. The main aim of this study was to identify the presumable biodegradation products of the investigated active pharmaceutical substances using the LC/MS/MS method. For this purpose, the media were enriched with the following active pharmaceutical ingredients selected for this study: BIF powder, CTZ powder, and BIF cream, each of them at the same concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. Subsequently, thin-layer chromatography coupled with densitometry was used to evaluate the content of BIF and CTZ in mycelium from in vitro cultures of L. edodes. The degradation process was found to affect primarily the imidazole moiety of both investigated compounds. In addition, the amounts of undegraded investigated compounds were found to be 4.98, 9.26, and 4.56 mg/g dry weight for BIF powder, CTZ powder, and BIF cream, respectively. Therefore, the findings of this study revealed that L. edodes could be considered for remediation of pollution caused by azole antifungal agents.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A detailed understanding of the fate of xenobiotics introduced into the environment and the mechanisms involved in their biotransformation, biodegradation, and biosorption is essential to improve the efficiency of remediation techniques. Mycoremediation is a form of bioremediation technique that has become increasingly popular in recent years as fungi are known to produce various effective extracellular enzymes that have the potential to neutralize a wide variety of xenobiotics released into the environment. Hence, mycoremediation appears to be a promising technique for the removal of a wide array of toxins and pharmaceutical residues from a damaged environment and wastewater. This study primarily aimed to investigate whether white-rot fungus ( Lentinula edodes ) can be utilized for the bioremediation of common antifungal agent terbinafine, which is mainly available in the market as powder or cream. The cultures of L. edodes were cultivated in the medium containing terbinafine powder or terbinafine 1% cream, each at a final concentration of 0.1 mg mL −1 . The addition of terbinafine in powder form have a negative effect on biomass growth ( p &lt; 0.05). The total amount of terbinafine in the dry weight of mycelium after culture was estimated to be 7.63 ± 0.45 mg and 12.52 ± 2.46 mg for powder and cream samples, respectively. In addition, there were no traces of terbinafine in any of the samples of medium used for culturing L. edodes after the experimental duration period. The biodegradation products of terbinafine were identified for the first time using UPLC/MS/MS. The biodegradation of terbinafine resulted in the loss of 1-naphthylmethanol, which occurred via oxidative deamination, N -demethylation, or tert-butyl group hydroxylation. The results of the study demonstrate that L. edodes mycelium can be effectively used for the remediation of terbinafine.",

    "abstract": "Lignocellulosic biomasses, exhibit resistance to enzymatic hydrolysis due to the presence of lignin and hemicellulose. Ionic liquids proved their applicability in lignin degradation, however, ionic liquid removal has to be performed to proceed to hydrolysis. Therefore, this study reports an in situ hydrolysis of empty fruit bunches (EFB) that combined an ionic liquid (IL) pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis. For enzyme production, palm kernel cake (PKC) was used as the primary media for microbial cellulase (PKC-Cel) from Trichoderma reesei (RUTC30). The obtained enzyme exhibited a promising stability in several ionic liquids. Among few, in choline acetate [Cho]OAc, PKC-Cel retained 63.16 % of the initial activity after 6 h and lost only 10 % of its activity in 10 % IL/buffer mixture. Upon the confirmation of the PKC-Cel stability, EFB was subjected to IL-pretreatment followed by hydrolysis in a single step without further removal of the IL. The findings revealed that choline acetate [Cho]OAc and choline butyrate [Cho]Bu were among the best ILs used in the study since 0.332 ± 0.05 g glucose/g and 0.565 ± 0.08 g total reducing sugar/g EFB were obtained after 24 h of enzymatic hydrolysis. Compared to the untreated EFB, the amount of reducing sugar obtained after enzymatic hydrolysis increased by three-fold in the case of [Cho]OAc and [Cho]Bu, two-fold with [EMIM]OAc and phosphate-based ILs whereas the lowest concentration was obtained in [TBPH]OAc. Pretreatment of EFB with [Cho]OAc and [Cho]Bu showed significant differences in the morphology of EFB samples when observed with SEM. Analysis of the lignin, hemicellulose and hemicellulose showed that the total lignin content from the raw EFB was reduced from 37.8 ± 0.6 to 25.81 ± 0.35 % (w/w) upon employment of [Cho]OAc in the compatible system. The PKC-Cel from T. reesei (RUTC30) exhibited promising characteristics that need to be investigated further towards a single-step process for bioethanol production.",

    "abstract": "The present work demonstrates the participation of polyamines (PAs) to improve direct regeneration and Agrobacterium-mediated transformation in soybean half-seeds. The inclusion of PAs to culture medium along with optimal plant growth regulators (PGRs) enhanced shoot induction [98.3 %; 4.44 µM N6-benzyladenine (BA) and 103.27 µM spermidine] and elongation [90.0 %; 1.45 µM gibberellic acid (GA3) and 49.42 µM spermine]. The polyamine putrescine (62.08 µM) alone greatly enriched root induction (96.3 %). The influence of PAs on transformed plant production was assessed by comparing optimized protocol (comprising PAs and PGRs) with a regeneration system involving only PGRs. Plant transformation was performed in half-seeds of cultivar DS 97–12 using strain EHA105 harboring pCAMBIA1301. Transgene expression and integration was confirmed by GUS staining, PCR, and Southern hybridization. The transformed explants/materials successively cultured on co-cultivation (BA and spermidine), shoot induction (BA and spermidine), shoot elongation (GA3 and spermine), and rooting medium (putrescine) showed enhanced transformation efficiency (29.3 %) compared with its counterparts (14.6 %) with respective PGR alone [BA, GA3, or indole-3-butyric acid (IBA)]. Overall findings of the study suggest that involvement of PAs improved T-DNA transfer during co-cultivation, and delivered most suitable condition for efficient regeneration/survival, which led to enhanced transformation efficiency in soybean.",

Maximum xylitol productivity (0.576 g L−1 h−1) was obtained at pH 4.0, agitation 300 rpm and aeration 1.5 vvm by rotating simplex method.

The candidate bacterium was isolated from the marine sediment of Manakudi coast and identified as A. faecalis APCMST-MKW6. The purified protease showed 16.39-fold purity, 70.34 U/mg specific activity with 21.67 % yield. The molecular weight of the purified alkaline protease was 49 kDa. This purified protease registered maximum activity at pH 9 and it was stable between pH 8–9 after 1.30 h of incubation. The optimum temperature registered was 60 °C and it was stable between 50 and 60 °C even after 1.30 h of incubation. This enzyme also showed maximum activity at 20 % NaCl concentration. Further, manganese chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride and barium chloride influenced this enzyme activity remarkably and it was also found to be enhanced by many of the tested surfactants and solvents. The candidate bacterium effectively deproteinized the shrimp shell waste compared to the other tested crustaceans shell wastes and also attained maximum antioxidant activity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The red-necked longhorn beetle Aromia bungii (Faldermann, 1835) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) is native to east Asia, where it is a major pest of cultivated and ornamental species of the genus Prunus . Morphological or molecular discrimination of adults or larval specimens is required to identify this invasive wood borer. However, recovering larval stages of the pest from trunks and branches causes extensive damage to plants and is timewasting. An alternative approach consists in applying non-invasive molecular diagnostic tools to biological traces (i.e., fecal pellets, frass). In this way, infestations in host plants can be detected without destructive methods. This paper presents a protocol based on both real-time and visual loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), using DNA of A. bungii extracted from fecal particles in larval frass. Laboratory validations demonstrated the robustness of the protocols adopted and their reliability was confirmed performing an inter-lab blind panel. The LAMP assay and the qPCR SYBR Green method using the F3/B3 LAMP external primers were equally sensitive, and both were more sensitive than the conventional PCR (sensitivity &gt; 10 3 to the same starting matrix). The visual LAMP protocol, due to the relatively easy performance of the method, could be a useful tool to apply in rapid monitoring of A. bungii and in the management of its outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "Microalgae are photoautotrophic organisms in freshwater systems known to uptake and bioremediate arsenic, a heavy metal. In this study, we compared the growth and arsenic uptake of two microalgae strains, Nostoc and Chlorella, to determine their suitability for arsenic bioremediation. As compared to the control, our results showed that treatment with As (III) enhanced the Nostoc growth by approximately 15% when grown in the absence of phosphate. The highest bioconcentration factor of Nostoc at this treatment was 1463.6, whereas 0.10 mg L-1 As (V) treatment improved the Chlorella growth by 25%, in the presence of phosphate. However, arsenic uptake reduced from 175.7 to 32.3 throughout the cultivation period for Chlorella. This suggests that Nostoc has an upper advantage in the bioremediation of arsenic as compared to the Chlorella strain. To gain insights into the potential of Nostoc in arsenic bioremediation, we further conducted SEM analysis on the vegetative cell surface. The SEM results showed that As (III) disrupted the Nostoc vegetative cell surface and structure. Further to this, pathway analysis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were conducted to identify the potential arsenic pathway regulated by Nostoc. The primary As (III)-related pathways elucidated include the arsA transporter and arsD complex that require ATP and As (III) methylation to S-adenosylmethionine. The phosphate deficiency condition resulting in the inability to generate ATP caused As (III) could not be excreted from the Nostoc cells, potentially contributing to the high arsenic concentration accumulated under phosphate-depleted conditions. These insights contribute to understanding the efficacy of microalgae strains in freshwater arsenic bioremediation.",

The cells of strain RH04-3(T) were straight to slightly curved, sporulating, Gram-positive rods (2.0-5.0 × 1.0 μm) that grew optimally at 50 °C (temperature growth range between 37 and 55 °C) and at pH 7 (pH growth range of 5.0 and 8.5). Growth was inhibited by NaCl concentrations ≥1.5% (w/v), and by chloramphenicol, streptomycin, tetracycline, penicillin and ampicillin. The strain utilized fructose, mannose, glycerol, lactate, pyruvate and H(2) in the presence of sulfate, and fermented pyruvate in the absence of sulfate. Strain RH04-3(T) reduced sulfate, sulfite, thiosulfate and elemental sulfur, but not nitrate, nitrite, iron(III), arsenate(V), vanadium(V) or cobalt(III) as terminal electron acceptors. The G + C content of DNA was 52.4 ± 0.8 mol % as determined by the thermal denaturation (Tm) method. 16S rRNA sequence analysis indicated that strain RH04-3(T) was a member of the genus Desulfotomaculum and was most closely related to Desulfotomaculum putei (similarity value of 95.2%) and Desulfotomaculum hydrothermale (similarity value of 93.6%). On the basis of phylogenetic and phenotypic characteristics, strain RH04-3(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Desulfotomaculum, for which the name Desulfotomaculum varum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain RH04-3(T) = JCM 16158(T) = KCTC 5794(T).",

Fructose was used as the sole carbon source in the fermentation media. Optimization of fermentation parameters and reliable mathematical models were used for the maximum production of rapamycin from Streptomyces hygroscopicus MTCC 4003. The experimental data for microbial production of rapamycin fitted well with the proposed mathematical models. Kinetic parameters were evaluated using best fit unstructured models, viz. Andrew's model, Monod model, Yano model, Aiba model. Andrew's model showed a comparatively better R2 value (0.9849) among all tested models. The values of maximum specific growth rate (μmax), saturation constant (KS), inhibition constant (Ki), and growth yield coefficient (YX/S) were found to be 0.008 (h-1), 2.835 (g/L), 0.0738 (g/L), and 0.1708 (g g-1), respectively. The optimum production of rapamycin was obtained at 300 rpm agitation and 1 vvm aeration rate in the fermentor. The final production of rapamycin in shake flask was 539 mg/L. Rapamycin titer found in bioreactor was 1,316 mg/L which is 52 % higher than the latest maximum value reported in the literature.",

    "abstract": "The synergistic interaction between various hemi/cellulolytic enzymes has become more important in order to achieve effective and optimal degradation of complex lignocellulose substrates for biofuel production. This study investigated the synergistic effect of three enzymes endoglucanase (EngE), mannanase (ManA) and xylanase (XynA) on the degradation of corn stalk, grass, and pineapple fruit pulp and determined the optimal degree of synergy between combinations of these enzymes. It was established that EngE was essential for degradation of all of the substrates, while the hemicellulases were able to contribute in a synergistic fashion to increase the activity on these substrates. Maximum specific activity and degree of synergy on the corn stalk and grass was found with EngE:XynA in a ratio of 75:25%, with a specific activity of 41.1 U/mg protein and a degree of synergy of 6.3 for corn stalk, and 44.1 U/mg protein and 3.4 for grass, respectively. The pineapple fruit pulp was optimally digested using a ManA:EngE combination in a 50:50% ratio; the specific activity and degree of synergy achieved were 52.4 U/mg protein and 2.7, respectively. This study highlights the importance of hemicellulases for the synergistic degradation of complex lignocellulose. The inclusion of a mannanase in an enzyme consortium for biomass degradation should be examined further as this study suggests that it may play an important, although mostly overlooked, role in the synergistic saccharification of lignocellulose.",

Standard isolation technique was modified for rapid and quick extraction of RNA, and lentil tissue most appropriate to extract good quality RNA was determined. The concentration of the phenol blocker polyvinylpyrrolidone in the extraction buffer was determined, DNase I was added to eliminate chromosomal DNA and the timing of this step was optimized. RNA up to 568 μg of RNA from 1 g of tissue was isolated from four different tissues of lentil in less than half the time typically required by reported methods. The method avoids the use of toxic phenol–chloroform, hazardous guanidinium thiocyanate (GTC) and laborious CsCl ultracentrifugation. Absorbance A260/A280 ratio of 1.9 and A260/A230 ratio of 2.7 reveal RNA to be of high purity.

One appealing exploitation route is the production of biogas by anaerobic digestion. Interestingly, despite the compositional differences between seaweed and lignocellulosic biomass, available data indicate that conditions and inocula traditionally used for the latter may work well for seaweed. To gain more insight into the underlying microbial processes, we have generated 16S rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing data to comparatively describe microbial communities in biogas digesters containing either the seaweed Saccharina latissima or wheat straw. The seaweed digesters gave better biogas yield and a higher relative abundance of core group Methanosaeta-affiliated Archaea. Conversely, variation in biomass had only minor abundance effects towards dominant bacterial lineages and influenced only low-abundant bacterial OTUs. Affiliations between dominant archaeal and bacterial phylotypes described here and previously identified anaerobic digestion core groups indicate that trends are beginning to emerge within these newly explored microbial ecosystems, the understanding of which is currently impeded by limited published datasets.",

These clumps of plants growing on a wide range of host plants have been traditionally regarded as medicinal repositories. However, current scientific discoveries have validated their health potentials like never before. Their extracts containing alkaloids, viscotoxins, lectins, and polysaccharides have been evidenced to possess a myriad biological potentials including cancer inhibition. Mistletoes have emerged as promising alternative therapy against colon, oral, lung, and pancreas cancers. The plant extracts bolster immunity, delay tumour initiation and progression, kill malignant tumours, stabilize DNA, alleviate side effects of chemotherapeutics, improve the lifespan, and coping ability of cancer patients and survivors. A range of proprietary formulations viz. Iscador, Eurixor, Helixor, Lektinol, Isorel, Iscucin, Abnoba-viscum and recombinant lectin ML-1 are already being commercialized.

The xylanase rapidly hydrolyzed xylan directly to xylose without the production of intermediary xylo-oligosaccharides within 15 min of incubation under optimum conditions. This trait of rapidly degrading xylan to xylose as a sole end-product could have biotechnological potential in degradation of agro-wastes for bioethanol manufacturing industry.",

Among the various amino acids and TCA cycle intermediates tested 2 mM L-aspartic acid and 5 mM citric acid gave ε-PL yield of 145.5 and 230 mg/L, respectively. A combination of citric acid after 24 h and L-aspartic acid after 36 h improved ε-PL yield from 85 mg/L (control) to 335 mg/L.

Previous reports of genetic deficiency for this protein have described severe chylomicronemia. Comparative GPIHBP1 amino acid sequences and structures and GPIHBP1 gene locations were examined using data from several mammalian genome projects. Mammalian GPIHBP1 genes usually contain four coding exons on the positive strand. Mammalian GPIHBP1 sequences shared 41-96% identities as compared with 9-32% sequence identities with other LY6-domain-containing human proteins (LY6-like). The human N-glycosylation site was predominantly conserved among other mammalian GPIHBP1 proteins except cow, dog and pig. Sequence alignments, key amino acid residues and conserved predicted secondary structures were also examined, including the N-terminal signal peptide, the acidic amino acid sequence region which binds LPL, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage group, the Ly6 domain and the C-terminal α-helix. Comparative and phylogenetic studies of mammalian GPIHBP1 suggested that it originated in eutherian mammals from a gene duplication event of an ancestral LY6-like gene and subsequent integration of exon 2, which may have been derived from BCL11A (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 11A gene) encoding an extended acidic amino acid sequence.

Bacteria were isolated from the new-formed spores using diluted plate method, and typical bacterial isolates were identified according to 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic analysis. Total 43 bacterial isolates affiliated to three phyla and 23 genera were obtained. The spore-associated bacterial communities were obviously different among the four source spores, suggesting that plant species or substrates could influence the bacterial population. Bacillus and Streptomyces were most frequently associated with the fungal spores. Function analysis of these bacteria by plate tests, it was found that about 30.2% isolates stimulated the spore germination, five out of seven tested isolates improved the hyphal growth, total 57.5% of the tested isolates solubilized phosphorus at different levels, 15% isolates degraded chitin, and a few isolates suppressed the growth of Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus.

    "abstract": "Abstract Micronutrient deficiencies are of major concern in human health and plant metabolism. Iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), iodine (I), selenium (Se) are regarded as micronutrients having major impact on human health. More than 50% of populations mainly from developing countries are suffering from one or the other micronutrient malnutrition. Ensuring adequate supply of these micronutrients through diet consisting of staple foods, such as common bean ( Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is must. Here, we evaluated common bean genotypes that were collected from various regions of Jammu and Kashmir, India for Fe, Zn and protein contents and used SSRs to identify the markers associated with these traits. We found significant variation among genotypes for Fe, Zn and protein contents. Genotype R2 was having 7.22 mg 100 g −1 of Fe content, genotype K15 with 1.93 mg 100 g −1 of Zn content and genotype KS6 with 31.6% of protein content. Diversity study was done using both cluster and structure based approach. Further, association mapping analysis using General Linear Method (GLM) approach was done to identify SSRs associated with accumulation of Fe, Zn and protein. 13 SSRs were identified that significantly ( p &lt; 0.05) showed association with Fe, Zn and protein contents in common bean. The markers associated with Fe were located on chromosome no. 2, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10, markers associated with Zn were located on chromosome no. 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 whereas only one marker located on chromosome no. 4 was found associated with protein content. These findings will provide potential opportunity to improve Fe and Zn concentrations in common bean, through molecular breeding.",

    "abstract": "Rational mutagenesis was performed (at the vicinity of the active site residues D317 and H358 of a mature polypeptide) to investigate the role of amino acids in the thermostability/activity of a lipase enzyme. The single variant enzyme created with E315G (lip M2) mutation near one of the active site residue (D317) found to be an important residue in controlling the thermal stability, the variant with E315G mutation demonstrated biochemical properties similar to that of native lipase. However, we found that this mutation strongly affected the activity and stability of the lip M1 mutant, reported in our previous study (Sharma et al. in Gene 491:264–271, 2012b). The dual mutant with E315G/N355K mutation in the Wt showed small increase in the protein thermostability compared to the native lipase, however, the thermostability of the mutant lip M1 was reduced several fold. Presumably, E315G (lip M2) mutation reverted the thermostability evolved by N355K (lip M1). The native and variant enzymes also displayed large variation in enzyme kinetics and their preference for pNP-esters (substrates). We further generated 3D models and studied the loop modelling of the WT and variants. Interestingly, loop region Leu314-Asn321 showed structural flexibility on introducing E315G mutation in the native lipase. On the other hand, lysine in mutant N355K exhibited side chain conformational changes in the loop Thr353-His358 which resulted in its H-bonding with Glu284. In addition, replacing glutamic acid by glycine at 315 position in lip M3 distorted the electrostatic interactions between Glu315 and Lys355 in the flexible loop region Leu314-Asn321.",

Phylogenetic analyses identified the Trichoderma isolates as T. harzianum and T. virens. The Trichoderma spp. were found to be antagonistic against the banana leaf pathogens Mycosphaerella musicola, Cordana musae, and Deightoniella torulosa in vitro. Several products used by the banana industry to increase production, including molasses, Fishoil and Seasol, were tested as food source for the Trichoderma isolates. The optimal food substrate was found to be molasses at a concentration of 5 %, which when used in combination with a di-1-p-menthene spreader-sticker enhanced the survivability of Trichoderma populations under natural conditions. This formulation suppressed D. torulosa development under glasshouse conditions. Furthermore, high sensitivity was observed towards the protectant fungicide Mancozeb but Biopest oil®, a paraffinic oil, only marginally suppressed the growth of Trichoderma isolates in vitro. Thus, this protocol represents a potential to manage banana leaf pathogens as a part of an integrated disease approach.",

Shiga toxin 1 (stx1), shiga toxin 2 (stx2), or a combination of both are responsible for most clinical symptoms of these diseases. Hence, various diagnostic methods have been developed so far to detect shiga toxins such as cell culture, ELISA, Rapid Latex Agglutination (RPLA) and hybridization, but due to high costs and labor time in addition to low sensitivity, they have not received much attention. The aim of this study was to develop a complete, rapid and reliable multiplex PCR (mPCR) method by using two pairs of specific primers to detect either the stx1 or the stx2 gene confirms the presence of E.coli O157:H7. The study results show that stx1F/stx1R primers are specific for stx1 and primers stx2F/stx2R are specific for stx2 genes in E. coli O157:H7. The mPCR method with two pairs of primers for amplifying the stx1, stx2 target genes to detect E. coli O157:H7 in food has been set up successfully. Complete method performed well in both types of food matrices with a detection limit of 3 CFU/25 g or mL of food samples. Tests on 180 food samples have shown a specificity value of 93.75 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 82.83-100), a sensitivity of 100 % (95 % CI, 83.79-99.85 %), and an accuracy of 96.66 % (CI 95 %, 83.41-99.91 %). Interestingly, results indicate that the mPCR performed as well as the traditional culture methods and can reduce the diagnosis time to 2 days. Finally, complete mPCR method was applied to natural samples covering a wide variety of food types proving that the mPCR method was a rapid and reliable screening method for detection of E. coli O157:H7 in food and environmental samples.",

The defensin Drr230a, originally isolated from pea, has been previously shown to be active against various entomopathogenic and phytopathogenic fungi. In the present study, the activity of a yeast-expressed recombinant Drr230a protein (rDrr230a) was tested against impacting soybean and cotton fungi. First, the gene was subcloned into the yeast expression vector pPICZαA and expressed in Pichia pastoris. Resulting rDrr230a exhibited in vitro activity against fungal growth and spore germination of Fusarium tucumaniae, which causes soybean sudden death syndrome, and against Colletotrichum gossypii var. cephalosporioides, which causes cotton ramulosis. The rDrr230a IC50 corresponding to inhibition of fungal growth of F. tucumaniae and C. gossypii var. cephalosporioides was 7.67 and 0.84 µM, respectively, demonstrating moderate activity against F. tucumaniae and high potency against C. gossypii var. cephalosporioides. Additionally, rDrr230a at 25 ng/µl (3.83 µM) resulted in 100 % inhibition of spore germination of both fungi, demonstrating that rDrr230a affects fungal development since spore germination. Moreover, rDrr230a at 3 µg/µl (460.12 µM) inhibited 100 % of in vitro spore germination of the obligatory biotrophic fungus Phakopsora pachyrhizi, which causes Asian soybean rust. Interestingly, rDrr230a substantially decreased the severity of Asian rust, as demonstrated by in planta assay. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a plant defensin active against an obligatory biotrophic phytopathogenic fungus. Results revealed the potential of rDrr230a as a candidate to be used in plant genetic engineering to control relevant cotton and soybean fungal diseases.",

The highest number of shoots (17.1) was observed when shoot tip explants were cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium fortified with 8.0 µM 6-Benzyladenine (BA) and 2.7 µM α-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). The mean number of shoots per explant was increased 1.6-fold in liquid medium as compared with semi-solid medium. Maximum rooting (100 %) with an average of 7.2 roots per shoot was obtained on MS basal medium. Rooted plantlets were successfully acclimatised in the greenhouse with 100 % survival rate. Composition of carotenoids, fatty acids and tocopherols was also studied from leaves of greenhouse-grown plants and in vitro-regenerated shoots of A. multiflora. The greatest amounts of carotenoids, fatty acids and tocopherols were obtained from leaves of in vitro-regenerated shoots cultured on MS basal medium, followed by leaves of greenhouse-grown plants and leaves of in vitro-regenerated shoots cultured on MS basal medium with 2.0 µM BA or thidiazuron. The most abundant carotenoid in A. multiflora leaves was all-E-lutein (89.4–382.6 μg g−1 FW) followed by all-E-β-carotene (32.0–156.7 μg g−1 FW), 9′-Z-neoxanthin (14.2–63.4 μg g−1 FW), all-E-violaxanthin (13.0–45.9 μg g−1 FW), all-E-zeaxanthin (1.3–2.5 μg g−1 FW) and all-E-β-cryptoxanthin (0.3–0.9 μg g−1 FW). α-Tocopherol was the predominant tocopherol in A. multiflora leaves. Linolenic acid (49.03–52.59 %) was detected in higher amounts in A. multiflora leaf samples followed by linoleic acid (18.95–21.39 %) and palmitic acid (15.79–18.66 %).",

The work involves the study of genes and enzymes involved in the degradation of the pesticide and was carried out with an objective of reducing the toxicity of Endosulfan by degrading it to less toxic metabolites. The long-term stability of Endosulfan degradation was studied during its repeated batch degradation, carried out over a period of 35 days. Immobilized cells of Ps. aeruginosa were able to show 60 % degradation of Endosulfan at the end of the 35th cycle with a cell leakage of 642 × 104 Cfu/mL. During continuous treatment, with 2 % concentration of Endosulfan, 100 % degradation was recorded up to 100 mL/h flow rate and with 10 % concentration of the Endosulfan, and 100 and 85 % degradation was recorded at 20 mL/h flow rate and 100 mL/h flow rate, respectively. After degradation of Endosulfan, products were extracted from a large amount of spent medium using two volumes of ethyl acetate and subjected to the LC-MS analysis. Endosulfan lactone and Endosulfan ether were the products of degradation detected by the LCMS analysis. Plasmid curing experiments indicated that genes responsible for the degradation of Endosulfan are present on the chromosome and not on the plasmid, as growth of Ps. aeruginosa was observed on modified non-sulfur medium with Endosulfan after the plasmid was cured with ethidium bromide. The results of PCR indicated that there is no amplified product of ~1350 bp expected for esd gene, in Ps. aeruginosa, although there were some non-specific bands. Enzymatic degradation studies indicated that the enzymes involved in the degradation of Endosulfan are intracellular. With this investigation, it was indicated that immobilized cells of Ps. aeruginosa have the potential to be used in the bioremediation of water contaminated with Endosulfan.",

    "abstract": "Black gram (Vigna mungo L. Hepper), is an extensively studied food crop which is affected by many abiotic and biotic factors, especially diseases. The yield potential of Black gram is shallow due to lack of genetic variability and biotic stress susceptibility. Core biotic stress factors include mung bean yellow mosaic virus (MYMV), urdbean leaf crinkle virus (UCLV), wilt (Fusarium oxysporum) and powdery mildew (Erysiphe polygoni DC). Although many studies determine resistant varieties to a particular disease, however, it is often complimented by low yield and susceptibility to other diseases. Hence, this study focuses on investigating the genetic relationships among three varieties and nine accessions of black gram having disease resistance to previously described diseases and susceptibility using random amplified polymorphic deoxyribonucleic acid (RAPD) markers. A total of 33 RAPD primers were used for diversity analysis and yielded 206 fragments. Number of amplified fragments ranged from two (OPN-1) to 13 (OPF-1). The highest similarity coefficient was observed between IC-145202 and IC-164118 (0.921), while lowest similarity was between PU-31 and IC-145202 (0.572). The genetic diversity obtained in this study along with disease analysis suggests PU31as a useful variety for the development of markers linked to MYMV, UCLV, wilt and powdery mildew resistance by marker-assisted back cross breeding and facilitates the production of crosses with multiple disease resistance.",

The myxobacteria were functionally characterized to assess their ability to produce antibacterial and anticancer metabolites. The isolates were found to be functionally versatile as they produced extracellular bioactive molecules that exhibited high frequency of activities against Bacillus cereus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas syringae. The strains also showed cytotoxic activity against the human cancer cell lines of liver, pancreas, prostrate, bone and cervix.

    "abstract": "Using solid-state fermentation, production of an industrially important pectin lyase from a fungal strain Fusarium oxysporum MTCC 1755 was attempted, which was further subjected to purification and characterization. The enzyme was purified by three steps, namely ammonium sulfate fractionation, cation-exchange chromatography on CM cellulose followed by gel filtration chromatography using Sephadex G-100 column. A 16-fold purification with 31.2% yield and 3.2 U/mg specific activity was achieved. The optimum pH of the purified enzyme was 9.0 and stability ranged from pH 5.0-7.0 for 24 h. Optimum temperature of purified enzyme was found to be 40 °C while temperature stability ranged from 10 to 50 °C for 30 min. The K m and k cat of the enzyme was 1.75 mg/ml and 83.3 s-1, respectively. The purified enzyme was found to be highly stimulated by Ca2+ ions while sugars like mannitol and sorbitol, and salts like NaCl and CaCl2 enhanced the thermostability. The purified pectin lyase was found suitable for retting of Crotolaria juncea fiber.",

    "abstract": "Rhodothermaceae bacterium RA is a halo-thermophile isolated from a saline hot spring. Previously, the genome of this bacterium was sequenced using a HiSeq 2500 platform culminating in 91 contigs. In this report, we report on the resequencing of its complete genome using a PacBio RSII platform. The genome has a GC content of 68.3%, is 4,653,222 bp in size, and encodes 3711 genes. We are interested in understanding the carbohydrate metabolic pathway, in particular the lignocellulosic biomass degradation pathway. Strain RA harbors 57 glycosyl hydrolase (GH) genes that are affiliated with 30 families. The bacterium consists of cellulose-acting (GH 3, 5, 9, and 44) and hemicellulose-acting enzymes (GH 3, 10, and 43). A crude cell-free extract of the bacterium exhibited endoglucanase, xylanase, β-glucosidase, and β-xylosidase activities. The complete genome information coupled with biochemical assays confirms that strain RA is able to degrade cellulose and xylan. Therefore, strain RA is another excellent member of family Rhodothermaceae as a repository of novel and thermostable cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes.",

    "abstract": "In present report effects of explants type, basal media and plant growth regulators (PGRs) were tested for induction of indirect somatic embryogenesis in medicinally important plant Silybum marianum L. Leaf, petiole and root explants were exploited in vitro on B5 (Gamborg), SH (Schenk and Hildebrandt) and MS (Murashige and Skoog) media for induction of embryogenic callus followed by somatic embryogenesis. Highest callus induction frequency (76 ± 4.8 %) was recorded when petiole explants of in vitro derived plantlets were cultured on B5 medium supplemented with 1.5 mg l-1 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4_D) in combination with 1.5 mg l-1 Thidiazuron (TDZ). Induction and multiplication of somatic embryos were observed, when the embryogenic calluses were sub-cultured on to B5 medium containing 0.5 mg l-1 2,4-D plus 1.5 mg l-1 TDZ. At this PGRs treatment, 77 % of the cultures responded with 39.1 somatic embryos per callus. Furthermore, MS0 medium was indicated more reponsive for growth and maturation of somatic embryos. Analysis of biochemical markers during various growth phases in somatic embryogenesis revealed that somatic embryos exhibited highest level of total carbohydrate, starch, ascorbic acid and total free amino acids. However, higher protein levels were detected in non-embryogenic callus. Nevertheless, considerable amount of silymarin (4.1 mg g-1 DW) was detected in somatic embryos than other growth phases. Thus, the present study concluded that biochemical and physiological changes during embryogenesis are influenced by interplay of explants type, basal media and PGRs.",

    "abstract": "Rapid industrialisation, technological development, urbanization and increase in population in the recent past coupled with unplanned and unscientific disposal methods led to increased heavy metal levels in water. Realizing the need for development of eco-friendly and cost effective methods, the present investigation was done for the adsorptive removal of copper from aqueous solutions with Dromaius novaehollandiae eggshell and chitosan composite. By one variable at a time method, the optimum contact time was found to be 60 min with an adsorbent dosage of 8 g/L at pH 6, initial adsorbate concentration of 20 mg/L and temperature 30 °C. The equilibrium data followed Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models and pseudo second-order kinetics. The equilibrium adsorption capacity determined from Langmuir isotherm was 48.3 mg/g. From the Van't Hoff equation, thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpy (ΔH°), entropy (ΔS°) and Gibb's free energy (ΔG°) were calculated and inferred that the process was spontaneous, irreversible and endothermic. To know the cumulative effects of operating parameters, a three level full factorial design of Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was applied and the suggested optimum conditions were 7.90 g/L of adsorbent dosage, 20.2651 mg/L of initial adsorbate concentration and 5.9 pH. Maximum percentage of copper adsorption attained was 95.25 % (19.05 mg/L) and the residual concentration of the metal after sorption corresponded to 0.95 mg/L, which is below the permissible limits (1.3 mg/L) of copper in drinking water. The adsorbent was characterized before and after adsorption by SEM-EDS, FTIR and XRD. The FTIR analysis showed the involvement of carboxyl, hydroxyl and amino groups while XRD analysis revealed the predominantly amorphous nature of the composite post-adsorption and the peaks at 2θ angles characteristic for copper and copper oxide. The mechanisms involved in the adsorption of copper onto the adsorbent are chemisorption, complexation and ion exchange.",

    "abstract": "The enhancement of plant secondary metabolite production in cell suspension cultures through biotic or abiotic elicitation has become a potential biotechnological approach for commercialization or large-scale production of bioactive compounds. Gymnema sylvestre R.Br. is an important medicinal plant, rich in a group of oleanane triterpenoid saponins called gymnemic acid, well known for its anti-diabetic activity. Two endophytic fungal strains were isolated from the leaves of G. sylvestre and identified as Polyancora globosa and Xylaria sp. based on the PCR amplification and internal transcribed spacer (ITS 1-5.8S-ITS 2) sequencing of 18S rRNA gene. The process of elicitation of cell suspension cultures of G. sylvestre with dried powder of fungal mycelia (DPFM) and extracellular culture filtrate (ECF) of endophytic fungi consistently enhanced the accumulation of gymnemic acid and the DPFM was proved to be an effective elicitor when compared to the ECF. The DPFM elicited the gymnemic acid content in the range of 2.57-10.45-fold, while the ECF elicited the gymnemic acid content in the range of 2.39-7.8-fold. P. globosa, a novel and a rare endophytic fungal strain, has shown a great influence on the production of gymnemic acid. Cell suspension cultures elicited with DPFM of P. globosa produced higher amount of gymnemic acid content (124.23 mg/g dried cell weight) compared to the cultures elicited with DPFM of Xylaria sp. (102.24 mg/g DCW). But the cultures treated with consortium of DPFM of both fungi showed great influence on the production of gymnemic acid (139.98 mg/g DCW) than the cultures treated with DPFM alone. Similarly, cultures treated with consortium of ECF of both fungi produced more gymnemic acid content (94.86 mg/g DCW) compared with cultures treated with ECF of Xylaria sp. (77.93 mg/g DCW) and ECF of P. globosa (78.65 mg/g DCW) alone.",

We have isolated 162 rhizo and endophytic bacteria from soil, roots, and leaves of the sea grass. Antifungal screening of isolated bacteria revealed 19 strains (11.7%) capable to inhibit growth of four pathogenic fungi, Pythium ultimum, Phytophthora capsici, pyricularia oryzae, and Rhizoctonia solani in an in vitro assay. Taxonomic and phylogenetic analyses on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed 97-99.9% sequence identity to recognized species. Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Jeotgalicoccus, and Planococcus, within the Phylum Firmicutes, Kocuria, Arthrobacter, Ornithinimicrobium and Corynebacterium (Actinobacteria), Sulfitobacter, Roseivivax, Ruegeria (α-Proteobacteria), Moraxella, and Vibrio (γ-Proteobacteria), were isolated. Strains belong to Phylum Firmicutes remain dominant antagonistic bacteria in this study. Further hydrolytic enzyme production was determined for these antagonistic bacteria. Our results demonstrated that the sea grass represents an important source of diverse antagonistic bacteria capable of producing antifungal metabolite.",

    "abstract": "The study investigated the effectiveness of selenium binding from its salt solution by Candida utilis ATCC 9950 yeast biomass cultured on a medium prepared from the agro-food industry wastes, containing an available source of carbon and nitrogen. Selenium binding by C. utilis yeast strain after 48 h of culturing at 28 °C from aqueous solutions with the addition of 30 mg Se/L reached a value of 2.28 mg Se/g of yeast biomass. The kinetics of selenium binding by the yeasts showed a better fit for the pseudo-second-order kinetic model compared to the pseudo-first-order one. Accumulation stability data were analyzed using the Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm models. The presence of competing anions such as SO42- , and HPO42- at a concentration of 0.5 mM resulted in about 35% reduction of selenium binding by the examined C. utilis strain. FTIR analysis showed that sulfur compounds were involved in selenium biosorption by the yeast. Compounds containing ammonium groups appeared to be very important for selenium binding. The results of the study demonstrated that the yeast can be used to effectively bind selenium from aqueous solution. At the same time, it gives the opportunity to obtain a biomass rich in this deficient element, which can also be used in dietary supplement production.",

    "abstract": "Waxy corn is popular beacuse of its high amylopectin due to mutation in granule-bound starch synthase-I or Waxy1 (Wx1) gene. Here, we characterized the wx1 allele among 24 diverse waxy inbreds using gene-based markers. A total of 29 alleles with average of 1.81 alleles/locus were observed. Major allele frequency varied from 0.42 to 1.00, with mean of 0.74. The polymorphism information content ranged from 0.00 to 0.56 (average 0.24). Three simple sequence repeat markers, viz., phi027, phi022 and phi061 were more polymorphic in the study. The mean heterozygosity was 0.04, which indicated attainment of higher levels of homozygosity. Dissimilarity coefficient varied from 0.00 to 0.90 with average of 0.51. Seventeen diverse haplotypes of wx1 allele were observed that was consistent with the pedigree. Cluster analyses grouped 24 genotypes into two main clusters each having sub-clusters. The information generated here possesses great potential for improvement of high amylopectin in maize through marker-assisted selection. This is the first report of molecular dissection of wx1 gene among the novel waxy inbreds developed in India.",

    "abstract": "Lignin is a major component of all plants, the degradation of which remains a major challenge to date owing to its recalcitrant nature. Several classes of fungi have been studied to carry out this process to some extent, but overall the process remains inefficient. We have isolated a novel alkalophilic dimorphic lignin-degrading Deuteromycete from soil, identified as \"uncultured\" and coded as MVI.2011. Supernatant from 12-h culture of MVI.2011 in optimized mineral medium containing lignin pH 9.0 was analysed for Lignin Peroxidase, Manganese Peroxidase and Laccase. Enzyme purification was carried out by standard protocols using ammonium sulphate precipitation followed by further purification by Gel Permeation Chromatography. Analysis of total protein, specific enzyme activity and molecular weight of the GPC-purified LiP, MnP and Laccase showed 93.83 μg/ml, 5.27 U/mg, 42 kDa; 78.13 μg/ml, 13.18 U/mg, 45 kDa and 85.81 μg/ml, 4.77 U/mg, 62 kDa, respectively. The purified enzymes possessed high activity over a wide range of pH (4-11), and temperature (30-55 °C). The optimum substrate concentration was 20 μg/ml of lignin for all the three enzymes. CD spectra suggested that the predominant secondary structure was helix in LiP, and, turns in MnP and Laccase. The breakdown products of lignin degradation by MVI.2011 and the three purified enzymes were detected and identified by FTIR and GC-MS. They were oxalic acid, hentriacontane, derivatives of octadecane, nonane, etc. These vital compounds are certain to find application as biofuels, an alternate energy source in various industries.",

    "abstract": "Metal bioaccessibility is an alarming issue in croplands of mining sites due to overloading of toxic metals. Hence, the present study is aimed to determine the overloading of toxic metal in croplands across the Tawag village, Hutti, Raichur, India. Correspondingly, to identify the soil bacterial growth, physiological oxidative stress enzyme activity and surface macromolecular functional group evolution were analysed in and around the toxic metal contaminated sites through FT-IR and FT-Raman spectrometry. The evaluated results attribute that the study area is heavily polluted with the toxic metals such as arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead and zinc. However, biochemical and 16S rRNA gene sequence homology tree confirmed that the arsenic and cadmium-resistant isolate belongs to Bacillus sp. MDPMK-02 and retrieved unique Gene Bank ID KT596811 (accession number) at National Centre for Biotechnology information (NCBI), India. Additionally, sodium arsenite-amended culture media possessing reduced biomass and enhanced the activity of oxidative stress defence enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) than cadmium chloride-amended medium and control. Subsequently, the infrared (IR) and Raman spectral analytical assessment distinguish that arsenic-treated Gram-positive isolate membrane fetched high percentage of hydration, elevation of surface polysaccharides, proteins and polyhydroxybutyric acid (PHBA) molecular specific stretch intensity compared to cadmium exposures. From these results, the study concluded that the mining wastes significantly pollute the surrounding croplands, and also Bacillus sp. MDPMK-02 possesses good chemosensing for cross-protection and bio-adaptation of toxic metal ions. Hence, these isolates can be compiled and implemented in environmental hazardous management techniques such as bioremediation, bioleaching and biodegradation.",

    "abstract": "p-Cresol is an environmental pollutant due to its vast use, toxicity and persistence, nevertheless, its degradation in an enzyme is unclear. In this study, we used Pleurotus sp. isolate VLECK02 polyphenol oxidase (PPO) for the determination of p-cresol degradation. On the basis of UV, FT-IR and chromatographic (HPLC and GC-MS) analysis, 4-methylcatechol was identified as the main metabolite of p-cresol catabolism. In addition, batch and semi-continuous degradation of p-cresol (10 and 20 mM) were studied and compared by free and immobilized PPO in different matrices like sodium alginate (SA), sodium alginate-polyvinyl alcohol (SA-PVA) and sodium alginate-polyvinyl alcohol-silver nanoparticles (SA-PVA-AgNPs). The experimental data showed that an enzyme (PPO) immobilized in SA-PVA-AgNPs was completely degraded p-cresol at initial concentrations of 10 and 20 mM within 30 h. These results suggest that the enzyme immobilized in SA-PVA-AgNPs has achieved higher degradation rates at a given time than free PPO and PPO immobilized in SA-PVA and SA. The SA-PVA-AgNPs and SA-PVA immobilized enzyme could be reused for more than 12 and 8 cycles, respectively, without losing any degradation capacity. Moreover, the immobilized PPO showed higher tolerance to various temperatures and pH than free PPO. Hence, immobilized PPO could be useful for the bioremediation of environment contaminated with phenolic compounds like p-cresol.",

Clear Jamun juice is not available in the market, so there is a need for extraction of juice with maximum yield. The goal of this research is to obtain high yield of clarified juice with the help of Pectinase (Aspergillus aculeatus) enzyme. The study was conducted at different enzyme concentration (0.01–0.1%), time duration (40–120 min), and temperature (30–50 °C). Various physical and chemical parameters, such as yield, turbidity, viscosity, clarity, colour, polyphenol, protein, TSS, and total solid, were measured as dependent variables. Process optimization has been done using Box–Behnken design. Optimization has been done for maximum yield percentage, L* value, a* value, protein, and polyphenol content, and minimum values for turbidity, viscosity, clarity, b* value, TSS, and total solid content. The suggested parameters for extraction of juice were at 0.05% enzyme concentration at 44 °C for 80 min. In a large-scale production, extraction of juice by Pectinase (Aspergillus aculeatus) has a significance importance due to its high yield as well as nutritional values.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) cleaves the viral polypeptide 1a and 1ab in a site-specific ((L-Q|(S, A, G)) manner and produce functional enzymes for mediating viral replication. Numerous studies have reported synthetic competitive inhibitors against this target enzyme but increase in substrate concentration often reduces the effectiveness of such inhibitors. Allosteric inhibition by natural compound can provide safe and effective treatment by alleviating this limitation. Present study deals with in silico allosteric inhibition analysis of quercetin, against SARS-CoV-2-Mpro. Molecular docking of quercetin with Mpro revealed consistent binding of quercetin at a site other than active site in multiple runs, with the highest binding energy of − 8.31 kcal/mol, forming 6 H-bonds with residues Gln127, Cys128, Lys137, Asp289 and Glu290. Molecular dynamic simulation of 50 ns revealed high stability of Mpro-quercetin complex with RMSD values ranging from 0.1 to 0.25 nm. Moreover, native-Mpro and Mpro-quercetin complex conformations extracted at different time points from simulation trajectories were subjected to active site-specific docking with modelled substrate peptide (AVLQSGFR) by ZDOCK server. Results displayed site-specific cleavage of peptide when docked with native-Mpro. While substrate peptide remained intact when docked with Mpro-quercetin complex, also the binding energy of peptide reduced from 785 to 86 from 1 to 50 ns as quercetin induced alterations in the active site cavity reducing its affinity for the substrate. Further, no interactions were noticed between peptide and active site residues of Mpro-quercetin complex conformations at 40 and 50 ns. Hence, quercetin displayed effective allosteric inhibition potential against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, and can be developed into an efficient treatment for COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic options for SARS-CoV-2 are limited merely to the symptoms or repurposed drugs and non-specific interventions to promote the human immune system. In the present study, chromatographic and in silico approaches were implemented to identify bioactive compounds which might play pivotal role as inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2 and human immunomodulator (TGF-β and TNF-α). Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Miers was evaluated for phenolic composition and explored for bioactive compounds by high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC). Furthermore, the bioactive compounds such as cordifolioside, berberine, and magnoflorine were appraised as human immunomodulatory and potent inhibitor against Main Protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 through multiple docking strategies. Cordifolioside formed six stable H-bonds with His41, Ser144, Cys145, His163, His164, and Glu166 of Mpro of SARS-CoV-2, which displayed a significant role in the viral replication/transcription during infection acting towards the common conserved binding cleft among all strains of coronavirus. Overall, the study emphasized that the proposed cordifolioside might use for future investigations, which hold as a promising scaffold for developing anti-COVID-19 drug and reduce human cytokine storm.",

    "abstract": "Wool has the tendency to turn into felt during agitation in washing machines. Thus, a benign non-polluting method for the production of machine-washable wool was developed herein. Initially, a proteolytic bacteria was isolated from hot region soil. The bacterial isolate was identified as Bacillus safensis FO-36bMZ836779 according to the 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Afterwards, the extracellular protease produced by this isolate was covalently immobilized in order to enhance its stability under non-ambient conditions which are usually adopted in industrial sectors like textile industries. Sericin, which is usually discharged into degumming effluent of natural silk, was utilized to prepare the immobilization carrier. Box-Behnken design was adopted in order to hone the preparation of the sericin-polyethylene-imine-glutaraldehyde activated agar carrier. The pH and temperature profiles of the free and immobilized proteases were compared. Later, wool fibres were bio-treated with both the free and the immobilized enzymes. The effect of process conditions on the resistance of the bio-finished wool to felting was investigated. The alteration in the fibre morphology was monitored using SEM. Amino acid analysis and alkali solubility tests were adopted to assign any change in the chemical structure of the bio-treated wool. The influence of bio-treatment of wool on its inherent properties was assigned. Results revealed that bio-treatment of wool with the said enzyme led to production of machine-washable wool without severe deterioration in the fibres' properties. In an energy- and water-consuming process, the hot solution from bio-treatment bath was used successfully in dyeing of wool.

The immunohistochemical staining with mouse monoclonal anti-human CD 68 and mouse monoclonal anti-GFAP was performed to assess the number of microglial cells and astrocytes, respectively.AD group showed an increase in the number of microglia, and the numbers declined in the treatment groups, RS 10, RS 20, RS10/10 and DPZ + RS (p < 0.001). Astrocyte count was increased in the treatment groups in contrast to the AD group (p < 0.05). The DPZ + RS combination group revealed substantial elevation in the number of astrocytes and decreased microglial number among all the groups (p < 0.001).RS administration has diminished the microglial number and elevated the number of astrocytes. The elevated reactive astrocytes have decreased the microglial population. However, the limitation of our study is utilizing the colchicine for the induction of neurodegeneration. Using the transgenic models of AD may give a better insight into the pathogenesis and effect of RS. Another limitation of this study is the administration of RS and DPZ through different routes. The prospects of this research include studying the probiotic nature of RS and the effect of RS in other neurodegenerative disorders.",

Therefore, in this study, a β-glucosidase hyperproducing mutant was developed by multiple exposures of ethyl methyl sulfonate (EMS) and ultraviolet (UV) radiation (both individually and jointly) to Bacillus subtilis strain (PS). The developed mutants were screened, selected and characterized. The mutant, PS-UM1 developed after UV exposure alone, indicated a small increase in β-glucosidase production (718 U/l) in comparison to the wild-type strain, PS (675 U/l). The mutant, PS-CM5 developed after EMS exposure alone, displayed a slightly better production (762 U/l) than both the above strains. However, after exposure of the wild-type strain to both UV and EMS mutagens jointly, a better mutant (PS-CM5-UM3) was developed with 1.2-fold increase in production (806 U/l). Further, optimization of culture conditions by classical \"one-variable-at-a-time\" approach was done to determine the optimum, pH, temperature and nitrogen sources. The selected mutant (PS-CM5-UM3) produced up to 1,797 U/l enzyme and was found to be stable for ten generations. The β-glucosidase from the selected mutant (PS-CM5-UM3) was concentrated and purified using ammonium sulfate, dialysis and size-exclusion chromatography. The enzyme displayed maximal activity at 60 °C and it was found to be fairly stable at temperatures up to 70 °C for 30 min. Its molecular weight was determined to be around 60 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).",

Algae in marine and fresh water environment may affect the fate and transport of spilled oil. Sorption of diesel and lubricating oil was studied using dead biomass of Spirulina sp. and Scenedesmus abundans. The rate and extent of sorption was studied in well mixed batch systems containing oil (0.1–2 %, v/v) and biomass (0.1 %) suspended in water. Sorption of diesel on Spirulina sp. was instantaneous. Rate limited sorption on algal biomass could be explained by the pseudo-second order model and equilibrium was established within 12 days. The Freundlich and Langmuir model could provide adequate fit for diesel sorption on algae but not for lubricating oil. A three parameter model, the Sips model, provided good fit for all the experimentally generated isotherms and yielded maximum sorption capacity of diesel and lubricating oil in the range of 12–14 g/g. Oil sorption on algae was comparable to other spill clean-up sorbents. Algae can be used for development of low cost sorbents and can facilitate removal of oil from contaminated water. Sorption is affected both by the type of oil and type of algae. This is the first study illustrating that the additives present in lubricating oil not only reduces the sorption rate but also alters sorption equilibrium such that two-parameter isotherms are inadequate.",

Fermentation of the released sugars into ethanol by a suitable ethanol producing microorganism using cheap media ingredients is the cornerstone of the overall process. This study evaluated the potential of rice bran extract (RBE) as a cheap nitrogen source for the production of 2G ethanol by Scheffersomyces (Pichia) stipitis NRRL Y-7124 using sugarcane bagasse (SB) hemicellulosic hydrolysate. Dilute acid hydrolysis of SB showed 12.45 g/l of xylose and 0.67 g/l of glucose along with inhibitors. It was concentrated by vacuum evaporation and submitted to sequential detoxification (neutralization by calcium hydroxide and charcoal adsorption). The detoxified hydrolysate revealed the removal of furfural (81 %) and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (61 %) leading to the final concentration of glucose (1.69 g/l) and xylose (33.03 g/l). S. stipitis was grown in three different fermentation media composed of detoxified hydrolysate as carbon source supplemented with varying nitrogen sources i.e. medium #1 (RBE + ammonium sulfate + calcium chloride), medium #2 (yeast extract + peptone) and medium #3 (yeast extract + peptone + malt extract). Medium #1 showed maximum ethanol production (8.6 g/l, yield 0.22 g/g) followed by medium #2 (8.1 g/l, yield 0.19 g/g) and medium #3 (7.4 g/l, yield 0.18 g/g).",

    "abstract": "Mangiferin, a bioactive compound having potent nutraceutical, strong antioxidant and pharmacological significance has been extracted using microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) technique from Curcuma amada, commonly known as mango ginger. The extraction solvent ethanol is eco-friendly, nontoxic and reduces the risk of environmental hazards. The influence of several independent variables such as microwave power, ethanol concentration, extraction (irradiation) time and pre-leaching time has been studied under varying conditions using one-factor-at-a-time analysis to obtain an optimal extraction ratio. The maximum mangiferin content of 1.1156 mg/g is obtained at microwave power of 550 W and extraction time of 50 s with 80 % ethanol as a solvent and pre-leaching time of 20 min. The results indicate that microwave power and ethanol concentration have the most significant effect on the yield of mangiferin content. The presence of mangiferin in final Curcuma amada extract is confirmed through high-performance liquid chromatography and the functional groups are identified through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses using standard mangiferin. The experimental profiles are fitted into a two-parameter modified first-order kinetic model and a three-parameter modified logistic model and checked using the goodness-of-fit criterion. The Curcuma amada retained its antioxidant activity after MAE treatment and the antioxidant activity of mangiferin obtained after extraction using DPPH free radical scavenging assay is studied.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale production of plasmid DNA to prepare therapeutic gene vectors or DNA-based vaccines requires a suitable bacterial host, which can stably maintain the plasmid DNA during industrial cultivation. Plasmid loss during bacterial cell divisions and structural changes in the plasmid DNA can dramatically reduce the yield of the desired recombinant plasmid DNA. While generating an HIV-based gene vector containing a bicistronic expression cassette 5'-Olig2cDNA-IRES-dsRed2-3', we encountered plasmid DNA instability, which occurred in homologous recombination deficient recA1 Escherichia coli strain Stbl2 specifically during large-scale bacterial cultivation. Unexpectedly, the new recombinant plasmid was structurally changed or completely lost in 0.5 L liquid cultures but not in the preceding 5 mL cultures. Neither the employment of an array of alternative recA1 E. coli plasmid hosts, nor the lowering of the culture incubation temperature prevented the instability. However, after the introduction of this instability-prone plasmid into the recA13E. coli strain Stbl3, the transformed bacteria grew without being overrun by plasmid-free cells, reduction in the plasmid DNA yield or structural changes in plasmid DNA. Thus, E. coli strain Stbl3 conferred structural and maintenance stability to the otherwise instability-prone lentivirus-based recombinant plasmid, suggesting that this strain can be used for the faithful maintenance of similar stability-compromised plasmids in large-scale bacterial cultivations. In contrast to Stbl2, which is derived wholly from the wild type isolate E. coli K12, E. coli Stbl3 is a hybrid strain of mixed E. coli K12 and E. coli B parentage. Therefore, we speculate that genetic determinants for the benevolent properties of E. coli Stbl3 for safe plasmid propagation originate from its E. coli B ancestor.",

Chemical stability, temperature stability, non-flammability, low vapor pressure, wide liquidus range, and non-toxicity are among those unique properties. These solvents are also known as green solvents due to non-toxicity and low vapor pressure. The present study was set to compare the effect of five different ionic liquids namely, 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium acetate, 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium diethyl phosphate, 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium chlorides, 1,3-dimethyl imidazolium dimethyl phosphate, and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium-trifluoromethane sulfonate on barley straw in bioethanol production process. The performance of ionic liquids was evaluated based on the change observed in chemical structure, crystallinity index, and cellulose digestibility. Overall, 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium acetate was found most effective in pretreating barely straw for bioethanol production. To the best of our knowledge, the present study reports different ionic liquids; some for the first time, for barely straw pretreatment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this study, a bioherbicide was produced by solid-state fermentation (SSF) using Diaporthe sp. Adjuvants were employed in a formulation to enhance the herbicidal activity towards the target ( Cucumis sativus ). The study was divided into two steps: (1) the fermentation condition for bioherbicide production was assessed; (2) evaluation of different formulations containing palm oil, Tween ® 80 and Span ® 80, in order to increase phytotoxicity. In step 1, the maximum herbicidal activity (1.23% of the leaves had lesions) was obtained at 25 °C, moisture content of 50 wt%, supplemented with 10 wt% of corn steep liquor and soybean bran and inoculum density of 15 wt%. In step 2, the formulation containing 8.2 wt% of palm oil, 8.2 wt% of Tween ® 80 and Span ® 80, resulting in an HLB of 12.8 showed the highest phytotoxicity on the leaves. At this condition, dry matter and height of target were reduced about 36% in comparison with control. Diaporthe sp. has the potential to produce molecules with herbicidal activity and the use of adjuvants enhanced three times its efficiency.",

These primers produced 789 loci, out of which 773 loci were polymorphic (including 220 unique loci) and 16 monomorphic loci. Highest number of bands amplified (263) in Curcuma caesia whereas lowest (209) in Zingiber cassumunar. Though all the markers discriminated the species effectively, analysis of combined data of all markers resulted in better distinction of individual species. Highest number of loci was amplified with SSR primers with resolving power in a range of 17.4-39. Dendrogram based on three molecular data using unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean classified all the species into two clusters. Mantle matrix correspondence test revealed high matrix correlation in all the cases. Correlation values for RAPD, ISSR and SSR were 0.797, 0.84 and 0.8, respectively, with combined data. In both the genera wild and cultivated species were completely separated from each other at genomic level. It also revealed distinct genetic identity between species of Curcuma and Zingiber. High genetic diversity documented in the present study provides a baseline data for optimization of conservation and breeding programme of the studied zingiberacious species.",

    "abstract": "Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) have been classified in the CAZy database into 153 GH families. Currently, there might be four α-amylase families: the main family GH13, the family GH57 with related GH119 and, eventually, also GH126. The family GH57 was established in 1996 as the second and smaller α-amylase family. In addition to α-amylase, it contains 4-α-glucanotransferase, α-glucan branching enzyme, amylopullulanase, dual-specificity amylopullulanase-cyclomaltodextrinase, non-specified amylase, maltogenic amylase and α-galactosidase. The family GH57 enzymes employ the retaining reaction mechanism, share five typical conserved sequence regions and possess catalytic (β/α)7-barrel succeeded by a four-helix bundle with the catalytic machinery consisting of catalytic nucleophile and proton donor (glutamic acid and aspartic acid at strands β4 and β7, respectively). The present bioinformatics study delivers a detailed sequence comparison of 1602 family GH57 sequences with the aim to highlight the uniqueness of each enzyme's specificity and all eventual protein groups. This was achieved by creating the evolutionary tree focused on both the enzyme specificities and taxonomical origin. The substantial increase of numbers of sequences from recent comparisons done more than 5 years ago has allowed to refine the details of the sequence logos for the individual enzyme specificities. The study identifies a new evolutionary distinct group of α-galactosidase-related enzymes with until-now-undefined enzyme specificity but positioned on the evolutionary tree on a branch adjacent to α-galactosidases. The specificity of α-galactosidase is, moreover, the only one of the entire family GH57 for which there is no structural support for the proposal of the proton donor based on sequence analysis. The analysis also suggests a few so-called \"like\" protein groups related to some family GH57 enzyme specificities but lacking one or both catalytic residues.",

Twenty actinobacteria were isolated from marine water sample and were primarily screened for biosurfactant production using hemolytic activity method. Among the 20 isolates, six showed positive result for hemolytic activity and those were taken for further secondary screening tests such as oil collapse method, oil spreading method and emulsification method. From the results of secondary screening analysis, two isolates (SIS-3 and SIS-20) were selected and further used to carry out biosurfactant characterization test such as pH, density, surface tension and viscosity determination. Comparing biosurfactant characterization results, SIS-3 was chosen for further analysis and application. FT-IR and GC–MS were carried out for analysis of biosurfactant from isolate SIS-3 and the compound detected was rhamnolipid. The isolate (SIS-3) was identified as Nocardiopsis using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and named as 'Nocardiopsis VITSISB' (KC958579) which was further applied for immobilizing whole cells for engine oil degradation by constructing an aquatic model and using natural products such as soybean meal, sugarcane juice as nutrient source. The oil was efficiently degraded by rhamnolipid producing Nocardiopsis VITSISB (KC958579) within 25 days which indicated that the strain can act as a natural candidate for the bioremediation of oil spill in ocean.",

Cassava biofortified with pro-vitamin A can help reduce Vitamin A Deficiency among the undernourished communities that rely upon it for sustenance. BioCassava Plus project has developed transgenic cassava that expresses beta carotene in roots using root specific patatin promoter. This study aimed at confirming expression of nptII, crtB and DXS genes. Leaf and roots samples were obtained from confined field trial at KARI Alupe at 12 months after planting. RNA was isolated from cassava roots and leaves using a modified Dellaporta protocol, analyzed for expression of DXS, crtB and the selectable marker, nptII using the one step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) and analyzed through gel electrophoresis. DXS, crtB and nptII genes were expressed in the roots as anticipated. On the contrary, DXS and crtB genes were also expressed in the leaves of the transgenic cassava despite the use of root specific patatin promoter. This finding indicates that the promoter confers expression in leaves too. Intensive molecular screening of the biofortified transgenic cassava is important for risk assessment that informs on integrity of the promoter gene and confirms expression of the beta carotene genes.",

    "abstract": "Candida dubliniensis is an emerging pathogenic yeast in humans and infections are usually restricted to mucosal parts of the body. However, its presence in specimens of immunocompromised individuals, especially in HIV-positive patients, is of major medical concern. There is a large fraction of genomes of C. dubliniensis in the database which are uncharacterized for their biochemical, biophysical, and/or cellular functions, and are identified as hypothetical proteins (HPs). Function annotation of Candida genome is, therefore, essentially required to facilitate the understanding of mechanisms of pathogenesis and biochemical pathways important for selecting novel therapeutic target. Here, we carried out an extensive analysis to explain the functional properties of genome, using available protein structure and function analysis tools. We successfully modeled the structures of eight HPs for which a template with moderate sequence similarity was available in the protein data bank. All modeled structures were analyzed and we found that these proteins may act as transporter, kinase, transferase, ketosteroid, isomerase, hydrolase, oxidoreductase, and binding targets for DNA and RNA. Since these unique HPs of Candida showed no homologs in humans, these proteins are expected to be a potential target for future antifungal therapy.",

To obtain high frequency response with enhanced shoot multiplication rate, 32 plant growth regulator regimes were screened amongst which benzylaminopurine at 5.0 mg/l was found most suitable, yielding 100 % response and maximum number of shoots per explant (7.93); same concentration was also most supportive for repeated multiplication (6.53 shoots). The quality of the shoots and multiplication rate could be significantly enhanced (24.35 shoots) when adenine sulphate, glutamine and phloroglucinol, in an optimised concentration, were additionally supplemented. The clonal nature of the micropropagated plants was confirmed by random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis. A comparative analysis of AChEI activity was carried out amongst the methanolic extracts of stem segments of the mother plant, randomly selected seedlings of different age (4 and 6 months old) of the same mother plant and randomly selected micropropagated plants of different age (3 and 6 months age). The mother plant sample showed effective AChEI activity, with IC50 of 66.46 μg/ml while seedlings, of different age groups, performed poorly (6-month-old seedlings, Se-16M, yielded IC50 of 20,538.46 μg/ml, while two randomly selected 4 months’ aged seedlings, Se-24M and Se-34M exhibited IC50 of 19,341.03 and 24,281.70 μg/ml). On the other hand, various micropropagated plants, 2 of 3 months (MiP-13M, MiP-23M) and 2 of 6 months (MiP-36M and MiP-46M) age behaved like the mother plant, exhibiting IC50 values of 71.87, 72.91, 67.65 and 69.65 μg/ml, respectively.",

The potential of carbon dioxide (CO2) fixation by Chlorella pyrenoidosa in enriched bicarbonate medium was evaluated. In the present study, effects of parameters such as pH, sodium bicarbonate concentration and inoculum size were assessed for the removal of CO2 by C. pyrenoidosa under mixotrophic condition. Central composite design tool from response surface methodology was used to validate statistical methods in order to study the influence of these parameters. The obtained results reveal that the maximum removal of CO2 was attained at pH 8 with sodium bicarbonate concentration of 3.33 g/l, and inoculum size of 30 %. The experimental results were statistically significant with R 2 value of 0.9527 and 0.960 for CO2 removal and accumulation of chlorophyll content, respectively. Among the various interactions, interactive effects between the parameters pH and inoculum size was statistically significant (P < 0.05) for CO2 removal and chlorophyll accumulation. Based on the studies, the application of C. pyrenoidosa as a potential source for carbon dioxide removal at alkaline pH from bicarbonate source is highlighted.",

Twenty-five RAPD and twenty-one ISSR primers that generated clear and reproducible banding patterns amplified 225 and 208 bands, respectively, among 20 sandalwood genotypes. Out of 225, 181 (83.13 %) RAPD bands were polymorphic while out of 208, 156 (75.77 %) ISSR bands were polymorphic. The average polymorphism information content (PIC) for RAPD and ISSR was 0.84 and 0.86, respectively. A good correlation (0.96) was observed between the matrices produced by RAPD and ISSR primers. Though, there was high similarity among genotypes (0.79 for RAPD and 0.70 for ISSR), the observed genetic diversity was found good enough for the characterization of sandalwood genotypes. Cross-species transferability SSR markers developed in S. austrocaledonicum and S. insulare were found to be monomorphic. The results of the present investigation would provide valid guidelines for collection, conservation and characterization of sandalwood genetic resources.",

The available methods are mostly based on direct lysis which leads to DNA shearing and co-extraction of extra cellular DNA that influences the community and functional analysis. Moreover, during extraction of DNA by direct lysis from athalassohaline soil, it was observed that, upon addition of poly ethylene glycol (PEG), isopropanol or absolute ethanol for precipitation of DNA, salt precipitates out and affecting DNA yield significantly. Therefore, indirect lysis method was optimized for extraction of environmental DNA from such soil containing high salts and low microbial biomass (CFU 4.3 × 104 per gram soil) using newly formulated cell extraction buffer in combination with low and high speed centrifugation. The cell extraction buffer composition and its concentration were optimized and PEG 8000 (1 %; w/v) and 1 M NaCl gave maximum cell mass for DNA extraction. The cell extraction efficiency was assessed with acridine orange staining of soil samples before and after cell extraction. The efficiency, reproducibility and purity of extracted DNA by newly developed procedure were compared with previously recognized methods and kits having different protocols including indirect lysis. The extracted environmental DNA showed better yield (5.6 ± 0.7 μg g-1) along with high purity ratios. The purity of DNA was validated by assessing its usability in various molecular techniques like restriction enzyme digestion, amplification of 16S rRNA gene using PCR and UV-Visible spectroscopy analysis.",

Maximum keratinase activity was observed at 48 h (89.12 U ml−1) showed 83 % of native black feather degradation. The concentration of free sulfhydryl groups released during degradation was 0.648 × 10−4 M (12 h), 2.144 × 10−4 M (96 h), and however, declined on prolong incubation to 1.752 × 10−4 M (120 h). Melanin was released in the degradation medium after microbial exploitation of black feather. After purification, melanin was dark brown colored powder insoluble in water, 5 M HCL, ethanol, methanol, benzene, chloroform, and acetone; whereas, soluble in KOH and NaOH. On exposure to oxidizing and reducing reagents feather melanin showed decolorization, while formed a brown precipitate when reacted with FeCl3. The spectroscopic characterization of isolated melanin demonstrated absorption at infra-red region. Similarly, UV–visible scan confirmed that increase in the wavelength progressively declined the absorbance of pigment. The crude keratinase enzyme (2 % v/v) produced during degradation showed complete dehairing of goat skin within 20 h.",

The availability of commercial kits for isolation of genomic DNAs from soil has drastically expedited the application of metagenomics approach for identifying novel sources of industrially important enzymes. The quantitative and qualitative assessment of metagenomic DNA isolated using either the manual method or the kit-based method should be performed prior to its use in downstream applications. The metagenomic DNA isolated from six different soil samples, using three methods, were analyzed in terms of yield, quality and downstream application as template for PCR amplification. The yield of DNA was approximately 3.52, 7.35, and 232.42 μg of DNA per gram of soil sample for the kit-based method, kit-modified method, and manual method, respectively. The manual method seems to be promising based on better yield and lesser humic acid content than the other two methods. The maximum yield was obtained in the soil collected from teak forest with all the three methods, indicating maximum microbial content and diversity. Furthermore, in terms of its suitability as template DNA for PCR amplification using 16S RNA primer, all methods are equally well. Thus, comparative assessment of three methods revealed suitability of manual method based on DNA yield and humic acid content, which could be important for many downstream applications like library preparations during metageomics approach.",

Our objective in this study was to identify anthocyanin-related genes in black rice plants. We identified anthocyanin-related genes in black rice plants using a combination of whole-genome resequencing, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), microarray experiments, and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Using multi-layer screening from 30 rice accessions, we identified 172,922 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 1276 differentially expressed genes that appear to be related to anthocyanin biosynthesis. We identified 18 putative genes from 172,922 SNPs using intensive selective sweeps. The 18 candidate genes identified from SNPs were not significantly correlated with the RNA-seq expression pattern or other well-known anthocyanin biosynthesis/metabolism genes. We also identified nine putative genes from 1276 differentially expressed genes using RNA-seq transcriptome analysis. In addition, we identified four phylogenetic groups from these nine candidate genes and 51 pathway-network genes. Finally, we verified nine anthocyanin-related genes using a newly designed microarray and semi-quantitative RT-PCR. We suggest that these nine identified genes appear to be related to the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis and/or metabolism.",

    "abstract": "β-Galactosidase is widely used for hydrolysis of whey lactose. However, galactose inhibition has acted as a major constraint on the catalytic process. Thus, it is sensible to improve upon this defect in β-galactosidase through protein modification. To reduce the galactose inhibition of Aspergillus candidus β-galactosidase (LACB), four amino acid positions were selected for mutation based on their molecular bindings with galactose. Four mutant libraries (Tyr96, Asn140, Glu142, and Tyr364) of the LACB were constructed using site-directed mutagenesis. Among all of the mutants, Y364F was superior to the wild-type enzyme. The Y364F mutant has a galactose inhibition constant (Ki) of 282 mM, 15.7-fold greater than that of the wild-type enzyme (Ki = 18 mM). When 18 mg/ml galactose was added, the activity of the wild-type enzyme fell to 57% of its initial activity, whereas Y364F activity was maintained at over 90% of its initial activity. The wild-type enzyme hydrolyzed 78% of the initial lactose (240 mg/ml) after 48 h, while the Y364F mutant had a hydrolysis rate greater than 90%. The β-galactosidase Y364F mutant with reduced galactose inhibition may have greater potential applications in whey treatment compared to wild-type LACB.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic relationship of 22 FLPs was revealed on the basis of polymorphism in three genes namely 16S rDNA, Pseudomonas-specific and rpoD gene regions. The primers for 16S rDNA, Pseudomonas-specific region and rpoD gene region were amplifying a region of 1492, 990 and 760 bp, respectively, from all the isolates investigated. The RFLP analysis of the PCR products resulted in a classification of these fluorescent pseudomonads which was best answered by rpoD-based RFLP analysis. The 22 FLPs were placed in two major clusters and seven subclusters suggesting that these were genotypically heterogenous and might belong to several species within Pseudomonas sensu stricto. Sequence analysis of these three genes for three selected isolates AS5, AS7 and AS15 showed 16S rDNA and Pseudomonas-specific gene region phylogenies were generally similar, but rpoD gene phylogeny was somewhat different from these two genes. These results were also congruent with the results of RFLP of these three genes. rpoD provided comparable phylogenetic resolution to that of the 16S rRNA and Pseudomonas-specific genes at all taxonomic levels, except between closely related organisms (species and subspecies levels), for which it provided better resolution. This is particularly relevant in the context of a growing number of studies focusing on subspecies diversity, in which single-copy protein-encoding genes such as rpoD could complement and better justify the information provided by the 16S rRNA gene. Hence rpoD can be used further as an evolutionary chronometer for species-level identification.",

This research was therefore aimed to collect, screen, characterize and identify potential cellulase-free xylanase producers. A total of 313 microbial isolates were collected while using selective media (EBAM and XAM) to determine the xylanolytic potential of microbes. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed and finally 11 bacterial and 6 fungal strains were selected for characterization and identification. The potential isolates were identified as Bacillus pumilus (388.82 U/mg), Bacillus safensis (385.26 U/mg), Aspergillus flavus (493.33 U/mg) and Aspergillus niger (419.33 U/mg).

Members of Andrographis plants possess important medicinal properties. In the present study, anti-cancerous properties of Andrographis nallamalayana (AN) were tested on A375 and B16F10 skin melanoma cancer cell lines. The leaf extracts of AN significantly reduced the cell viability and cell survival of skin cancer cell lines, achieved by MTT assay and clonogenic assays, respectively. Further, TUNEL assays revealed that AN extracts induces the apoptosis. Western blot analysis revealed that AN leaf extracts reduced the expression of Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic protein and induced the expression of proapoptotic molecules such as Bcl-2 associated death promoter protein (BAD), Bcl-2 associated X protein (BAX) and cleaved caspase-3. Moreover, the qRT-PCR and western blot analysis demonstrated the reduced expression of G2/M phase proteins cdk1, cyclin B1 and increased expression of p53, cyclin-dependent kinase 1 inhibitor, p21. Further, immunofluorescence analysis revealed that AN reduced the NF-κB nuclear translocation, luciferase reporter assays demonstrated reporter gene activation. qRT-PCR assays showed that AN significantly reduced the expression of NF-κB target genes. The results concluded that the extracts of AN exhibited significant anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic activities on melanoma skin cancer cell lines.",

    "abstract": "Plant-microbial interaction in rhizosphere plays vital role in shaping plant's growth and ecosystem function. Most of the rhizospheric microbial diversity studies are restricted to bacteria. In natural ecosystem, archaea also constitutes a major component of the microbial population. However, their diversity is less known compared to bacteria. Experiments were carried out to examine diversity of bacteria and archaea in the rhizosphere of bioenergy crop Jatropha curcas (J. curcas). Samples were collected from three locations varying widely in the soil physico-chemical properties. Diversity was estimated by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) targeting 16S rRNA gene of bacteria and archaea. Fifteen bacterial and 17 archaeal terminal restriction fragments (TRFs) were retrieved from J. curcas rhizosphere. Bacterial indicative TRFs were Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Acidobacteria, Verrumicrobiaceae, and Chlroflexi. Major archaeal TRFs were crenarchaeota, and euryarchaeota. In case of bacteria, relative fluorescence was low for TRF160 and high for TRF51, TRF 420. Similarly, for archaea relative fluorescence of TRF 218, and TRF 282 was low and high for TRF 278, TRF468 and TRF93. Principal component analysis (PCA) of bacterial TRFs designated PC 1 with 46.83% of variation and PC2 with 31.07% variation. Archaeal TRFs designated 90.94% of variation by PC1 and 9.05% by PC2. Simpson index varied from 0.530 to 0.880 and Shannon index from 1.462 to 3.139 for bacteria. For archaea, Simpson index varied from 0.855 to 0.897 and Shannon index varied from 3.027 to 3.155. Study concluded that rhizosphere of J. curcas constituted of diverse set of both bacteria and archaea, which might have promising plant growth promoting activities.",

    "abstract": "Genetic variation of 36 Sechium edule accessions collected across 12 states in India was assessed using morphological traits and DAMD markers. Eighteen fruit morphological traits (both qualitative and quantitative) were evaluated to confirm the variations in the present collection. Quantitative traits showed major variations with respect to fruit weight (7.85-498.33 g/fruit), fruit length (5.8-15 cm/fruit), fruit diameter (6-28 cm/fruit) and length of the spine (0-5 cm). Qualitative traits were also diverse in fruit colour, shape, spine density, reticulation, flexibility of spine and furrow depth. The first six principle components showed 82.88% variation in the principal component analysis. The principal component analysis revealed that fruit weight, fruit width, fruit diameter, fruit shape, length of spine, spine density and furrow depth had a significant contribution to the total variation. The DNA analysis performed using DAMD primers were used for deducing the diversity at DNA level. The collection produced 102 bands out of which 97 were polymorphic and the percentage polymorphism ranged between 66.66 and 100 per primer. Discrete pattern of clustering was obtained using UPGMA method of complete linkage percent disagreement revealing high diversity among the collected accessions. Thus, the present study indicates that molecular and morphological marker map would improve our knowledge of S. edule and would facilitate efforts to breed improved S. edule cultivars.",

    "abstract": "Acute and chronic pollution of environments with crude oil does not bode well for biota living within the vicinity of polluted environments. This is due to environmental and public health concerns on the negative impact of crude oil pollution on living organisms. Enhancing microbial activities by adding nutrients and other amendments had proved effective in pollutant removal during bioremediation. This study was carried out to determine how microbial group respond during remediation by enhanced natural attenuation (RENA) during a field-scale bioremediation. Crude oil-polluted soil samples were collected (before, during, and after remediation) from a site undergoing remediation by enhanced natural attenuation (RENA) at Ikarama Community, Bayelsa State, Nigeria, and were analyzed for total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH), polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), and a shift in microbial community. The gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) results showed that the pollutant concentrations (TPH and PAH) reduced by 98 and 85%, respectively, after the remediation. Culturable hydrocarbon utilizing bacteria (CHUB) was highest (8.3 × 104 cfu/g) for sample collected during the remediation studies, whilst sample collected after remediation had low CHUB (6.1 × 104 cfu/g) compared to that collected before remediation (7.7 × 104 cfu/g). Analysis of 16S rRNA of the isolated CHUB showed they belonged to eight bacterial genera namely: Achromobacter, Alcaligenes, Azospirillus, Bacillus, Lysinibacillus, Ochrobactrum, Proteus, and Pusillimonas, with Alcaligenes as the dominant genus. In this study, it was observed that the bacterial community shifted from mixed group (Gram-positive and -negative) before and during the remediation, to only the latter group after the remediation studies. The betaproteobacteria groups were the dominant isolated bacterial phylotype. This study showed that RENA is an effective method of reducing pollutant concentration in crude oil-polluted sites, and could be applied to other polluted sites in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria to mitigate the devastating effects of crude oil pollution.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Depression and anxiety are the most crippling neuropsychiatric disorders of this modern era. These mostly occur as anxiety followed by depression or in mixed state. Therefore, there is an urgent need of a safe and effective treatment, which proves its worth in this ailment. What else than a conventional food would be a better choice for a convenient therapy. Therefore, Garcinia indica, commonly known as Kokam, fruit rind has been used in the present study to investigate its antidepressant and anti-anxiety potential using forced swim test, tail suspension test, and reserpine-induced hypothermia; and elevated plus maze, hole-board test, and light dark model, respectively. Garcinia indica fruit rind given to mice with food for consecutive 14 days at 0.5, 1, and 2% w/w significantly ( p &lt; 0.05) reduced despair behavior in forced swim test, immobility duration in tail suspension test, and also switched the hypothermia (reserpine induced) to normal temperature significantly ( p &lt; 0.05). Garcinia indica significantly ( p &lt; 0.05) raised the time elapsed and count of entries in open arms of elevated plus maze, enhanced incidence of head dipping in holes of hole board along with duration of expending time in lit compartment of light dark model, exhibiting its anti-anxiety effect. Garcinia indica significantly reduced monoamine oxidase and malondialdehyde levels providing support to neuroprotective potential of fruit rind. The mechanistic study showed the participation of G. indica at α 1 -adrenoceptor and D 2 -dopamine receptor, by attenuating prazosin and sulpiride-induced increase in immobility duration. Garcinia indica fruit rind showed a significant antidepressant and anxiolytic effect while no effect on locomotor activity, i.e., no psycho-stimulation.",

    "abstract": "Mosquitoes are exceptionally efficient in detecting their hosts for blood meal using odorant binding proteins, viz. 3N7H and 3Q8I and spread several dreadful diseases. DEET is a synthetic mosquito repellent widely used all over world for protection against mosquito bite. Reports reveal that, synthetic mosquito repellents may pose health problems in considerably large population. In view of the above fact, we made an attempt to discover efficient and novel natural mosquito repellent compounds with least impact on human health. Methanolic leaf extracts of Ocimum basilicum Linn. var. pilosum (willd.)-Benth and Ocimum tenuiflorum var. CIM-AYU were subjected to GC–MS analysis and obtained 35 phytochemical constituents. Repellent potentiality of the Ocimum compounds was assessed against 3Q8I and 3N7H of Anopheles gambiae. PDB structures of mosquito odorant binding proteins were downloaded, processed and docking studies were performed along with reference ligand DEET using Schrodinger MAESTRO 9.2 software. Molecular docking results reveal that phenol, 2-methoxy-3-(2-propenyl)-, licopersin, gamma sitosterol and benzene, 1,2-dimethoxy-4-(2-propenyl)- from O. tenuiflorum var. CIM-AYU are strongly bound with 3N7H. Whereas, 4h-1-benzopyran-4-one, 5-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxy-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-, catechol and monoacetin from O. basilicum Linn. var. pilosum (willd.)-Benth. show high binding affinity with odorant binding protein 3Q8I. All natural compounds tested in the present study display better docking scores than DEET. The results further substantiate that the 12 out of 35 compounds of the two Ocimum species found to be ideal candidates for design and development of potential mosquito repellents. ADME properties of the tested compounds further confirm that bioactive compounds of Ocimum species were found to be in acceptable range. Synchronized application of at least two different natural compounds (with best docking scores) which target 3N7H and 3Q8I (Odorant Binding Proteins of mosquito) proteins may provide enhanced protection against mosquitoes bite. Based on the ADME properties, natural compounds of Ocimum species can be considered for design and development of safe mosquito repellents.",

    "abstract": "An efficient keratinolytic strain of Stenorophomonas maltophilia KB13 was isolated from feather disposal site of Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh, India. The strain could metabolize 10 g/l chicken feathers as sole source of carbon and nitrogen. Soluble protein, amino acid, and cysteine content were found to be maximum (690.6 ± 8.7, 688.9 ± 9.12 and 21 ± 0.36 µg/ml, respectively) at late logarithmic phase of growth. Protease and keratinase activity reached its maximum level (103.26 ± 7.09 and 178.5 ± 9.10 U/ml) at the 4th day of incubation. The feather protein hydrolysate (FPH) obtained after degradation of chicken feathers was utilized to reduce hexavalent chromium. About 78.4 ± 2.4 and 63.6 ± 2.2 % reduction of 50 and 100 mg/l Cr(VI), respectively, was observed after 60 min of incubation with FPH. Further, there was no effect of autoclaved FPH on Cr(VI) reduction indicating that any bacterial enzyme was not involved in reduction process. Cr(VI) reduction was significantly inhibited by 10 mm Hg2+ ions indicating the role of sulfur-containing amino acids in reduction process. FTIR analysis confirmed that chromium reduction occurred due to oxidation of amino acids cysteine and cystine. This study shows that FPH arising after feather degradation can be employed as a potential candidate for the reduction of hexavalant chromium.",

Candida tropicalis strains gave the highest results with 83.28 and 54.07 g/L xylitol production from 100 g/L xylose. Lignocellulosic materials were exposed to acid hydrolysis at different conditions. Chestnut shells gave the highest xylose yield and the hydrolysate of chestnut shells was used in further experiments in which xylitol productions of two potential C. tropicalis strains were investigated. Combined detoxification method including evaporation, overliming and activated charcoal with the use of threefold concentration and also yeast extract supplementation suggested to be efficient for both growth and product formation in chestnut shell hydrolysate in which 40 % xylitol yield was obtained. It was concluded that detoxified and fortified chestnut shell hydrolysate could be a potential medium for xylitol production.",

The experimental results made by statistical design for high pectinase production revealed that the suitable media components: NaNO3 2.0 g/l, KCl 0.50 g/l, KH2PO4 1.0 g/l, MgSO4·7H2O 0.50 g/l, Yeast extract 1.0 g/l, mango industrial waste powder 5.0 g/l. The actual pectinase activity was 75.23 % correlated with the predicted pectinase activity where the model (CCD) was significant. Response surface modelling applied effectively to optimize the production of pectinase in submerged fermentation to make the process low cost-effective by using powdered mango industrial waste as substrate.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is a polygenic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia occurring as a result of impaired insulin secretion or insulin resistance. Various environmental and genetic factors interact and increase the risk of T2DM and its complications. Among the various genetic factors associated with T2DM, single nucleotide polymorphism in different candidate genes have been studied intensively and the resulting genetic variants have been found to have either positive or negative association with T2DM thereby increasing or decreasing the risk of T2DM, respectively. In this review, we will focus on Guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit beta 3 (GNB3), Norepinephrine Transporter (NET), Potassium Channel gene (KCNJ11), Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 (TCF7L2) and Glucocorticoid receptor (GRL) genes and their association with T2DM studied in different ethnic groups. The products of these genes are involved in the biochemical pathway leading to T2DM. Polymorphisms in these genes have been intensively studied in individuals of different ethnic origins. Results show that genetic variants of TCF7L2 and KCNJ11 genes have potential to emerge as a risk biomarker for T2DM whereas results of GNB3, GRL and NET genes have been controversial when studied in individuals of different ethnicities. We have tried to summarize the results generated globally in context to the selected genes which could possibly help researchers working in this field and would eventually help in understanding the mechanistic pathways of T2DM leading early diagnosis and prevention.",

Throughout the storage period (at 9-day intervals), different antioxidants and biochemical assays (allied with storage) such as titratable acidity, ascorbic acid content, ferrous ion chelating activity, reducing power, DPPH scavenging activity, hydroxyl radical scavenging activity, total phenolic content, total sugar estimation, and enzymatic study of polyphenol oxidase and pectate lyase, were assessed. During storage, the castor oil-coated fruits showed a substantial decrease in titratable acidity, ascorbic acid content, total phenolic content, including antioxidant activities such as reducing power and DPPH activity; however, an increase in ferrous ion chelating activity, total soluble sugar content, polyphenol oxidase activity and initial pectate lyase activity was observed, in contrast to that of the non-coated fruits.

    "abstract": "Very few studies have been dedicated to R-hydroxyacids (R-HA) production using extracellular polyhydroxyalkanoate depolymerases (ePhaZs). Penicillium expansum produced maximum extracellular polyhydroxybutyrate depolymerase (~6 U/mL) by 72 h when grown in mineral salt medium containing 0.2 % w/v PHB, pH 5.0, at 30 °C and 200 rpm shaking conditions. Partial purification of the extracellular poly(-β-hydroxybutyrate) depolymerase PHAZ Pen from P. expansum by two steps using ammonium sulphate (80 % saturation) and affinity chromatography using concanavalin A yielded 22.76-fold purity and 43.15 % recovery of protein. The enzyme composed of a single polypeptide chain of apparent molecular mass of 20 kDa, as determined by SDS-PAGE, stained positive for glycoprotein by periodic–schiff base (PAS) staining. Optimum enzyme activity was detected between pH 4.0 and 6.0 at 45–50 °C with pH 5.0 and 50 °C supporting maximum activity. The enzyme was stable between pH 4.0 and 6.0 at 55 °C for 1 h with a residual activity of almost 70–80 %. The enzyme was completely inhibited by 1 mM DTT/1 mM HgCl2 and N-ethylmaleimide (10 mM) indicating the importance of essential disulphide bonds (cystine residues) and tyrosine for enzyme activity or probably for maintaining the native enzyme structure. Among the various divalent and trivalent metal ions, mercuric chloride, ferric citrate and ferrous sulphate inhibited enzyme activity. The enzyme showed substrate specificity towards only PHB and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) and no other lipid or other p-nitrophenyl fatty acids or with polycaprolactone, showing that it was a true depolymerase and not any lipase or cutinase. Preliminary investigation revealed β-hydroxybutyrate as the end product of PHB hydrolysis by P. expansum, suggesting that the enzyme acted principally as an exo-type hydrolase. The above properties when compared with other fungal PHB depolymerases reported till date suggest the distinct nature of the PHB depolymerase of P. expansum.",

    "abstract": "L-Lysine is an essential amino acid with high commercial importance, as it has to be available in sufficient quantities in animal and human feeds to meet their nutritional requirement. As there is constant increase in L-lysine demand every year, to meet the increasing demand it is necessary to produce L-lysine in large scale. Generally, L-lysine is produced by batch fermentation. In the present investigation, different fermentation process parameters such as fermentation time, pH, temperature, glucose concentration, airflow rate and aeration rate were studied to optimize the production of L-lysine by Corynebacterium glutamicum MH 20-22 B in a 5 L laboratory-scale stirred tank bioreactor. A comparative study of L-lysine production with free cells and immobilized cells of C. glutamicum MH 20-22 B was also investigated to determine whether free cells or immobilized cells were advantageous for production of L-lysine. In this way, optimized fermentation upstream parameters which produced the maximum yield of L-lysine were developed and it was also concluded from the present study that immobilized cells of C. glutamicum MH 20-22 B were more advantageous for L-lysine production as they yield more L-lysine compared to free cells of C. glutamicum MH 20-22 B. It was observed in the present study that the optimum values of fermentation time, pH, temperature, glucose concentration, airflow rate and aeration rate were 96 h, 7.5, 30 °C, 90 g/l, 1.0 vvm and 200 rpm, respectively, by immobilized cells, whereas in case of free cells the optimum values were 72 h, 7.5, 30 °C, 80 g/l, 1.25 vvm and 300 rpm. Immobilized C. glutamicum MH 20-22 B cells exhibited greater L-lysine production of 31.58 g/l than free cells which produced 26.34 g/l of L-lysine.",

    "abstract": "Haemophilus influenzae is a small pleomorphic Gram-negative bacteria which causes several chronic diseases, including bacteremia, meningitis, cellulitis, epiglottitis, septic arthritis, pneumonia, and empyema. Here we extensively analyzed the sequenced genome of H. influenzae strain Rd KW20 using protein family databases, protein structure prediction, pathways and genome context methods to assign a precise function to proteins whose functions are unknown. These proteins are termed as hypothetical proteins (HPs), for which no experimental information is available. Function prediction of these proteins would surely be supportive to precisely understand the biochemical pathways and mechanism of pathogenesis of Haemophilus influenzae. During the extensive analysis of H. influenzae genome, we found the presence of eight HPs showing lyase activity. Subsequently, we modeled and analyzed three-dimensional structure of all these HPs to determine their functions more precisely. We found these HPs possess cystathionine-β-synthase, cyclase, carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase, pseudouridine synthase A and C, D-tagatose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase and aminodeoxychorismate lyase-like features, indicating their corresponding functions in the H. influenzae. Lyases are actively involved in the regulation of biosynthesis of various hormones, metabolic pathways, signal transduction, and DNA repair. Lyases are also considered as a key player for various biological processes. These enzymes are critically essential for the survival and pathogenesis of H. influenzae and, therefore, these enzymes may be considered as a potential target for structure-based rational drug design. Our structure–function relationship analysis will be useful to search and design potential lead molecules based on the structure of these lyases, for drug design and discovery.",

Effective methods of treatment which can detoxify cyanide are the need of the hour. The aim of the present study is to develop a bioreactor for complete degradation of cyanide using immobilized cells of Serratia marcescens RL2b. Alginate-entrapped cells of S. marcescens RL2b were used for complete degradation of cyanide in a packed bed reactor (PBR). Cells grown in minimal salt medium (pH 6.0) were harvested after 20 h and exhibited 0.4 U mg−1 dcw activity and 99 % cyanide degradation in 10 h. These resting cells were entrapped using 3 % alginate beads and packed in a column reactor (20 × 1.7 cm). Simulated cyanide (12 mmol l−1)-containing wastewater was loaded and fractions were collected after different time intervals at various flow rates. Complete degradation of 12 m mmol l−1 (780 mg l−1) cyanide in 10 h was observed at a flow rate of 1.5 ml h−1. The degradation of cyanide in PBR showed direct dependence on retention time. The retention time of cyanide in the reactor was 9.27 h. The PBR can degrade 1.2 g of cyanide completely in 1 day.",

Accidental feeding of AFB1-contaminated rice straw may be detrimental to dairy cattle. White-rot basidiomycetous fungus Pleurotus ostreatus can grow on different agronomic wastes by synthesizing different ligninolytic enzymes. These extracellular enzymes are capable of degrading many environmentally hazardous compounds including AFB1. The present study examines the ability of different strains of P. ostreatus to degrade AFB1 in contaminated rice straw. Different strains of A. flavus were inoculated on rice straw for AFB1 production. The moldy straw was then subjected to co-cultivation by different strains of P. ostreatus. The extent of AFB1 degradation was determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Results indicated the presence of AFB1 in the moldy straw samples at levels of 27.95 ± 0.23 and 21.26 ± 0.55 µg/g of dry substrate for A. flavus MTCC 2798 and A. flavus GHBF09, respectively. Co-cultivation of P. ostreatus strains on AFB1-contaminated rice straw revealed their ability to rapidly colonize the substrate by profuse hyphal ramification. Highest degradation of AFB1 (89.41 %) was recorded in the straw containing co-cultures of A. flavus MTCC 2798 and P. ostreatus GHBBF10. Natural isolate P. ostreatus GHBBF10 demonstrated higher AFB1-degradation potential than P.ostreatus MTCC 142. This basidiomycete strain can be further exploited to effectively degrade moderate concentrations of AFB1 in contaminated moldy rice straw.",

To achieve maximum enzyme production, the medium components affecting cutinase production were screened by Plackett–Burman followed by central composite design. The results obtained suggested that cutin, temperature and CaCl2 have influenced the cutinase production significantly with very high confidence levels. Cutinase production was maximum (663 U/mg protein) when using cutin prepared from orange peel as sole source of carbon. An overall 4.33-fold increase in the production of cutinase was observed after optimization of culture conditions (including 2.5-fold increase using RSM) during 24 h of incubation.

They belonged to both traditional (Desulfovibrio, Desulfotomaculum) and non-traditional (Citrobacter) sulfate-reducing bacteria. All the isolates were able to produce a high amount of sulfide. However, only traditional isolates were showing the amplification for the SRB-specific gene, dsrAB.

Enzyme activity before immobilization (at 60 °C, pH 8.0 for 5 min) was 3580 µg/ml/min.

    "abstract": "In the present study, the effects of chemical fertilizer (CF) and organic fertilizer plus chemical fertilizer application (OF-CF) on natural rubber yield, soil properties, and soil bacterial community were systematically investigated in rubber plantations. The rubber dry yield was 26.3% more in the OF treatment group than in the CF treatment group. The contents of total nitrogen (TN), available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP), and available potassium (AK) as well as soil organic matter (SOM) and pH value were higher following OF-CF treatment. Using Illumina sequencing, a total of 927 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained following CF treatment, while 955 OTUs were obtained after OF-CF treatment. Relative abundance analysis showed the relative abundances of four phyla (Acidobacteria, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes) were different between the two treatment groups. Correlation analysis revealed Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Thaumarchaeota, Elusimicrobia, Verrucomicrobia were the key taxa that determined the soil properties. Additionally, five OTUs (OTU_506, OTU_391, OTU_189, OTU_278, OTU_1057) were thought to be related to the biodegradation of natural rubber. Taken together, these results improve our understanding of the OF-mediated improvement in soil fertility and contribute to the identification of rubber-degrading bacteria in rubber plantations.",

It possesses a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA of ~ 30 kb nucleotides as its genetic material. It is responsible for COVID-19 which has been declared a pandemic by WHO. Having reported for the first time in Wuhan, China, the virus infected over 21.48 million people and caused over 0.77 million deaths till mid-august 2020. SARS-CoV-2 contains the spike protein site that gets activated by an enzyme furin which is found in the lung, liver, and small intestine of humans. It shows the potentiality of virus for attacking multiple organs and their failures. Due to the absence of vaccines, the cure is restricted to supportive care including repurposed drugs. In silico approaches may offer an alternative screening to optimize hits to lead stages. It can provide important related to drug resistance, their lineages and evolution. This approach may also help to find an effective vaccine against COVID-19. This review focuses on the in silico aspects of genomics, proteomics, pathogenesis, phylogenetic analysis and viral receptor binding analysis in Betacoronavirus.",

To improve the efficiency of cellulase expression of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a eukaryotic expression vector harboring a single-enzyme-system-three-cellulase gene (sestc) was integrated into the S. cerevisiae genome by the protoplast method. Using PCR screening, RT-PCR, and \"transparent circle\" detection, several recombinant S. cerevisiae strains, capable of efficiently expressing the heterogeneous cellulase, were selected. The total activity of cellulase, endo-β-D-glucanase, exo-β-D-glucanase, and xylanase of the recombinant S. cerevisiae transformant (designated number 14) was 1.1, 378, 1.44, and 164 U ml-1, respectively, which was 27.5-, 63-, 24-, and 19-fold higher than that of the wild-type strain. The concentration of ethanol produced by the engineered S. cerevisiae strain was 8.1 gl-1, with wheat bran as the carbon source, under submerged conditions; this was 57.86-fold higher than that produced by the wild-type strain (0.14 gl-1).",

In this study, effect of vanillin, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde and acetate on antibiotic production in Streptomyces coelicolor is investigated. IC 50 value of vanillin, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde and acetate was recorded as 5, 11.3 and 115 mM, respectively. Vanillin was found as a very effective molecule, and it completely abolished antibiotic (undecylprodigiosin and actinorhodin) production at 1 mM concentration, while 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde and acetate have little effect. Microscopic analysis with field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) showed that addition of vanillin inhibits mycelia formation and increases differentiation of S. coelicolor cells. Vanillin increases expression of genes responsible for sporulation (ssgA) and decreases expression of antibiotic transcriptional regulator (redD and actII-orf4), while it has no effect on genes related to the mycelia formation (bldA and bldN) and quorum sensing (scbA and scbR). Vanillin does not affect the glycolysis process, but may affect acetate and pyruvate accumulation which leads to increase in fatty acid accumulation. The production of antibiotics using biomass hydrolysates can be quite complex due to the presence of exogenous chemicals such as furfural and vanillin, and needs further detailed study.",

In the present study, isolation of sulfosulfuron-degrading Brevibacillus borstelensis and Streptomyces albogriseolus from the field soils in the northwestern region of India was carried out where the use of sulfosulfuron is predominant, and further assessed for their potential to degrade sulfosulfuron individually and together in a consortium form under lab conditions. Concentration of sulfosulfuron was reduced from 10 to 7.72 µg/ml in 12 h to 5.13 µg/ml in 20 h by B. borstelensis and the metabolites detected by LCMS-MS were aminopyrimidine and a rearranged amine in 12 and 20 h of growth. Similarly, S. albogriseolus reduced the concentration of sulfosulfuron from 10 to 6.74 µg/ml in 12 h to 6.62 µg/ml in 20 h with aminopyrimidine and a rearranged amine as metabolites. B. borstelensis and S. albogriseolus together also reduced the concentration of sulfosulfuron from 10 µg/ml in initial hour to 8.34 µg/ml in 12 h to 6.66 µg/ml in 20 h. Hence, B. borstelensis and S. albogriseolus provide a safer, inexpensive and effective way to bio-remediate the harmful and toxic sulfosulfuron from the environment if further explored at a larger field scale in near future.",

The present investigation is a novel attempt to reveal the phylogenetic association of Impatiens species of South India, by placing them in the global phylogeny of Impatiens based on a combined analysis of two chloroplast genes. Thirty species of genus Impatiens were collected from different locations of South India. Total genomic DNA was extracted from fresh plant leaf, and polymerase chain reaction was carried out using atpB–rbcL and trnL-F intergenic spacer-specific forward and reverse primers. Thirteen sequences of Impatiens species from three centers of diversity were obtained from GenBank for reconstructing the evolutionary relationships within the genus Impatiens. Bayesian inference analysis was carried out in MrBayes v.3.2.2. This analysis supported Southeast Asia as the ancestral place of origin of extant Impatiens species. Molecular phylogeny of South Indian Impatiens spp. based on combined chloroplast sequences showed the same association as that of morphological taxonomy. Sections Scapigerae, Tomentosae, Sub-Umbellatae, and Racemosae showed Southeast Asian relationship, while sections Annuae and Microsepalae showed African affinity.",

The genome annotation of the strain DP-K7 through the bioinformatics tool “Prokka” showed that the genome contains 3,010,594 bp with 69.01% GC content. The genome comprises 57 contigs including 2 rRNA genes, 47 tRNA genes, and 2754 CDS. The plate and broth assay showed that the strain DP-K7 has the potential to utilize methyl red as the sole carbon source for growth. Indeed, the RP-HPLC analysis proved that the strain DP-K7 is capable of degrading methyl red. The genome BLAST against a characterized azoreductase (AzoB— Xenophilus azovorans KF46F) revealed the presence of two azoreductase-like genes ( azoKi-1 and azoKi-2 ). The phylogenetic analysis of the primary amino acid sequence of characterized azoreductases suggested that AzoKi-1 and AzoKi-2 belong to members of the clade IV azoreductase, which are flavin-independent. The multiple sequence alignment of AzoKi-1 and AzoKi-2 with flavin-independent azoreductases showed the presence of NAD(P)H binding like motif (GxxGxxG). In addition, other genes coding for dye degrading enzymes (SodC, SodA, KatA, KatE, and DyP2) were also found in the genome supporting that the strain K. indica DP-K7 is a potential azo dye degrader.",

    "abstract": "Rauvolfia serpentina (L.) Benth. ex Kurz., popularly known as Indian Snakeroot plant, belonging to Apocynaceae family, holds immense medicinal importance, owing to its rich source of multiple secondary metabolites such as ajmaline, ajmalicine, reserpine, and serpentine. To meet the constant demands for the key secondary metabolite (reserpine) by majority of the pharmaceutical industries, the present study assessed the effects of direct and indirect regeneration system on amelioration of reserpine accumulation in shoots of R. serpentina. In vitro multiple shoot cultures were established using shoot tip explants. Best results for shoot initiation, multiplication, and biomass production were obtained in case of Murashige and Skoog medium, supplemented with 1 mg/l N6-benzyladenine. The multiple shoots were then sub-cultured on cytokinin-auxin combination media for further proliferation. Highest shoot and leaf multiplication rates and the most enhanced biomass were obtained in case of 1-1.5 mg/l Kinetin + 0.2 mg/l α-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA). Callus induction and its subsequent proliferation was obtained using 1.5 mg/l 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. The best indirect shoot regeneration with highest shoot and leaf proliferation from calli was observed in case of 1 mg/l thidiazuron + 0.2 mg/l NAA. Reserpine content estimation via HPTLC from in vitro shoots (direct regeneration) and calli (indirect regeneration) were recorded to undergo an almost three-fold and two-fold increment (respectively) in comparison to that of the mother plant. Thus, in vitro direct regeneration system proved to be more effective and efficient in ameliorating the reserpine content.",

    "abstract": "At specific genomic loci, miRNAs are in clusters and their association with copy number variations (CNVs) may exhibit abnormal expression in several cancers. Hence, the current study aims to understand the expression of miRNA clusters residing within CNVs and the regulation of their target genes in bladder cancer. To achieve this, we used extensive bioinformatics resources and performed an integrated analysis of recurrent CNVs, clustered miRNA expression, gene expression, and drug-gene interaction datasets. The study identified nine upregulated miRNA clusters that are residing on CNV gain regions and three miRNA clusters (hsa-mir-200c/mir-141, hsa-mir-216a/mir-217, and hsa-mir-15b/mir-16-2) are correlated with patient survival. These clustered miRNAs targeted 89 genes that were downregulated in bladder cancer. Moreover, network and gene enrichment analysis displayed 10 hub genes (CCND2, ETS1, FGF2, FN1, JAK2, JUN, KDR, NOTCH1, PTEN, and ZEB1) which have significant potential for diagnosis and prognosis of bladder cancer patients. Interestingly, hsa-mir-200c/mir-141 and hsa-mir-15b/mir-16-2 cluster candidates showed significant differences in their expression in stage-specific manner during cancer progression. Downregulation of NOTCH1 by hsa-mir-200c/mir-141 may also sensitize tumors to methotrexate thus suggesting potential chemotherapeutic options for bladder cancer subjects. To overcome some computational challenges and reduce the complexity in multistep big data analysis, we developed an automated pipeline called CmiRClustFinder v1.0 (https://github.com/msls-bioinfo/CmiRClustFinder_v1.0), which can perform integrated data analysis of 35 TCGA cancer types.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13205-022-03225-z.",

New isolates and two standard cultures—Azospirillum brasilense and Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus, were evaluated for their morphological, biochemical and molecular characteristics. Morphologically all were rod shaped, Gram-negative bacteria. Their plant growth promotory properties were also assessed which proved isolates RtBn and StBn as IAA producing. Except isolate StBn, all were phosphate solubilising and except RtBn all produced siderophores. Molecular characterisation of the isolates was performed using amplified 16S r-DNA restriction analysis. Similarity index in unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean programme clustered the isolates according to their geographical distribution. Native isolates showed insignificant similarity with South American strains used as standards. nifH amplification was observed with all the isolates used in the study which again establish them as potential N-fixers.",

    "abstract": "The worldwide expansion of hybrid breeding and clonal forestry is to meet the demands of paper pulp and bioenergy. Although India was one of the pioneers in hybrid production of eucalypts only recently the hybrid clonal forestry is gaining momentum. Inter-specific hybrids are being produced to exploit the hybrid vigor of F1 individuals. Quality control genotyping for hybrid purity and parentage confirmation at the early stage is one of the essential criteria for clonal propagation and field trails for the assessment of growth performance. Eucalyptus being a obligatory outcrossed species with potential to self pollination, possibilities of pollen contamination are high. Hence, in the present study, Eucalyptus camaldulensis × E. tereticornis inter-specific hybrids were genotyped using 25 fluorescent labeled microsatellite markers available in public domain. Multiplex loading of PCR products was performed successfully for most of the microsatellite loci. Hybrid purity index was calculated and parentage was confirmed. Hybrid purity values ranged from 85 to 100 % showed the efficiency of controlled pollination techniques. A subset of six fully informative simple sequence repeats was identified for routine quality control genotyping for these hybrids. Detection of non-essential genotypes observed among the hybrid seedlings proved the significance of hybrid purity tests and the false hybrids were removed at the seedling stage. The hybrids with proven hybridity will be used for generation of genetic linkage, discovery of quantitative trait loci and the individuals with high productivity can enter into mass clonal multiplication.",

Asymbiotic seed germination has been applied for ex situ conservation of rare, endangered and threatened orchid taxa and could provide rapid means their multiplication. In the present study reported here, seeds of an epiphytic and rare orchid, Cymbidium eburneum were germinated asymbiotically in different basal media viz., Murashige and Skoog (MS), Knudson C, Mitra et al. (Mitra), Gamborg et al. (B5) and Nitsch. The highest germination rate was observed in Mitra medium, whereas the development of the protocorms was found to be best in MS medium. Effects of growth regulators viz., indole-3 acetic acid (IAA), α-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-d), thidiazuron (TDZ), 6-benzyl aminopurine (BAP) and kinetin (Kn) both singly and in combination incorporated in the MS medium were studied on growth and development of seedlings. It was observed that MS medium nourished with 15 μM each of BAP and NAA in combination was found to enhance shoot number and length, and root number and length in the seedlings. The rooted seedlings were successfully acclimatized.",

    "abstract": "Information on inoculum load and diversity of native microbial community is an important prerequisite for crop management of microbial origin. Azospirillum has a proven role in benefiting the maize (Zea mays) crop in terms of nutrient (nitrogen) supply as well as plant growth enhancement. Bihar state has highest average national maize productivity although fertilizer consumption is minimum, indicating richness of Azospirillum both in terms of population and diversity in soils. An experiment was planned to generate basic information on Azospirillum population variation in maize soils under different agricultural practices and soil types of Bihar, to identify suitable agricultural practices supporting the target microorganism and efficient Azospirillum strain(s). No tillage, growing traditional maize cultivar, land use history (diara soil having history of maize cultivation), soil organic carbon (>1%) and intercrop with oat supported prevalence of Azospirillum in maize rhizosphere. Native Azospirillum population varied from 1 million to 1 billion/g soil under diverse agricultural practices and soil types. Such richness, however, does not necessarily mean that artificial inoculation of Azospirillum is not required in Bihar soils as 92% of Azospirillum isolates (50 isolates) were poor in nitrogen-fixing ability and 88% were poor on IAA production. Efficient strains of Azospirillum based on growth (three), acetylene reduction assay (three), IAA production (three), broad range of pH (two) and temperature tolerance were identified. The findings suggested that maize crop in Bihar should be inoculated in universal mode rather than site-specific mode.",

    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the effect of individual Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions upon the nutrient dynamics and cell morphology during submerged fermentation of Aspergillus giganteus MTCC 8408 in a medium containing ample soluble starch, corn steep liquor and proteose peptone supply. Nutrient dynamics was elucidated using Taguchi's DOE (design of experiment) L8 orthogonal array (OA) with carbon, nitrogen and four most influensive microelements at their assigned ratio namely; K+/Ca2+ and Mg2+/Na+. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to correlate the effect of selected factors on morphological changes and nutrient dynamics during submerged fermentation. At higher K+/Ca2+ ratio 4.78:1; the maximum growth was figured out in terms of dry weight, while the inhibition of dry weight production was observed at higher Mg2+/Na+ ratio 0.94:1 with enhanced intracellular afp production. At lower C/N ratio 27.4:1; filamentous form of growth was maintained with the hyphae being scarcely branched without bulbous cells. Membrane perturbation due to the induction of intracellular oxidative stress was noticed at higher C/N ration. Taguchi DOE resulted in afp yield per substrate utilized, Y p/s of 1.08 mg g-1 soluble starch utilized with gram dry cell weight (gdcw) of 23.9 g L-1 while afp yield per biomass utilized resulted, Y p/x of 1.12 mg afp gdcw-1 L-1 and biomass yield per substrate utilized, Y x/s of 1.195 gdcw g-1 L-1. The present study revealed an opportunity to develop a cost effective methods for cell propagation so as to yield effective inoculum levels towards mass production and formulation studies.",

The diagnosis of sex is very difficult in the dioecious plant prior flowering wherein sex identification at the seedling stage is of great importance to breeders as well as farmers for crop improvement or production purpose. A comprehensive approach of sex determination comprising morphological, biochemical, cytological and molecular attributes is a must required for gender differentiation in dioecious plant species. In the present review, we highlighted the economical, medicinal as well as industrial importance of most of the dioecious species extensively grown in Indian subcontinent. In addition to that, the cytogenetic, genetic as well as molecular information in connection to their sex determination were critically discussed in this review.",

This has raised ecotoxicological concerns due to the release of ENPs to the environment. In the present study, we investigated the effects of interactions of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) on physiological, biochemical, and molecular indices in seedlings of an important oil seed crop Brassica napus L. The seedlings were treated with 0, 20, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 500 mg/L of CuO NPs for 14 days in half-strength semi-solid Murashige and Skoog medium. The CuO NPs treatment significantly reduced shoot and root growth as well as plant biomass. Shortening and thickening of primary and lateral roots and inhibition of lateral root growth was observed at higher concentrations. An increase in reactive oxygen species generation, and malondialdehyde accumulation was observed. Histochemical staining of roots with propidium iodide and aniline blue indicated cell death and callose formation in roots. Transcriptional modulation of genes related to oxidative stress viz. CuZn superoxide dismutase, catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase was observed. Element content analysis showed an increase in Cu content and decrease in Fe, Mn, and Zn contents. Overall, exposure to CuO NPs caused oxidative injury, cell death, callose formation, and decreased the micro nutrient contents in B. napus seedlings.",

The co-injection of modified Cas9-D10A nickase with a pair of sgRNAs into the zygote's cytoplasm easily and efficiently generated biallelic modification of the pULBP1 gene in one step. Five out of nine F0 generation piglets showed insertions or deletions in the targeting site of the pULBP1 gene, indicating that pULBP1 mutation efficiency reached about 56% (5/9). Quantitative determination of pULBP1 showed approximately a 1.53-fold reduction in the amount of protein ULBP1 on the cell surface (ELISA). A human NK-cell cytotoxicity test leads to the conclusion that higher cell viability is observed for −/− ULBP1 (survival rate 85.36%) compared to +/+ ULBP1 (69.58%). ULBP1-KO pigs will provide a more progressive xenograft source for further research studies, especially those measuring the effects of abolishing the gene function in terms of the complexity of the immunological interactions.",

    "abstract": "A bacterium capable of degrading pendimethalin was isolated from the contaminated soil samples and identified as Bacillus lehensis XJU based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. 6-Aminopendimethalin and 3,4-dimethyl 2,6-dinitroaniline were identified as the metabolites of pendimethalin degradation by the bacterium. The biodegradation of pendimethalin by freely suspended and the immobilized cells of B. lehensis on various matrices namely agar, alginate, polyacrylamide, and polyurethane foam was also investigated. The batch degradation rate was nearly the same for both free and immobilized cells in agar and alginate, whereas polyacrylamide- and PUF-immobilized cells degraded 93 and 100 of 0.1 % pendimethalin after 96 and 72 h, respectively. At higher concentration, the degradation rate of freely suspended cells decreased; whereas the same immobilized cells on polyurethane foam completely degraded 0.2 % pendimethalin within 96 h. The repeated batch degradation with the polyurethane foam-immobilized cells was reused for 35 cycles without losing the 0.1 % pendimethalin degrading ability. In contrast, agar-, alginate- and polyacrylamide-immobilized cells could be reused for 15, 18, and 25 cycles, respectively. When the pendimethalin concentration was increased to 0.2 %, the immobilized cells could be reused but the pendimethalin degradation rate was decreased. Polyurethane foam-immobilized cells exhibited better tolerance to pH and temperature alterations than freely suspended cells and could be stored for more than 3 months without losing pendimethalin degrading ability. The immobilization of cells capable of degrading pendimethalin may serve as an ideal technique for the complete degradation of the herbicide in the environment.",

Cyanobacteria administration reduced blood glucose level, and increased plasma insulin, C-peptide levels and restored the body weight. Cyanobacteria administration significantly reduced lipid peroxidation in the diabetic rats. Hexokinase enzyme activity was increased, whereas glucose-6-phosphatase enzyme activity decreased in streptozotocin-diabetic rats compared to their respective controls. Cyanobacteria administration caused significant renormalization of serum hepatic enzymes in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. In conclusion, cyanobacteria have a protective effect on anti-oxidant and anti-diabetic in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.",

Therefore, understanding genetic factors underlying lignin biosynthesis in tossa jute holds promise for jute based product diversification. The major limiting factor in undertaking such study is unavailability of efficient protocol for RNA extraction at secondary growth active stage of tossa jute. Here we report a simplified, swift and cost effective protocol for isolating fairly good quality RNA from bark tissue of 65-days-old field grown tossa jute plant with active secondary growth. The purity, concentration and integrity of extracted RNA ascertained. To confirm downstream amenability, isolated RNA samples were reverse transcribed and PCR analysis done by using CCoAMT1 primer. Results established that method of RNA extraction presented here is an improvement over the other methods, particularly for bark tissue of field grown tossa jute at advance developmental stage. Therefore, present study will enhance our ability to understand expression pattern of fiber formation and maturation related genes in mature bark tissue that holds key for much talked genetic manipulation of fiber quality via lignin optimisation in the crop.",

Since biological detoxification of hazardous chemical compounds has been renowned for its robustness and environmental-friendliness, the ability of the Exiguobacterium acetylicum (GenBank accession number KT282229) and Bacillus marisflavi (GenBank accession number KR016603) to co-metabolise thiocyanate (SCN-) and free cyanide (CN-) under alkaline conditions was evaluated. E. acetylicum had an SCN- degradation efficiency of 99.9 % from an initial SCN- concentration of 150 mg SCN-/L, but the organism was unable to degrade CN-. Consequently, B. marisflavi had a CN- degradation efficiency of 99 % from an initial concentration of 200 mg CN-/L. Similarly, the organism was unable to degrade SCN-; hence, this resulted in the evaluation of co-metabolism of SCN- and CN- by the two microbial species. Optimisation of operational conditions was evaluated using response surface methodology (RSM). A numeric optimisation technique was used to evaluate the optimisation of the input variables i.e. pH, temperature, SCN- and CN- concentrations. The optimum conditions were found to be as follows: pH 9.0, temperature 34 °C, 140 mg SCN-/L and 205 mg CN-/L under which complete SCN- and CN- degradation would be achieved over a 168-h period. Using the optimised data, co-metabolism of SCN- and CN- by both E. acetylicum and B. marisflavi was evaluated, achieving a combined degradation efficiency of ≥99.9 %. The high degradative capacity of these organisms has resulted in their supplementation on an active continuous biological degradation system that is treating both SCN- and CN-.",

Chinese Guike No. 1 pig breed is a novel swine specialized strain incorporated with the pedigree background of Duroc and Chinese Luchuan pig breeds, thus inherits an excellent production performance. The present study was conducted to establish somatic cloning procedures of adult breeding boars from the Chinese Guike No. 1 specialized strain. Ear skin fibroblasts were first isolated from a three-year-old Chinese Guike No. 1 breeding boar, and following that, used as donor cell to produce nuclear transfer embryos. Such cloned embryos showed full in vitro development and with the blastocyst formation rate of 18.4 % (37/201, three independent replicates). Finally, after transferring of 1187 nuclear transfer derived embryos to four surrogate recipients, six live piglets with normal health and development were produced. The overall cloning efficiency was 0.5 % and the clonal provenance of such SCNT derived piglets was confirmed by DNA microsatellite analysis. All of the cloned piglets were clinically healthy and had a normal weight at 1 month of age. Collectively, the first successful cloning of an adult Chinese Guike No. 1 breeding boar may lay the foundation for future improving the pig production industry.",

Among these, about 40% of the isolates showed the presence of secondary metabolite biosynthetic genes such as PKS or NRPS or both. Organic extracts of nearly 50% of these organisms were cytotoxic to human breast cancer MCF-7 cells and were bactericidal to human pathogens, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas sp., while 20-30% of them were bactericidal to Vibrio sp. and Staphylococcus sp. too. In all, 8 isolates, belonging to Pseudomonas spp., Bacillus sp. and/or Lysinibacillus sp. displayed high level of bactericidal/cytotoxic properties.

H460 cells treated with the ethyl acetate extract of strain MCCB 248 and stained with Hoechst 33342 showed clear signs of apoptosis, including shrinkage of the cell nucleus, DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation. Further to this treated cells showed indications of early apoptotic cell death, including a significant proportion of Annexin V positive staining and evidence of DNA damage as observed in the TUNEL assay. Amplified PKS 1 and NRPS genes involved in secondary metabolite production showed only 82% similarity to known biosynthetic genes of Streptomyces, indicating the likely production of a novel secondary metabolite in this extract. Additionally, chemical dereplication efforts using LC–MS/MS molecular networking suggested the presence of a series of undescribed tetraene polyols. Taken together, these results revealed that this Arctic S. artemisiae strain MCCB 248 is a promising candidate for natural products drug discovery and genome mining for potential anticancer agents.",

Acclimation was achieved by serially sub-culturing in increasing concentration of individual substrates, such as rice husk, sugarcane bagasse, and banana pseudostem in the standard media, with cellobiose as an adjunct. The acclimated cellulolytic thermophile exhibited an early log phase entry with enhanced growth compared to the direct inoculation experiments with unacclimated culture. Around 672 mg/g of reducing sugar was produced from sugarcane bagasse media and 636 mg/g from rice husk media and 513 mg/g from banana pseudostem media with the acclimated organism. Bioethanol production also doubled in experiments with serially acclimated cultures, with a maximum of 1.21 and 1.0 g/L ethanol titre from sugarcane bagasse and rice husk, respectively. The serial acclimation experiments have increased the saccharification potentials of the organism towards the respective lignocellulosic substrates and also enhanced the bioethanol production.",

    "abstract": "The present study investigated the efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 in creating genomic deletions as the basis of its application in removing selection marker genes or the intergenic regions. Three loci, representing a transgene and two rice genes, were targeted at two sites each, in separate experiments, and the deletion of the defined fragments was investigated by PCR and sequencing. Genomic deletions were found at a low rate among the transformed callus lines that could be isolated, cultured, and regenerated into plants harboring the deletion. However, randomly regenerated plants showed mixed genomic effects, and generally did not harbor heritable genomic deletions. To determine whether point mutations occurred at each targeted site, a total of 114 plants consisting of primary transgenic lines and their progeny were analyzed. Ninety-three plants showed targeting, 60 of which were targeted at both sites. The presence of point mutations at both sites was correlated with the guide RNA efficiency. In summary, genomic deletions through dual-targeting by the paired-guide RNAs were generally observed in callus, while de novo point mutations at one or both sites occurred at high rates in transgenic plants and their progeny, generating a variety of insertion-deletions or single-nucleotide variations. In this study, point mutations were exceedingly favored over genomic deletions; therefore, for the recovery of plant lines harboring targeted deletions, identifying early transformed clones harboring the deletions, and isolating them for plant regeneration is recommended.",

    "abstract": "16S rRNA gene analysis has emerged as one of the valuable tools that are being utilized in investigating the molecular phylogenetic structure of the particular environment. Here, we embarked upon understanding and delineating the molecular phylogeny structure of microbes in polluted soil samples from cancer prone belt of the Punjab, India, which is highly contaminated with herbicide, pesticide and heavy metals. To investigate the bacterial phylogeny structure, a high-molecular weight metagenomic DNA was extracted from the soil samples, followed by PCR amplification, cloning and analysis of the 16S rRNA genes. Study employing 16S rRNA profiling of the community DNA revealed the presence of two major phylums: the Proteobacteria (26.7 %), the Bacteroidetes (11.2 %), and several minor groups, i.e., Acidobacteria (4.2 %), Actinobacteria (4.2 %), Firmicutes (2.8 %), Verrucomicrobia (2.8 %), Gemmatimonadetes (1.4 %) and Chloroflexi (1.4 %). Among the Proteobacteria, we mainly observed the α-Proteobacteria (18.3 %). Nearly, 38 % of the recovered 16S rRNA gene sequences in this study do not share similarity with known culturable bacterial sequences reported in the genebank data base and hence considered to be novel. More interestingly, 16S rRNA gene sequences of archaeal origin (7.0 %) were also recovered that primarily indicate change in their evolution pattern. A phylogenetic tree constructed based on alignment-dependent method revealed the extent of similarity these clones shared with each other, followed by alignment-independent methods that statistically confirmed the sequence variation among the clones. Despite the high level of contamination in the study area, we observed remarkable microbial diversity that mainly includes the Gram-negative bacteria. The presence of more Gram-negative bacteria indicates that they have evolved a robust mechanism to resist and cope up with these pollutants compared to Gram-positive groups. Investigation of the polluted soil samples employing culture-independent approach revealed important bacterial groups which could be engineered for future bioremediation studies.",

    "abstract": "This study reports thermophilic fungus Malbranchea flava as a potent source of xylanase and xylan-debranching accessory enzymes. M. flava produced high levels of xylanase on sorghum straw containing solidified culture medium. The optimization of culture conditions for production of hemicellulases was carried out using one factor at a time approach and Box–Behnken design of experiments with casein (%), inoculum age (h) and inoculum level (ml) as process variables and xylanase, β-xylosidase, acetyl esterases and arabinofuranosidase as response variables. The results showed that casein concentration between 3.0 and 3.5 %, inoculum age (56–60 h) and inoculum level (2–2.5 ml) resulted in production of 16,978, 10.0, 67.7 and 3.8 (U/gds) of xylanase, β-xylosidase, acetyl esterase and α-l-arabinofuranosidase, respectively. Under optimized conditions M. flava produced eight functionally diverse xylanases with distinct substrate specificity against different xylan types. The peptide mass fingerprinting of 2-D gel electrophoresis resolved proteins indicated to the presence of cellobiose dehydrogenase and glycosyl hydrolases suggesting the potential of this strain in oxidative and classical cellulase-mediated hydrolysis of lignocellulosics. Addition of xylanase (300 U/g substrate) during saccharification (at 15 % substrate loading) of different pretreated (acid/alkali) substrates (cotton stalks, wheat straw, rice straw, carrot grass) by commercial cellulase (NS28066) resulted in 9–36 % increase in saccharification and subsequent fermentation to ethanol when compared to experiment with commercial enzyme only. High ethanol level 46 (g/l) was achieved with acid pretreated cotton stalk when M. flava xylanase was supplemented as compared to 39 (g/l) with xylanase without xylanase addition.",

Repeated use during the last two decades of the ACCase-inhibiting herbicide (clodinafop) to control this weed has resulted in the occurrence of resistance. Fifty-three P. minor populations were collected from wheat fields in Haryana and Punjab states of India. The dose-response assays indicated that 29 populations were resistant, 23 populations were susceptible and one population was moderately resistant to clodinafop. Sequence analysis of the CT domain of ACCase gene among resistant and susceptible populations revealed two non-synonymous mutations, Trp2027 to Cys and Ile2041 to Asn in the resistant populations. Allele-specific PCR markers were developed to differentiate between wild-type and resistant codons at positions 2027 and 2041 of ACCase in P. minor which enables molecular assays for rapid detection and resistance diagnosis for efficient weed management in wheat. This is the first report from India of a target site mutation corresponding to resistance to clodinafop in P. minor.",

With this connection, Pseudonocardia endophytica (VUK-10) was isolated using dilution plate technique and was examined for its secondary metabolite profiling. After successive purification and spectroscopic characterization viz., FTIR, mass, NMR, DEPT, HMQC, HMBC, and COSY spectroscopy, two compounds were identified including a semi synthetic derivative N-(4-aminocyclooctyl)-3, 5-dinitrobenzamide (1), obtained from the precursor of novel natural product cyclooctane-1,4-diamine (3), along with a known compound 3-((1H-indol-6-yl) methyl) hexahydropyrrolo [1, 2-a] pyrazine-1, 4-dione (2). Anti cancer activities of the characterized compounds against in vitro cancerous cell line models, MDA-MB-231, OAW-42, HeLa, and MCF-7 reveal that HELA cells are most susceptible (IC50-10 nM compound 1 and 2) followed by other studied cells. On the other hand, antibacterial and antifungal activities of the studied compounds against tested pathogens revealed that there is a significant antimicrobial activity with all the tested bacterial and fungal species. Moreover, compound 1 showed the lowest MIC values against Streptococcus mutans as 4 and 16 µg/ml for Candida albicans. In conclusion, the identified novel chemical compounds in the present study may have a potential application in anticancer therapy as well as to mitigate the bacterial and fungal pathogens thus to control the infectious diseases.",

In one strain, designated ACShi27, which exhibited the highest total cellulase expression, total cellulase, endoglucanase, exoglucanase, and xylanase expression levels were 1.73, 16.23, 17.73, and 150.83 U ml-1, respectively; these values were 14.5, 22.3, 24.6, and 17.3% higher than those of the wild-type Aspergillus niger M85 using wheat bran as an induction substrate. Production of cellulases and xylanase by solid-state fermentation followed by in situ saccharification of ACShi27 was investigated with alkaline-pretreated rice straw as a substrate. After 2 days of enzyme induction at 30 °C, followed by 48 h of saccharification at 50 °C, the conversion rate of carbon polymers into reducing sugar reached 293.2 mg g-1, which was 1.23-fold higher than that of the wild-type strain. The expression of sestc in Aspergillus niger can improve the total cellulase and xylanase activity and synergism, thereby enhancing the lignocellulose in situ saccharification.",

    "abstract": "Virginiamycin produced by Streptomyces virginiae as a natural mix of macrocyclic peptidolactones M and S is widely used in the industrial production of ethanol fuel and as an antibiotic feed additive for cattle and poultry. Its main antimicrobial components, M1 and S1 factors, act synergistically if the M1:S1 ratio in the final product is 70–75:25–30. This fact significantly complicates the development of stable high-yield strains suitable for industrial application. In the previous work, authors obtained a mutant S. virginiae VKM Ac-2738D strain, characterized by a high productivity in flasks and the optimum M1:S1 ratio (75:25) in the final product. In this study, the scale-up of the virginiamycin production by VKM AC-2738D from shake flasks to a pilot-scale (100 L) stirred fermentor was carried out and the possibility of the in situ use of synthetic adsorbing resins to remove virginiamycin from culture broth was assessed. After the optimization of pH and dissolved oxygen concentration (6.8–7.0 and 50%, respectively), the fed-batch fermentation of VKM Ac-2738D with continuous addition of 50% sucrose solution (5 g/L/day starting from 48 h of fermentation) resulted in a final virginiamycin titer of 4.9 g/L. Among four tested resins, Diaion® HP21 added to fermentation medium prior to sterilization absorbed 98.5% of the total virginiamycin that simplifies its further recovery procedure and increased its total titer to 5.6 g/L at the M1:S1 ratio of 74:26. The developed technology has several important advantages, which include (1) the optimum M1:S1 ratio in the final product, (2) the possibility to use sucrose as a carbon source instead of traditionally used and more expensive glucose or d-maltose, and (3) selective binding of up to 98.5% of produced virginiamycin on the adsorbing resin.",

    "abstract": "Our study aims to investigate the impact of miR-224 on cell migration and invasion in colorectal cancer (CRC) as well as its molecular mechanisms. The results showed that miR-224 was significantly upregulated in CRC compared to normal tissues via the TCGA database. Overexpression of miR-224 promoted CRC cell migration and invasion, while inhibition of miR-224 demonstrated the opposite result via transwell assays. In addition, we found that BTRC was a target gene of miR-224 through the miRecords database and dual-luciferase assay, while western blot together with RT-qPCR showed that inhibition of miR-224 led to elevated BTRC expression in protein level but not in mRNA level, and also decreased the expression of β-catenin. In reference to the Human Protein Atlas, BTRC protein expression was higher in normal tissues than in CRC tissues. In conclusion, miR-224 regulates its target BTRC protein expression and its related Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Its impact on cell migration and invasion in CRC cells suggested that miR-224 could be a prospective therapeutic target for early-stage non-metastatic CRC.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of Cellulomonas flavigena and Streptomyces viridosporus , as a bacterial inoculant, on the compostability of post-extraction lavender waste. The major physicochemical, microbiological, and biological properties of the composting materials were monitored for 161 days. The technology developed was shown to improve the compostability of recalcitrant herbal residues. The use of lavender waste beneficially affected the composting process by extending the thermophilic phase, accelerating the degradation of organic matter, and elevating the viable counts of useful microorganisms; however, adverse effects were also observed, including an increased carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (19.05) and a decreased germination index (93.4%). Bacterial inoculation was found to preserve the nitrogen content (2.50%) and improve the efficiency of biodegradation. The Salmonella - and Escherichia coli -free final composting products were mature, stable, and ready for soil application. To the authors’ knowledge, no previous research has investigated the compostability of lavender waste. Likewise, this is the first study that has used strains of C. flavigena and S. viridosporus in combination to facilitate a composting process.",

    "abstract": "The multiple probiotic characteristics of strain TCI904 isolated in this study from natural fermented milk were investigated using a mouse model. TCI904 was identified as Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricu (LDB), a well-known lactic acid starter bacterium found in yogurt. TCI904 exhibited an outstanding pancreatic lipase inhibition activity among several strains of lactic acid bacteria in vitro. Its in vivo effects were further studied. In a comparison of mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and those fed a HFD combined with TCI904 for 9 weeks, differences were observed in various aspects of health, and the adverse effects of a HFD were prevented in the latter group. TCI904 effectively prevented fat and body weight accumulation without reducing food intake; it also modulated innate immunity and increased the level of IgA in feces, reversing the increased blood sugar and insulin levels and attenuated the hyperlipidemia caused by a HFD. Based on biochemical test data, compared with the HFD group, a HFD combined with TCI904 induced significant lowering of insulin resistance indicator, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and atherogenic indices of plasma (AIP), the atherogenic coefficient (AC) and cardiac risk ratio (CRR) and increased the cardioprotective index (CPI). In addition, the administration of TCI904 alleviated mood disorders caused by a HFD. Taking the recommended human dose of TCI904 did not affect the liver or kidney function, indicating that TCI904 has sufficient in vivo safety. Taken together, the results of the present study contributed towards validation of the probiotic benefits of lactic acid starter microflora. Orally taken TCI904 exhibited positive immune- and metabolic-modulating, and anxiolytic properties, especially in HFD-induced obesity.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13205-022-03356-3.",

The striking stimulation in soil enzyme activities noticed at 2.5 kg ha-1, persists for 20 days in both soils. Overall, the higher concentrations (5.0-10.0 kg ha-1) of flubendiamide, and spinosad were toxic or innocuous to cellulase, invertase and amylase activities, respectively. The results of the present study thus, clearly, indicate that application of the insecticides in cultivation of groundnut, at field application rates improved the activities of cellulase, invertase and amylase in soils.",

Bhatooru is an indigenous leavened bread or roti and constitutes the staple diet of rural population of Himachal. The microbiological analysis of the inoculums (malera) revealed that it composed of a consortium of microorganisms. Population of Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc and Saccharomyces cerevisiae increased from 4.77 to 8.0 log cfu/g of dry matter in 10 h of fermentation. The amount of total proteins increased from 13.6 to 18.4 % (w/w). The total sugars during fermentation decreased from 74.1 to 50.1 % (w/w) on dry weight basis. However, the reducing sugar level of the fermenting samples increased significantly from 7.8 to 16.5 mg/g dry matter in the first 4 h and thereafter, it gradually decreased to 10.0 mg/g dry matter. Similarly starch content decreased from 70.2 to 48.3 % (w/w) on dry weight basis by 10 h of fermentation. In fermented samples protease activity increased from 0.48 U/g dry matter to 11.5 U/g in 6 h and then decreased to 3.21 U/g on dry weight basis at 10 h. Amylase activity initially increased from 65.0 to 79.4 U to 6 h and then declined to 69.9 U/g of dry matter. Fermentation in bhatooru significantly enhanced the B vitamin levels especially thiamine, riboflavin and nicotinic acid and essential amino acids viz methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, lysine and leucine.",

Arthrospira platensis has been scarcely reported as a new candidate for L-asparaginase production. In the present study, we localized L-asparaginase in A. platensis and enhanced its production. Enzyme localization was conducted by culturing cells in SOT medium and extracting the enzymes from different parts of the cell. The Taguchi method (factors studied: nitrogen, iron, sodium chloride, and temperature shock) using an L9 orthogonal array was designed for improving L-asparaginase production. The highest specific activity of L-asparaginase was found in subcellular, cytoplasmic extracts (0.166 ± 0.029 U/mg). Optimization data revealed that the highest production of L-asparaginase (0.275 ± 0.005 U) was attained by NaNO3, NaCl, and FeSO4·7H2O at concentrations, 1.875 g/l, 0.25 M, and 0.0075 g/l, respectively, with 1-h temperature shock at 22 °C in the dark. Results revealed more than twofold higher production of L-asparaginase than that under the normal condition. In summary, L-asparaginase appeared dominantly in the cytoplasmic region and its production could be induced by employing combined stress conditions with a Taguchi experimental design. To our best knowledge, this is the first report on L-asparaginase production in cyanobacteria of the subclass Oscillatoriophycideae.",

    "abstract": "Rice straw is one of the potential economic feedstock for biobutanol production through ABE fermentation. However, the rice straw hydrolysate-based fermentation medium needs to be supported with nutritional elements. In this study, an attempt is made to optimize the rice straw hydrolysate-based fermentation medium employing Clostridium acetobutylicum MTCC 481 using Taguchi design of experiments (DOE) statistical model. Initially, a set of 12 nutrient components viz. MgNO3·6H2O, FeNO3, NH4NO3, yeast extract, PABA, biotin, PABA + biotin mixture, CaCl2, KCl, NaCl, MgSO4 and CH3COONa were screened through classical (one-variable-at-a-time) method. Based on the results, four components (PABA, yeast extract, MgSO4 and CH3COONa) were found to have significant impact, and were further subjected to statistical optimization through Taguchi DOE method. These experiments revealed that RSH supported with 3 g L-1 of yeast extract and 4 mg L-1 PABA to RSH was the most optimum fermentation medium. Experiments using 2 L bioreactor with this optimum fermentation medium showed nearly complete utilization of soluble sugars with the production of 8.7 g L-1 of total solvents and 6 g L-1 of butanol. The experimental data were fitted to kinetic models reported in the literature to determine the kinetic parameters of the fermentation process. An interesting result was revealed from this analysis that the under optimized fermentation medium, the kinetic parameters for both shake flask and bioreactor level were similar. This essentially means that effect of scale of operation is rendered insignificant when fermentation medium is under optimum conditions.",

Resistance screening against several viruses resulted in identifying a multiple virus resistant genotype ‘IHR 2451’. Degenerate primers based on the conserved regions between P-Loop and GLPL of Resistance genes (R-genes) were used to amplify nucleotide binding sites (NBS)—encoding regions from genotype ‘IHR 2451’. Alignment of deduced amino acid sequences and phylogenetic analyses of isolated sequences distinguished into two groups representing toll interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) and non-TIR, and different families within the group confirming the hypotheses that dicots have both the types of NBS-LRR genes. The alignment of deduced amino acid sequences revealed conservation of subdomains P-loop, RNBS-A, kinase2, RNBS-B, and GLPL. The distinctive five RGAs showing specific conserved motifs were subjected to BLASTp and indicated high homology at deduced amino acid level with R genes identified such as Pvr9 gene for potyvirus resistance, putative late blight resistance protein homolog R1B-23 and other disease resistance genes suggesting high correlation with resistance to different pathogens. These pepper RGAs could be regarded as candidate sequences of resistant genes for marker development.",

    "abstract": "The current report assesses the efficiency of encapsulation-desiccation protocol to cryopreserve oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) polyembryoids. Specifically identified polyembryoids, comprising of haustorium and torpedo-shaped structures, were encapsulated [comprising 3% (w/v) sodium alginate and 100 mM CaCl2]. Calcium alginate-encapsulated and sucrose-precultured polyembryoids were subjected to different spans of desiccation in a laminar air-flow cabinet, followed by freezing in liquid nitrogen. The effect of sucrose preculture (with gradual exposure to 0.3, 0.5, 0.75 and 1 M for 7 days) and dehydration periods (0-10 h) under sterile air-flow on post-freezing survival and regrowth of encapsulated polyembryoids were studied. Cryopreserved and thawed polyembryoids (initially precultured in sucrose, followed by 9 h air-desiccated to 23.3% moisture content) displayed the highest survival percentage (73.3%) and regeneration (of shoot, root and secondary somatic embryo) on Murashige and Skoog regrowth medium containing sucrose (0.3-1 M) and 0.2 mg/l 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid. In addition, ultrastructural study using scanning electron microscopy exhibited successful revival of cryopreserved polyembryoids, owing to retention of cellular membrane stability through optimized and protected (encapsulated) desiccation. The present study thus substantiates the potential of this encapsulation-desiccation procedure in cryopreservation of oil palm polyembryoids for long-term conservation programs.",

Two other species, viz., Cyclea peltata (Lam.) Hook.f. & Thomson and Stephania japonica (Thunb.) Miers of the same family are being used as the source of this drug in various parts of India. This type of substitution or adulteration will ultimately affect the therapeutic efficacy of the medicines adversely. ISSR profiles of all the three taxa are generated and analyzed to assess the genetic relationships among these three species. The profiles of all the three species displayed a high level of polymorphism among them. ISSR markers developed can be used in authenticating and validating the exact species discrimination of the genuine raw drug of 'Patha' from its substitutes/adulterants to guarantee the quality and legitimacy of this drug in the market.",

Furthermore, in vitro regenerated plants are typically frail and sometimes difficult to handle subsequently increasing their risk to damage and disease; hence acclimatization of these plantlets is the most important step in tissue culture techniques. An experiment was conducted under in vitro conditions to study the effects of shaking duration (twice daily at 6:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. for 2, 4, 8, and 16 min at 250 rpm for 14 days) on Sansevieria trifasciata L. as a model plant. Results showed that shaking improved handling, total plant height, and leaf characteristics of the model plant. Forty-eight hours after 14 days of shaking treatments with increasing shaking time, leaf length decreased but proline content of leaf increased. However, 6 months after starting the experiment different results were observed. In explants that received 16 min of shaking treatment, leaf length and area and photosynthesis rate were increased compared with control plantlets. Six months after starting the experiment, control plantlets had 12.5 % mortality; however, no mortality was observed in other treated explants. The results demonstrated that shaking improved the explants' root length and number and as a simple, cost-effective, and non-chemical novel approach may be substituted for other prevalent acclimatization techniques used for tissue culture regenerated plantlets. Further studies with sensitive plants are needed to establish this hypothesis.",

Subsequently, optimal levels of physical parameters and key media components, namely temperature, pH, sucrose, K2HPO4, NaCl, yeast, CaCl2·2H2O and MgSO4·7H2O, were determined using the Taguchi orthogonal array (OA) experimental design (DOE) methodology. Taguchi method based on three levels with a OA layout of L18 (21 × 37) with eight most influential factors on amidase synthesis for the proposed experimental design. Analysis of variance was performed on the obtained results and optimum condition suggested by statistical calculations was tested in a verification test. An increase of 169.56 % in amidase production compared to the unoptimized conditions was observed and the conversion of isonicotinamide was significantly improved after performing optimization techniques, including OFAT and Taguchi method. The result indicated that Taguchi method was effective in optimizing the culture conditions of amidase production.",

    "abstract": "Tribulus terrestris L., commonly called puncture vine and gokhru, is an important member of Zygophyllaceae. The species is highly important in context to therapeutic uses and provides important active principles responsible for treatment of various diseases and also used as tonic. It is widely distributed in tropical regions of India and the world. However, status of its genetic diversity remained concealed due to lack of research work in this species. In present study, genetic diversity and structure of different populations of T. terrestris from north India was examined at molecular level using newly developed Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers. In total, 20 primers produced 48 alleles in a size range of 100-500 bp with maximum (4) fragments amplified by TTMS-1, TTMS-25 and TTMS-33. Mean Polymorphism Information Content (PIC) and Marker Index (MI) were 0.368 and 1.01, respectively. Dendrogram showed three groups, one of which was purely containing accessions from Rajasthan while other two groups corresponded to Punjab and Haryana regions with intermixing of few other accessions. Analysis of molecular variance partitioned 76 % genetic variance within populations and 24 % among populations. Bayesian model based STRUCTURE analysis detected two genetic stocks for analyzed germplasm and also detected some admixed individuals. Different geographical populations of this species showed high level of genetic diversity. Results of present study can be useful in identifying diverse accessions and management of this plant resource. Moreover, the novel SSR markers developed can be utilized for various genetic analyses in this species in future.",

The purification revealed the occurrence of multiple forms of xylanases (Xyl-I, Xyl-IIa, Xyl-IIb and Xyl-III). The molecular mass of highly purified Xyl-IIb was ~31 kDa with SDS-PAGE. The enzyme was cellulase-free, thermostable (55-75 °C) and acidophilic (3.5-5.0). It was activated by Ca2+, Ba2+, DTT and β-mercaptoethanol, whereas inhibited by Hg2+, Pb2+, Ni2+ and p-CMB. Purified Xyl-IIb exhibited highest specificity toward birchwood and oat spelts xylan. Kinetics of Xyl-IIb revealed a K m of 10 mg/ml and 16.7 mg/ml and V max of 9523g and 15,873 U/mg with birchwood and oat spelts xylan, respectively, indicating high affinity toward birchwood xylan. The xylanase (Xyl-IIb) belongs to glycosyl hydrolase (GH) family 10 based on conserved regions. Xylanase-encoding gene (xynB) consists of 1501 bp with an open reading frame of 264 bp which was predicted to encode a protein having 87 amino acids and shared homology with endo-1,4-beta-xylanase (xynB) gene from Penicillium citrinum. Cloned xynB gene was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) with xylanase activity (80 U/mg) and confirmed to be GH-10 Xyl-IIa based on molecular mass (~40 kDa). These properties of xylanase make it promising for their applications in biofuel industries.",

We applied subtractive genomics approach for the identification of novel antimicrobial targets in Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae PXO99A, the causative agent of bacterial blight in rice. Comparative analysis was performed through BLAST available with the NCBI. The analysis revealed that 27 essential protein sequences out of 4,988 sequences of X. oryzae pv. oryzae PXO99A are non-homologous to Oryza sativa. Subsequent analysis of 27 essential proteins revealed their involvement in different metabolic activities such as transport activity, DNA binding, structural constituent of ribosome, cell division, translation, and plasma membrane. These 27 proteins were analyzed for virulence and novelty and out of 27, three essential non-homologous proteins were found to be the novel antimicrobial targets.",

    "abstract": "Rising energy prices and depleting reserves of fossil fuels continue to renew interest in the conversion of biomass to biofuels production. Biofuels derived from renewable feedstocks are environmentally friendly fuels and have the potential to meet more than a quarter of world demand for transportation fuels by 2050. Moreover, biofuels are expected to reduce reliance on imported petroleum, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and stimulate regional economies by creating jobs and increasing demand and prices for bioproducts.\r\n\r\nBiofuels such as ethanol are derived from food crops, biomass, or lignocellulosic materials through biochemical and thermochemical conversion processes. First-generation biofuels (i.e. corn ethanol and biodiesel) are made largely from food crops such as cereals, sugar crops, and oil seeds. The technologies to produce the first-generation biofuels from edible sugars and starches are mature and well understood, and production is primarily limited by environmental and social concerns such as competition for land and water used for food and fiber production causing increase in world commodity prices for food and animal feeds (Sims et al. 2010). Owing to these important limitations the “next-generation”, or second- and third-generation biofuels are being developed from non-edible lignocellulosic materials using advanced technologies. These lignocellulosic feedstocks include woody biomass and wood wastes, crop residues, dedicated energy crops such as switchgrass, municipal wastes, and algae. These next-generation feedstocks do not compete directly with food production and can often be produced on marginal or unused croplands. Furthermore, lignocellulosic biomass is an abundant renewable energy source, with the potential to displace a large portion of conventional energy resources such as fossil fuels and natural gas for the future production of liquid biofuels with improved environmental benefits. As a result, lignocellulosic biomass holds promise as a feedstock for a biorefinery where sugars can be transformed into building-block chemicals through fermentation, enzymatic, and chemical transformations (Ragauskas et al. 2006).\r\n\r\nLignocellulosic biomass is a composite structure of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose polymers. The efficient utilization of biomass for biofuels production requires a fractionation of biomass constituents into separate streams at maximum yields. However, a major barrier to lignocellulosic biomass utilization in any sugar platform biorefinery is its intrinsic resistance to deconstruction. This recalcitrance results from multiple factors including the heterogeneous nature of the polymer matrix, the complexity of lignin and hemicellulose spatial and chemical interactions, and the extensive hydrogen bonding of crystalline cellulose. Therefore, investigating plant cell wall biosynthesis to unravel the recalcitrant structure of lignocellulosic biomass, exploring the types of pretreatment processes used to deconstruct biomass, and developing efficient enzymatic hydrolysis are main focus areas in converting the polymeric carbohydrates present in plant biomass to fermentable sugars for cost-effective ethanol production.",

The most potent isolate was from the Red Sea sponge Callyspongia spp. and was selected for identification. The18S rRNA amplification for phylogenetic study revealed that the isolate was highly related to Aspergillus flocculosus strain NRRL 5224 by 99 %. Medium composition and culture conditions for dextranase production were optimized by response surface methodology. A significant influence of dextran, yeast extract, K2HPO4, NaNO3, NaCl, MgSO4.7H2O and culture requirements such as incubation time, inoculum size, medium volume and inoculum age on dextranase production was evaluated by Plackett-Burman design. The most significant factors were further optimized using Box-Behnken design. The model predicted a dextranase activity of 438.15 U/ml when dextran concentration, medium volume and incubation time were 2.1 g/l, 52.47/250 ml flask and 80.48 h, respectively. Verification of the model showed that dextranase production of 440 U/ml was observed under the optimal condition confirming the validity of the model.",

De-husked seeds of 21 cultivars of indica rice were cultured onto MS medium for screening of their micropropagation capabilities. All the selected cultivars are being cultivated by farmers of Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan states of India, these cultivars bear good quality of grain and high yield. Similarly, both states are facing the problem of drought so; we selected these cultivars for the micropropagation and transformation studies. The induction of callus and regeneration in these selected cultivars were achieved on MS culture medium with supplementation of various growth regulators. Maximum callus induction and regeneration frequency were observed in Sambha mahsuri at the concentration of 3.0 mg L−1 of 2,4-D and BAP (5.0 mg L−1) while the moderate response achieved in other cultivars of rice. Sambha mahsuri showed promising results in terms of callus induction frequency, and regeneration potentialities of embryogenic callus so, there is need to develop a rice cultivars that could thrive under drought condition if the country is to sustain rice production. Finally, regenerated plantlets were successfully transferred to natural conditions (in pots) after acclimatization.",

This study reports a possible pretreatment method for miscanthus using aqueous ethylenediamine (EDA) for 30 min at 180 °C with or without ammonia. The mass ratio of miscanthus to EDA was varied from 1:3, 1:1, and 1:0.5, keeping the mass ratio of miscanthus to liquid (EDA + Water) constant at 1:8. The ammonia-to-miscanthus ratio was 1:0.25. After pretreatment with a ratio of 1:3 miscanthus to EDA, about 75 % of the lignin was removed from the raw miscanthus with 90 % retention of cellulose and 50 % of hemicellulose in the recovered solid. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the recovered solid miscanthus gave 63 % glucose and 62 % xylose conversion after 72 h. EDA provides an effective pretreatment for miscanthus, achieving good delignification and enhanced sugar yield by enzyme hydrolysis. Results using aqueous EDA with or without ammonia are much better than those using hot water and compare favorably with those using aqueous ammonia. The delignification efficiency of EDA pretreatment is high compared to that for hot-water pretreatment and is nearly as efficient as that obtained for aqueous-ammonia pretreatment.",

We have investigated the bacterial diversity of the coastal area of Karwar, Karnataka State, India. Among these bacterial isolates, five bacterial strains were selected and identified by their morphological, biochemical characteristics and phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. The identified bacterial isolates, Bacillus toyonensis PNTB1, Lysinibacillus sphaericus PTB, Vibrio vulnificus PMD, Shewanella MPTDBS, and Pseudomonas chlororaphis PNTB were characterized for their tolerance to salt and antibiotics. Vibrio vulnificus PMD showed maximum tolerance at higher concentration of salt than other bacteria. These bacterial strains were screened for the production of extracellular enzymes such as lipase, cellulase, pectinase, tannase, chitinase, and L-glutaminase. Vibrio vulnificus showed maximum production of L-glutaminase enzyme. Bacillus toyonensis PNTB1 shows lipase, CM-cellulase and chitinase activities. These isolated bacterial cultures were also utilized most of the aromatic compounds at 7 mM. These findings indicate the organisms present in this zone may have more potential applications in bioremediation, agricultural, industrial, and therapeutics.",

Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most frequent invasive form of breast cancer followed by metastasis. There is no accepted marker for distinguishing this form from other less aggressive forms of breast cancer. Therefore, finding new markers especially molecularly detectable ones are noteworthy. It has been shown that NOTCH1 has been overexpressed in the patients with breast cancer, but no study has investigated the expression of NOTCH1 and its correlation with other molecular and hormonal markers of breast cancer so far. In the current study, 20 breast cancer tissues and 20 matched adjacent normal breast tissue from breast cancer patients were obtained and categorized in two groups: patients with IDC and patient with other types of breast cancer. Gene expression analysis using real-time PCR showed that the NOTCH1 gene was significantly overexpressed in patients with IDC. We also found a slight correlation between NOTCH1 overexpression and p53 accumulation in the cancerous cells confirmed by Immunohistochemistry (IHC). This results showed that it is possible to introduce NOTCH1 expression as a novel biomarker of IDC, alone or preferably accompanied by IHC of p53. We also can design new therapeutic agents targeting NOTCH1 expression for inhibition of metastasis in ductal breast carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "Invertase (EC.3.2.1.26) catalyzes the hydrolysis of sucrose to an equimolar mixture of d-glucose and d-fructose which is of interest for various industrial applications. In this research, Saccharomyces cerevisiae invertase gene (SUC2) was optimized based on Pichia pastoris codon preference. The synthetic gene was introduced into the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris under the control of the inducible AOX1 promoter. High level of the extracellular recombinant invertase (R-inv) production was achieved via methanol induction for 4 days and purified by His-Tag affinity chromatography which appeared to be a mixture of glycosylated proteins with various sizes of 85–95 kDa on SDS-PAGE. Deglycosylation of the proteins by Endo-H resulted in the proteins with average molecular weight of 60 kDa. The purified recombinant invertase biochemical properties and kinetic parameters determined a pH and temperature optimum at 4.8 and 60 °C, respectively, which in comparison with native S. cerevisiae invertase, thermal stability of recombinant invertase is highly increased in different heating treatment experiments. The purification of recombinant invertase resulted in an enzyme with specific activity of 178.56 U/mg with 3.83-fold of purification and the kinetic constants for enzyme were Km value of 19 mM and Vmax value of 300 μmol min−1 mg−1 With kinetic efficiency (Kcat/Km) of 13.15 s−1 mmol−1 it can be concluded that recombinant P. pastoris invertase can be more effective for industrial quality criteria. We conclude that recombinant P. pastoris enzyme with broad pH stability, substrate specificity and proper thermal stability can fulfil a series of predefined industrial quality criteria to be used in food, pharmaceutical and bio ethanol production industries.",

    "abstract": "Xylanases activity (XY) from Aspergillus japonicus URM5620 produced by Solid-State Fermentation (SSF) of castor press cake (Ricinus communis) on different conditions of production and extraction by PEG/citrate aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) were investigated. XY production was influenced by substrate amount (5-10 g), initial moisture (15-35 %), pH (4.0-6.0) and temperature (25-35 °C), obtaining the maximum activity of 29,085 ± 1808 U g ds-1 using 5.0 g of substrate with initial moisture of 15 % at 25 °C and pH 6.0, after 120 h of fermentation. The influence of PEG molar mass (1000-8000 g mol-1), phase concentrations (PEG 20.0-24.0 % w/w and sodium citrate 15-20 % w/w) and pH (6.0-8.0) on partition coefficient, purification factor, yield and selectivity of XY were determinate. Enzyme partitioning into the PEG rich phase was favored by M PEG 8000 (g mol-1), C PEG 24 % (w/w), C C 20 % (w/w) and pH 8.0, resulting in partition coefficient of 50.78, activity yield of 268 %, 7.20-fold purification factor and selectivity of 293. A. japonicus URM5620 has a potential role in the development of a bioprocess for the XY production using low-cost media. In addition, the present study proved it is feasible to extract xylanase from SSF by adopting the one step ATPS consisting of PEG/citrate.",

    "abstract": "Bioflocculants are secondary metabolites produced by microorganisms during their growth which have received attentions due to their biodegradability, innocuousness and lack of secondary pollution from degradation intermediates. This study reports on a bioflocculant produced by Bacillus specie isolated from Thyume River in South Africa. The bacterial isolate was identified through 16S rDNA sequencing and the BLAST analysis of the nucleotide sequences revealed 99% similarity to Bacillus sp. BCT-7112. The sequence was subsequently deposited in the GenBank as Bacillus sp. AEMREG4 with accession number KP406729. The optimum culture conditions for bioflocculant production were an inoculum size 4% (v/v) (80%) and starch (81%) as well as yeast extract (82%) as sole carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. Addition of Ca2+ greatly enhanced the flocculating activity (76%) of crude bioflocculant over a wide range of pH 4-10 and retained high flocculating activity when heated at 100 °C for 1 h. Chemical analyses of the purified bioflocculant revealed carbohydrate (79% w/w) as a predominant component followed by uronic acid (15% w/w) and protein (5% w/w). Fourier transform infrared spectrum revealed the presence of carboxyl, hydroxyl and methoxyl groups as the functional groups responsible for flocculation and the high flocculation activity achieved portends its industrial applicability.",

VL-63 and its mutant, pvsod1 (deficient in superoxide dismutase activity) under 50 μM sodium arsenate (As), As + L-buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO) and As + BSO + Sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS)-treatments for 10 days. Main objective was to investigate the functional relationship between hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and glutathione (GSH) in regulation of sulfate transporters and cysteine metabolisms as up-stream thiol components and GSH, phytochelatins (PCs) and antioxidant defense response as downstream cascade under As-exposure. As treatment alone initiated coordinated inductions of sulfate transport, biosynthesis of cysteine, GSH, and PCs, and GSH-mediated antioxidant defense in the pvsod1 mutant. At As + BSO, GSH synthesis was blocked, resulting in significantly low GSH redox pool and steep decline in GSH-dependent antioxidant capacity of both the genotypes. However, unlike VL-63, cysteine-degradation pathway was induced in pvsod1 mutant, resulting in significant accumulation of endogenous H2S. The H2S-surge in the pvsod1 mutant stimulated ascorbate-dependent antioxidant defense and catalases and regulated O-acetylserine (thiol)lyase activity, preventing overaccumulation of H2O2 and free cysteine, respectively. No As-induced oxidative stress symptom was observed in the mutant. This trend was maintained at As + BSO + NaHS treatment, also. In contrast, failure to induce entire cascade from sulfate transport to downstream antioxidant defense led to onset of As-induced oxidative damage in VL-63 plant. Results revealed dual roles of H2S as (a) stimulator of GSH-independent antioxidant defense and (b) regulator of cysteine homeostasis through its metabolic diversion during As-exposure and blockage of GSH biosynthesis.",

Pakistan is fifth among the 22 high-burden TB countries with the incidence rate of 230/100,000 persons, however, studies related to prevalent Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains and their spread, drug resistance pattern and evolutionary genetics are inadequate. The present study was undertaken to highlight the circulation of M. tuberculosis strains causing drug resistant TB in our community by targeting the molecular marker IS6110 and then characterization of these strains as Beijing and Non-Beijing genotypes. Sputum samples from 102 MDR TB suspects from different cities of Punjab were collected and their record was stored in a database. Sputum samples were evaluated by Ziehl Neelson staining and cultured on Lownstein Jensen medium by Modified Petroff's method. DST was performed for first-line anti-mycobacterial drugs by indirect proportion method. Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were investigated for the presence of IS6110 and further identification as Beijing, Non-Beijing or mixed genotype. Percentage of male and female patients was found to be 58.8 and 41.2 % respectively. DST showed resistance of 93 % of isolates to isoniazid and rifampicin. All of the isolates showed positive results for IS6110 amplification. Based on PCR amplification of Beijing and non-Beijing primer sets 4.9 % of the patients showed infection with pure Beijing isolates, 14.7 % with both Beijing and non-Beijing isolates and 80.3 % with pure non-Beijing isolates. Analysis of IS6110 and Beijing sequences showed the presence of putative transposase conserved domain while non-Beijing sequences were epitomized with RAMP_I_III superfamily domain (CRISPR-associated protein family). TB in Pakistan is predominantly caused by Non-Beijing genotypes, but Beijing strains showed incessant circulation in our community as both single and mixed (co-infecting Non-Beijing and Beijing) strains.",

Methanotrophs can oxidize up to 30 % of the produced methane and thus have a pivotal environmental role in methane mitigation. India occupies the largest region under rice cultivation; however, most of the studies done on methanotrophic communities have focused on the Northern region. We studied methanotrophic community of a flooded, organically fertilized rice field using pmoA clone library approach. Organic rice fields impose a more serious threat as they produce more methane. pmoA gene is the main functional gene which is primarily used for taxonomical analysis of methanotrophs. Our results showed that the pmoA clone libraries from two growth stages of rice were dominated by pmoA sequences which were very distant from cultivated Type Ia methanotrophic genera (80–82 % nucleotide similarity) indicative of the presence of a putatively novel genus. We designated this group of clones as 'rice field clones' as this also includes many pmoA sequences originating from other rice fields. Thus, our current knowledge of methanotroph diversity from Indian rice fields has been expanded revealing that a substantial portion of methanotrophic diversity is unexplored.",

The transcriptomes of A. heterophyllum were analyzed to identify possible genes associated with tuberous root development by taking clues from genes implicated in other plant species. Out of 18 genes, eight genes encoding GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase (GMPase), SHAGGY, Expansin, RING-box protein 1 (RBX1), SRF receptor kinase (SRF), β-amylase, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) and Auxin responsive factor 2 (ARF2) showed higher transcript abundance in roots (13–171 folds) compared to shoots. Comparative expression analysis of those genes between tuberous root developmental stages showed 11–97 folds increase in transcripts in fully developed roots compared to young rootlets, thereby implying their association in biosynthesis, accumulation and storage of primary metabolites towards root biomass. Cluster analysis revealed a positive correlation with the gene expression data for different stages of tuberous root formation in A. heterophyllum. The outcome of this study can be useful in genetic improvement of A. heterophyllum for root biomass yield.",

The Celite-bound lipase was optimally active at 75 °C and pH 8.5 under shaking and showed maximum hydrolytic activity toward p-NPP as a substrate. The bound lipase was found to be stimulated only in the presence of Al3+ and EDTA. All surfactants (Tween-20, Tween-80 and Triton X-100) had an inhibitory effect on lipase activity. The optimization of various reaction conditions of ascorbyl palmitate was achieved considering one factor at a time. The esterification of ascorbic acid and palmitic acid was carried out with 1 M ascorbic acid and 2.5 M palmitic acid in DMSO at 75 °C for 18 h under shaking (120 rpm). Molecular sieves had an important effect on the ester synthesis resulting in an enhanced yield. The by-product (H2O) produced in the reaction was scavenged by the molecular sieves (20 mg/ml) added in the reaction mixture which enhanced the ester yield to 80 %.

Results showed that rice plants over-expressing SAP were tolerant to drought stress compared to wild type and the plants over-expressing AtBI-1, which is a homolog of the human Bax inhibitor-1 in Arabidopsis. ABA and JA levels in OsSAP and AtBI-1 transgenic plants consistently increased up to at least 3 days after drought treatment, whereas lower GA3 levels were recorded during early drought period. Comparison between control and transgenic plants overexpressing anti-apoptosis genes OsSAP and AtBI-1 resulted in different patterns of hormone levels, indicating that these genes are involved in the plant responses to drought stress and present an opportunity for further study on drought stress tolerance in rice and other plant species.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to determine whether the serum ferritin, the biomarker of an acute phase reactant and the gall bladder wall edema, an early indicator of capillary leakage can predict the severity of dengue fever. This study included 131 patients, who were between the age group of 18-80 years. The patients presented to our department with an acute illness, within the first four days of high temperature. The statistical analysis of this study was performed by using the Chi-square and independent Student's t tests. The diagnostic markers are considered statistically significant, if the serum ferritin level is higher than 500 ng/ml and the gall bladder wall thickness is more than 3 mm. The present study observed that, 39 patients (89%) who had severe dengue (n = 44) revealed a significant gall bladder wall thickening, and this correlation was significant statistically (p < 0.000). It was also observed that, the ferritin levels have a highly significant positive correlation with the severity of dengue. The severe dengue patients had a mean ferritin level of 9125.34 μg/l, whereas the non-severe group had 4271 μg/l. This comparison was also statistically significant, as the p value was 0.003. We report that the serum ferritin levels have a highly significant positive correlation with the severity of dengue. The gall bladder wall edema during the third and fourth day of the illness was also associated with severe dengue. However, diffuse gall bladder wall thickening and high serum ferritin levels are also reported in various other conditions and their exact cause have to be determined by the correlation of associated clinical findings and imaging features.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study investigated the ameliorative effects of Yinchen lipid-lowering tea (YCLLT) on Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the specific mechanism involved was also studied. We modeled hepatocellular steatosis with HepG2 cells and intervened with different concentrations of YCLLT-containing serum. Lipid deposition was assessed by oil red O staining and AdipoR1 expression was analyzed by Western blot. The hepatocyte steatosis model was further treated with YCLLT-containing serum and/or silencing AdipoR1. Lipid deposition was observed by oil red O staining. Flow cytometry was used to detect apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential. The levels of TNF-α, IL-6, MDA, 8-OHdG, and ATP were analyzed by ELISA or the corresponding kits. The mitochondrial structure was observed by transmission electron microscopy. The expression of AdipoR1/AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway factors was analyzed by Western blot, and co-localization of SIRT1 and immunofluorescence. The results revealed that YCLLT attenuated lipid deposition, inhibited the levels of inflammatory factors TNF-α and IL-6, reduced the levels of MDA and 8-OHdG, up-regulated the ATP content and mitochondrial membrane potential, and promoted the expression of AdipoR1, p-LKB1, p-AMPKα, SIRT1, and PGC-1a in a cellular model of NAFLD. Further, silencing of AdipoR1 inhibited the ameliorative effect of YCLLT in the NAFLD cell model. Altogether, Yinchen lipid-lowering tea attenuates lipid deposition in a fatty liver model by improving mitochondrial function via activating AdipoR1/AMPK/ SIRT1 signaling.",

    "abstract": "Anosmin-1 (ANOS1) is an extracellular matrix (ECM)-related glycoprotein that is highly expressed in a variety of tumors. However, the specific role and mechanism of ANOS1 in advanced gastric cancer (GC) and its correlation with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are not well understood, despite ongoing research into the expression of ANOS1 and its impact on clinical outcomes. The ANOS1 expression and clinical data were acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to analyze the differential expression of ANOS1 and its prognostic impact in advanced gastric cancer. The expression of ANOS1 and E-cadherin was detected using immunohistochemical (IHC) techniques in 99 cases of advanced gastric cancer (GC) tissues and their adjacent normal tissues. Subsequently, the correlation of ANOS1 with clinicopathological characteristics was performed to discuss using chi-square test. The prognostic value of ANOS1 expression was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression. The Spearman's study was conducted to explore the relationship between ANOS1 expression, immunity, and EMT-related genes. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was utilized to determine the functional enrichment of ANOS1 in gastric cancer and the \"pRRophetic\"R package was utilized to determine the relationship between ANOS1 expression and drug sensitivity. TCGA data analysis has shown that ANOS1 was significantly overexpressed in advanced GC and high ANOS1 expression had a poor prognosis. The IHC analysis showed elevated ANOS1 levels in advanced GC tissues compared to the adjacent tissues. High ANOS1 expression was correlated with tumor infiltration, lymph node metastasis, TNM stage, and vascular invasion in advanced GC, indicating its role in tumor invasiveness and metastasis. Furthermore, research indicated that the expression of ANOS1 was inversely associated with E-cadherin levels in advanced GC. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with high ANOS1 expression had poorer overall survival than those with low expression. Furthermore, ANOS1 was positively associated with EMT-related genes and correlated with 22 types of immune cell infiltration and 7 immune checkpoints. The patients with high expression levels of ANOS1 demonstrated sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil, dasatinib, and docetaxel. GSEA analysis revealed significant enrichment of ANOS1 in multiple oncogenic pathways, particularly extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor interactions, focal adhesion, hematopoietic cell lineage, chemokine signaling pathways, pathways in cancer, and transforming growth factor-β signaling pathway. ANOS1 may impact gastric cancer progression by regulating EMT, suggesting its dual utility as both a prognostic biomarker and a novel therapeutic target for GC intervention.",

The aim of this study was to compare the features and usefulness of genomic SSR (gSSR) and EST-SSRs in European plum (Prunus domestica L.), an economically important, hexaploid stone fruit crop globally cultivated to produce fleshy fruits and derived foodstuff. The analysis of an ample set of morphologically diverse varieties indicated that gSSRs and EST-SSRs provide different estimates of some of the locus-based indicators of diversity. Moreover, the two classes of SSRs gave different, weakly correlated, estimations of distance-based parameters with gSSRs being more powerful for discriminating purposes. The two SSR classes provide complementary information in European plum, making the contribution of EST-SSRs useful not only as non-neutral markers. The differences between SSR classes are discussed considering the neutral and non-neutral evolution, and the polyploidy and asexual propagation of the cultivated tree varieties.",

    "abstract": "Haemophilus influenzae, a Gram-negative bacterium and a member of the family Pasteurellaceae, causes chronic bronchitis, bacteremia, meningitis, etc. The H. influenzae is the first organism whose genome was completely sequenced and annotated. Here, we have extensively analyzed the genome of H. influenzae using available proteins structure and function analysis tools. The objective of this analysis is to assign a precise function to hypothetical proteins (HPs) whose functions are not determined so far. Function prediction of these proteins is helpful in precise understanding of mechanisms of pathogenesis and biochemical pathways important for selecting novel therapeutic target. After an extensive analysis of H. Influenzae genome we have found 13 HPs showing high level of sequence and structural similarity to the enzyme isomerase. Consequently, the structures of HPs have been modeled and analyzed to determine their precise functions. We found these HPs are alanine racemase, lysine 2, 3-aminomutase, topoisomerase DNA-binding C4 zinc finger, pseudouridine synthase B, C and E (Rlu B, C and E), hydroxypyruvate isomerase, nucleoside-diphosphate-sugar epimerase, amidophosphoribosyltransferase, aldose-1-epimerase, tautomerase/MIF, Xylose isomerase-like, have TIM barrel domain and sedoheptulose-7-phosphate isomerase like activity, signifying their corresponding functions in the H. influenzae. This work provides a better understanding of the role HPs with isomerase activities in the survival and pathogenesis of H. influenzae.",

The isolated actinomycetes and fungi did not produce significant inhibition zones against the tested pathogens; however, the macroalgal isolated actinomycetes strain AMA1 produced reddish pigment in Starch Casein medium which remained stable till the stationary phase of growth. The marine sediment isolate BCS4, identified as Bacillus sp. showed wide spectrum of activity against the tested Gram positive bacteria, S. simulans MTCC 3610 and Gram negative bacteria, Proteus vulgaris with zone of inhibitions of 25 and 11 mm respectively. Better extraction of the bioactive compound was obtained with ethyl acetate when compared with methanol, benzene and hexane and TLC analysis revealed the presence of an active compound. The 16SrRNA sequencing confirmed the potent strain belong to Bacillus sp. and hence designated Bacillus sp. BCS4.",

CAV is primarily involved in several biosynthetic processes such as ureagenesis, gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis by providing bicarbonate ion. Here, we report a new strategy for cloning, expression and purification for CAVA in the bacterial system followed by its biophysical characterization. The cDNA of CAVA, a 801 nucleotide long that encodes a 267-amino acid polypeptide of molecular mass of 30-kDa (excluding signal peptide), was sub-cloned in the expression vector pET21c and transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) for expression. The recombinant protein was purified in two steps by Ni-NTA and DEAE weak anion-exchange chromatography under native condition from the supernatant, while inclusion bodies (IBs) were used to get protein under the denatured condition with a relatively high yield. CAVA was purified under denatured conditions in a single step using Ni-NTA chromatography. SDS-PAGE showed a band of 30-kDa, which was further confirmed as CAVA by Western blot and MALDI-TOF/MS. We further performed enzyme activity to ensure that both forms of purified proteins are enzymatically active. Measurements of secondary structure of the native, denatured and renatured proteins were carried out using circular dichroism. The purified protein can be further used for structural and biochemical studies.",

The isolates were screened for their CLA production capability at different level of linoleic acid (LA) (0, 200, 400, 600, 800 μg/ml) at different time intervals (0, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h). A total of more than 300 anaerobic cultures were isolated and 31 of them were identified as Butyrivibrio spp. based on morphological, biochemical and molecular characterization. Further, molecular characterization revealed that a large portion (67.7 %) of isolated Butyrivibrio belonged to Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens (B. fibrisolvens) species which is considered to be the most active bacteria amongst the rumen bacteria populace in terms of CLA production. Bacterial isolate VIII (strain 4a) showed highest CLA production ability (140.77 μg/ml) when incubated at 200 μg/ml LA for 2 h, which is 240 % higher than the isolate XXVII, Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus (B. proteoclasticus) showing lowest CLA production (57.28 μg/ml) amongst the screened isolates. It was evident from the observations recorded during the course of experiments that CLA production ability is strain specific and thus did not follow a single pattern. CLA production also varied with time of incubation and concentration of free linoleic acid supplemented in the growth medium. The results of these findings put forward a strain that is high CLA producer and can be further exploited as an additive for enhancing meat and milk quality in ruminants.",

Currently available commercial vaccines are designed by targeting mainly HPV16 and HPV18 viral strains as these are the most common strains associated with cervical cancer. Because of the high level of antigenic specificity of HPV capsid antigens, the currently available vaccines are not suitable to provide cross-protection from all other high-risk HPV strains. Due to increasing reports of cervical cancer cases from other HPV high-risk strains other than HPV16 and 18, it is crucial to design vaccine that generate reasonable CD8+ T-cell responses for possibly all the high-risk strains. With this aim, we have developed a computational workflow to identify conserved cross-clade CD8+ T-cell HPV vaccine candidates by considering E1, E2, E6 and E7 proteins from all the high-risk HPV strains. We have identified a set of 14 immunogenic conserved peptide fragments that are supposed to provide protection against infection from any of the high-risk HPV strains across globe.",

    "abstract": "A thermophilic, heterotrophic and facultatively anaerobic bacterium designated strain D7XPN1 was isolated from Baku BakuKing™, a commercial food-waste degrading bioreactor (composter). The strain grew optimally at 45 °C (growth range between 24 and 50 °C) and pH 7 (growth pH range between pH 5 and 9) in Luria Broth supplemented with 0.3 % glucose. Strain D7XPN1 tolerated up to 7 % NaCl and showed amylolytic and xylanolytic activities. 16S rRNA gene analysis placed strain D7XPN1 in the cluster represented by Bacillus subtilis and the genome analysis of the 4.1 Mb genome sequence determined using RAST (Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology) indicated a total of 5116 genomic features were present of which 2320 features could be grouped into several subsystem categories. Of these, 615 features were related to carbohydrate metabolism which included a range of enzymes with potential in the biodegradation of food wastes, a property consistent with the ecological habitat of the isolate. ANIb (Average Nucleotide Identity based on BLAST) analysis with 49 Bacillus subtilis genomes indicated that it was distantly related to the three currently taxonomically validated B. subtilis subspecies namely B. subtilis subsp. subtilis (95.6 %), B. subtilis subsp. spizizenii (93 %) and B. subtilis subsp. inaquosorum (92 %) and based on our current knowledge warranted that it be included as a separate cluster together with strain JS which it was closely related (98.69 %). The close relationship of strains D7XPN1 and JS is also supported from our results from electronic DNA-DNA Hybridization (e-DDH) studies. Furthermore, our additional in-depth phylogenomic analyses using three different datasets unequivocally supported the creation of a fourth B. subtilis subspecies to include strains D7XPN1 and JS for which we propose strain D7XPN1T (=KCTC 33554T, JCM 30051T) as the type strain, and designate it as B. subtilis subsp. stecoris.",

Of the process variables screened, DNTs (2,4-DNT and 2,6-DNT), MgSO4·7H2O, temperature and inoculum size (O.D.) were selected as the most important (P value <0.05) factors. In multiresponse analysis of central composite design, medium formulation consisting of 474/470 mg l−1 2,4-DNT/2,6-DNT, 0.11 g l−1 MgSO4·7H2O, 37.5 °C temperature and 1.05 OD inoculum size were found to predict maximum % degradation and specific growth rate of 97.55 % and 0.19 h−1, respectively. The validity of the optimized variables was verified in shake flasks. The optimized media significantly shortened the time required for biodegradation of DNTs while providing a nearly 30 % (for 2,4-DNT) and 70 % (for 2,6-DNT) increased biodegradation along with 5.64-fold increase in specific growth rate for both DNTs.",

Disease incidence ranged from 15 to 30%. Phytoplasma presence was confirmed in all symptomatic chrysanthemum varieties by molecular identification assays. Sequence comparison, phylogenetic and in silico RFLP analyses of 16S rDNA sequences allowed the identification of the chrysanthemum infecting phytoplasma strains into different ribosomal groups and subgroups, namely 16SrI, 16SrII-D, 16SrVI-D and 16SrXIV. Detection of phytoplasma strains of 16SrII-D subgroup were also confirmed in symptomatic Chenopodium album and Parthenium hysterophorus plants grown in and around the surveyed chrysanthemum fields at New Delhi, whereas 16SrVI-D phytoplasma strains were detected in symptomatic Cannabis sativa weed and leafhopper Hishimonus phycitis individuals collected from the symptomatic chrysanthemum fields at New Delhi. This is the first report on the presence of 16SrVI and 16SrXIV groups of phytoplasmas in chrysanthemum plants. Studies on genetic diversity of phytoplasmas infecting the major chrysanthemum varieties in India and their epidemiological aspects had previously not been reported. The detection and identification of phytoplasmas in different chrysanthemum varieties could contribute to increase the awareness among farmers in the management of these diseases.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, which causes severe pneumonia epidemics, probably originated from Chinese horseshoe bats, but the intermediate and host range is still unknown. ACE2 is the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. The binding capacity of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to ACE2 is the critical determinant of viral host range and cross-species infection. Here, we used an in silico approach to predict the potential animals range with high susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 by modelling and studying the Spike-ACE2 interaction of 22 domestic and wild animals. Our results showed that all studied animals are potentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection with a slight difference in the binding affinity and stability of their ACE2-RBD complexes. Furthermore, we identified a specific substitution of tyrosine to histidine at position 41 in ACE2 that likely reduces the affinity to SARS-CoV-2 in horses and greater horseshoe bats. These results may help to provide important insights into SARS-CoV-2 host range which will make it possible to control the spread of the virus and identify animal models that could be used for screening antiviral drugs or vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Moscatilin (stilbenoid) is a plant-derived anticancer compound, and it has mostly been isolated from threatened wild Dendrobium species. The present study attempts to evaluate the cytotoxicity of Moscatilin on several cancer cell lines through MTT assay. Additionally, it also aims towards estimating and comparing the radiosensitivity, cell-cycle progression, and apoptotic/necrotic effect induced by Moscatilin on different cell lines. The effects of Moscatilin was compared with another significant stilbenoid anticancer agent, Resveratrol (a structural analog of Moscatilin), whose presence has also been reported in Dendrobiums . Considering the threatened nature of this genus, crude extracts of a tropical and epiphytic Dendrobium species, viz., Dendrobium ovatum , prepared from in vitro seedlings were also tested towards cytotoxicity and radiosensitization efficacy. Moscatilin functioned as an effective radiosensitizer at 5 µg/ml along with 1 Gy X-ray and 200 J/m 2 UV-C radiations. It was also able to perturb cell cycle both at replicative and post-replicative phases with the aforementioned combination. Moscatilin, in unison with radiation, triggered immunogenic death specifically on cancer cells starting from Pyroptosis, terminating in Necroptosis. Moscatilin, when used singly, could evoke immunogenic cell death. Analyses of Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns released during radiation and Moscatilin treatment would aid in ascertaining the mode of cell death. Moscatilin is a potential radiosensitizer and must be tested for preclinical and clinical trials to combat cancer.",

A cDNA library was constructed enriched in differentially expressed transcripts in the resistant cultivar Pusa mukta. A total of 150 unigenes were classified into five functional categories. The present study indicates that the defense-related unigenes accounted for the 35 % of the total unigenes studied. Confirmation of defense-specific representation genes through semiquantitative RT-PCR revealed their increased expression in the resistant cultivar which was validated by qPCR. The resistant cultivar elicited a strong hypersensitive response upon attack by black rot pathogen. The study is first of its kind where the resistant cultivar Pusa mukta in India has been assessed for its resistance to the bacterial pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Moscatilin, a bibenzyl derivative (stilbenoid), mostly found in one of the largest genera of Orchidaceae; Dendrobium has many therapeutic benefits. Its function as an anticancer agent has been widely demonstrated through many research investigations. However, the compound has not been produced in vitro to date. The present study highlights the development of cultures viz., seedling generation, callus induction and callus regeneration (transformation of callus into plantlets). These cultures were devised to conserve the threatened tropical epiphytic orchid species, Dendrobium ovatum and identify their potential towards moscatilin bioproduction in vitro. Among the three culture platforms, callus-derived plantlets could yield high moscatilin when treated with l -Phenylalanine as a precursor. Tissue differentiation was found to be indispensable for the high production of this polyphenol. These cultures also offer potential commercial benefits as they can serve as appropriate platforms to decode moscatilin biosynthesis and other significant bibenzyl derivatives. Elicitors, such as chitosan, salicylic acid, and methyl jasmonate, were found, causing an enhancement in moscatilin content in the cultures. The seedlings obtained can serve towards ecorestoration and preservation of the studied species. Callogenesis was useful in plantlet regeneration, as callus-derived plantlets could be utilized for the enrichment and commercial scale-up of moscatilin-like chemicals.",

    "abstract": "Uncontrolled enzyme-immobilizer interactions were evident after immobilizing β-galactosidase onto soy-protein isolate-glutaraldehyde-functionalized carrageenan beads. Such interactions triggered shortcomings in the immobilized β-galactosidase (iβGL) thermal and storage stabilities. The thermal stability of the iβGL was somewhat lesser than that of the free βGL. Moreover, the iβGL suffered an initial sharp fall-off in its activity after storing it. Thus, approaches were adopted to prevent the occurrence of such uncontrolled enzyme-immobilizer interactions, and accordingly, boost the stability of the iβGL. These approaches involved neutralizing the covalently reactive GA entities via glycine and also altering the functionalizing GA concentrations. Nonetheless, no improvement was recorded in the iβGL thermal stability and this indicated that the uncontrolled enzyme-immobilizer interactions were not mediated via GA. Another approach was then attempted which involved treating the iβGL with lactose. The lactose-treated iβGL (LT-iβGL) presented superior thermal stability as was verified from its smaller k d and bigger t 1/2 and D-values. The LT-iβGL t 1/2 values were 5.60 and 3.53 fold higher than those presented by the free βGL at 62 and 65 °C, respectively. Moreover, the LT- iβGL presented loftier ΔG than did the free βGL. The storage stability of the LT- iβGL was also superior as it offered 100.41% of its commencing activity on its 43rd storage day. Thus, it could be concluded that lactose prevented the uncontrolled enzyme-immobilizer interactions. Finally, advantageous galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) were prepared via the iβGL. The GOS were then analyzed with mass spectrometry, and it was shown that their degree of polymerization reached up to 7.",

    "abstract": "This study developed a new single-tube multiplex real-time PCR method for detecting toxigenic C. difficile directly from fecal samples using tcdA, tcdB, cdtB, and internal gene tpi as targets, which could be performed on kinds of polymerase chain reaction device including point-of-care testing (POCT), with improved detection efficiency. The specificity, sensitivity, and repeatability of each gene was evaluated using 69 C. difficile isolates and 74 fecal samples. Results were compared with established PCR, qPCR, and ELISA methods. Interspecies specificity was 100% based on six common intestinal pathogens (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus Faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium botulinum). The lower detection limit (LDL) for tcdA, tcdB, and cdtB with pure C. difficile DNA was 101,100, and 100 copies/μL, respectively, the coefficients of variation among different experimental batches and within each experimental batch were both less than 3%, which shows that this method has strong repeatability. And the LDL of fecal DNA was 5 × 100, 5 × 103, and 5 × 102 colony-forming units (CFU)/g, respectively. In addition, the efficiency for detection of tcdA was compared with established PCR and real-time PCR methods, demonstrating high consistency (98.4%) and similar sensitivity. ELISA was used to confirm inconsistent results, which were identical with our method. The sensitivity and specificity for detecting toxigenic C. difficile in fecal samples were 96.49% and 94.12% compared with the toxigenic culture (TC). This method effectively identified the toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains with high specificity, sensitivity, and repeatability, and could reduce the false positive rate of tcdA, and accurately identify the typical Asian strain RT017, making it potentially contribute to the surveillance of CDI in China.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13205-022-03434-6.",

The wound healing effects and antioxidant capacities of water extracts from Nostoc NIES-2111_MUM004 were evaluated via in vitro wound scratch assay and three antioxidant assays respectively. Results showed that the water extracts were protein-rich and exhibited good antioxidant properties in ABTS radical scavenging (11.27 ± 0.205 mg TAE g-1 extract), Ferric reducing antioxidant power (1652.71 ± 110.71 mg TAE g-1 extract) and β-carotene bleaching assay (354.90 ± 31.80 mg TAE g-1 extract). Also, extracts were non-cytotoxic in concentrations up to 250 µg/mL as reflected in cytotoxicity assay. Importantly, water extracts showed considerable proliferation and migration activity at 125 µg/mL with wound closure rate as high as 42.67%. Statistical correlation revealed no significant relationship (p > 0.05) between protein fraction and the wound healing properties, confirming that phycobiliproteins were not solely responsible for wound healing activities. Subsequent Q-TOF-LCMS analysis identified six protein families involved in enhancing the proliferation and migration of epithelial cells. These findings are antecedent in the uncovering of continuous supplies of bioactive compounds from new and sustainable sources. Ultimately, enriching the microalgae menu for applications in pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and cosmeceuticals.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension has not been elucidated. We investigated the role of a circular ribonucleic acid, circDiaph3, in the proliferation and migration of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells during pulmonary hypertension. CircDiaph3 overexpression in blood samples of patients with pulmonary hypertension was analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Subsequently, a rat model of pulmonary arterial hypertension was established under hypoxic conditions. Pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells were harvested from the rat model for subsequent experiments with small interfering ribonucleic acid-mediated knockdown of circDiaph3. In cell model, we found that PI3K, AKT, mTOR and insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling pathway (IGF1R) and smooth muscle cell marker genes (α-SMA, Vcam1) were significantly downregulated. The overexpression of Igf1r in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells rescued the downregulated smooth muscle cell genes, IGF1R signaling pathway proteins, increased smooth muscle cell proliferation, and reduced apoptosis. CircDiaph3 regulates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway via IGF1R to inhibit apoptosis and promote proliferation of smooth muscle cells. Additionally, adenovirus-mediated in vivo inhibition of circDiaph3 was carried out in rats with pulmonary arterial hypertension, followed by harvesting of their pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells for subsequent experiments. Excessive proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the pulmonary artery has narrowed the pulmonary artery lumen, thereby causing pulmonary hypertension, and our results suggest that circDiaph3 has important value in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13205-023-03739-0.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In our recent study, we explored the efficacy of three-dimensional (3D) measurement of tumor volume in predicting the improvement of quality of life (QoL) in patients suffering from renal cell cancer (RCC), who were treated with axitinib and anti-PD-L1 antibodies. This study encompassed 18 RCC patients, including 10 men and 8 women, with an average age of 56.83 ± 9.94 years. By utilizing 3D Slicer software, we analyzed pre- and post-treatment CT scans to assess changes in tumor volume. Patients' QoL was evaluated through the FKSI–DRS questionnaire. Our findings revealed that 3D models for all patients were successfully created, and there was a moderate agreement between treatment response classifications based on RECIST 1.1 criteria and volumetric analysis (kappa = 0.556, p = 0.001). Notably, nine patients reported a clinically meaningful improvement in QoL following the treatment. Interestingly, the change in tumor volume as indicated by the 3D model showed a higher area under the curve in predicting QoL improvement compared to the change in diameter measured by CT, although this difference was not statistically significant (z = 0.593, p = 0.553). Furthermore, a multivariable analysis identified the change in tumor volume based on the 3D model as an independent predictor of QoL improvement (odds ratio = 1.073, 95% CI 1.002–1.149, p = 0.045).In conclusion, our study suggests that the change in tumor volume measured by a 3D model may be a more effective predictor of symptom improvement in RCC patients than traditional CT-based diameter measurements. This offers a novel approach for assessing treatment response and patient well-being, presenting a significant advancement in the field of RCC treatment.",

The biological effects of the ZnO-NPs were then tested against C3A hepatocyte cells and L6 myocyte cell lines via series of analysis, including cytotoxicity, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antidiabetic effect via enzymatic inhibition. The UV–Vis analysis showed a maximum absorption spectrum at 360, and the TEM analysis reveals a spherical and hexagonal structures, with an average dimension of 28.05–58.3 nm, and the XRD reveals a crystalline hexagonal structure. The zeta potential evaluation indicated that the ZnO-NPs are relatively stable at − 20 mV, and the FTIR analysis identified some important functional group associated with phenolics, carboxylic acid, and amides that are responsible for reducing and stabilizing the ZnO-NPs. The synthesized ZnO-NPs demonstrated cytotoxic effects on the cell lines at higher concentrations (125 µg/mL and 250 µg/mL), complicating the interpretation of the results of the inflammatory and antioxidant assays. However, there was a significant ( p &lt; 0.05) increase in the inhibitions of pancreatic lipase, alpha-glucosidase, and alpha-amylase, indicating beneficial antidiabetic effects.",

    "abstract": "The abnormalities caused by excess fat accumulation can result in pathological conditions which are linked to several interrelated diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and obesity. This set of conditions, known as metabolic syndrome, is a global pandemic of enormous medical, economic, and social concern affecting a significant portion of the world's population. Although genetics, physiology and environmental components play a major role in the onset of disease caused by excessive fat accumulation, little is known about how or to what extent each of these factors contributes to it. The worm, Caenorhabditis elegans offers an opportunity to study disease related to metabolic disorder in a developmental system that provides anatomical and genomic simplicity relative to the vertebrate animals and is an excellent eukaryotic genetic model which enable us to answer the questions concerning fat accumulation which remain unresolved. The stored triglycerides (TG) provide the primary source of energy during periods of food deficiency. In nature, lipid stored as TGs are hydrolyzed into fatty acids which are broken down through β-oxidation to yield acetyl-CoA. Our recent study suggests that a member of C. elegans Krüppel-like factor, klf-3 regulates lipid metabolism by promoting FA β-oxidation and in parallel may contribute in normal reproduction and fecundity. Genetic and epigenetic factors that influence this pathway may have considerable impact on fat related diseases in human. Increasing number of studies suggest the role of mammalian KLFs in adipogenesis. This functional conservation should guide our further effort to explore C. elegans as a legitimate model system for studying the role of KLFs in many pathway components of lipid metabolism.",

Unfortunately, the clinical usefulness of As2O3 has been limited by its toxicity. The present study was designed to investigate the toxic effects of As2O3 at its clinical concentrations. Experimental rats were administered with As2O3 2, 4 and 8 mg/kg body weight for a period of 45 days and the serum glucose, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, lipid peroxidation and antioxidant status were measured. As2O3-treated rats showed elevated serum glucose, creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase concentrations. Lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde was found to be produced more in arsenic-treated rats. Reduced glutathione and glutathione-dependant antioxidant enzymes, glutathione-S-transferase and glutathione peroxidase, and the antiperoxidative enzymes, superoxide dismutase and catalase, concentrations were reduced with the As2O3 treatment. All these toxic effects were found increased with the increase in concentration of As2O3. The results of the study indicate that As2O3 produced dose-dependant toxic side effects at its clinical concentrations.",

    "abstract": "Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is popularly known as insecticidal bacterium. However, non-insecticidal Bt strains are more extensively available in natural environment than the insecticidal ones. Parasporin (PS) is a collection of genealogically heterogeneous Cry proteins synthesized in non-insecticidal isolates of Bt. An important character generally related with PS proteins is their strong cytocidal activity preferentially on human cancer cells of various origins. Identification and characterization of novel parasporin protein which are non-hemolytic and non-insecticidal but having selective anticancer activity raise the possibility of a novel application of Bt in medical field. In the present study, seven new indigenous isolates (T6, T37, T68, T98, T165, T186, and T461) of Bt showed variation in colony morphology, crystal characters and protein profiles with each other. Out of the seven new isolates screened for parasporin (ps) and cry genes, two of the new indigenous isolates (T98 and T186) of Bt showed the presence of ps4 gene. Partial ps4 gene was cloned from the two new isolates and the sequence of partial ps4 gene showed high homology with its holotype ps4Aa1. These two isolates were characterized based on the proteolytic processing of the inclusion proteins and the proteolytic products were found to be comparable to the PS4 reference strain A1470. The two isolates of Bt did not show toxicity toward Spodoptera litura and Helicoverpa armigera. Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that the isolates T98 and T186 are parasporin producers.",

Axenically grown bryophytes expressed potential in biotechnological processes. The present study was designed to investigate the in vitro cell growth, culture parameters and their effect on flavonoid synthesis. Chlorophyll-containing callus cells of Marchantia linearis Lehm & Lindenb. is able to grow under low light in the presence of organic carbon source and retain the ability to produce flavonoids. Highest flavonoid production was achieved using 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid as growth hormone. Inoculum size, light intensity, organic carbon source and cations are the culture parameters affecting flavonoid productivity. Maximum flavonoid productivity is observed under low light intensity, with a photon flux density ca. 20 μmol/m2/s. Optimal inoculum size and glucose concentration for flavonoid production are 10-14 and 2-3 %, respectively. Cations like ferrous trigger flavonoid synthesis by increasing its intracellular concentrations. Flavonoid production in the cell culture is shown to be significantly growth related. Osmotic stress is ineffective in triggering flavonoid synthesis. Methyl jasmonate and 2-(2-fluoro-6-nitrobenzylsulfanyl) pyridine-4-carbothioamide elicitors showed positive effect on intracellular flavonoid content in cultured cells. Using the standard plot of quercetin (y = 0.0148x, R2 = 0.975), the flavonoid contents of in vitro samples were found ranging from 4.0 to 17.7 mg quercetin equivalent/g tissue. Flavonoids are fractionated by HPLC-PAD revealed the presence of quercetin (182.5 μg/g), luteolin (464.5 μg/g) and apigenin (297.5 μg/g).

    "abstract": "Catharanthus roseus is an important medicinal plant known for its pharmacological qualities such as antimicrobial, anticancerous, antifeedant, antisterility, antidiabetic activities. More than 130 bioactive compounds like vinblastine, vindoline and vincristine have been synthesized in this plant. Extensive studies have been carried out for optimization regeneration and transformation protocols. Most of the protocol described are laborious and time-consuming. Due to sophisticated protocol of regeneration and genetic transformation, the production of these bioactive molecules is less and not feasible to be commercialized worldwide. Here we have optimized the efficient protocol for regeneration and transformation to minimize the time scale and enhance the transformation frequency through Agrobacterium and sonication-assisted transformation (SAAT) method. In this study, hypocotyl explants responded best for maximal production of transformed shoots. The callus percentage were recorded 52% with 1.0 mg L-1 (BAP) and 0.5 mg L-1 (NAA) while 80% shoot percentage obtained with 4.0 mg L-1 (BAP) and 0.05 mg L-1 (NAA). The microscopic studies revealed that the expression of GFP was clearly localized in leaf tissue of the C. roseus after transformation of pRepGFP0029 construct. Consequently, transformation efficiency was revealed on the basis of GFP localization. The transformation efficiency of SAAT method was 6.0% comparable to 3.5% as conventional method. Further, PCR analysis confirmed the integration of the nptII gene in the transformed plantlets of C. roseus.",

    "abstract": "Soil is major reservoir for microbes and harbors a vast microbial diversity. Soil microbiota plays a pivotal role in biogeochemical cycles, bioremediation, and in health and disease states of humans, animals, and plants. It is imperative to understand the microbial signatures which are specific in such an ecosystem to unravel their potential role and impact on environment. During the recent years, exploration of soil microbial communities has been geared up with the advent of advanced sequencing technologies. Introduction of custom-made protocols and optimized procedures have enhanced the accuracy levels along with cost-effectiveness of DNA extraction. Standardization of DNA extraction method from soil microbiota has its own limitations due to different nature of soils and the complexity of ecosystems. Though a few standardized protocols are in usage, huge variations and complexities among the microbial communities frequently suggest the optimization, based on various known and unknown factors. Therefore, a set of four standardized DNA isolation protocols was comparatively analyzed with respect to our custom-made protocol owing to the scientific fact that the same protocol does not hold good for all soil samples. Furthermore, the developed protocol has been successfully applied for the identification of efficient plant-specific Rhizobial stains for five legume plants from the soils of various locations under same geographical region. Out of 40 Badrachalam forest soils, five samples, KPFS36, CHFS17, TPFS33, GVFS06, and GPFS40, one for each of Arachis hypogaea, Vigna radiata, Vigna mungo, Glycine max, and Cicer arietinum plants, were selected, respectively, for the soil DNA extraction. A considerable improvement in the DNA yield was identified using the modified protocol with a yield of 21.08 μg/g providing abundant DNA fragments for further investigation on Rhizobial species.",

However, the CO2 vol% specifically required at operating conditions to meet the carbon requirement of algal cells in photobioreactor is never determined and 1-10% v/v CO2-enriched air is arbitrarily used. A scheme is proposed and experimentally validated for Chlorella vulgaris that allows computing CO2-saturated growth feasible at given CO2 vol% and volumetric O2 mass-transfer coefficient (k L a)O. CO2 sufficiency in an experiment can be theoretically established to adjust conditions for CO2-saturated growth. The methodology completely eliminates the requirement of CO2 electrode for online estimation of dissolved CO2 to determine critical CO2 concentration (Ccrit), specific CO2 uptake rate (SCUR), and volumetric CO2 mass-transfer coefficient (k L a)C required for the governing CO2 mass-transfer equation. Ccrit was estimated from specific O2 production rate (SOPR) measurements at different dissolved CO2 concentrations. SCUR was calculated from SOPR and photosynthetic quotient (PQ) determined from the balanced stoichiometric equation of growth. Effect of light attenuation and nutrient depletion on biomass estimate is also discussed. Furthermore, a simple design of photosynthetic activity measurement system was used, which minimizes light attenuation by hanging a low depth (ca. 10 mm) culture over the light source.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Extraction of RNA from Dioscorea is difficult because of rich mucilage and secondary metabolite content. High-quality RNA is required for RT-PCR and transcriptome analysis. Different protocols and common extraction kits were used for RNA extraction in Dioscorea , but the results were not satisfactory. A CTAB based protocol with lithium chloride precipitation yielded good quality RNA. The RNA isolated using this protocol was successfully used for RT-PCR and transcriptome sequencing experiments. Mucilage content varies at different developmental stages of Dioscorea and the present protocol was effective in isolating RNA from such samples. Although the protocol was originally modified for tuber tissues, it can be used also for extraction of RNA from rhizome, root, shoot and leaf.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigated the effect of mixed cultures of Pseudomonas aureofaciens and Escherichia coli and air as gas on degradation of chemical oxygen demand (COD) in three-phase inverse fluidized beds (TPIFBs) for textile effluents with initial COD of 1200 ppm (effluent 1) and 640 ppm (effluent 2). Investigators focused on the importance of different design of gas spargers of the TPIFB for checking its effect on COD reduction performance. For this purpose, four different gas spargers were fabricated for gas flow entry into bioreactor with different % open area: Gas sparger 1 (18% open area), sparger 2 (10.42% open area), sparger 3 (8.077% open area) and sparger 4 (1.53% open area). These percentage open area decided the amount of gas flow in a unit time in batch studies, which in turn rely mainly on superficial gas velocity. The reduction in COD was measured at two different superficial gas velocity (0.00343 and 0.004068 m/s) and at two ratio of static bed height to diameter (H/D) of 0.5 and 0.25 in an aerobic mode. Textile effluent 1 resulted in 98.07% COD reduction with sparger 3 and discharged at 23.14 ppm in 28 h. Textile effluent 2 resulted in 96.5% COD reduction with sparger 2 and discharged at 22.4 ppm in 22 h. The resulting COD values of Effluent 1 and effluent 2 were in range of discharge limit and resulted at a low gas velocity of 0.00343 m/s and low H/D ratio of 0.25. The gas holdup correlation was found to be ε g = 0.0064 U g0.98 .",

    "abstract": "Abstract Given the high mortality rate associated with tumors and the severe side effects of current treatments, scientists are exploring alternative therapies with fewer adverse effects. They are increasingly turning to natural remedies, much like our ancestors who used plant extracts to treat various ailments long before understanding the underlying mechanisms. Even though they did not know exactly why these plants treated those diseases then, we have the privilege of testing these plants and discovering the active ingredients responsible for these effects. This study aims to investigate the anticancer mechanisms of Pulicaria crispa hexane fraction (Hex F) against human colorectal cancer cells and elucidate its molecular pathways of action. The methanol extract of P. crispa and its fractions were evaluated for cytotoxic activity using MTT assay against HepG2, HCT116, and Hep-2 cancer cell lines, with oral epithelial normal cells (OEC) as controls. The most potent fraction (Hex F) was further analyzed using flow cytometry for cell cycle and apoptosis analysis, qRT-PCR for gene expression profiling, ELISA for protein quantification, and biochemical assays for oxidative stress and glycolytic enzyme activities. Hex F demonstrated significant cytotoxicity against HCT116 cells with an IC 50 of 39.4 μg/mL and a selectivity index of 1.76 indicating preferential toxicity toward cancer cells. Flow cytometry analysis revealed G 2 /M phase cell cycle arrest and significant induction of apoptosis. Gene expression analysis showed significant upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes p53, caspase-8, and caspase-9, while anti-apoptotic Bcl2 was downregulated). Protein analysis confirmed increased caspase-3 and caspase-7 activities, accompanied by enhanced anti-inflammatory response with increased IL-10 and decreased IL-4 levels. Oxidative stress markers indicated cellular damage with decreased GSH and SOD levels, while MDA increased significantly. Glycolytic enzyme activities were substantially reduced, with PK, Aldolase, and LDH activities decreased, suggesting metabolic disruption. GC–MS analysis identified β-sitosterol (17.89%), phytol (15.65%), stigmasterol (13.13%), and lupeol (12.89%) as major bioactive compounds. These findings demonstrate that P. crispa Hex F exerts anticancer effects through multiple mechanisms including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, oxidative stress generation, and metabolic disruption, supporting its potential as a natural anticancer therapeutic agent.",

    "abstract": "The shared pathways between neuroinflammation and diabetes mellitus involve the NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequent production of the IL-1β. Chronic hyperactivation of hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and innate immunity are implicated in neurological disorders and diabetes. Repurposing drugs with anti-inflammatory properties allows for faster clinical translation in neuroinflammation as compared to developing new drugs from scratch. Few repurposed drugs have already undergone safety and efficacy testing for other conditions, making them attractive candidates for the neuroinflammatory disorders. Gliburide, an oral hypoglycaemic effectively inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome, signifying that it may be used to treat the neuroinflammation-related disorders. A GLP-1 receptor agonist, liraglutide established encouraging effects in regulating hyperglycaemia and possibly lowering neuroinflammation. Patients who were obese and receiving liraglutide saw improvements in their glycaemic control and a decrease in neuroinflammatory markers in addition to the weight loss. Studies on mice suggested that, sulphonyl-ureas have properties to decrease the neuroinflammatory conditions and has potential benefits by targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway, modulating lipopolysaccharide induced micro and astroglial neuroinflammation by activating the ERK/STAT3/NF-κB signalling pathways. Empagliflozin offered neuroprotection and helped in neurovascular remodelling, which is crucial for maintaining cognitive function. Repurposing is already-approved for the antidiabetic medications, such as insulin, metformin and thiazolidinediones. Insulin may be a viable and effective approach to treat neuroinflammation. In conclusion, the interplay between diabetes and neuroinflammation highlights the importance of metabolic health in neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding these shared pathways can inform strategies for prevention and treatment, potentially targeting both conditions simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive brain disorder that affects neurological functioning specifically targeting cognition, memory and behaviour. Pathology starts with the accumulation of tau proteins which on phosphorylation can be destructive for brain function. With gold standard drugs like Donepezil, there have been several attempts made to discover adjuvant therapeutic molecules such as plant-based products that could not only ease the ill-toward effects of these drugs, but also lead to the betterment of the patients suffering from AD. These are crucial in the management of patients of AD, by associations with psychological vulnerabilities and the overall loss of health of such individuals ‘Resveratrol’ is one such plant-based molecule which is a stilbene polyphenol present in many of the commonly occurring plants. Resveratrol is reported to have anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties which brings about the neuroprotection. Several studies have also been conducted that targets the signalling cascades involved during the progression of AD. This review attempts to give a collective information of its properties, its synthesis, metabolism and mechanisms that could drive researchers forward for its therapeutic applications during the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Most woody species undergo morphological, physiological, and biochemical changes during ontogenetic development from juvenile to adult phases, especially in terms of clonal potential, growth vigor, and adventitious rooting capacity. This study focused on generating information to support the vegetative propagation of adult individuals of Khaya spp., aiming to optimize the mechanisms involved in the induction of adventitious rooting and its association with indole-3-butyric acid (IBA). The experiment evaluated the rejuvenation/reinvigoration of plant tissues from three Khaya species by comparing juvenile and adult materials, epicormic shoots, and tissues rescued from the base of felled trees. In contrast to most studies, which focus primarily on juvenile materials, this is the first to investigate cloning through the rescue of adult genotypes, targeting the multiplication of individuals expressing superior phenotypic traits in the field. The results indicated that IBA application did not significantly influence survival, rooting, or the occurrence of abnormalities in the cuttings. Although adventitious rooting was achieved for all species, the percentages did not exceed 30%, reflecting typical results for species with low propagation potential. Basal cuttings showed enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase similar to those observed in juvenile materials, although total protein and carbohydrate contents were less significant. Based on these findings, the quantification of superoxide dismutase and catalase is recommended as physiological indicators of rejuvenation for K. grandifoliola , while superoxide dismutase is recommended for K. senegalensis and K. ivorensis . The biochemical differences observed among the materials suggest a strong relationship with the degree of physiological maturation and the expression of antioxidant mechanisms, providing important information for future research into clonal propagation and genetic improvement of Khaya spp. Strategies such as successive propagation cycles of rescued materials may contribute to increased adventitious rooting percentages and, consequently, to the rejuvenation/reinvigoration of tissues.",

The antibacterial activity of the functionalized fabrics was evaluated against two pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) and one common skin commensal (Staphylococcus epidermidis). Biocompatibility with human skin cells was assessed through MTT assays, TO/PI, and Calcein/PI staining. Results demonstrated strong antimicrobial activity of the functionalized textiles against S. aureus and S. epidermidis, with less evident effects on E. coli. Fabrics, functionalized with hop extracts, demonstrated biocompatibility in the applied two-dimensional models; however, confirming their safety for human use requires further evaluation using advanced models and additional endpoints, such as skin sensitization and genotoxicity. Overall, the study highlights the potential of incorporating natural plant extracts in textile functionalization to create eco-friendly and antimicrobial materials that meet growing market demands for safety and sustainability. Future research is warranted to optimize performance and applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aspergillus niger K Y 401431 was used in the present study for biosynthesis of copper/copper oxide nanoparticles. A niger K Y 401431 was checked for the production of the carcinogenic mycotoxin ‘ochratoxin A’ to prove the safety of the strain and the culture filtrate was free from ochratoxin A. For the optimized production of Cu/Cu 2 O NPs, the influence of some parameters was investigated. 10 mM of CuSO 4 was optimal for nanoparticle production, well-defined Cu/ Cu 2 O NPs formation occurred after 240 min of incubation using culture filtrate of A. niger K Y 401431developed under submerged culture conditions for 3 days culture age. The biosynthesized copper nanoparticles were characterized by UV–visible spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), dynamic light scattering (DLS), X-ray diffraction (XRD). The characterization of Cu/Cu 2 O NPs revealed the formation of crystalline spherical shaped (Cu/Cu 2 O NPs) with 4–10 nm size. The cytotoxic efficacy was investigated against three cancer cell lines MCF7 (Human Caucasian breast adenocarcinoma), HEPG2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line) and A549 (Lung carcinoma cell line) using MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. The cytotoxic effect of the biosynthesized Cu/ Cu 2 O NPs on A549, HEPG-2, and MCF-7 showed IC 50 of 20.3, 56.9, and 43.3 µg / ml, respectively. In this study, the biosynthesized Cu/ Cu 2 O NPs were used for the preparation of chitosan/agarose/copper bionanocomposite film by casting method. The Cs/Agr/ Cu-Cu 2 O bionanocomposite films were investigated using SEM, XRD, and FT-IR. The prepared bionanocomposite film displayed enhanced antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Developing a drug delivery strategy that can cross the blood–brain barrier is crucial to effective neurological treatment. In this work, a new strategy was introduced for efficient drug delivery of Donepezil based on the preparation of polyelectrolyte complexes (PEC) nanogel from β-chitosan (CS) and the prepared sulfonated styrene–maleic anhydride (S-SMA). First, low-molecular-weight SMA was prepared. Then, sulphonation of SMA was carried out. Three PEC nanoparticles were prepared by mixing three different ratios of S-SMA with β-chitosan. The structure and characteristics of the nanoparticles were thoroughly investigated. Varying S-SMA content (donated CS-S1, CS-S2, and CS-S3) for fixed a β-CS content, the surface charge and average size of the nanoparticles were tunable . Donepezil hydrochloride (DH) was encapsulated successfully in the nanoparticles CS-S3 and donated as CS-S3-DH. Additionally, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images revealed that almost 50% of the nanoparticles particles had diameters of 27 ± 0.1 and 111 ± 0.4 nm for CS-S3 and CS-S3-DH, respectively. The in vitro drug release study indicates a sustained release of DH for 72 h. In addition, the in vitro acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory was investigated. The result showed that AChE inhibitory percentages were 16.5 and 63.9% for CS-S3 and CS-S3-DH, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive primary brain tumor in adults and is characterized by rapid growth, diffuse infiltration, and resistance to conventional therapies. This review explores pathophysiology, molecular mechanisms, and therapeutic advancements of GBM. GBM is highly heterogeneous and can be classified into molecular subtypes based on genetic and epigenetic alterations, influencing patient prognosis and treatment response. Despite advances in surgical techniques, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, survival remains limited, with a median of 15–18 months. Emerging therapeutic strategies, including immunotherapy, tumor treatment, oncolytic virotherapy, and nanotechnology-based drug delivery, are under investigation to increase treatment efficacy. Immunotherapy, particularly checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T-cell therapy, has potential but faces challenges due to the immunosuppressive microenvironment of GBM. Oncolytic viruses and personalized vaccines aim to trigger antitumor immune responses, whereas nanotechnology-based approaches enhance drug delivery across the blood‒brain barrier (BBB). This review highlights the urgent need for multimodal strategies that integrate novel therapies with existing standards to improve patient outcomes. Future research should focus on overcoming treatment resistance, leveraging molecular profiling for personalized medicine, and exploring innovative drug delivery systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Neuroinflammation is known to be a contributing factor for several neurological disorders as well as cognitive dysfunction. Different signalling pathways, and a variety of supporting cells of CNS are suggested to be involved in the progression of neurodegeneration. Among the factors contributing to neuroinflammation, peripheral inflammation takes a lead role according to recent research, since persistent peripheral inflammation is believed to disrupt the blood–brain barrier (BBB). This, in turn, allows the peripheral immune cells to infiltrate the central nervous system (CNS), triggering a chronic inflammatory response. Microglia and astrocytes, the key glial cells in the CNS, become overactivated, resulting in the unwarranted generation of the proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF- α, IL- 1β, and the IL-6. While acute neuroinflammation is initially beneficial in repairing neuronal damage, prolonged activation contributes to the oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, protein aggregation and neural degeneration. The dysregulation of the neuroinflammatory process is likened to the deposition of the amyloid precursor proteins (APP), tau pathology and the synaptic dysfunction, ultimately impairing cognitive function. Key brain regions like the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and amygdala are particularly vulnerable to neuroinflammatory damage. Chronic inflammation in these areas disrupts synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis and neurotransmitter stability, leading to cognitive decline and several neurological disorders. Understanding the regional specificity of neuroinflammatory responses provides valuable insights into mechanisms underlining cognitive impairment. Multifaceted treatment approaches like improvement in the delivery of drugs across the BBB, disease-specific cytokine centred treatment and improving the gut microbial environment with lifestyle changes would help in inhibiting the progression of neuroinflammation and associated cognitive dysfunction in various neurodegenerative diseases. This review is an attempt to differentiate the impact of neuroinflammation on major regions of the brain associated with cognition, so that future studies targeting neurotherapeutic strategies might get benefited, by understanding the mechanism of the inflammatory pathway that affects the brain and a spectrum of cognition. Here, we also discuss the influence.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Digestate, a byproduct of anaerobic digestion, has emerged as a sustainable and viable alternative to chemical fertilizers in agriculture. Several studies have demonstrated that its application can enhance soil microbial biomass, nitrogen mineralization, and nutrient availability without adversely affecting soil structure or microbiological activity. Although the use of digestates is still limited, a global upward trend is emerging worldwide. Promising results, such as increased root growth and improved germination rates, have been reported. However, utilizing digestates without appropriate treatment or quality control may pose risks to human health, soil microbiota, and the environment. The levels of certain contaminants, particularly heavy metals, in digestates can vary significantly. Although in many cases, they are within the limits established by organizations such as the FAO, WHO, and the European Economic Commission, some values may exceed them and pose an environmental risk. From a microbiological perspective, it has been observed that digestates can stimulate beneficial bacterial communities, favoring greater bacterial growth. This review examines the current landscape of the use of digestates derived from organic solid waste, highlighting their potential as fertilizers, soil improvers, and agricultural prebiotics, based on their physicochemical characteristics and their impact on agroecological systems. Nevertheless, their safe use requires strict quality monitoring and post-treatment strategies, particularly in regions such as Latin America, where regulatory frameworks are limited. Establishing robust standards will be key to ensuring their sustainable application in agriculture.",

    "abstract": "We present here a systematic analysis of the Diospyros kaki expressed sequence tags (ESTs) generated from development stage-specific libraries. A total of 2,529 putative tentative unigenes were identified in the MF library whereas the OYF library displayed 3,775 tentative unigenes. Among the two cDNA libraries, 325 EST-Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in 296 putative unigenes were detected in the MF library showing an occurrence of 11.7% with a frequency of 1 SSR/3.16 kb whereas the OYF library had an EST-SSRs occurrence of 10.8% with 407 EST-SSRs in the 352 putative unigenes with a frequency of 1 SSR/2.92 kb. We observed a higher frequency of SNPs and indels in the OYF library (20.94 SNPs/indels per 100 bp) in comparison to MF library showed a relatively lower frequency (0.74 SNPs/indels per 100 bp). A combined homology and secondary structure analysis approach identified a potential miRNA precursor, an ortholog of miR159, and potential miR159 targets, in the development-specific ESTs of D. kaki.

    "abstract": "At least eight families of mammalian patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing proteins (PNPLA) (E.C. 3.1.1.3) catalyse the hydrolysis of triglycerides, including PNPLA4 (alternatively PLPL4 or GS2), which also acts as a retinol transacylase and participates in retinol-ester metabolism in the body. Bioinformatic methods were used to predict the amino acid sequences, secondary and tertiary structures and gene locations for PNPLA4 genes and encoded proteins using data from several vertebrate genome projects. PNPLA4 genes were located on the X-chromosome for the eutherian mammalian genomes examined. Opossum (marsupial), chicken, anole lizard, clawed toad, zebrafish and lancelet PNPLA4 genes were also identified. Most vertebrate PNPLA4 genes typically contained six coding exons whereas the lancelet PNPLA4 gene contained five coding exons. PNPLA4 subunits were the smallest among the PNPLA-like proteins examined containing 252–255 residues, shared >64 % sequence identities and key amino acid residues and predicted motifs, including 'patatin' (residues 6–176); putative catalytic dyad active site residues, Ser43 and Asp163; oxy-anion 'hole' residues (10–15); and conserved serine residues, which may perform structural roles for this enzyme. Predicted tertiary structures for PNPLA4 'patatin' were similar to those reported for potato 'patatin', suggesting that it is strongly conserved during evolution. Human PNPLA4 contained a CpG49 island within the gene promoter, a miRNA-186 binding site within the mRNA 3′-noncoding region for the PNPLA4b isoform and exhibited wide tissue expression at a higher than average level. These and previous studies of vertebrate PNPLA-like gene families have suggested that PNPLA4 is an ancient gene in evolution which has resulted from a duplication of an ancestral invertebrate ATGL-like gene (encoding adipose triglyceride lipase).",

To prove the possibility of xenobiotics degradation, cultures of L. edodes were cultivated in an Oddoux liquid medium with the addition of synthetic 17α-ethynylestradiol and synthetic testosterone. The endocrine disruptors were extracted from the mycelium and determined qualitatively by RP-HPLC. The degradation products of testosterone and 17α-ethynylestradiol were identified using a UPLC/MS/MS analysis. Undegraded testosterone was determined at the amount of 2.97 mg/g dry weight but only in one of the L. edodes extracts from in vitro cultures supplemented with 50 mg of this compound. In turn, 17α-ethynylestradiol was not determined in any samples. Additionally in all extracts, mushroom sterols (ergosterol peroxide and ergosterol) were determined. Their total amounts were significantly lower in samples containing the abovementioned steroids than in extracts from mycelium L. edodes without the addition of steroid hormones. The results demonstrated that the mycelium of L. edodes can be used in the biodegradation process of a water environment contaminated with endocrine disruptors.",

To enhance the yield of erythromycin, effects of various parameters such as bagasse concentration, organic nitrogen source, inorganic nitrogen source, pH and temperature were analysed. It was found that bagasse can be used as an alternate carbon source in erythromycin production medium. Erythromycin production in the new formulation of bagasse based medium was found to be 512 mg/L which was 28 % higher than glucose based medium. Strain improvement was done by random UV-mutagenesis. When compared to wild type strain, mutant strain showed 40 % higher yield in production medium. Erythromycin potency assay and HPLC analysis were performed to confirm the presence of erythromycin in the partially purified samples. These optimized conditions could be used for the commercial production of this unique antibiotic which gave significant industrial perspectives.",

The bacterial strains isolated from the fresh leaves of a mangrove A. marina were assessed for adenosine deaminase activity by plating method. Optimization of reaction process was carried out using response surface methodology of central composite design. The potent strain was identified based on 16S rRNA sequencing and phylogeny. Of five endophytic strains, EMLK1 showed a significant deaminase activity over other four strains. The conditions for maximum activity of the isolated adenosine deaminase are described. The potent strain EMLK1 was identified as Lysinibacillus sp. (JQ710723) being the first report as a mangrove endophyte. Mangrove-derived endophytic bacillus strain Lysinibacillus sp. EMLK1 is proved to be a promising source for the production of adenosine deaminase and this enzyme deserves further studies for purification and its application in disease diagnosis.",

Pretreatment of SBP with 'slake lime' (calcium hydroxide) was investigated using a 2(3) factorial design and the factors examined included lime loading, temperature and time. The pretreatment was evaluated for its ability to enhance enzymatic degradation using a combination of three hemicellulases, namely ArfA (an arabinofuranosidase), ManA (an endo-mannanase) and XynA (an endo-xylanase) from C. cellulovorans to determine the conditions under which optimal activity was facilitated. Optimal pretreatment conditions were found to be 0.4 g lime/g SBP, with 36 h digestion at 40 °C. The synergistic interactions between ArfA, ManA and XynA from C. cellulovorans were subsequently investigated on the pretreated SBP. The highest degree of synergy was observed at a protein ratio of 75% ArfA to 25% ManA, with a specific activity of 2.9 U/g protein. However, the highest activity was observed at 4.2 U/g protein at 100% ArfA. This study demonstrated that lime treatment enhanced enzymatic hydrolysis of SBP. The ArfA was the most effective hemicellulase for release of sugars from pretreated SBP, but the synergy with the ManA indicated that low levels of mannan in SBP were probably masking the access of the ArfA to its substrate. XynA displayed no synergy with the other two hemicellulases, indicating that the xylan in the SBP was not hampering the access of ArfA or ManA to their substrates and was not closely associated with the mannan and arabinan in the SBP.",

Comparative IDS amino acid sequences and structures and IDS gene locations were examined using data from several vertebrate genome projects. Vertebrate IDS sequences shared 60–99% identities with each other. Human IDS showed 47% sequence identity with fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) IDS. Sequence alignments, key amino acid residues, N-glycosylation sites and conserved predicted secondary and tertiary structures were also studied, including signal peptide, propeptide and active site residues. Mammalian IDS genes usually contained 9 coding exons. The human IDS gene promoter contained a large CpG island (CpG46) and 5 transcription factor binding sites, whereas the 3′-UTR region contained 5 miRNA target sites. These may contribute to IDS gene regulation of expression in the brain and other neural tissues of the body. An IDS pseudogene (IDSP1) was located proximally to the IDS gene on the X-chromosome in primate genomes. Phylogenetic analyses examined the relationships and potential evolutionary origins of the vertebrate IDS gene. These suggested that IDS has originated in an invertebrate ancestral genome and retained throughout vertebrate evolution and conserved on marsupial and eutherian X-chromosomes, with the exception of rat Ids on chromosome 8.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cyanobacterial diazotrophs play a significant role in environmental nitrogen economy despite their habitat either tropical or polar. However, the phenomenon by which it copes with temperature induced stress is poorly understood. Temperature response study of psychrophilic and mesophilic Nostoc strains explores their adaptive mechanisms. The selected psychrophilic and mesophilic strains were confirmed as Nostoc punctiforme and Nostoc calcicola respectively, by ultrastructure and 16S rDNA phylogeny. The psychrophilic strain has extensive glycolipid and polysaccharide sheath along with characteristic deposition of cyanophycin, polyhydroxybutyrate granules, and carboxysomes. This is possibly an adaptive strategy exhibited to withstand the freezing temperature and high intense of ultraviolet rays. The biomass measured in terms of dry weight, protein, and chlorophyll indicated a temperature dependant shift in both the psychrophilic and mesophilic strains and attained maximum growth in their respective temperature niches. At low temperature, psychrophilic organism exhibited nitrogenase activity, while mesophilic strains did not. The maximum glutamine synthetase activity was observed at 4 °C for psychrophilic and 37 °C for mesophilic strains. Activity at 4 °C in psychrophilic strains revealed their energetic mechanism even at low temperature. The nitrate and nitrite reductase of both psychrophilic and mesophilic strains showed maximum activity at 37 °C denoting their similar nitrogen assimilating mechanisms for combined nitrogen utilization. The activity studies of nitrogen fixation/assimilation enzymes have differential effects at varying temperatures, which provide valuable insights of physiological contribution and role of Nostoc strains in the biological nitrogen cycle.",

Morphometric methods and routine 16S rDNA-based identification undermines the genetic diversity and impedes strain-level differentiation. A comparative study to deduce the discriminatory power of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) for analyzing the genetic diversity of 20 Nostoc strains of diverse geographical origin was carried out. The RAPD primer used in the study generated 100% polymorphic profile. HIP TG primer produced the highest number of bands and fragments. Five primers, viz. OPA 08, OPA 11, HIP GC, OPAH 02 and OPF 05 could produce unique bands for 11 strains. Cluster analysis using the RAPD profile showed 12.5-25% similarity among the strains. Following in silico restriction analysis, two restriction enzymes, viz. HaeIII and HinfI were selected for ARDRA. However, clustering based on the restriction pattern showed 22.5-100% similarity. Results of the present study clearly indicate higher resolution of RAPD which can be reliably used for strain-level differentiation of Nostoc strains.",

    "abstract": "A comparative study of amino acid sequence and physicochemical properties indicates the affiliation of protein from the nitrilase/cyanide hydratase family. This family contains nitrilases that break carbon-nitrogen bonds and appear to be involved in the reduction of organic nitrogen compounds and ammonia production. They all have distinct substrate specificity and include nitrilase, cyanide hydratases, aliphatic amidases, beta-alanine synthase, and a few other proteins with unknown molecular function. These sequences were analyzed for different physical and chemical properties and to relate these observed differences to the thermostability properties, phylogenetic tree construction and the evolutionary relationship among them. In this work, in silico analysis of amino acid sequences of mesophilic (15) and thermophilic (archaea, 15 and bacteria, 15) proteins has been done. The physiochemical properties of these three groups of nitrilase/cyanide hydratase family also differ in number of amino acids, molecular weight, pI values, positively charged ions, i.e. Arg + Lys, aliphatic index and grand average of hydropathacity (GRAVY). The amino acid Ala (1.37-fold) was found to be higher in mesophilic bacteria as compared to thermophilic bacteria but Lys and Phe were found to be significantly high (1.43 and 1.39-fold, respectively) in case of thermophilic bacteria. The amino acids Ala, Cys, Gln, His and Thr were found to be significantly higher (1.41, 1.6, 1.77, 1.44 and 1.29-fold, respectively) in mesophilic bacteria as compared to thermophilic archaea, where Glu, Leu and Val were found significantly high (1.22, 1.19 and 1.26-fold, respectively).",

In the present work, we have addressed the effectiveness of using immobilized cells for aerobic processes, behaviour of immobilized cells, optimization and upstream bioprocess analysis for the production of lysine by immobilized cells of Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032 and MH 20-22 B in stirred tank bioreactor. Optimized operational conditions for maximal yield and productivity were determined with six parameters i.e., pH, temperature, fermentation time, airflow rate, glucose concentration and aeration rate. With the obtained results, it was evident that the optimum values for the upstream parameters viz., fermentation time, pH, temperature, glucose concentration, air flow rate and agitation rate are 96 h, 7.5, 30 °C, 90 g/l, 1.0 vvm and 200 rpm for both immobilized cells of C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 and MH 20-22 B. Immobilized cells of C. glutamicum MH 20-22 B, which is a leucine auxotroph has yielded more l-lysine compare to the immobilized cells of wild type strain C. glutamicum ATCC 13032.",

During protein assimilation in our body surplus nitrogen is made, this open nitrogen is altered into urea and expelled out of the body by kidneys, in this cycle OTC helps in the conversion of free toxic nitrogen into urea. Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD: OMIM#311250) is triggered by mutation in this OTC gene. To date more than 200 mutations have been noted. Mutation in OTC gene indicates alteration in enzyme production, which upsets the ability to carry out the chemical reaction. The computational analysis was initiated to identify the deleterious nsSNPs in OTC gene in causing OTCD using five different computational tools such as SIFT, PolyPhen 2, I-Mutant 3, SNPs&Go, and PhD-SNP. Studies on the molecular basis of OTC gene and OTCD have been done partially till date. Hence, in silico categorization of functional SNPs in OTC gene can provide valuable insight in near future in the diagnosis and treatment of OTCD.",

Here, the KstD from Gordonia neofelifaecis was expressed efficiently in Escherichia coli. E. coli cells expressing KstD3gor were subjected to the investigation of dehydrogenation activity for different steroids. The results showed that KstD3gor has a clear preference for steroid substrates with 3-keto-4-ene configuration, and it exhibits higher activity towards steroid substrates carrying a small or no aliphatic side chain than towards substrates having a bulky side chain at the C-17 atom. The recombinant strain could efficiently convert androst-4,9(11)-dien-3,17-dione into androst-1,4,9(11)-trien-3,17-dione (with conversion rate of 96%). 1(2)-Dehydrogenation of androst-4,9(11)-dien-3,17-dione is one of the key steps in glucocorticoid production. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting on the conversion of androst-4,9(11)-dien-3,17-dione catalyzed by recombinant KstD; the expression system of KstD3gor reported here would have an impact in the industrial production of glucocorticoid in the future.",

This superior strain was grown in the presence of ZnSO4, Pb (CH3COO)2 and mixture of ZnSO4, Pb(CH3COO)2 metal salts and the growth was observed at different time points. The cell pellet fraction was found to have more of zinc than lead as determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy indicating the translocation of these metals from media to the cells. However, the intracellular translocation of zinc is affected by the presence of lead in the media.

N - 227 was separately mutagenized to give three site-directed β-CGTase mutants, Y127F, R254F and D355R, that showed enhanced cyclization activity towards a starch substrate from 1.64 to 2.1-folds. Kinetic studies indicate that the mutants had higher affinity towards the substrate than the wild type β-CGTase. The Y127F mutant had the highest affinity which was indicated by the lowest K m of 15.30 mM and the highest catalytic activity. Increasing hydrophobicity around the catalytic center appeared to favor the cyclization activity of the mutants. The β-CGTase and the three mutants showed optimal enzyme activity at 60 °C and pH 6.0. All the enzymes were stable for at least 60 min across a wide pH range (5.0–7.0).",

Betulin has three most significant positions, i.e., primary hydroxyl group at position C-28, secondary hydroxyl group at position C-3, and alkene moiety at position C-20, where chemical modifications were performed to yield pharmacologically more active derivatives. Bioconversion optimization was performed for the enhancement in the percentage of conversion using statistical approach by opting temperature, pH and betulin concentration as independent variables. Three hundred fifty isolates were screened from natural sources under selective medium containing up to 3 g/l of betulin for their tolerance and bioconversion efficiency. Isolate KD235 was found to grow in 3 g/l betulin with 23.34 ± 0.57 g/l biomass and 0.67 ± 0.06 g/l betulinic acid production. New isolate KD235 was characterized by molecular analysis and named as Bacillus megaterium KD235. Molecular characterization of a potentially active isolate for the transformation of betulin to betulinic acid was suggested as isolate Bacillus megaterium KD235. Maximum bioconversion (22 ± 1.5%) was found at optimized conditions, i.e., pH 6.5, temperature 30 °C and at 3 g/l betulin. Validations of experiments as ~11% more bioconversion i.e., 1 ± 0.1 g/l betulinic acid were obtained using 5 l lab fermenter as compared to shake flask.",

Results of EPMA and phytolith analysis clearly revealed that the surface of exocarp (fruit) of Cucumis sativus Linn. containing warts has greater quantity of silicon as compared to the other part of the fruit. Besides silicon, some other elements were also found, on the fruit exocarp and its surrounding area. The other elements are magnesium (Mg), aluminum (Al), phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), and sodium. The percentage of silica is highest followed by Ni, Ca, Al, P, Mg, Fe, S, Cu, K, and Cl.

    "abstract": "Abstract Molecular assays based on qPCR TaqMan Probes were developed to identify three species of the genus Xylosandrus , X. compactus, X. crassiusculus and X. germanus (Coleoptera Curculionidae Scolytinae). These ambrosia beetles are xylophagous species alien to Europe, causing damages to many ornamental and fruiting trees as well as shrubs. DNA extraction was carried out from adults, larvae and biological samples derived from insect damages on infested plants. For X. compactus , segments of galleries in thin infested twigs were cut and processed; in the case of X. crassiusculus , raw frass extruded from exit holes was used, while DNA of X. germanus was extracted from small wood chips removed around insect exit holes. The assays were inclusive for the target species and exclusive for all the non-target species tested. The LoD was 3.2 pg/µL for the frass of X. crassiusculus and 0.016 ng/µL for the woody matrices of the other two species. Both repeatability and reproducibility were estimated on adults and woody samples, showing very low values ranging between 0.00 and 4.11. Thus, the proposed diagnostic assays resulted to be very efficient also on the woody matrices used for DNA extraction, demonstrating the applicability of the protocol in the absence of dead specimens or living stages.",

    "abstract": "Recent COVID-19 pandemic situation caused due to the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) affected global health as well as economics. There is global attention on prevention, diagnosis as well as treatment of COVID-19 infection which would help in easing the current situation. The use of nanotechnology and nanomedicine has been considered to be promising due to its excellent potential in managing various medical issues such as viruses which is a major threat. Nanoparticles have shown great potential in various biomedical applications and can prove to be of great use in antiviral therapy, especially over other conventional antiviral agents. This review focusses on the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 and the progression of the COVID-19 disease followed by currently available treatments for the same. Use of nanotechnology has been elaborated by exploiting various nanoparticles like metal and metal oxide nanoparticles, carbon-based nanoparticles, quantum dots, polymeric nanoparticles as well as lipid-based nanoparticles along with its mechanism of action against viruses which can prove to be beneficial in COVID-19 therapeutics. However, it needs to be considered that use of these nanotechnology-based approaches in COVID-19 therapeutics only aids the human immunity in fighting the infection. The main function is performed by the immune system in combatting any infection.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The human Abl kinases comprise a family of proteins that are known to be key stimulus drivers in the signaling pathways modulating cell growth, cell survival, cell adhesion, and apoptosis. Recent collative studies have indicated the role of activation of Abl and Abl-related genes in solid tumors; further terming the Abl kinases as molecular switches which promote proliferation, tumorigenesis, and metastasis. The up-regulated Abl-kinase expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) and the role of Abl tyrosine kinase activity in the Matrigel invasion of CRC cells have cemented its significance in CRC advancement. Therefore, the requisite of identifying small molecules which serve as Abl selective inhibitors and designing anti-Abl therapies, particularly for CRC tumors, has driven this study. Curcumin has been touted as an effective inhibitor of cancer cells; however, it is limited by its physicochemical inadequacies. Hence, we have studied the behavior of heterocyclic derivatives of curcumin via computational tools such as pharmacophore-based virtual screening, molecular docking, free-energy binding, and ADME profiling. The most actively docked molecule, 3,5-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methylstyryl)-1H-pyrazole-1-carboxamide, was comparatively evaluated against Curcumin via molecular dynamics simulation using Desmond, Schrödinger. The study exhibited the improved stability of the derivative as compared to Curcumin in the tested protein pocket and displayed the interaction bonds with the contacted key amino acids. To further establish the claim, the derivatives were synthesized via the mechanism of cyclization of Curcumin and screened in vitro using SRB assay against human CRC cell line, HCT 116. The active derivative indicated an IC 50 value of 5.85 µM, which was sevenfold lower as compared to Curcumin’s IC 50 of 35.40 µM. Hence, the results base the potential role of the curcumin derivative in modulating Abl-kinase activity and in turn may have potential therapeutic value as a lead for CRC therapy.",

Soil DNA isolation is tough due to the presence of various organic components present in soil which interfere in extraction procedure. Here, we report a novel direct soil DNA extraction protocol utilizing bare superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and its comparison with conventional and commercial kit-based soil DNA extraction methods. The quality, quantity and feasibility of the recovered DNA from all the three methods towards various molecular techniques were checked. Our magnetic nanoparticle-based soil DNA extraction successfully yields pure DNA without any RNA or protein contamination as revealed by the nanodrop spectrophotometer and agarose gel electrophoretic study. Different methods of soil DNA extraction were evaluated on the basis of PCR, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and real-time PCR. Soil DNA extracted using conventional method fails to carry out critical molecular biology techniques where as magnetic nanoparticle-based soil DNA extraction gave good results which is comparable to commercial kit. This comparative study suggests that protocol described in this report is novel, less time consuming, cost effective with fewer handling steps and yields high quantity, good quality DNA from soil.",

Several pathophysiological associations have been identified in which Propionibacterium acnes plays a major role. This bacteria primarily affects areas containing oil glands including the face, back and trunk, where it causes the formation of seborrhoea and inflammatory lesions. The treatment methods currently in place have side effects. A novel alternative method with no side effects is hence required. In this study, we report the synthesis of an exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing bacterial-based nanoparticle as a stable biocompatible material for drug delivery. We then evaluated the effectiveness of EPS-based nanoparticle cream against P. acnes. Our results demonstrate that EPS nanoparticles have great potential as a safe and effective topical treatment for acne vulgaris and other associated infections.",

    "abstract": "The use of CRISPR/Cas9 system has rapidly grown in the last years. Here, the optimization of gene editing of a single-nucleotide polymorphism in a human non-malignant somatic cell line of thyrocytes (Nthy-Ori) was described highlighting strategies for overcoming the problems concerning the delivery and off-targets. We employed both lentivirus and chemical lipids as delivery agents and two strategies for creating the double-strand breaks (DSB). The former induced a DSB by a classical Cas9 nuclease (standard strategy), while the second one employed a modified Cas9 creating a single-strand break (SSB). The knock-in was carried out using a single-stranded donor oligonucleotide or the HR410-PA donor vector (HR). The desired cells could be obtained by combining the double nickase system with the HR vector transfected chemically. This result could be due to the type of DSB, likely processed mainly by non-homologous end joining when blunt (standard strategy) and by HR when overhanging (double nickase). Our results showed that the double nickase is suitable for knocking-in the immortalized Nthy-Ori cell line, while the standard CRISPR/Cas9 system is suitable for gene knock-out creating in/del mutations.

    "abstract": "Abstract This study aimed to analyze the effect of nutritional supplements on improving conidia production of Metarhizium rileyi Nm017 at laboratory scale (yields of conidia/substrate and biomass/substrate, and substrate consumption). Also, the influence on quality parameters were evaluated (germination at 36 and 48 h, enzymatic activity, and insecticidal activity on Helicoverpa zea ). Six treatments (T1–T6) were assessed and all of them reached maximum conidia concentration after 7 days fermentation, a feasible production timetable. Yields from treatment T6 (yeast extract + V8 juice) were 1.5–threefold higher than the other treatments. Conidia from T6 reached germinations of 56% and 12% at 36 and 48 h, respectively, higher than T1 (without supplements), which had the lowest values found. M. rileyi conidia obtained from treatment T6 had the highest enzymatic activity (0.45 U chitinase g −1 , 0.28 U lipase g −1 , and 1.29 U protease g −1 ). However, treatments with the highest conidia yields and enzymatic activity were not positively correlated to the efficacy against H. zea. When M. rileyi was produced on T5 (yeast hydrolysate + V8 juice), conidia were 35% more virulent than treatment T6. The findings evidenced the noticeable impact of nutritional substrate amended for conidia production and quality. This work showed the relevance of insecticidal activity assessment as a selection criterion in the mass production development of a biocontrol agent.",

    "abstract": "Abstract During and after the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the use of personal care products and disinfectants increased in universities worldwide. Among these, quaternary ammonium-based products stand out; these compounds and their intermediates caused substantial changes in the chemical composition of the wastewater produced by these institutions. For this reason, improvements and environmentally sustainable biological alternatives were introduced in the existing treatment systems so that these institutions could continue their research and teaching activities. For this reason, the objective of this study was to develop an improved culture medium to cultivate ammonium oxidising bacteria (AOB) to increase the biomass and use them in the treatment of wastewater produced in a faculty of sciences in Bogotá, D.C., Colombia. A Plackett Burman Experimental Design (PBED) and growth curves served for oligotrophic culture medium, and production conditions improved for the AOB. Finally, these bacteria were used with total heterotrophic bacteria (THB) for wastewater treatment in a pilot plant. Modification of base ammonium broth and culture conditions (6607 mg L −1 of (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 84 mg L −1 CaCO 3 , 40 mg L −1 MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O, 40 mg L −1 CaCl 2 ·2H 2 O and 200 mg L −1 KH 2 PO 4 , 10% (w/v) inoculum, no copper addition, pH 7.0 ± 0.2, 200 r.p.m., 30 days) favoured the growth of Nitrosomonas europea , Nitrosococcus oceani , and Nitrosospira multiformis with values of 8.23 ± 1.9, 7.56 ± 0.7 and 4.2 ± 0.4 Log 10 CFU mL −1 , respectively. NO 2 − production was 0.396 ± 0.0264, 0.247 ± 0.013 and 0.185 ± 0.003 mg L −1 for Nitrosomonas europea , Nitrosococcus oceani and Nitrosospira multiformis. After the 5-day wastewater treatment (WW) by co-inoculating the three studied bacteria in the wastewater (with their self-microorganisms), the concentrations of AOB and THB were 5.92 and 9.3 Log 10 CFU mL −1 , respectively. These values were related to the oxidative decrease of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), (39.5 mg L −1 ), Ammonium ion (NH 4 + ), (6.5 mg L −1 ) Nitrite (NO 2 − ), (2.0 mg L −1 ) and Nitrate (NO 3 − ), (1.5 mg L −1 ), respectively in the five days of treatment. It was concluded, with the improvement of a culture medium and production conditions for three AOB through biotechnological strategies at the laboratory scale, being a promising alternative to bio-augment of the biomass of the studied bacteria under controlled conditions that allow the aerobic removal of COD and nitrogen cycle intermediates present in the studied wastewater.",

    "abstract": "Abstract R2R3-MYBs are an important group of transcription factors that regulate crucial developmental processes across the plant kingdom; yet no comprehensive analysis of the R2R3-MYBs in the early-diverging eudicot clade of Ranunculaceae has been conducted so far. In the present study, Aquilegia coerulea is chosen to understand the extent of conservation and divergence of R2R3-MYBs as a representative of the family by analysing the genomic distribution, organization, gene structure, physiochemical properties, protein architecture, evolution and possible mode of expansion. Genome-wide analysis showed the presence of 82 putative homologues classified into 21 subgroups, based on phylogenetic analysis of full-length protein sequences. The domain has remained largely conserved across all homologues with few differences from the characterized Arabidopsis thaliana R2R3-MYBs. The topology of the phylogenetic tree remains the same when full-length protein sequences are used, indicating that the evolution of R2R3-MYBs is driven by the domain region only. This is supported by the presence of similar structures of exon–intron and conserved motifs within the same subgroup. Furthermore, comparisons of the AqcoeR2R3-MYB members with monocots and core-eudicots revealed the evolutionary expansion of a few functional clades, such as A. thaliana R2R3-MYB subgroup 6 (SG6), the upstream regulatory factors of floral pigment biosynthesis and floral color. The reconstructed evolutionary history of SG6-like genes across angiosperms highlights the occurrence of independent duplication events in the genus Aquilegia . AqcoeR2R3-MYB genes are present in all seven chromosomes of A. coerulea , most of which result from local and segmental duplications. Selection analysis of these duplicated gene pairs indicates purifying selection except one, and the physiochemical analyses of R2R3-MYBs reveal differences among the MYBs signifying their functional diversification. This study paves the way for further investigation of paralogous copies and their probable role in the evolution of different floral traits in A. coerulea . It lays the foundation for functional genomic studies of R2R3-MYBs in the basal eudicots and facilitates comparative studies among angiosperms. The work also provides a framework for deciphering novel genetic regulatory pathways that govern the diversity of floral morphology.",

    "abstract": "This paper reports the presence of a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor (HGPI) gene in Dolichos biflorus for the first time. A full-length protease inhibitor gene with complete open reading frame of 669 bp encoding 222 amino acids was cloned from D. biflorus using a PCR-based method. BlastN search showed that the HGPI gene shared 100% homology with Cicer arietinum trypsin inhibitor mRNA and 97% with Cajanus cajan protease inhibitor. The deduced amino acid sequence exhibited homology with Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitor from chickpea, pigeon pea and soybean. The deduced amino acid sequence contained N-terminal signal sequence of 18 amino acids and had a molecular weight of 24 kDa. The phylogenetic tree also showed close relationship with Cicer arietinum and Cajanus cajan. Southern blotting revealed the presence of only one copy of HGPI gene in the D. biflorus genome. Homology modeling was employed to predict secondary structure and 3D-structural models for the protease inhibitor. The gene was found to be constitutively expressed in different tissues as determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The novel HGPI gene has been submitted to the GenBank with Accession No. FN666416. The isolated novel HGPI gene will broaden the pool of plant defense genes and might be an ideal choice for developing transgenic crops resistant to insect pests, as well as pathogens. In addition, it could be used as a probe for selection of insect- and pathogen-resistant genotypes.",

The wild type P. pentosaceus had specific activity of 0.58 U/mg whereas the mutant showed that of 1.0 U/mg with 72% enhancement. The antibiogram of 27 antibiotics tested against mutant showed significant differences with 9 antibiotics when compared to wild type. In carbohydrate fermentation profile, trehalose, galactose, maltose, lactose and fructose are metabolized by both the strains, but weakly in case of mutant. Stabilization of purified dextransucrase from wild type and mutant with various stabilizers was studied at 30 and 4 °C. Both enzymes were more stable at 4 °C. Among various stabilizers such as dextran (100 kDa, 10 μg/ml), glycerol (0.5%, v/v), PEG 8000 (10 μg/ml) and Tween 80 (0.5%, v/v), Tween 80 provided maximum stabilization at 4 and 30 °C. The mutant showed better stabilization than that of the wild type at both 30 and 4 °C. The loss of activity at 30 °C after 24 h in wild type and mutant in the presence of Tween 80 was only 34 and 32%, respectively, whereas the loss of activity in control of wild type and mutant was 76 and 59%, respectively. After 15 days at 4 °C, the loss of activity in control of wild type and mutant in the presence of Tween 80 was only 15 and 8%, respectively, whereas at 30 °C, the loss of activity in control of wild type and mutant was 49 and 42% respectively.

It is one of the plants that are able to grow in waterlogged area where others could not. Apart from that sago palm is also a source of starch, contributes economically to the people and an important export for the state of Sarawak. Despite the importance of sago palm especially in the production of starch and its ability to withstand stresses, so far, not many molecular studies have been reported on sago palm. To study the characters in sago palm, transcriptome analysis was conducted where it would give a better understanding of the plant development through gene expression. Here, we report the construction of a cDNA library and preliminary expressed sequence tags analysis from the young leaves of sago palm. A total of 434 clones were sequenced with inserts ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 bps with primary and amplified titers of 8 × 105 and 1.0 × 109 pfu/ml, respectively. Clustering of these sequences resulted in a set of 372 tentative unigenes comprising 340 singletons and 32 contigs. The database was also annotated with BLAST2GO which showed that majority of the transcripts were involved in primary metabolism and stress tolerance.",

In this study, we aimed to purify recombinant RIPs, investigate their function in the treatment of bacterial infection, and determine their toxicity in mice. We employed a pMAL protein fusion and purification system using E. coli transformed with a plasmid containing MBP-tagged MAP30 cDNA. MBP-tagged MAP30 was purified using a modified novel protocol to effectively produce highly active MAP30 of high purity. In an acute toxicity study in mice, no mortality occurred at doses lower than 1.25 mg/kg. MAP30 at both 0.42 and 0.14 mg/kg induced anti-MAP30 IgG, which reached a maximum titer at week 3. In conclusion, recombinant MAP30 prepared using our purification method possesses bioactivity, and has a synergistic bacteria-killing effect that can significantly reduce the required dosages of chloramphenicol and erythromycin. Therefore, when MAP30 is used in combination with chloramphenicol or erythromycin, it may of benefit in terms of reducing the side effects of the antibiotics, as lower concentrations of antibiotics are required.",

    "abstract": "Gravity is the fundamental force that may have operated during the evolution of life on Earth. It is thus important to understand as to what the effects of gravity are on cellular life. The studies related to effect of microgravity on cells may provide greater insights in understanding of how the physical force of gravity shaped life on Earth. The present study focuses on a unique group of organisms called the Haloarchaea, which are known for their extreme resistance to survive in stress-induced environments. The aim of the present investigation was to study the effect of simulated microgravity on physiological response of extremely halophilic archaeon, Haloarcula argentinensis RR10, under slow clinorotation. The growth kinetics of the archaeon in microgravity was studied using the Baryani model and the viable and apoptotic cells were assessed using propidium iodide fluorescent microscopic studies. The physiological mechanism of adaptation was activation of 'salt-in' strategy by intracellular sequestration of sodium ions as detected by EDAX. The organism upregulated the production of ribosomal proteins in simulated microgravity as evidenced by Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization Time of flight-Mass Spectrophotometry. Simulated microgravity altered the antibiotic susceptibility of the haloarchaeon and it developed resistance to Augmentin, Norfloxacin, Tobramycin and Cefoperazone, rendering it a multidrug resistant strain. The presence of antibiotic efflux pump was detected in the haloarchaeon and it also enhanced production of protective carotenoid pigment in simulated microgravity. The present study is presumably the first report of physiological response of H. argentinensis RR10 in microgravity simulated under slow clinorotation.",

Among the isolates ascomycetes were most prevalent. Colonisation rate of fungal endophytes was high in leaf tissue (95%) followed by stem (77.75%) and root segments (33.33%). The most frequent and dominant coloniser of the host plant were Colletotrichum sp., which was isolated from all locations. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated the presence of hyphae in the intra and intercellular spaces of the plant tissue. Morphological and phylogenetic analyses using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences of nuclear rRNA genes showed that the fungi recovered belonged to the lineages of Sordariomycetes, Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes and Tremellomycetes. A maximum likelihood tree revealed the relationship between the obtained sequence data and the closest sequences retrieved from the GenBank.",

In this communication, we describe recombinant expression, characterization and application of a lipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) with diaphorase activity from a strain of Bacillus sphaericus. The DLD gene consisting of 1413 bp encoding a protein of 470 amino acids was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and the recombinant enzyme was characterized. B. sphaericus DLD catalyzed the reduction of NAD+ by dihydrolipoamide and exhibited NADH-dependent diaphorase activity. The molecular weight of purified enzyme was about 50 kDa, and determined to be a monomeric protein. Diaphorase was active and stable from pH 7.0 to 9.0 with an optimal activity at pH 8.5. It showed its maximal activity at temperature of 30 °C and was almost stable at temperatures between 25 and 30 °C. Different metal ions and inhibitors showed no influence on the activity of target enzyme. The K m and V max values for NADH were estimated to be 0.33 mM and 200.0 U/ml, respectively. Moreover, recombinant B. sphaericus diaphorase exhibited considerable potential to be used as a component of diagnostic tests for the quantification of metabolites. In conclusion, considering the properties of diaphorase from B. sphaericus PAD-91, it can have potential application as a diagnostic enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The objective of this study was to determine the effect of application of pesticides on morphology, viability, and germination of pollen grains of Blackberry ( Rubus glaucus Benth.) and Tree tomato ( Solanum betaceum Cav.). The study was performed at Patate, Tungurahua province, Ecuador and was divided into two phases. Phase one dedicated to the study of morphology, viability, and identification of nutrient solution for better germination of pollen grains and phase two for the analysis of the effect of conventional, organic, and biological pesticides on pollen grain germination and pollen tube length. To study pollen morphology, pollens were extracted by hand pressure and was analyzed by optical and electron microscopy. The viable pollen grains were identified by staining with 1% acetocarmine. Even though Tree tomato and Blackberry pollen grains are morphologically similar, their exine shapes differ. We observed four times increase in pollen germination rate when suspended in nutrient solution (Sucrose with Boric acid) than control (water). Pollen grains under nutrient solution were subjected to different groups of pesticides for the period of 2, 4, and 6 h. With respect to pesticide affect, the Blackberry pollen grain germination followed the following order: Lecaniceb &gt; Beauveb &gt; Metazeb =&gt; Myceb &gt; Control. However, the effect on Tree tomato pollen grains was as follows: Lecaniceb &gt; Myceb &gt; Cantus &gt; Bacillus thuringiensis &gt; Kripton &gt; Control. As per as pollen grain germination is concerned, we observed that the chemical pesticides are more harmful than other pesticides. So, it is necessary to perform screening test for different pesticides and their effect on pollen grain germination before applying to the fields.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Alpha-(1,2)-fucosyltransferase ( FUT1 ) gene has some influence on economically important traits and disease resistance. DNA methylation plays an important role in human diseases but is relatively poorly studied in pigs by regulating the mRNA expression of genes. The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of promoter methylation on the expression of FUT1 gene. We used bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) and qPCR to analyze the methylation of the FUT1 5′-flanking region and FUT1 mRNA expression in the duodenum of Sutai piglets from newborn to weaning. FUT1 contains three CpG islands upstream of the start codon, of which two are located in the putative promoter region containing multiple promoter elements and transcription factor binding sites, such as CpG islands, a CAAT box, SP1, and EARLY-SEQ 1. The CpG island between nucleotides −1762 and −580 had a low degree of methylation, and its methylation level was significantly lower in 35-day-old piglets than 8- and 18-day-old piglets ( P &lt; 0.05). FUT1 mRNA expression was significantly higher in 35-day-old piglets than 8- and 18-day-old piglets ( P &lt; 0.05). Pearson’s correlation analysis showed that the methylation of the CpG island between nucleotides −1762 and −580 of FUT1 was significantly, negatively correlated with FUT1 mRNA expression ( P &lt; 0.05). These results demonstrate that differential methylation of CpG islands negatively regulates the expression of FUT1 in the porcine duodenum, suggesting a probable influence on the resistance of piglets to infection with ETEC F18.",

For this reason, biodesulfurization of thiophenic compounds has been studied extensively. However, studies on the sulfide compounds are scarce. In this paper, we describe desulfurization of a model sulfidic compound, dibenzyl sulfide (DBS) by an isolated Gordonia sp. IITR100. The reaction was accompanied with the formation of metabolites dibenzyl sulfoxide, dibenzyl sulfone and benzoic acid. Studies with recombinant E. coli revealed that enzyme DszC of this isolate metabolizes DBS into dibenzyl sulfoxide and dibenzyl sulfone, but the reaction downstream to it is mediated by some enzyme other than its DszA. In reactions where DBS and dibenzothiophene (DBT) were present together, both IITR100 and recombinant E. coli exhibited preference for the desulfurization of DBS over DBT. The newly identified capability of IITR100 for desulfurization of both thiophenic and sulfidic compounds suggests its potential use in improved desulfurization of petroleum fractions.",

Eggplant PPOs identified earlier were used in \"Basic local alignment search tool (BLAST)\" search against expressed sequence tag and nucleotide databases. We have identified seven additional sequences which were almost complete in length. The sequences of the PPOs were aligned and their phylogenetic and evolutionary relationships established. The sequences are quite diverse, broadly falling into two major clusters; three PPOs form a separate branch/minor cluster. The thirteen sequences had conserved copper A binding sites but copper B binding sites differed considerably in two new PPO sequences (AFJ79642 and ACR61398). A third conserved 'Histidine-rich' region has been identified at the 'C' terminus of the eggplant PPOs. In addition, all the seven new PPOs exhibited at least one glycosylated sequon in the mature PPO sequence. Identification of additional PPO genes will further help in functional and biological characterization of these PPOs.",

A 470 bp of the BnSHP1 cDNA sequence constructed in an RNAi-silencing vector was transferred to oilseed rape cv. SLM046. Molecular analysis of T2 transgenic plants by RT-PCR and Real-time PCR showed that expression of the BnSHP alleles was highly decreased in comparison with control plants.

    "abstract": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common non-skin cancer in the world. Tobacco chewing is implicated with most of the cases of HNSCC but this type of cancer is increasing in non-tobacco chewers as well. This study was instigated to provide comprehensive variant and gene-level data in HNSCC subjects of the Indian population and fill the gap in the literature on comparative assessment of gene mutations in cancer subjects with a habit of tobacco and those without any habit using targeted amplicon sequencing. We performed targeted Amplicon sequencing of 409 tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes, frequently mutated across many cancer types, including head and neck. DNA from primary tumor tissues and matched blood was analyzed for HNSCC patients with a habit of tobacco and those without any habit. PDE4DIP, SYNE1, and NOTCH1 emerged as the highly mutated genes in HNSCC. A total of 39 candidate causal variants in 22 unique cancer driver genes were identified in non-habitual (WoH) and habitual (WH) subjects. Comparison of genes from both the subjects, showed seven unique cancer driver genes (KIT, ATM, RNF213, GATA2, DST, RET, CYP2C19) in WoH, while WH showed five (IL7R, PKHD1, MLL3, PTPRD, MAPK8) and 10 genes (SETD2, ATR, CDKN2A, NCOA4, TP53, SYNE1, KAT6B, THBS1, PTPRT, and FGFR3) were common to both subjects. In addition to this NOTCH1, NOTCH2, and NOTCH4 gene were found to be mutated only in habitual subjects. These findings strongly support a causal role for tobacco, acting via PI3K and MAPK pathway inhibition and stimulation of various genes leading to oncogenic transformations in case of tobacco chewers. In case of non-tobacco chewers it appears that mutations in the pathway affecting the squamous epithelial lineage and DNA repair genes lead to HNSCC. Somatic mutation in CYP2C19 gene in the non-habitual subjects suggests that this gene may have a tobacco independent role in development and progression of HNSCC. In addition to sharing high mutation rate, NOTCH gene family was found to be mutated only in habitual sample. Further, presence of mutated genes not earlier reported to be involved in HNSCC, suggest that the Indian sub-continent may have different sets of genes, as compared to other parts of the world, involved in the development and progression of HNSCC.",

    "abstract": "Assessment of the impact of transgenic crops on non-target organisms (NTO) is a prerequisite to their release into the target environment for commercial use. Transgenic sweetpotato varieties expressing Cry proteins (Bt sweetpotato) are under development to provide effective protection against sweetpotato weevils (Coleoptera) which cause severe economic losses in sub-Saharan Africa. Like any other pest control technologies, genetically engineered crops expressing insecticidal proteins need to be evaluated to assess potential negative effects on non-target organisms that provide important services to the ecosystem. Beneficial arthropods in sweetpotato production systems can include pollinators, decomposers, and predators and parasitoids of the target insect pest(s). Non-target arthropod species commonly found in sweetpotato fields that are related taxonomically to the target pests were identified through expert consultation and literature review in Uganda where Bt sweetpotato is expected to be initially evaluated. Results indicate the presence of few relevant non-target Coleopterans that could be affected by Coleopteran Bt sweetpotato varieties: ground, rove and ladybird beetles. These insects are important predators in sweetpotato fields. Additionally, honeybee (hymenoptera) is the main pollinator of sweetpotato and used for honey production. Numerous studies have shown that honeybees are unaffected by the Cry proteins currently deployed which are homologous to those of the weevil-resistant Bt sweetpotato. However, because of their feeding behaviour, Bt sweetpotato represents an extremely low hazard due to negligible exposure. Hence, we conclude that there is good evidence from literature and expert opinion that relevant NTOs in sweetpotato fields are unlikely to be affected by the introduction of Bt sweetpotato in Uganda.",

Role of Elspar® (l-asparaginase from Escherichia coli) in regulation of l-Asn and l-Gln has been confirmed by the other researchers through experimental studies. Therapeutic research against ALL remained elusive with the lack of information on molecular interactions of Elspar® with amino acid substrates. In the present study, using different docking tools binding cavities, key residues in binding and ligand binding mechanisms were identified. For the apo state enzyme and ligand bound state complexes, MD simulations were performed. Trajectory analysis for 30 ns run confirmed the kinship of l-Asn with l-asparaginase enzyme in the dynamic system with less stability in comparison to l-Gln docked complex. Overall findings strongly supported the bi-functional nature of the enzyme drug. A good number of conformational changes were observed with 1NNS structure due to ligand binding. Results of present study give much more information on structural and functional aspects of E. coli l-asparaginase upon the interaction with its ligands which may be useful in designing effective therapeutics for ALL.",

Level of expression of transgenes in transgenic plants is important to achieve desirable level of resistance against target insects. In order to achieve desirable level of expression, rice chloroplast transit peptide sequence was fused with synthetic cry2AX1 gene to target its protein in chloroplasts. Sixteen PCR positive lines of rice were generated by Agrobacterium mediated transformation using immature embryos. Southern blot hybridization analysis of T0 transgenic plants confirmed the integration of cry2AX1 gene in two to five locations of rice genome and ELISA demonstrated its expression. Concentration of Cry2AX1 in transgenic rice events ranged 5.0–120 ng/g of fresh leaf tissue. Insect bioassay of T0 transgenic rice plants against neonate larvae of rice leaffolder showed larval mortality ranging between 20 and 80 % in comparison to control plant. Stable inheritance and expression of cry2AX1 gene was demonstrated in T1 progenies through Southern and ELISA. In T1 progenies, the highest concentration of Cry2AX1 and mortality of rice leaffolder larvae were recorded as 150 ng/g of fresh leaf tissue and 80 %, respectively. The Cry2AX1 expression even at a very low concentration (120–150 ng/g) in transgenic rice plants was found effective against rice leaffolder larvae.",

    "abstract": "To counter the host RNA silencing defense mechanism, many plant viruses encode RNA silencing suppressor proteins. These groups of proteins share very low sequence and structural similarities among them, which consequently hamper their annotation using sequence similarity-based search methods. Alternatively the machine learning-based methods can become a suitable choice, but the optimal performance through machine learning-based methods is being affected by various factors such as class imbalance, incomplete learning, selection of inappropriate features, etc. In this paper, we have proposed a novel approach to deal with the class imbalance problem by finding the optimal class distribution for enhancing the prediction accuracy for the RNA silencing suppressors. The optimal class distribution was obtained using different resampling techniques with varying degrees of class distribution starting from natural distribution to ideal distribution, i.e., equal distribution. The experimental results support the fact that optimal class distribution plays an important role to achieve near perfect learning. The best prediction results are obtained with Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) learning algorithm. We could achieve a sensitivity of 98.5 %, specificity of 92.6 % with an overall accuracy of 95.3 % on a tenfold cross validation and is further validated using leave one out cross validation test. It was also observed that the machine learning models trained on oversampled training sets using synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) have relatively performed better than on both randomly undersampled and imbalanced training data sets. Further, we have characterized the important discriminatory sequence features of RNA-silencing suppressors which distinguish these groups of proteins from other protein families.",

In this study, we explored the potential function of phosphoglucomutase (PGM) using RNA interference technology in Nilaparvata lugens , the brown planthopper. PGM1 and PGM2 were found highly expressed in the midgut of brown planthoppers, with different expression levels in different instar nymphs. The glycogen, glucose, and trehalose levels were also significantly increased after brown planthoppers were injected with dsRNA targeting PGM1 (dsPGM1) or PGM2 (dsPGM2). In addition, injection of dsPGM1 or dsPGM2 resulted in increased membrane-bound trehalase activity but not soluble trehalase activity. Furthermore, the expression of genes related to trehalose and glycogen metabolism decreased significantly after injection with dsPGM1 and dsPGM2. The expression levels of genes involved in chitin metabolism in the brown planthopper were also significantly decreased and the insects showed wing deformities and difficulty molting following RNAi. We suggest that silencing of PGM1 and PGM2 expression directly inhibits trehalose metabolism, leading to impaired chitin synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Understanding the genetic determinants are essential for improving the fruit quality traits of strawberry. In this study, we focused on mapping the loci for fruit-length (FL), -diameter (FD), -weight (FW) and -soluble solid content (SSC) using the genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified via ddRAD-sequencing of the F 1 population raised from Maehyang (♀) X Festival (♂). A total of 12,698 high quality SNPs were identified of which 1554 SNPs that showed significant Mendelian segregation ( p &lt; 0.05) were mapped to 53 linkage groups (LG) spanning a total of 2937.93 cM with an average marker density of 2.14 cM/locus. Six QTLs for FL and four QTLs for each of FD, FW and SSC were identified that explained 24–35%, 21–42%, 24–54% and 23–50% of overall phenotypic variations, respectively. The genes that lie within these QTL regions were extracted and discussed thoroughly. In addition, a high resolution melting marker (MF154) were designed based on the SNP A1 723 G of the UDP-glucose 4-epimerase GEPI48-like gene FAN_iscf00021287. The marker detected the high vs low sugar containing F 1 plants and commercial cultivars with 81.39% and 86.95% detection accuracy, respectively. These SNPs, linkage map, QTLs and candidate genes will be helpful in understanding and improving the fruit quality traits of strawberry.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The study investigates the ability of methanolic extract of Andrographis paniculata (MAP) to supplement polyvalent anti-snake venom (ASV) in inhibiting neurotoxic enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and ‘spreading factor’ hyaluronidase from Naja naja (N.N) venom. AChE and hyaluronidase activity were measured in 100 or 200 µg of crude venom, respectively, and designated as ‘control’. In Test Group I, enzyme assays were performed immediately after the addition of ASV/MAP/ASV + MAP to the venom. Inhibition of AChE by ASV (100–367 µg) was 12–17%, and of hyaluronidase (22–660 µg) was 33–41%. Under the same conditions, MAP (100–400 µg) inhibited AChE and hyaluronidase to the extent of 17–33% and 17–52%, respectively. When ASV (220 µg) and MAP (100–200 µg) were added together, AChE and hyaluronidase were inhibited to a greater extent from 39–63 to 36–44%, than when either of them was used alone. In Test Group 2, the venom was incubated with ASV/MAP/ASV + MAP for 10–30 min at 37 °C prior to the assay which enhanced AChE inhibition by 6%, 82% and 18% respectively, when compared to Test Group I. Though there was no change in inhibition of hyaluronidase in the presence of ASV, MAP could further increase the extent of inhibition by 27% and ASV + MAP upto 4%. In Test Group III, venom and substrate were incubated for 90 min and hyaluronidase activity was measured after the addition of inhibitors. Here, ASV + MAP caused increased inhibition by 69% compared to ASV alone. The study confirms the ability of phytochemicals in MAP to contribute to a multipronged strategy by supplementing, thereby augmenting the efficacy of ASV.",

Flat stem, little leaf, and phyllody symptoms were observed in I. balsamina nurseries in Uttar Pradesh and Tripura states of India during surveys from 2018 to 2020, with an incidence from 6 to 27%. Amplicons of ~ 1.2 kb were amplified in all the tested symptomatic samples of I. balsamina using universal phytoplasma primer pairs from different surveyed locations, but not from the asymptomatic plants. Pairwise sequence comparison, phylogeny, and virtual RFLP analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences identified the phytoplasmas as 16SrI-B subgroup strain from Tripura (Lembucherra) and 16SrII-D subgroup strain from Uttar Pradesh (Gorakhpur and Faizabad). Phytoplasma presence and identity was further confirmed by amplifying secA , rp , secY, and tuf genes. This is the first report of 16SrI-B and 16SrII-D phytoplasmas detection in I. balsamina in the world.",

    "abstract": "Crizotinib is an anticancer drug used for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Evidences available suggest that there is a development of an acquired resistance against crizotinib action due to the emergence of several mutations in the ALK gene. It is therefore necessary to develop potent anti-cancer drugs for the treatment of crizotinib resistance non-small cell lung cancer types. In the present study, a novel class of lead molecule was identified using virtual screening, molecular docking and molecular dynamic approach. The virtual screening analysis was done using PubChem database by employing crizotinib as query and the data reduction was carried out by using molecular docking techniques. The bioavailability of the lead compounds was examined with the help of Lipinski rule of five. The screened lead molecules were analyzed for toxicity profiles, drug-likeness and other physico-chemical properties of drugs by OSIRIS program. Finally, molecular dynamics simulation was also performed to validate the binding property of the lead compound. Our analysis clearly indicates that CID 11562217, a nitrile containing compound (pyrazole-substituted aminoheteroaryl), could be the potential ALK inhibitor certainly helpful to overcome the drug resistance in non-small cell lung cancer.",

Strain HQ1 was identified as Ochrobactrum sp. on the basis of morphology, physico-biochemical characteristics and 16S rRNA sequence analysis. The generation time of Ochrobactrum sp. HQ1 on 2-HQ at log phase is 0.71 h or 42.6 min. The degradation of 2-HQ by HQ1 under various physico-chemical parameters was analysed by HPLC and observed to be optimum with a high inoculum density (1.0 OD) at pH 7-8, temperatures 37-40°C and a high concentration of 2-HQ (500 ppm). Degradation of 2-HQ was also improved when additional nitrogen sources were used and this was attributed to the enhanced growth of the bacterium on the readily available nitrogen sources. Analysis of 2-HQ degradation by GC-MS resulted in elucidation of the degradation pathway for HQ1, a novel observation for aerobic Gram-negative bacteria. These findings are a possible indication of the application of HQ1 in the bioremediation of pesticide/metabolite contamination.",

    "abstract": "Despite the extensive use of small millet landraces as an important source of nutrition for people living in semi-arid regions, they are presently marginalized and their diversity and distribution are threatened at a global scale. Local farmers have developed ancient breeding programs entrenched in traditional knowledge (TK) that has sustained rural cultures for thousands of years. The convention on biological diversity seeks fair and equitable sharing of genetic resources arising from local knowledge and requires signatory nations to provide appropriate policy and legal framework to farmers’ rights over plant genetic resources and associated TK. DNA barcoding employed in this study is proposed as a model for conservation of genetic diversity and an essential step towards documenting and protecting farmers’ rights and TK. Our study focuses on 32 landraces of small millets that are still used by indigenous farmers located in the rain fed areas of rural India and Nepal. Traditional knowledge of traits and utility was gathered using participatory methods and semi-structured interviews with key informants. DNA was extracted and sequenced (rbcL, trnH-psbA and ITS2) from 160 samples. Both multivariate analysis of traits and phylogenetic analyses were used to assess diversity among small millet landraces. Our research revealed considerable variation in traits and DNA sequences among the 32 small millet landraces. We utilized a tiered approach using ITS2 DNA barcode to make 100 % accurate landrace (32 landraces) and species (six species) assignments for all 160 blind samples in our study. We have also recorded precious TK of nutritional value, ecological and agricultural traits used by local farmers for each of these traditional landraces. This research demonstrates the potential of DNA barcoding as a reliable identification tool and for use in evaluating and conserving genetic diversity of small millets. We suggest ways in which DNA barcodes could be used in the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers’ Rights in India and Nepal.",

A two-step pathway involving nitrile hydratase (NHase) and amidase was observed for the biodegradation of butyronitrile. Complete degradation (mineralization) of butyronitrile with the help of metabolite feeding experiment was reported. The significance of this investigation was the capability of the strain to completely degrade and its ability to grow on higher concentrations of butyronitrile. These potential features make it a suitable candidate for practical field application for effective in situ bioremediation of butyronitrile contaminated sites.",

The isolate was a close relative of Pseudoxanthomonas japonensis (95 % similarity) and designated as K2. The bacterial isolate showed positive reaction for oxidase, catalase, and 20 carbohydrates using KB009 Part A and B HiCarbohydrate™ Kit. Degradation experiments were conducted using 200 mg l−1 initial IPU as a source of carbon at different pH and temperatures. Maximum IPU degradation by K2 was observed at pH 7.0 and 30 °C, while least degradation at 6.5 pH and 25 °C. Addition of dextrose along with IPU as an auxiliary carbon source increased IPU degradation by 4.72 %, as compared to the IPU degradation without dextrose under optimum conditions. 4-isopropylaniline was detected as a degradation by-product in the medium. The present study demonstrated the IPU metabolizing capacity of a novel bacterial isolate K2 that can be a better choice for the remediation of IPU-contaminated sites.",

We hypothesize that the screening of the S protein sequences of all the seven known HCoVs would result in the identification of potential multi-epitope vaccine candidates capable of conferring immunity against various HCoVs. In the present study, several machine learning-based in-silico tools were employed to design a broad-spectrum multi-epitope vaccine candidate targeting the S protein of seven known strains of human coronaviruses. Herein, multiple B-cell epitopes and T-cell epitopes (CTL and HTL) were predicted from the S protein sequences of all seven known HCoVs. Post-prediction they were linked together with an adjuvant to construct a potential broad-spectrum vaccine candidate. Secondary and tertiary structures were predicted and validated, and the refined 3D-model was docked with an immune receptor. The vaccine candidate was evaluated for antigenicity, allergenicity, solubility, and its ability to achieve high-level expression in bacterial hosts. Finally, the immune simulation was carried out to evaluate the immune response after three vaccine doses. The designed vaccine is antigenic (with or without the adjuvant), non-allergenic, binds well with TLR-3 receptor and might elicit a diverse and strong immune response.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13205-022-03286-0.",

Flavopiridol is one such drug candidate. In the current study, we sought to make analogues of flavopiridol. Still, the conditions used during their synthesis were unfavourable for the formation of flavopiridol and led to the generation of benzofuranones. In the present work, a new series of benzylidene benzofuranones were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their antioxidant, anti-colorectal cancer activity. Molecular docking, MMGBSA and molecular dynamics studies were conducted to assess their binding affinity at the active site of CDK2. Based on the cytotoxicity exhibited by test compounds, the compound NISOA4 (from isopropyl series) was further selected for mechanistic anticancer studies on HCT 116 cell lines. The compound selected was evaluated by comet assay, DNA fragmentation assay, cell cycle analysis, apoptosis detection by annexin FITC, semi-quantitative RTPCR based gene expression studies and FRET assay on the target CDK2/Cyclin A. Compound NISOA4 exhibited marked olive moments in comet assay studies. The apoptotic DNA fragmentation for compound NISOA4 demonstrated a marked change in the DNA fragmentation. The compound exhibited cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase at both the test concentrations. Apoptosis induction was observed at both the test concentrations and the compound was found to be a potent proapoptotic agent. It exhibited marked inhibition for the CDK2 gene expression and did not show any effect on CyclinA gene expression. However, the compound NISOA4 along with other analogues showed appreciable inhibition for the CDK2/Cyclin A target enzyme.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13205-022-03312-1.",

    "abstract": "Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp) is an important pathotype with enhanced virulence features compared with classical K. pneumoniae (cKp). hvKp usually causes life-threatening infections in the community, often affecting young and healthy individuals. During the past few decades, hvKp-induced liver abscess has been increasingly reported in Asia and is emerging as a global disease. To better comprehend the molecular characteristics of hvKp-induced liver abscess and recognize the global dissemination of hypervirulent strains with resistance determinants, we sequenced the whole genome of 26 K. pneumoniae strains from patients with liver abscess (KLA) and investigated the clinical factors related to different phenotype groups. The epidemiology, virulence-related factors, and antimicrobial resistance determinants were also discussed. The age, gender, and whether being hospitalized showed no differences among the string-positive and -negative groups were also studied. The assembly and annotation suggested that most of the 26 new liver abscess-causing hvKp strains were ST23-K1 or ST86-K2, and only one of the strains exhibited multidrug resistance. Compared with the existing 36 global liver abscess genome sequences, higher sequence type and virulence gene diversity were found in the new genomes. The clinical characteristics and genomic data of the isolated strains will enrich our knowledge for comparative genomic studies, allowing the better understanding of hvKp characteristics and evolution.",

    "abstract": "EIF5A2, a key member of the EIF family, has not been extensively studied regarding its role and mechanism in pan-cancer. TCGA and GTEx analyses were performed to investigate the differential expression of EIF5A2 in tumors and normal tissues. cBioportal was used to investigate the gene alterations of EIF5A2 in tumors. We used Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses to discuss the impact of EIF5A2 expression on prognosis. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect EIF5A2 mRNA levels in 12 cases of fresh liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) and corresponding adjacent non-tumor tissues. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was employed to evaluate the expression levels of EIF5A2 in 284 cases of LIHC as well as in adjacent non-tumorous tissues. Furthermore, the study explored the association between EIF5A2 expression and various clinicopathological parameters, along with its prognostic implications. Spearman correlation analysis was used to estimate the relationship between EIF5A2 expression and tumor mutation burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), and immunologic features. \"pRRophetic\"R package was utilized to obtain the sensitivity of common drugs. The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was used to study the functional enrichment analysis of EIF5A2-related genes. EIF5A2 was overexpressed in most tumors using TCGA and GTEx databases. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that high EIF5A2 expression was associated with unfavorable overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), brain lower grade glioma (LGG), and LIHC. The frequency of EIF5A2 gene alterations was the highest in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). EIF5A2 expression was associated with TMB, MSI, and immune cell infiltration in some tumors. We performed IHC and qRT-PCR to evaluate EIF5A2 expression in HCC and normal tissues, and found upregulation of EIF5A2 expression at the mRNA and protein levels in LIHC. There was a correlation between EIF5A2 expression and tumor size, tumor grade, and TNM stage in LIHC. Kaplan-Meier survival suggested that the overexpression EIF5A2 group had unfavorable outcomes in LIHC. EIF5A2 expression was correlated with immune cell infiltration in LIHC. The high EIF5A2 expression group was more sensitive to cisplatin, crizontinib, gemcitabine, and nilotinib in LIHC. High EIF5A2 expression was associated with several pathways, including cell cycle, proteasome, DNA replication, primary immunodeficiency and oocyte meiosis. EIF5A2 may serve as a potential prognostic marker and a latent focus for cancer immunological treatment.",

A Box–Behnken design using RSM with six variables, namely pH, incubation temperature, enzyme (laccase) concentration, 1-hydroxybenzotriazol (HBT) concentration, dye concentration and incubation time was used in this study to determine significant correlations between the effects of these variables on the decolourization of Sirius rose. The optimum concentrations of HBT, dye and laccase were 0.5 mM, 60 mg/L and 0.1 U/mL, respectively, to obtain maximum decolourization of Sirius rose (approx. 99.5% in 150 min at 45 °C, pH 3). A quadratic model was obtained for dye decolourization using this design. Experimental values were in good agreement with values predicted by the model, giving highly significant correlations.",

This can help us understand the genetic variations that can alter the function of the gene products. A total of 941 SNPs are investigated for CASP9 gene. To determine whether a non-synonymous SNP (nsSNP) in this gene affects its protein product, we used certain computational tools which predicted one nsSNP, rs1052574, to have deleterious phenotypic effect. This polymorphic variant results in amino acid substitution from leucine to proline at 197 position, i.e., from acyclic amino acid to a 5-membered amino acid which resides in the buried area of the protein with a high level of conservation. This amino acid substitution shows a transition from helix to coil in the mutant protein. Hence, due to the complete alteration in the structural property of the amino acid side chain, the stability of the protein is reduced which may affect the function of CASP9 protein, leading to deregulation of apoptosis and neuroblastoma development.",

(S II). Strains were identified as Photorhabdus luminescens HRM1, P. luminescens HS1, P. luminescens HP88, Xenorhabdus indica and X. nematophila ATTC19061 using 16S rDNA sequence analysis. To reveal the genetic diversity among these strains, three molecular markers (RAPD, ISSR and SRAP) were employed. RAPD analysis showed 73.8 and 54.5 polymorphism percentages for the Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus strains, respectively. ISSR analysis resulted in 70.1 and 75.2 polymorphism percentages among the Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus strains, respectively. The SRAP analysis indicated that 75.6 and 61.2% genetic polymorphism was detected among Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus strains, respectively. The cluster analysis grouped the three Photorhabdus strains together in one cluster and the two Xenorhabdus strains together in another cluster indicating the phylogenetic relationships among them. The genotype-specific markers detected from the three molecular markers (RAPD, ISSR and SRAP) were sufficient to distinguish between the different bacterial strains tested and can be used in the future IBM program that could be built on the use of these strains.",

P. indica is known to produce α-amylase and protease. Since the organism exhibits beneficial role in plant growth promotion, achieving high biomass is immensely essential. Hence to enable the commercial production, screening of medium components is a necessary step. The present paper investigates the screening of medium components using Plackett–Burman experimental design wherein the parameters such as α-amylase, protease and biomass have been examined. The parameters α-amylase, protease and biomass was found to vary from 0.25 to 0.45 mg−1 ml−1 min−1, 0.1 to 0.15 mg−1 ml−1 h−1 and 0.8 to 22.6 g l−1, respectively, in 16 runs which demonstrates the strong influence of the medium components.",

    "abstract": "The enzyme maltase (glucoinvertase; glucosidosucrase; maltase-glucoamylase; α-glucopyranosidase; glucosidoinvertase; α-d-glucosidase; α-glucoside hydrolase; α-1,4-glucosidase EC 3.2.1.20), is involved in the exo-hydrolysis of 1,4-α-glucosidic linkages and certain oligosaccharides into glucose which is an important energy source for soil microbes. This enzyme originates from different sources, which include plants, seaweeds, protozoa, fungi, bacteria, vertebrates, and invertebrates. The assay of soil maltase using maltose as substrate and the released glucose determined using a glucose oxidase–peroxidase system has not been explored or investigated to the best of our knowledge. A simple assay protocol using this system is proposed to evaluate and characterize maltase activity in soils. The protocol involves the release of glucose (determined using a glucose oxidase–peroxidase colorimetric approach) when 1 g soil is treated with toluene and incubated with 5 mM maltose in 67 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) at 37 °C for 1 h. The optimal activity using this procedure was at pH 5.0 and decreased at temperatures above 70 °C. The calculated Km values ranged from 0.8 to 6.5 mM, and are comparable to those of enzymes purified from microorganisms. The Arrhenius equation plots for the activity in the four soils were linear between 20 and 70 °C. The activation energy values ranged from 34.1 to 57.2 kJ mol−1, the temperature coefficients (Q10) ranged from 1.5 to 1.9 (avg. = 1.7), and the coefficients of variation (CV) of the proposed assay protocol for the soils used was <6%. While we recognize the availability of established assay protocols to determine soil α-glucosidase (referred in other literature as maltase) activity based on the p-nitrophenol (artificial product) released from p-nitrophenyl-α-d-glucopyranoside (artificial substrate), our interest was to assay its activity by determining the glucose (natural product) released from maltose (natural substrate).",

    "abstract": "Trehalose is the main blood sugar in insects. To study the function of trehalase during exposure to low temperatures, three other novel cDNAs of trehalase were cloned from Harmonia axyridis by transcriptome sequencing and rapid amplification of cDNA ends. One of the cloned cDNAs encoded a soluble trehalase, the second trehalase cDNA encoded a transmembrane-like domain, and the third cDNA encoded a membrane-bound protein. Therefore, these cDNAs were, respectively, named HaTreh1-5, HaTreh2-like, and HaTreh2. HaTreh1-5, HaTreh2-like, and HaTreh2 cDNAs encoded proteins containing 586, 553, and 633 amino acids with predicted masses of approximately 69.47, 63.46, and 73.66 kDa, and pIs of 9.20, 5.52, and 6.31, respectively. All three novel trehalases contained signal motifs \"PGGINKESYYLDSY\", \"QWDYPNAWPP\", and a highly conserved glycine-rich (GGGGEY) region. The expression levels of HaTreh1-5 and HaTreh2 mRNAs were high during adult stages, whereas HaTreh2-like was expressed in low amounts in the fourth larval stage. The results showed that the activity of membrane-bound trehalases decreased from 25 to 10 °C and from 5 to - 5 °C during cooling. The results also revealed a decreasing trend in expression of the three HaTreh mRNAs during the cooling treatment, and an initial decrease followed by an increase during the process of re-warming.",

In this report, using high stringent computational-based methods, a total of 101 putative miRNAs were identified from European sardine fish ( Sardina pilchardus Walbaum, 1792). All the precursors of identified sardine miRNAs formed stable stem-loop structures and displayed high minimum free energy index (MFEI) values. For the experimental validation of the computationally predicted miRNAs, a tissue-specific quantitative study of eight randomly selected putative sardine miRNAs ( spi-miR9, spi-miR26, spi-miR128, spi-miR129, spi-miR132, spi-miR212, spi-miR219, and spi-miR338 ) was performed in brain and liver and all the selected miRNAs were found to be overexpressed in brain tissue. Moreover, using RNAhybrid, a total of 83 potential target proteins of the characterized sardine miRNAs were identified those are involved in transcription, cellular development, defense mechanism, and various signaling pathways. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of sardine microRNAs and their targets.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The important physiological and pathophysiological roles of intestinal human microbiome (HMB) in human health have been emerging, owing to the access to molecular biology techniques. Herein we evaluated, for the first time, the intestinal HMB through direct hybridization approach using n-counter flex DX technology which bypasses the amplification procedure currently applied by other technologies to study the human microbiome. To this purpose, a clinical study was carried out on fecal samples, recruiting both healthy volunteers (N-FOB) and subjects positive for occult blood (P-FOB). A relevant custom panel of 79 16S rRNA target gene was engineered and 32 of them displayed a variation between the two clusters of subjects. Our findings revealed that bacteria belonging to Proteobacteria have higher distribution in P-FOB describing dysbiosis. Similarly, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phylum display high distribution in P-FOB. Of interest, the presence of Clostridium difficile that belongs to Firmicutes phylum displayed about 70% of low presence in N-FOB compared to P-FOB subjects. Only one bacterium belonging to the Actinobacteria phylum, the Bifidobacterium bifidum , was present.",

Fragments of the upstream regulatory region of the movement protein gene of the Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV; two fragments) and Watermelon chlorotic stunt virus (WmCSV, two fragments) and one fragment of the coat protein putative promoter of TYLCV (CPTY-pro) were isolated to assess their abilities to drive expression in monocot and dicot plants. We used bioinformatic analyses to identify tentative motifs in the fragments. The five promoter fragments were isolated, fused with the GUS reporter gene, and transformed into tomato, watermelon, and rice plantlets via Agrobacterium infiltration. GUS expression driven by each putative promoter was analysed using histochemical and fluorometric analyses. In both dicots and the monocots, the highest level of GUS expression was obtained using a truncated regulatory region from TYLCV (MMPTY-pro) followed by a truncated regulatory region from WmCSV (MMPWm-pro). However, the corresponding full-length fragments from TYLCV and WmCSV showed essentially equivalent expression levels in the fluorometric GUS assay compared with the enhanced Cauliflower mosaic virus e35S-pro. In addition, CPTY-pro showed no expression in either the dicots or the monocot. This study demonstrated that MMPTY-pro and MMPWm-pro may be useful as plant promoters.",

    "abstract": "Stripe rust caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici is most important and devastating disease of wheat worldwide, which affects the grain yields, quality and nutrition. To elucidate, the genetic basis of resistance, a mapping population of recombinant inbred lines was developed from a cross between resistant Cappelle-Desprez and susceptible cultivar PBW343 using single-seed descent. Variety PBW343 had been one of the most popular cultivars of North Western Plains Zone, for more than a decade, before succumbing to the stripe rust. Cappelle-Desprez, a source of durable adult plant resistance, has maintained its resistance against stripe rust for a long time in Europe. Map construction and QTL analysis were completed with 1012 polymorphic (DArT and SSR) markers. Screenings for stripe rust disease were carried out in field condition for two consecutive crop seasons (2012-2013 and 2013-2014). Susceptible parent (PBW343) achieved a significant level of disease i.e., 100 % in both the years. In present investigations, resistance in Cappelle-Desprez was found stable and response to the rust ranged from 0 to 1.5 % over the years. The estimated broad-sense heritability (h 2) of stripe rust rAUDPC in the mapping population was 0.82. The relative area under the disease progress curve data showed continuous distributions, indicating that trait was controlled multigenically. Genomic region identified on chromosome 2D, was located within the short arm, with flanking markers (Xgwm484-Xcfd73), explained phenotypic variation (PVE) ranged from 13.9 to 31.8 %. The genomic region identified on chromosome 5B was found with the effect of maximum contribution with flanking DArT markers (1376633|F|0-1207571|F|0), PVE ranged from 24 to 27.0 %. This can, therefore, be utilized for marker assisted selection in developing much needed stripe rust resistant lines for the northern wheat belt of India.",

In these villages the aerobic heterotrophic, Gram-negative, spore-forming, starch-hydrolyzing, Pseudomonas, nitrate-reducing, denitrifying, asymbiotic N2 fixing, nitrifying, phosphate-solubilizing bacterial populations ranged from 1.22 to 2.67 × 106, 0.09-1.63 × 105, 1.53-3.68 × 105, 2.22-4.06 × 105, 0.02-0.04 × 105, 0.35-1.33 × 105, 0.07-0.82 × 105, 0.58-2.50 × 105, 0.13-2.35 × 105, 0.05-1.9 × 105 cfu/g dry soil, respectively. The organic carbon content of the soil samples ranged from 0.61 to 0.93 %. The available nitrogen and phosphate in the soils of the study area varied from 11.2 to 29.5 and 230.8-503.09 mg/kg, respectively. The one-way ANOVA revealed significant variations (p < 0.05) in the microbial diversity with respect to different locations of the study site. Shannon-Wiener and Simpson Index of the study areas ranged from 1.56 to 1.88 and 3.85-5.73, respectively. Jatimati showed comparatively higher diversity index among the villages of the study area. From principal component analysis, three components were extracted having the Eigen values of 3.541, 1.603 and 1.391, respectively. Agglometric hierarchial cluster analysis in respect of the number of different bacterial groups in different places of the study area showed that the denitrifying, nitrate reducing, asymbiotic nitrogen-fixing and spore-forming bacteria formed a cluster while Pseudomonas differed from them forming another cluster and nitrifying, Gram negative, phosphate-solubilising and starch-hydrolyzing bacteria formed another different cluster. This variation of the soil bacteria might be dependent on the microhabitat present in different locations of the study area.",

Increasing efforts have been done to find new applications for lignin. One of them is as a food additive, but its chemical nature makes it sensitive to browning which constitutes a major drawback for this type of lignin application. In the present study we are documenting how color stabilization of a commercial kraft lignin was achieved after the treatment with Penicillium chrysogenum var. halophenolicum. In addition the fungal capacity to remove lignin is studied together with the effect of its treatment on cytotoxicity of lignin. P. chrysogenum var. halophenolicum was able to transform lignin, ensuring its color stability for more than 24 months. Dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy showed that the fungus contributed to homogenize particle size and hydrodynamic properties in lignin suspensions without increase the toxicity over HeLa cells and human primary fibroblasts. These findings suggest new uses for kraft lignin after P. chrysogenum var. halophenolicum treatment providing an effective approach for improve color stability.",

The inactivation efficiency of E. hirae using MB ranges between 10.81 and 48.55 %, whereas in the case of E. coli it ranges between 10.41 and 46.44 %. Using SAQS, the inactivation efficiency of E. hirae was within 5.26-39.03 %, and in the case of E. coli it varied in the range 4.65-37.66 %. Statistical analysis of the photo-inactivation results in the form of analysis of variance (ANOVA) and student 't' test revealed significant individual effect of these process parameters. In addition, an increase in dark incubation period with MB or SAQS resulted in enhanced photo-inactivation efficiency against both the microorganisms. Reactive oxygen species measurement and analysis of lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl index helped in a better understanding of the photo-inactivation mechanism.",

In the present study, mec gene prevalence was analyzed along with SCC mec diversity among 55 human clinical CoNS isolates. PCR screening of insertion sequence (IS256) was also conducted to elucidate their association with methicillin resistance among selected CoNS species. In addition to this, PCR screening and sequence analysis of novel colonization-associated gene sasX was also carried out. High incidences of mec gene, IS256 and their association have been noted among all of the CoNS species tested. Interestingly, eight CoNS isolates were found to harbor sasX gene including S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus and S. saprophtyicus species. Remarkably they were also found to have the coexistence of mec gene and IS256 in their genome. Increased SCC mec diversity with non-typeable elements was also observed among CoNS isolates. Presence of sasX gene in CoNS with mec gene and insertion sequence 256 and also the identification of non-typeable SCC mec element make the study novel and interesting.",

    "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the major hepatic metabolic disorders that occurs because of the accumulation of lipids in hepatocytes in the form of free fatty acids (FFA) and triglycerides (TG) which become non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NOTCH-1 receptors act as novel targets for the development of NAFLD/NASH, where overexpression of NOTCH-1 receptor alters the lipid metabolism in hepatocytes leading to NAFLD. SIRT-1 deacetylates the NOTCH-1 receptor and inhibits NAFLD. Hence, computer-aided drug design (CADD) was used to check the SIRT-1 activation ability of cinnamic sulfonyl hydroxamate derivatives (NMJ 1-8), resveratrol, and vorinostat. SIRT-1 (PDB ID: 5BTR) was docked with eight hydroxamate derivatives and vorinostat using Schrödinger software. Based on binding energy obtained (- 26.31 to - 47.34 kcal/mol), vorinostat, NMJ-2, NMJ-3, NMJ-5 were selected for induced-fit docking (IFD) and results were within - 750.70 to - 753.22 kcal/mol. Qikprop tool was used to analyse the pre pharmacokinetic parameters (ADME analysis) of all hydroxamate compounds. As observed in the molecular dynamic (MD) study, NMJ-2, NMJ-3 were showing acceptable results for activation of SIRT-1. Based on these predictions, in-vivo studies were conducted in CF1 mice, where NMJ-3 showed significant (p < 0.05) changes in lipid profile and anti-oxidant parameters (Catalase, SOD, GSH, nitrite, and LPO) and plasma insulin levels. NMJ-3 treatment also reduced inflammation, fibrosis, and necrosis in liver samples.",

    "abstract": "Nanobiotechnology has been an encouraging approach to improving the efficacy of hydrophobic bioactive compounds. The biologically active constituents present in herbal extracts are poorly absorbed, resulting in loss of bioavailability and efficacy. Hence, herbal medicine and nanotechnology are combined to overcome these limitations. The surface-to-volume ratio of nanoparticles is high and as the size is small, the functional properties are enhanced. The present study reports the synthesis of cinnamon and cumin (Ci-Cu) dual drug-loaded poly (D, L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) to overcome the limitations of oral bioavailability and extend the effect of these drugs for alleviating health problems. The solvent evaporation method was adopted for the synthesis, and the as-prepared nanoparticles were characterized by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The average size of the formed spherical Ci-Cu nanoparticles ranged between 90 and 120 nm. The encapsulation efficiency of the drug was found to be 79% ± 4.5%. XRD analysis demonstrated that cinnamon and cumin were amorphously scattered in the PLGA matrix. The FTIR bands showed no evident changes suggesting the no direct molecular interactions between the drug and the polymer. At pH 6.9, the release studies in vitro exhibited a burst initially followed by a tendency to obtain a slower steady release. The results indicated that the Cu-Ci dual drug-loaded polymeric NPs has drug release at a slower rate. The time taken for 25% release of drug in Ci-Cu-loaded PLGA NPs was twice as compared to cumin-loaded PLGA Nps, and three times compared to cinnamon-loaded PLGA NPs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract For many biomedical applications, high-precision CO 2 detection with a rapid response is essential. Due to the superior surface-active characteristics, 2D materials are particularly crucial for electrochemical sensors. The liquid phase exfoliation method of 2D Co 2 Te 3 production is used to achieve the electrochemical sensing of CO 2 . The Co 2 Te 3 electrode performs better than other CO 2 detectors in terms of linearity, low detection limit, and high sensitivity. The outstanding physical characteristics of the electrocatalyst, including its large specific surface area, quick electron transport, and presence of a surface charge, can be credited for its extraordinary electrocatalytic activity. More importantly, the suggested electrochemical sensor has great repeatability, strong stability, and outstanding selectivity. Additionally, the electrochemical sensor based on Co 2 Te 3 could be used to monitor respiratory alkalosis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRs) are bacteria that colonize the plant roots. These beneficial bacteria have an influence on plant development through multiple mechanisms, such as nutrient availability, alleviating biotic and abiotic stress, and secrete phytohormones. Therefore, their inoculation constitutes a powerful tool towards sustainable agriculture and crop production. To understand plant-PGPRs interaction we present the classification of PGPR using machine learning and meta-learning classifiers namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR), meta-SVM and meta-KLR to predict the presence of Bacillus megaterium inoculated in tomato root tissues using publicly available transcriptomic data. The original dataset presents 36 significantly differentially expressed genes. As the meta-KLR achieved near-optimal performance considering all the relevant metrics, this meta learner was afterwards used to identify the informative genes (IGs). The outcomes showed 157 IGs, being present all significantly differentially expressed genes previously identified. Among the IGs, 113 were identified as tomato genes, 5 as Bacillus subtilis proteins, 1 as Escherichia coli protein and 6 were unidentified. Then, a functional enrichment analysis of the tomato IGs showed 175 biological processes, 22 molecular functions and 20 KEGG pathways involved in B. megaterium– tomato interaction. Furthermore, the biological networks study of their Arabidopsis thaliana orthologous genes identified the co-expression, predicted interaction, shared protein domains and co-localization networks.",

    "abstract": "Within a decade, MERS-CoV emerged with nearly four times higher case fatality rate than an earlier outbreak of SARS-CoV and spread out in 27 countries in short span of time. As an emerging virus, combating it requires an in-depth understanding of its molecular machinery. Therefore, conformational characterization studies of coronavirus proteins are necessary to advance our knowledge of the matter for the development of antiviral therapies. In this study, MERS-CoV papain-like protease (PLpro) was recombinantly expressed and purified. Thermal folding pathway and thermodynamic properties were characterized using dynamic multimode spectroscopy (DMS) and thermal shift assay. DMS study showed that the PLpro undergoes a single thermal transition and follows a pathway of two-state folding with T m and van't Hoff enthalpy values of 54.4 ± 0.1 °C and 317.1 ± 3.9 kJ/mol, respectively. An orthogonal technique based on intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence also showed that MERS-CoV PLpro undergoes a single thermal transition and unfolds via a pathway of two-state folding with a T m value of 51.4 °C. Our findings provide significant understandings of the thermodynamic and structural properties of MERS-CoV PLpro.",

They are considered as key regulators for gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and play an important role in the regulation of many fundamental biological processes. Andrias davidianus, as one of the largest amphibian on earth, may represent the transitional type of animal from aquatic to terrestrial life, but so far, no miRNA has been identified in the species. In this study, Illumina deep sequencing was used for high-throughput analysis of miRNAs in a pooled small RNA library isolated from eight tissues sample of A. davidianus including the spleen, liver, muscle, kidney, skin, testis, gut, and heart. In total, 6,213,146 reads were obtained, 5,962,175 of which were related to 143 unique miRNAs, including 140 conserved and three novel A. davidianus-specific miRNAs. Among them, seven conserved miRNAs and one novel miRNA were selected to validate their expression pattern by stem-loop qRT-PCR. Moreover, 4700 potential target genes were predicted for 143 A. davidianus miRNAs; GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway showed that most of the targets are involved in diverse biological processes including ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, FOXO signaling pathway, tight junction, and spliceosome. This study provides the first large-scale identification and characterization of A. davidianus miRNAs, and predicted their potential target genes; it will lay a valuable foundation for future understanding the role of these miRNAs on regulating diverse biological processes.",

    "abstract": "The persistence and performance of plant growth-promoting microorganisms (PGPMs) in soil are considered critical features for effectiveness, yet they are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the colonization and activity of a new PGPM, phosphate-solubilizing Gluconacetobacter liquefaciens qzr14, in a pot culture experiment using cucumber as test crop for 20 days. The number of G. liquefaciens and bacterial diversity in the rhizosphere and bulk soil were monitored by real-time PCR and DGGE, respectively. Soil phosphorus and cucumber biomass were also examined. G. liquefaciens qzr14 effectively colonized the rhizosphere soil (bacterial density ranging from 2.70 × 108 to 1.18 × 109 copies per gram dry soil). G. liquefaciens qzr14 inoculation had significantly positive effects on bacterial diversity (BD) of the rhizosphere and bulk soil and the ratio of soluble phosphorus to total phosphorus (SP/TP). The number of G. liquefaciens in the rhizosphere soil was significantly related to SP/TP and the BD of the rhizosphere and bulk soil. BD in rhizosphere soil was significantly related to SP/TP and BD in bulk soil. Based on the results of correlation analysis, we inferred that the introduced G. liquefaciens qzr14 effectively colonized the rhizosphere of cucumber, and then expanded its bacterial community by solubilizing soil phosphorus. The expanded bacterial communities might promote cucumber growth by some new functions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Serine/threonine kinase gene ( STK11 ) is identified as tumor suppressor gene whose mutation can lead to Peutz–Jeghers syndrome (PJS). STK11 is emerging as a multifunctional protein, it activates 14 different AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) family members, important in the regulation of cell polarity, cell cycle arrest, energy and hemostasis. Present study was designed to evaluate STK11 mRNA expression in MCF-7 cancer and MCF-10 normal breast cells lines. mRNA expression was studied by real-time PCR. Further, human STK11 promoter construct was fused to a luciferase reporter and transfected into both MCF-7 and MCF-10 cells to identify the promoter activity in these cells. STK11 mRNA was found significantly higher in MCF-7 compared to MCF-10 cells ( p value &lt; 0.0005) indicating its role in the onset of breast cancer. Interestingly, it was found that the promoter activity of STK11 gene in MCF-7 cells was also significantly higher when compared to MCF-10 cells ( p value &lt; 0.005). Positive correlation was observed in promoter activity and gene expression ( p = 0.048, r 2 = 0.587). This study for the first time relates the altered STK11 gene expression in breast cancer cells with altered promoter activity. The present finding may shed light on the new therapeutic approaches against breast cancer by targeting gene or its promoter.",

    "abstract": "A pure yeast strain Candida tropicalis was immobilized on the matrix of powdered activated carbon, sodium alginate, and polyethylene glycol (PSP beads). The immobilized beads were used as fluidized material in a bioreactor to remove toluene from gaseous stream. Applied toluene loadings were 15.4 and 29.8 g/m(3) h in Step 1 and Step 2, respectively, and toluene removal was found above 95% during the entire operation. A continuous pH decline was observed and pH of the suspension was just above 6 in Step 2 but no adverse effects on treatment efficiency were observed. The CO(2) yield values were found to be 0.57 and 0.62 g-[Formula: see text] in Step 1 and Step 2, respectively. These values indicate that a major portion of toluene-carbon was channeled to yeast respiration even at higher toluene loading. In conclusion, immobilized C. tropicalis can be used as a fluidized material for enhanced degradation of gaseous toluene.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Several plant biotechnology applications are based on the expression of multiple genes located on a single transformation vector. The principles of stable expression of foreign genes in plant cells include integration of full-length gene fragments consisting of promoter and transcription terminator sequences, and avoiding converging orientation of the gene transcriptional direction. Therefore, investigators usually generate constructs in which genes are assembled in the same orientation. However, no specific information is available on the effect of the order in which genes should be assembled in the construct to support optimum expression of each gene upon integration in the genome. While many factors, including genomic position and the integration structure, could affect gene expression, the investigators judiciously design DNA constructs to avoid glitches. However, the gene order in a multigene assembly remains an open question. This study addressed the effect of gene order in the DNA construct on gene expression in rice using a simple design of two genes placed in two possible orders with respect to the genomic context. Transgenic rice lines containing green fluorescent protein (GFP) and β-glucuronidase (GUS) genes in two distinct orders were developed by Cre- lox -mediated site-specific integration. Gene expression analysis of transgenic lines showed that both genes were expressed at similar levels in either orientation, and different transgenic lines expressed each gene within 1–2× range. Thus, no significant effect of the gene order on gene expression was found in the transformed rice lines containing precise site-specific integrations and stable gene expression in plant cells could be obtained with altered gene orders. Therefore, gene orientation and integration structures are more important factors governing gene expression than gene orders in the genomic context.",

Here, we report recent updates to the Java application SBAL, an integrated tool to generate, edit, visualise and analyse secondary structure-based sequence alignments. The main goal of the software is to streamline the work flow in generation of structure-based alignments, and we have thus implemented the option to import and visualise sequence and structure information directly from any PDB file. The new feature is achieved by a Java application named ASSP which follows the original framework of the well-established dictionary of protein secondary structure by Kabsch and Sander. ASSP is also available as a stand-alone application. Other major additions to SBAL include the calculation of distance matrices, peptide properties, as well as detailed on-line tutorials for typical applications.",

In this short report, we attempt to raise awareness to the fact that taking annotated genomes from public repositories and using them for metabolic model reconstructions is far from being trivial due to annotation inconsistencies. We are proposing a protocol for comparative analysis of metabolic models on closely related genomes, using fifteen strains of genus Brucella, which contains pathogens of both humans and livestock. This study lead to the identification and subsequent correction of inconsistent annotations in the SEED database, as well as the identification of 31 biochemical reactions that are common to Brucella, which are not originally identified by automated metabolic reconstructions. We are currently implementing this protocol for improving automated annotations within the SEED database and these improvements have been propagated into PATRIC, Model-SEED, KBase and RAST. This method is an enabling step for the future creation of consistent annotation systems and high-quality model reconstructions that will support in predicting accurate phenotypes such as pathogenicity, media requirements or type of respiration.",

Enzymes involved in the hydrolysis of NAD, i.e. alkaline phosphatase, aminohydrolase and glycohydrolase were determined. Alkaline phosphatase was found to catalyse the sequential hydrolysis of two phosphate moieties of NAD molecule to nicotinamide riboside plus adenosine. Adenosine was then deaminated by aminohydrolase to inosine and ammonia. While glycohydrolase catalyzed the hydrolysis of the nicotinamide-ribosidic bond of NAD+ to produce nicotinamide and ADP-ribose in equimolar amounts, enzyme purification through a 3-step purification procedure revealed the existence of two peaks of alkaline phosphatases, and one peak contained deaminase and glycohydrolase activities. NAD deaminase was purified to homogeneity as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an apparent molecular mass of 91 kDa. Characterization and determination of some of NAD aminohydrolase kinetic properties were conducted due to its biological role in the regulation of cellular NAD level. The results also revealed that NAD did not exert its feedback control on nicotinamide amidase produced by P. brevicompactum.",

Equimolar concentration of amplicons from 69 PCR products of each sample was pooled and subjected to sequencing using Ion Torrent PGM. Data obtained were analysed using DNASTAR software package and case control analysis using SAS software. We found SNP present in BPIFA1 gene of B. indicus shows association with event of HC which reflects its potential to be a genetic marker. Bioinformatic analysis to detect structural and functional impact nsSNP of BPIFA1 added another layer of confirmation to our result. We successfully identified SNP associated with HC as well as demonstrated efficient approach for limited number of SNP discovery and validation in targeted genomics regions in large number of samples combining PCR amplification and Ion Torrent PGM sequencing which suits small-scale laboratories with limited budget.",

The factors involved in MPF that were assessed in this study comprised banana peel and corncob, KH2PO4, Tween 80, MgSO4·7H2O, NaCl, yeast extract, and diammonium hydrogen citrate to identify the optimal concentration for D-lactic acid production. Optimization of these component factors was performed using the Taguchi method with an L8 orthogonal array. The optimal concentrations for the effectiveness of MPF using biomass substrates were as follows: (1) banana peel, D-lactic acid production was 31.8 g/L in medium containing 15 % carbon source, 0.5 % KH2PO4, 0.1 % Tween 80, 0.05 % MgSO4·7H2O, 0.05 % NaCl, 1.5 % yeast extract, and 0.2 % diammonium hydrogen citrate. (2) corncob, D-lactic acid production was 38.3 g/L in medium containing 15 % of a carbon source, 0.5 % KH2PO4, 0.1 % Tween 80, 0.05 % MgSO4·7H2O, 0.1 % NaCl, 1.0 % yeast extract, and 0.4 % diammonium hydrogen citrate. Thus, both banana peel and corncob are unutilized potential resources for D-lactic acid production. These results indicate that MPF using L. mesenteroides and A. awamori could constitute part of a potential industrial application of the currently unutilized banana peel and corncob biomass for D-lactic acid production.",

Statistical optimization of physiochemical parameters enhanced the protease production by 75 %. Protease of S. marcescens PPB-26 was classified as a metalloprotease. It showed optimal activity at 30 °C, pH 7.5 (0.15 M Tris–HCl buffer) and with 0.8 % substrate concentration. It had K m = 0.3 %, V max = 34.5 μmol min−1 mg−1 protein and a half life of 2 days at 30 °C. The enzyme was stable in most metal ions but showed increased activity with Fe2+ and Cu2+ while strong inhibition with Co2+ and Zn2+. Further investigation showed that the enzyme could not only retain its activity in various organic solvents but also showed increased activity with methanol and ethanol. The reported metalloprotease is thus a potential candidate for carrying out industrial peptide synthesis.",

Bayesian and coalescent analyses on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequences suggested three major groups with close proximity between Pseudomonas and Frankia isolates. This result has been further validated based on the data observed through similarity coefficient value and computational RFLP. Principal component analysis and Mandel h and k statistical analysis also confirmed and strengthen the findings. Approximately 458 aligned sequence of all the taxa were used to decipher nucleotide diversity, polymorphism and gene flow between these taxa. Thus, our results suggest for a possible co-evolution or a heterologous gene transfer of distantly related microbial forms. Further, our study also advocate for the use of computer aided, virtual RFLP analysis as a cost effective and rapid identification tool.",

A total of 789 copies of the cDNA were cloned in Escherichia coli by employing the pGEM-T Easy vector. Sequencing was carried out by Solgent Co. (Korea). As many as 579 expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeat (EST-SSR) markers were designed (73.38%) from the known cDNA nucleotide base sequences. The lengths of the developed EST-SSR markers ranged from 100 to 499 bp (average length 238 bp). Their motif sequence types were varied, with most being dinucleotides and pentanucleotides, and the most commonly found motifs were CAGAAT (29.0%) and TCT (2.8%). Based on these SSR-containing sequences, 619 pairs of high-quality SSR primers were designed using WebSat and Primer3web. The total number of primers designed was 144. Polymorphism was evident in 82 EST-SSR markers among 20 Korean sweet potato cultivars tested and in 90 EST-SSR markers in the two parents of a mapping population, Yeseumi and Annobeny. In this study, the hexaploid sweet potato (2n = 6x = 90) EST-SSR markers were developed in the absence of full-sequence data. Moreover, by acting as a molecular tag for particular traits, the EST-SSR marker can also simultaneously identify information about the corresponding gene. These EST-SSR markers will allow the molecular analysis of sweet potato to be done more efficiently. Thus, we can develop high-quality sweet potato while overcoming the challenges from climate change and other unfavorable conditions.",

Co-culture of the bacterium with the explants gave marginal hairy root phenotype that failed to multiply in the culture medium. Some primary and secondary metabolites were subdued in infected explants. Moscatilin, the stilbenoid active principle in D. ovatum, was found below the detection limit. The presence of two metabolites viz., Laudanosine, a benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid and Lyciumin B, a cyclic peptide, were detected exclusively in the infected explants. The subjugated amino acids and phenolics in the infected plantlets were routed to produce phytoanticipins, and phenanthrenes, strengthening the defence mechanism in infected tissues. This research implies that the plant's defence mechanism activation could have prevented the extensive hairy root formation in the explants, even though nodulations and phenotype transitions were witnessed. Moscatilin has a structural resemblance with Resveratrol, a phytoalexin that combats bacterial and fungal pathogens. The study favours the possibility of Moscatlin being a precursor for phenanthrene compounds, thereby serving as a ‘phytoanticipin’ during the infection phase.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study investigates the therapeutic effect of petroleum ether fraction of Trigonella foenum-graecum L. (PE-TFG) seed extract in ovariectomized rats fed with high-fat diet. Rats were randomly grouped into sham ovariectomy (S.OVX), ovariectomy + high-fat diet (OVX + HFD), and treatment groups. The blood samples were collected, and lipid profile, glucose, hepatic markers, and inflammatory markers were estimated. Liver, kidney, and common carotid artery were isolated for histopathological observations. Liver samples were tested for antioxidant, oxidative stress markers, mRNA expression of adiponectin, and PPAR-γ. PE-TFG treatment significantly decreased total cholesterol (18%), LDL (20%), hepatic markers (28%), leptin (17%), TNF-α (21%), and increased mRNA expression of adiponectin and PPAR-γ. There was also micro- and macro-hepatic steatosis, inflammation in the liver, deteriorated tubules in the kidney, and increased tunica intima and media thickness of the common carotid artery. These pathological alterations were reversed with PE-TFG administration. This impact might be linked to phytoestrogens and other components in PE-TFG such as diosgenin, phenols, and flavonoids.",

    "abstract": "The family GH126 is a family of glycoside hydrolases established in 2011. Officially, in the CAZy database, it counts ~ 1000 sequences originating solely from bacterial phylum Firmicutes. Two members, the proteins CPF_2247 from Clostridium perfringens and PssZ from Listeria monocytogenes have been characterized as a probable α-amylase and an exopolysaccharide-specific glycosidase, respectively; their three-dimensional structures being also solved as possessing catalytic (α/α)6-barrel fold. Previously, based on a detailed in silico analysis, the seven conserved sequence regions (CSRs) were identified for the family along with elucidating basic evolutionary relationships within the family members. The present study represents a continuation study focusing on two particular aims: (1) to find out whether the taxonomic coverage of the family GH126 might be extended outside the Firmicutes and, if positive, to deliver those out-of-Firmicutes proteins with putting them into the context of the family; and (2) to identify the family members containing the N- and/or C-terminal extensions of their polypeptide chain, additional to the catalytic (α/α)6-barrel domain, and perform the bioinformatics characterization of the extra domains. The main results could be summarized as follows: (1) 17 bacterial proteins caught by BLAST searches outside Firmicutes (especially from phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes) have been found and convincingly suggested as new family GH126 members; and (2) a thioredoxin-like fold and various leucine-rich repeat motifs identified by Phyre2 structure homology modelling have been recognized as extra domains occurring most frequently in the N-terminal extensions of family GH126 members possessing a modular organization.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Molecular biology research often requires extraction of DNA fragments from agarose gels. In the past decades, there have been many methods developed for this purpose. Currently most researchers, especially novices, use commercial kits for this extraction, although these kits cost money and the procedures involved are not necessarily easier than some erstwhile methods. We herein reintroduce and reassess several simple and cost-free older methods. One method involves excising a slice of the gel containing the DNA fragment, followed by a thaw-and-freeze procedure to release the DNA from the gel slice into the gel-making buffer. The second method involves a dialysis tubing and requires electroelution of the DNA from the gel slice in the tubing. The third one is to centrifuge the gel slice to release the DNA. The fourth method requires electro-transfer of the DNA from the gel into a filter paper, while the fifth one includes either allowing the DNA in the slice to be dissolved into a buffer or dissolving the DNA-containing gel slice, followed by DNA precipitation with ethanol or isopropanol. The strengths and weaknesses of these methods are discussed to assist researchers in making their choice. We also point out that some of the end uses of the DNA fragment in the agarose gel may not actually require extraction of the DNA. For instance, a tiny DNA-containing gel block or filter paper can be directly used as the template in a nested or semi-nested polymerase chain reaction to preliminarily determine the identity of the DNA fragment.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, a novel transformation protocol for Opuntia ficus-indica was generated by means of particle bombardment. The best conditions obtained were: 900 psi rupture disk pressure, 8 cm microprojectile travel distance, and 4 h of exposition to 0.2 M mannitol. For all experiments, gold particles coated with 1.0 µg/µL of pBI426 plasmid DNA were used. With all these conditions, a 23% of transformation efficiency in terms of regeneration in selection media (100 mg/L kanamycin) was obtained. Interestingly, the presence of both transgenes: nptII and uidA, by means of PCR and RT-PCR assays was detected. The regeneration percentage achieved in terms of stable integration for both genes was 10%. In addition, we also detected adequate amounts of β-glucuronidase activity by means of the GUS fluorometric assay. The procedure described in the present investigation reveals the feasibility of using nopal for the introduction, expression, and possible production of heterologous proteins.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Botroclot is a marketed preparation containing hemocoagulase, which is an enzyme having coagulant activity, isolated from the snake Botrops atrox. This formulation is used in dental surgeries and other minor surgical wounds. However, the formulation remains untested in diabetic wounds. Hence, we proposed a study for the topical application of Botroclot in high-fat diet (HFD) + Streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats. HFD was fed initially to rats which facilitates the development of insulin resistance. Thereafter, an injection of STZ (40 mg/kg, i.p.) was given. This resulted in the development of diabetes with elevated fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance. After stabilization of blood glucose values, wounds were created by punch biopsy on the dorsal side of the palm of the rat to mimic the diabetic wounds frequently seen in the case of humans. Later, the application of Botroclot on these wounds was carried out for 15 days. Topical application of hemocoagulase improved the wound closure and there was a gradual decrease in inflammatory markers and a substantial increase in collagen deposition occurred. Histopathological findings indicated the same, with an increase in granulation tissue suggesting that the topical application moderately improves the wound healing in diabetic rats. We conclude that Botroclot can have a mild to moderate effect in improving collagen deposition and thus wound contraction, improving wound closure in diabetic wounds in rats. This study also establishes the basis for exploration of agents from venom-based sources in diabetic wound healing.",

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the hepatoprotective effect of BM-MSC and its combination treatment with silymarin in carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 )-induced liver cirrhosis animal model and to investigate whether tail vein or portal vein infusion was the ideal route for BM-MSC transplantation. 36 female Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups ( n = 6): Group 1 (normal control), Group 2 (received only CCl 4 , disease model), Group 3 (CCl 4 + BM-MSCs through tail vein), Group 4 (CCl 4 + BM-MSCs through portal vein), Group 5 (CCl 4 + silymarin), Group 6 (CCl 4 + BM-MSCs + silymarin). On the 21st day after treatment, blood samples were collected for biochemical estimations. After the experiment, the rats were sacrificed. Liver was dissected out and processed for histopathology and scanning electron microscopy studies. Liver enzyme and marker analysis, histopathological studies indicated that the combination of BM-MSCs and silymarin was effective in treating liver cirrhosis. Transplanted BM-MSCs in combination with silymarin ameliorated the liver tissue damage through their immunoregulatory activities. Among the two routes, the intravenous administration of cells through the tail vein was found to be more effective and safe.",

    "abstract": "Thermophilic bacteria, especially from the genus Bacillus, constitute a huge potential source of novel enzymes that could be relevant for biotechnological applications. In this work, we described the cellulose and hemicellulose-related enzymatic activities of the hot spring Bacillus aerius CCMM B940 from the Moroccan Coordinated Collections of Microorganisms (CCMM), and revealed its potential for hemicellulosic biomass utilization. Indeed, B940 was able to degrade complex polysaccharides such as xylan and lichenan and exhibited activity towards carboxymethylcellulose. The strain was also able to grow on agriculture waste such as orange and apple peels as the sole carbon source. Whole-genome sequencing allowed the reclassification of CCMM B940 previously known as B. aerius into Bacillus paralicheniformis since the former species name has been rejected. The draft genome reported here is composed of 38 contigs resulting in a genome of 4,315,004 bp and an average G + C content of 45.87%, and is an important resource for illuminating the molecular mechanisms of carbohydrate metabolism. The annotated genomic sequences evidenced more than 52 genes encoding glycoside hydrolases and pectate lyases belonging to 27 different families of CAZymes that are involved in the degradation of plant cell wall carbohydrates. Genomic predictions in addition to in vitro experiments have revealed broad hydrolytic capabilities of the strain, thus reinforcing its relevance for biotechnology applications.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13205-021-02919-0.",

    "abstract": "To construct wild-type E. coli irp2 gene deletion strains, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology was used, and the difficulty and key points of gene editing of wild-type strains were analyzed. Based on the resistance of the CRISPR/Cas9 system expression vector, 4 strains of 41 E. coli strains isolated from Saba pigs were selected as the target strains for the deletion of the irp2 gene, which were sensitive to both ampicillin and kanamycin. Then, CRISPR/Cas9 technology was combined with homologous recombination technology to construct recombinant vectors containing Cas9, sgRNA and donor sequences to knock out the irp2 gene. Finally, the absence of the irp2 gene in E. coli was further verified by iron uptake assays, iron carrier production assays and growth curve measurements. The results showed that three of the selected strains showed single base mutations and deletions (Δirp2-1, Δirp2-2 and Δirp2-3). The deletion of the irp2 gene reduced the ability of E. coli to take up iron ions and produce iron carriers, but not affect the growth characteristics of E. coli. It is shown that the CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out system constructed in this study can successfully knock out the irp2 gene of the wild-type E. coli. Our results providing new insights into genome editing in wild-type strains, which enable further functional studies of the irp2 gene in wild-type E. coli.",

    "abstract": "In cases of public or occupational radiation overexposure and eventual radiological accidents, it is important to provide dose assessment, medical triage, diagnoses and treatment to victims. Cytogenetic bio-dosimetry based on scoring of dicentric chromosomal aberrations assay (DCA) is the “gold standard” biotechnology technique for estimating medically relevant radiation doses. Under the auspices of the National Science, Technology and Innovation Plan in Saudi Arabia, we have set up a biodosimetry laboratory and produced a national standard dose–response calibration curve for DCA, pre-required to estimate the doses received. For this, the basic cytogenetic DCA technique needed to be established. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were collected from four healthy volunteers and irradiated with radiation doses between 0 and 5 Gy of 320 keV X-rays. Then, lymphocytes were PHA stimulated, Colcemid division arrested and stained cytogenetic slides were prepared. The Metafer4 system (MetaSystem) was used for automatic and manually assisted metaphase finding and scoring of dicentric chromosomes. Results were fit to the linear-quadratic dose–effect model according to the IAEA EPR-Biodosimetry-2011 report. The resulting manually assisted dose–response calibration curve (Y = 0.0017 + 0.026 × D + 0.081 × D2) was in the range of those described in other populations. Although the automated scoring over-and-under estimates DCA at low (<1 Gy) and high (>2 Gy) doses, respectively, it showed potential for use in triage mode to segregate between victims with potential risk to develop acute radiotoxicity syndromes. In conclusion, we have successfully established the first biodosimetry laboratory in the region and have produced a preliminary national dose–response calibration curve. The laboratory can now contribute to the national preparedness plan in response to eventual radiation emergencies in addition to providing information for decision makers and public health officials who assess the magnitude of public, medical, occupational and accidental radiation exposures.",

In the present study, small-insert metagenomic library from soil sample collected from Ladakh (3,000–3,600 m.a.s.l) in northwestern Himalayas, India was constructed. Function-driven screening of ~8,500 colonies led to the isolation of one esterase-positive clone (clone-est) harboring 2.43 kb insert. Sequence analysis of the insert identified two ORF’s, phosM encoding phosphoesterase and rodM encoding rhodanese. The 800 bp rodM gene encoded a polypeptide of 227 amino acids (RodM). The RodM showed maximum homology with the rhodanese-like protein from Cyanobacterium synechococcus species with a score identity of only 51 %. Putative 3D structure of RodM developed by homology modeling resembles to homodimeric protein of SUD sulfur transferase of Wolinella succinogenes with properly structured active-site cysteine (Cys) residue. Rhodanese has been reported from few culturable microorganisms.",

In the present study, prediction and modeling of T cell epitopes of Toscana virus (TOSV) antigenic proteins followed by the binding simulation studies of predicted highest binding scorers with their corresponding MHC class II alleles were done. Immunoinformatics was applied in computational vaccinology to analyze the viral proteins which generate possible outcomes to elicit vaccine for TOSV. Here, immunoinformatic tool ProPred was used to predict the promiscuous MHC class II epitopes of viral antigenic proteins. The molecular modeling of the selected epitopes as well as MHC alleles was done at CPH model 3.2 server. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies were performed through the NAMD graphical user interface embedded in visual molecular dynamics. The epitope/peptide VKMMIVLNL of viral nucleoprotein as well as VMILGLLSS of viral glycoprotein has shown the highest binding score with the same DRB1*1104 MHC II allele. These two predicted peptides are highly potential to induce T cell-mediated immune response and are expected to be useful in designing epitope-based vaccines after further testing. The results signify that the nucleoprotein, glycoprotein or the combination of both could be useful for future development of a vaccine controlling the spread of this emerging virus that could pose a new threat for humans.",

In this study, gene expression of WRKY1 and EREBP1 genes and activity of two enzymes were investigated in two genotypes, G9 (as resistance) and G12 (as susceptible) of 10 days-old lemon balm seedlings. Experiments were done according to factorial design on the base of completely randomized design with three replications for expression analysis and enzyme assays. Seedlings were cultured in MS medium suspensions, including 0, 3, 6, 12 and 15 % w/v PEG 6000. Leaf samples were subsequently collected at 0, 3, 6, 24, 48, 72 h after culture. According to the results of the enzyme assay, SOD activity in resistant genotype was more than in sensitive one. POD activity was high in G9 in severe drought condition and in G12 this activity was increased at initial times of drought stress. The survey results revealed that the expression levels of both genes, EREBP1 and WRKY1, in G9 variety were more than G12, and in this respect we can say that the G9 variety is more resistant to drought.",

Enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase from Mtb is a well-known and thoroughly studied target for anti-tuberculosis therapy. In the present analysis, virtual screening techniques performed from Drug bank database by utilizing INH-NAD adduct as query for the discovery of potent anti-TB agents. About 100 molecules sharing similar scaffold with INH-NAD adduct were analyzed for their binding effectiveness. The initial screening based on number of rotatable bonds gave 42 hit molecules. Subsequently, physiochemical properties such as toxicity, solubility, drug-likeness and drug score were analyzed for the filtered set of compounds. Final data reduction was performed by means of molecular docking and normal mode docking analysis. The result indicates that DB04362, adenosine diphosphate 5-(beta-ethyl)-4-methyl-thiazole-2-carboxylic acid could be a promising lead compound and be effective in treating sensitive as well as drug-resistant strains of Mtb. We believe that this novel scaffolds might be the good starting point for lead compounds and certainly aid the experimental designing of anti-tuberculosis drug in a short time.",

    "abstract": "To assess the genetic diversity among four canola cultivars (namely, Serw-3, Serw-4, Misser L-16 and Semu 249), random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), simple sequence repeat polymorphism (SSR) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analyses were performed. The data indicated that all of the three molecular markers gave different levels of polymorphism. A total of 118, 31 and 338 markers that show 61, 67.7 and 81 % polymorphism percentages were resulted from the RAPD, SSR and AFLP analyses, respectively. Based on the data obtained the three markers can be used to differentiate between the four canola cultivars. The genotype-specific markers were determined, 18 out of the 72 polymorphic RAPD markers generated were found to be genotype-specific (25 %). The highest number of RAPD specific markers was scored for Semu 249 (15 markers), while Serw-4 scored two markers. On the other hand, Serw-3 scored one marker. The cultivar Semu 249 scored the highest number of unique AFLP markers, giving 57 unique markers, followed by Misser L-16 which was characterized by 40 unique AFLP markers, then Serw-3 giving 31 unique markers. While Serw-4 was characterized by the lowest number producing 14 unique positive markers. The dendrogram built on the basis of combined data from RAPD, SSR and AFLP analysis represents the genetic distances among the four canola cultivars. Understanding the genetic variability among the current canola cultivars opens up a possibility for developing a molecular genetic map that will lead to the application of marker-assisted selection tools in genetic improvement of canola.",

    "abstract": "Forty-three bacterial isolates in five genera were recovered from naturally infected green pepper fruits (38 samples) showing dark brown, irregular-shaped splotches. The pathogenicity test was performed on healthy green pepper fruits and red colonies were from inoculated fruits showing the same symptoms and the infected area developed into soft rot. Their identification was based on phenotypic characters and sequence of the gene fragment coding 16S rRNA. Of 43 isolates, 10 showing splotches on green pepper fruits belonged to genus Serratia on the basis of phenotypic characters. One representative isolate of the genus Serratia has been identified by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis as belonging to the Serratia rubidaea and has the potential to cause spot on green pepper. Eleven phytopathogenic bacterial isolates were also obtained at the same time but did not induce any splotch symptoms on artificially infected green pepper. Five out of 11 bacterial isolates were identified as Ralstonia on the basis of biochemical tests. Partial sequencing of 16S ribosomal gene of representative isolate revealed that the isolate is Ralstonia solanacearum. The six remaining isolates were related to Xanthomonas vesicatoria on the basis of biochemical tests. Twenty-two of opportunistic human pathogens were isolated at the same time and related to Proteus and Klebsiella. Opportunistic human pathogens did not produce any symptoms on artificially infected green pepper. One representative isolate for each genus was identified as Klebsiella oxytoca and Proteus mirabilis based on their partial 16S rRNA gene sequences. The virulence of the S. rubidaea, the causal agent of green pepper fruits splotches was attributed to the production and secretion of a large variety of enzymes capable of degrading the complex polysaccharides of the plant cell wall and membrane constituents.",

CDA is widely employed for bio-catalytic conversion of chitin to chitosan. Chitosan is a biopolymer with immense commercial potential in diverse industrial sectors, viz. pharmaceutics, food, agriculture, water treatment, etc. CDA production was significantly affected by all the variables studied, viz. pH, temperature, inoculum age and size. The optimal conditions that stimulating maximal CDA production were found to be: pH, 7.9; temperature, 28 °C; inoculum age, 90 h, and 11 % inoculum size. Under these optimized conditions, the actual maximal CDA production was 623.57 ± 8.2 Ul-1, which was in good agreement with the values predicted by the quadratic model (648.24 Ul-1), confirming the validity of the model. Optimization of fermentation conditions through CCD had resulted into 1.4-fold enhancement in CDA productivity (Qp = 4.3264 Ul-1 h-1). Results of these experiments indicated that response surface methodology was proved to be a promising method for optimization of CDA production.",

Thiomonas strains represent an important arsenite oxidizer found ubiquitous in acid mine drainage. In the present study, the arsenite oxidase gene (aioBA) was cloned from Thiomonas delicata DSM 16361, expressed heterologously in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. The purified recombinant Aio consisted of two subunits with the respective molecular weights of 91 and 21 kDa according to SDS-PAGE. Aio catalysis was optimum at pH 5.5 and 50-55 °C. Aio exhibited stability under acidic conditions (pH 2.5-6). The V max and K m values of the enzyme were found to be 4 µmol min-1 mg-1 and 14.2 µM, respectively. SDS and Triton X-100 were found to inhibit the enzyme activity. The homology model of Aio showed correlation with the acidophilic adaptation of the enzyme. This is the first characterization studies of Aio from a species belonging to the Thiomonas genus. The arsenite oxidase was found to be among the acid-tolerant Aio reported to date and has the potential to be used for biosensor and bioremediation applications in acidic environments.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, we investigated radiation mitigating activities of Psidium guajava L. (P. guajava) against whole-body X- ray induced damages in albino Wistar rat model. The animals were orally administered with 200 mg/kg bodyweight of hydroalcoholic leaf extract of P. guajava for five consecutive days and on the fifth day, after the last dose of extract administration, animals were exposed to 4 Gy of X-rays. Rats were sacrificed 24 h post X-ray irradiation. The radiomitigating activity of the herb extract was assessed by micronucleus assay, histopathology of the small intestine and hematological parameters. Hepatic cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin -10 (IL-10) levels were assayed to validate the anti-inflammatory property. Biochemical estimations were also performed in RBC lysates to corroborate antioxidant properties in the leaf extract. HPLC analysis of crude extract confirmed the presence of standard flavonoid quercetin. Our results indicated that radiation elevated COX-2, IL-6 and decreased IL-10 levels and also induced micronucleus formation in polychromatic erythrocytes, simultaneously impairing hematological parameters along with erythrocyte antioxidants. The animals pre-treated with P. guajava exhibited a significant decrease in the COX-2 (P ≤ 0.01), IL-6 levels (P ≤ 0.05) and also displayed significant increase in the hepatic IL-10 levels (P ≤ 0.01). Pre-treatment with plant extract improved antioxidant enzyme activities, hematological parameters and reduced the intestinal damage by recovering the architecture of the small intestine. Moreover, extract also rendered protection against radiation induced DNA damage, as evidenced by the significant (P ≤ 0.01) decrease in the percentage of radiation-induced micronucleus in polychromatic erythrocytes. Furthermore, the herb extract treatment increased radiation LD50/30 from 6.6 Gy to 9.0 Gy, offering a dose reduction factor (DRF) of 1.36. Our findings for the first time propose the beneficial use of P. guajava as a radioprotector against X-ray induced damage.",

Their role in nutrient cycle is well documented. 16S rDNA sequences do not always allow the species to be discriminated. In this study 40 Bacillus spp. obtained from fish culture pond and 10 culture type strains were analysed for their genomic diversity by PCR–RFLP of intergenic spacer region of 16S-23S and HSP60 genes. TaqI digestion of PCR products amplified by ITS PCR did not render distinctive RFLP patterns. Numerical analysis of ITS PCR–RFLP pattern differentiated the isolates into 11 clusters. Same species were found to be grouped in different clusters. But PstI digested PCR products amplified from HSP60 gene of the isolates showed distinctive RFLP patterns. The dendrogram constructed from HSP60 PCR–RFLP delineated the isolates into 11 clusters also. All the clusters, except cluster I grouped only one type of species. The results showed that Bacillus spp. could be clearly distinguished by PCR–RFLP of HSP60 gene. Therefore, the HSP60 gene is proposed as an additional molecular marker for discrimination of Bacillus group.",

Presence of RsMYB1 in transgenic lines was confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results of reverse-transcription-PCR analysis revealed that the expression of RsMYB1 was stable in all transgenic lines and could enhance the expression levels of three key biosynthetic genes (F3H, DFR, and ANS) involved in anthocyanin production. Accordingly, anthocyanin content was significantly higher in transgenic lines than in control of all the cultivars, although the increasement was not visually observed in any of the transgenic lines. Therefore, these results demonstrate that RsMYB1 has potential to enhance anthocyanin content in the chrysanthemums.",

In-vivo expression technologies and differential display RT-PCR are providing new approaches to further examine a microbe's response to experimental conditions which more closely resemble natural microbial associations and habitats. In this study, Bacillus endophyticus strain SA isolated from the inner tissue of the stem of the cultivated plant (Salvadora persica, Asir, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) produces an antagonistic factor. This factor has a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-positive and specifically against Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The antagonistic factor was isolated from the bacterial culture medium and purified by thin layer chromatography technique, then analyzed by GC-MS analysis. Identification of the producer strain was performed using the partial nucleotide sequence of 16S rRNA gene, which indicated that this strain is identical to B. endophyticus with 99 % similarity. The sequence of this strain was deposited at NCBI GenBank under accession number KF011545. Application of differential display RT-PCR revealed that the isolate was able to up-regulate a gene with serine protease like protein. The protein is well known as antimicrobial agent and was reported to be produced by plants, animals and insects. Serine protease is also known to be produced by bacteria for purposes oth er than bacterial-bacterial antagonistic effect, which has been confirmed by this study.",

    "abstract": "Bacillus thuringiensis is a bacterium with unusual properties that make it useful for pest control in ecoagriculture. It can form a parasporal crystal containing polypeptides (also called delta-endotoxins). These entomopathogenic toxins are made during the stationary phase of the bacterial growth cycle and were initially characterized as an insect pathogen. Nowadays, the use of saturated two-level designs is very popular. This method is especially used in industrial applications where the cost of experiments is expensive. Standard classical approaches are not appropriate to analyze data from saturated designs. It is due to the fact that they only allow to estimate the main factor effects and cannot assure enough freedom degrees to estimate the error variance. In this paper, we propose the use of empirical Bayesian procedures to get inferences for data obtained from saturated designs, inspired from Hadamard matrices. The proposed methodology is illustrated by assuming a dataset to prove the model robustness. The comparison between the two studied mathematical techniques, based on mean square error values (MSE), revealed that Bayesian method (BM) was more accurate than least square method (LSM): for example, the results showed that 2002 and 2000.7 mg/l for experimental and predicted (BM) data were obtained against 2002 and 1991 mg/l for experimental and predicted (LSM) data. This suggested method could be generalized in several application fields in biological sciences.",

Viral samples were collected from different regions of the northern part of West Bengal in India and were analyzed by PCR technique to study the variations across the region. The partial segment of the HytaNPV polyhedrin gene was cloned and sequenced. A 527 bp nucleotide sequence containing highly conserved region from polyhedrin gene of HytaNPV was observed. The blast homology search for studied polyhedrin gene showed 98% sequence identity with the sequence of previous reported NPV of H. talaca, H. infixaria and Buzura suppressaria. Pathogenicity study against second instar H. talaca indicated that the LC50 values ranged from 4.61 × 105 to 7.57 × 105 polyhedral occlusion bodies per ml (POBs/ml) and the LT50 values ranged from 4.2 to 6.66 days. Sequencing result reveals that the same HytaNPV strain dominates across this area and the pathogenicity indicates its potential as an alternative to chemical insecticides to control H. talaca.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The ‘enzyme prodrug therapy’ represents a promising strategy to overcome limitations of current cancer treatments by the systemic administration of prodrugs, converted by a foreign enzyme into an active anticancer compound directly in tumor sites. One example is D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO), a dimeric flavoenzyme able to catalyze the oxidative deamination of D-amino acids with production of hydrogen peroxide, a reactive oxygen species (ROS), able to favor cancer cells death. A DAAO variant containing five aminoacidic substitutions (mDAAO) was demonstrated to possess a better therapeutic efficacy under low O 2 concentration than wild-type DAAO (wtDAAO). Recently, aiming to design promising nanocarriers for DAAO, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to reduce their tendency to aggregation and to improve their biocompatibility. Here, wtDAAO and mDAAO were adsorbed on PEGylated MWCNTs and their activity and cytotoxicity were tested. While PEG-MWCNTs-DAAOs have shown a higher activity than pristine MWCNTs-DAAO (independently on the DAAO variant used), PEG-MWCNTs-mDAAO showed a higher cytotoxicity than PEG-MWCNTs-wtDAAO at low O 2 concentration. In order to evaluate the nanocarriers’ biocompatibility, PEG-MWCNTs-DAAOs were incubated in human serum and the composition of protein corona was investigated via nLC-MS/MS, aiming to characterize both soft and hard coronas. The mDAAO variant has influenced the bio-corona composition in both number of proteins and presence of opsonins and dysopsonins: notably, the soft corona of PEG-MWCNTs-mDAAO contained less proteins and was more enriched in proteins able to inhibit the immune response than PEG-MWCNTs-wtDAAO. Considering the obtained results, the PEGylated MWCNTs conjugated with the mDAAO variant seems a promising candidate for a selective antitumor oxidative therapy: under anoxic-like conditions, this novel drug delivery system showed a remarkable cytotoxic effect controlled by the substrate addition, against different tumor cell lines, and a bio-corona composition devoted to prolong its blood circulation time, thus improving the drug’s biodistribution.",

    "abstract": "Wastewater treatment plants produce solid and semi-solid sludge, which treatment minimises secondary environmental pollution because of wastewater treatment and obtaining new bioproducts. For this reason, in this paper, the co-pyrolysis of biogenic biomasses recovered from a biological reactor with immobilised fungal and bacterial biomass and a tertiary reactor with Chlorella sp. used for dye-contaminated wastewater treatment was carried out. Biogenic biomasses mixed with pine bark allowed the production and characterisation of two types of biochar. The raw material and biochar were on the \"in vitro\" germination of Lolium sp. seeds, followed by adsorption studies for malachite green (MG) dye using the raw material and the biochar. Results showed that using 60 mg L-1 of a cationic coagulant at pH 6.5 allowed for the recovery of more than 90% of the microalgae after 50 min of processing. Two biochar resulted: BC300, at pH 5.08 ± 0.08 and BC500, at pH 6.78 ± 0.01. The raw material and both biochars were co-inoculated with growth-promoting bacteria; their viabilities ranged from 1.7 × 106 ± 1.0 × 101 to 7.5 × 108 ± 6.0 × 102 CFU g-1 for total heterotrophic, nitrogen-fixing and phosphate-solubilising bacteria. Re-use tests on Lolium sp. seed germination showed that with the post-coagulation effluent, the germination was 100%, while with the biochar, with and without beneficial bacteria, the germination was 98 and 99%, respectively. Finally, BC500 adsorbed the highest percentage of malachite green at pH 4.0, obtaining qecal values of 0.5249 mg g-1 (R2: 0.9875) with the pseudo-second-order model.

    "abstract": "Chitinase is an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of chitin, commonly induced upon the attack of pathogens and other stresses. A cDNA (MsChi1) was isolated from Metroxylon sagu and expressed predominantly in the inflorescence tissue of M. sagu, suggesting its role in developmental processes. The chitinase cDNA was detected and isolated via differential display and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Primers specific to M. saguchitinase were used as probes to amplify the 3'-end and 5'-end regions of chitinase cDNA. Transcript analysis showed that chitinase is expressed in inflorescence and meristem tissues but was not detected in the leaf tissue. Sequence analysis of amplified cDNA fragments of 3'-end and 5'-end regions indicated that the chitinase cDNA was successfully amplified. The M. saguchitinase cDNA isolated was approximately 1,143 bp long and corresponds to 312 predicted amino acids. Alignments of nucleotide and amino acid have grouped this chitinase to family 19 class I chitinase.",

LIG1 is a crucial gene which is involved in excision repair pathways and mutations in this gene may lead to increase sensitivity towards DNA damaging agents. A total of 792 SNPs were reported to be associated with gene LIG1 in dbSNP. Different web server namely SIFT, PolyPhen, CUPSAT, FASTSNP, MAPPER and dbSMR were used to identify potentially functional SNPs in gene LIG1. SIFT, PolyPhen and CUPSAT servers predicted eleven nsSNPs to be intolerant, thirteen nsSNP to be damaging and two nsSNPs have the potential to destabilize protein structure. The nsSNP rs11666150 was predicted to be damaging by all three servers and its mutant structure showed significant increase in overall energy. FASTSNP predicted twenty SNPs to be present in splicing modifier binding sites while rSNP module from MAPPER server predicted nine SNPs to influence the binding of transcription factors. The results from the study may provide vital clues in establishing affect of polymorphism on phenotype and in elucidating drug response.",

The RGA2 was purified using simple two-step process using DEAE-Hi-Trap FF and Superdex 200 chromatography columns, with a high yield. The purity of RGA2 was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and identified by MALDI-TOF/MS. The purified protein was further characterized for its secondary structural elements using the far-UV circular dichroism measurements. Our purification procedure is simple two-step process with high yield which can be further used to produce RGA2 for structural and functional studies.",

Several proangiogenic molecules have been reported to be associated in CML progression, including the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). However, detail mechanism about the cellular distribution and function of HGF in CML is yet to be revealed. The proliferation of hematopoietic cells are regulated by some of the growth factors like interleukin 3 (IL-3), IL-6, erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, etc. In this study IL-6 pathways have been taken into consideration which induces JAK/STAT and MAPK pathways to decipher the CML progression stages. An attempt has been made to model these pathways with the help of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and estimating unknown parameters through fminsearch optimization algorithm. Some of the specific component like STAT3, of the pathway has been analyzed in detail and their role in CML progression has been elucidated. The roles of STAT3 inhibitors into the treatment of CML have been thoroughly studied and optimum concentration of the inhibitors have been predicted.",

Here, we characterize 20 Moroccan and 19 exotic bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars using 47 functional and 7 linked random DNA markers associated with 21 loci of the most important traits for wheat breeding. The functional marker analysis revealed that 35, 45, and 10 % of the Moroccan cultivars, respectively have the rust resistance genes (Lr34/Yr18/Pm38), dwarfing genes (Rht1b or Rht2b alleles) and the leaf rust resistance gene (Lr68). The marker alleles for genes Lr37/Yr17/Sr38, Sr24 and Yr36 were present only in the exotic cultivars and absent in Moroccan cultivars. 25 % of cultivars had 1BL.1RS translocation. 70 % of the wheat cultivars had Ppo-D1a and Ppo-A1b associated with low polyphenol oxidase activity. 10 % of cultivars showed presence of a random DNA marker allele (175 bp) linked to Hessian fly resistance gene H22. The majority of the Moroccan cultivars were carrying alleles that impart good bread making quality. Neighbor joining (NJ) and principal coordinate analysis based on the marker data revealed a clear differentiation between elite Moroccan and exotic wheat cultivars. The results of this study are useful for selecting suitable parents for making targeted crosses in marker-assisted wheat breeding and enhancing genetic diversity in the wheat cultivars.",

Suspension culture was initiated from 4-week-old embryogenic calli in the liquid MS medium with 1-mg/l 2,4-D and 2-mg/l picloram. Suspension culture was maintained by sub-culturing each 3 weeks into a fresh medium. At week 9 after third sub-cultures, torpedo and cotyledonary embryo stages were observed. Embryos were then developed into shoots on medium 1 mg/l of each BA and IBA. Obtained shoots were successfully rooted on 1-mg/ml GA3, 0.5-mg/ml BA, and 1-mg/ml IBA. To enhance the resistance availability in strawberry plants, elicitation was applied by adding the JA and SA elicitors to the suspension culture with two doses (0.5 and 1 mM) individually and in combination, in addition to the fungal homogenate of Macrophomina phasiolena at concentration of 106 spor/ml. The fawrky-1-Camarosa gene, which has defense-related function, was detected in the different elicited strawberry tissues and isolated via RT-PCR. The isolated gene was submitted to GenBank with accession number (KX096885).",

Therefore, explants of that age cultured on Agrobacterium minimal medium (AB) containing 100 µM acetosyringone were infected with Agrobacterium (cell titre 0.5 OD600nm) for 15 min followed by 48 h of co-cultivation on kanamycin-enriched medium (50 mg/L). Transformation of the shoots was confirmed using β-glucuronidase (GUS) histochemical assay and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). With the transformation protocol thus optimized, the transformation frequency as determined using GUS assays was 54.0 % for AKS 207 and 47.6 % for PKV Pink. The corresponding figures using PCR were 27.0 and 33.3 %. The transformed shoots required 10–14 weeks of culture initiation but produced very few roots.",

    "abstract": "Many methods have been used to isolate genomic DNA, but some of them are time-consuming and costly, especially when extracting a large number of samples. Here we described an easy protocol using two simple solutions for DNA extraction from A. tumefaciens cells. Compared with the standard protocol, this protocol allows rapid DNA isolation with comparable yield and purity at negligible cost. Following this protocol, we have demonstrated: (1) gDNA extraction was achieved within 15 min; (2) this method was cost-effective, since it only used calcium chloride and lysozyme; SDS, phenol, chloroform and proteinase K were not necessary; (3) the method gave high yield of gDNA (130 ng/loopful culture) compared with standard protocol that was suitable for restriction analysis; (4) the protocol can be carried out in a single test tube and the cells directly from solid media can be used. Thus, this protocol offers an easy, efficient and economical way to extract genomic DNA from A. tumefaciens.",

    "abstract": "T-urf13, a well-documented cms-associated gene from maize, has been shown to render methomyl sensitivity to heterologous systems like rice, yeast and bacteria when expressed constitutively. Since these transgenic plants were fertile, it was hypothesized that T-urf13 gene if expressed in anthers may result in male sterility that could be used for hybrid seed production. Hence, this work was aimed at analysing whether T-urf13 gene when expressed in anthers can result in male sterile plants or requires methomyl treatment to cause male sterility (controllable). This is the first report of transformation of tobacco with T-urf13 gene under anther-specific promoter (TA29) with or without mitochondrial targeting sequence. Most of the transgenic plants obtained were fertile; this was surprising as many male sterile plants were expected as T-urf13 gene is a cms associated gene. Our results suggest that it may not be possible to obtain male sterility by expressing URF13 in the anther by itself or by methomyl application.",

The working strain showed a pronounced optimum pH and temperature for β-xylosidase production at 6.0 and 27 °C, respectively. The enzyme production was found to remain stable for a long period of 120 h. Orange peel and sweet lime peel showed different responses in the presence of various nitrogen sources, probably due to their differences in hemicellulosic contents. This could be further confirmed by the difference in enzyme production after pretreatment with acid and alkali.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the phytochemical, antioxidant, and anticancer activities of the crude extract and its fractions of Cupaniopsis anacardioides. The results showed that total phenolic content (TPC), their secondary metabolites (flavonoids-TFC; proanthocyanidins-TPro), and antioxidant activity were significantly different between the crude extract and its fractions. The butanol fraction (F3) had the highest levels of TPC, TFC, and TPro, followed by the crude extract, aqueous fraction (F4), dichloromethyl fraction (F2), and hexane fraction (F1). High-Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis revealed 14 major bioactive compounds were identified in the C. anacardioides extract. Further analysis showed F3 fraction contained the highest levels of the major bioactive compounds, while F1 fraction had the lowest. A similar pattern was observed for antioxidant activities. The crude extract, F3 and F4 fractions were further tested for cytotoxicity against 10 cancer cell lines, including HT29 (colon); U87, SJG2 (glioblastoma); MCF-7 (Breast); A2780 (ovarian); H460 (lung); A431 (skin); Du145 (prostate); BE2-C (neuroblastoma); MIA PaCa-2 (pancreas); and one non-tumour-derived normal breast cell line (MCF10A). Except for Du145 (prostate), the crude extract, F3 and F4 fractions inhibited the cancer cell lines at 100 µg/mL, with F3 possessing greater activity against these cancer cell lines. Future studies are recommended to isolate and identify the major bioactive compounds of the F3 fraction, and further tested their impact against cancer cell lines. This could identify the potential of anticancer agents from C. anacardioides.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The goal of the research was to develop a hydrophobic octanoate salt of chitosan (CS–OA) and use the salt as a nanoparticle platform for the delivery of curcumin (CUR) into prostate cancer cells. The nanoprecipitation technique was used to prepare the nanoparticles, which were measured for particle size and encapsulation efficacy relative to CUR–CS nanoparticles. The cytotoxicity of CUR–OA–CS nanoparticles was evaluated in prostate cancerous cells (PC3 and DU145) in comparison with the corresponding blank nanoparticles and hydroalcoholic CUR solution. PXRD, SEM, and TEM were also used to examine the CUR–CS–OA nanoparticles. The average diameters of the CUR–CS–OA and CUR–CS nanoparticles were 268.90 ± 3.77 nm and 221.90 ± 2.79 nm, respectively, with encapsulation efficiencies of 61.37 ± 1.70% and 60.20 ± 3.17%. PXRD and SEM suggested CUR amorphization in the CS–OA nanoparticles. The void nanoparticles exhibited concentration-dependent antiproliferative action, which was attributed to the cellular uptake of CS. CUR loading into these nanoparticles increased their cytotoxicity even more. The potential of CS–OA nanoparticles as a special delivery system for additional cytotoxic drugs into different malignant cells can be further explored.",

    "abstract": "Cell cycle-specific cancer chemotherapy is based on the ability of a drug to halt, minimise or destroy rapidly dividing cells. However, their efficacy is limited by the emergence of a self-renewing cell pool called \"cancer stem cells\" (CSC). Choriocarcinoma is a tumour of trophoblastic tissue. We, in this study, analysed whether spheroids generated from doxorubicin-treated and non-treated choriocarcinoma cell lines exhibit markers of stem cells. Two choriocarcinoma cell lines, namely JEG-3 and BeWo, were used in this study. Spheroids were generated from doxorubicin-treated cells and the non-treated cells under non-adherent condition, followed by analysis of stem-cell markers' expression, namely NANOG, OCT4 and SOX2. Immunofluorescence analysis suggested a general increase in the markers' concentration in spheroids relative to the parental cells. RT-qPCR and immunoblots showed an increase in the stem-cell marker expression in spheroids generated from doxorubicin-treated when compared to non-treated cells. In spheroids, Sox2 was significantly upregulated in doxorubicin-treated spheroids, whereas Nanog and Oct4 were generally downregulated when compared to non-treated spheroids. Both 2D and 3D invasion assays showed that the spheroids treated with doxorubicin exhibited reduced invasion. Our data suggest that choriocarcinoma cell lines may have the potential to produce spheroidal cells, yet the drug-treatment affected the invasion potential of spheroids.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13205-022-03243-x.",

In vitro assay showed increased anti-oxidative enzyme levels indicating ROS-mediated oxidative stress by ILs. The proteomic profile and identification of differential proteins confirmed the fungal adaptations by (i) increased expression of glycolytic enzymes and ATP synthases (ii) downregulation of TCA cycle and protein synthesis machinery components (iii) expression of HSP70 and catalase/peroxidase. These changes are indicative of metabolic regulation of many important pathways and how ILs can be used to manipulate protein behavior.",

    "abstract": "The presence of acetate in the bacterial medium leads to a reduction in the growth rate of cells and recombinant protein production. In this study, three compounds including propionic acid, lithium chloride and butyric acid were added to the medium which decreased acetate levels and enhanced recombinant protein production (alpha-synuclein). In fact, propionic acid and lithium chloride are both known as acetate kinase inhibitors. The results obtained in the case of butyric acid were similar to those of the two other compounds indicating that butyric acid may act through a mechanism similar to propionic acid and lithium chloride. Consequently, it was shown that the presence of each of these supplements (5-200 μM) increased recombinant alpha-synuclein production and cell density by approximately 10-15 %. HPLC analysis showed that the levels of acetate in the media containing the supplements were considerably less than those of the control. Furthermore, pH values remained almost constant in the supplemented cultures. Growing the bacteria at lower temperatures (25 °C) indicated that the positive effects of these supplements were not as effective as at higher temperatures (37 °C), presumably due to the adequate balance between oxygen and carbon consumption. This study can confirm the viewpoint regarding the harmful effects of acetate on the recombinant protein production and cell density. Besides, such methods represent easy and complementary ways to increase target recombinant protein production without negatively affecting host cell density, and requiring complex genetic manipulation.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella species are important foodborne pathogens that can cause illness and death in humans. The objective of this study was to determine the genetic relatedness of 115 Salmonella strains isolated from ducks and their environment using random amplified polymorphic deoxyribonucleic acid (RAPD). The analysis of Salmonella strains by RAPD produced DNA fingerprints of different sizes for differentiation purposes, and cluster analysis at a coefficient of 0.85 grouped the Salmonella strains into various clusters and singletons. S. Typhimurium were grouped into nine clusters and ten singletons, S. Hadar were grouped into seven clusters and nine singletons, S. Enteritidis were grouped into four clusters and five singletons, S. Braenderup were grouped into five clusters and four singletons, S. Albany were grouped into two clusters and seven singletons, and S. Derby were grouped into two clusters and four singletons at a coefficient of 0.85 with discriminatory index (D) ranging from 0.879 to 0.957. With the exception of S. Typhimurium strains which were grouped into three major groups (genotypes) by RAPD analysis, the rest were grouped into two major genotypes. RAPD was a useful genotyping tool for determining the genetic relatedness of the duck Salmonella strains. Comparison of the genetic relatedness among foodborne pathogens and their sources of isolation are important to trace their source and possibly the source of human infection.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale expression of biopharmaceutical proteins in cellular hosts results in production of large insoluble mass aggregates. In order to generate functional product, these aggregates require further processing through refolding with denaturant, a process in itself that can result in aggregation. Using a model folding protein, cytochrome C, we show how an increase in final denaturant concentration decreases the propensity of the protein to aggregate during refolding. Using polarised fluorescence anisotropy, we show how reduced levels of aggregation can be achieved by increasing the period of time the protein remains flexible during refolding, mediated through dilution ratios. This highlights the relationship between the flexibility of a protein and its propensity to aggregate. We attribute this behaviour to the preferential urea-residue interaction, over self-association between molecules.",

    "abstract": "Random mutagenesis with N-methyl-N′ nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (NTG) was used to mutate Aspergillus oryzae RP-21 to develop high gluconic acid-producing mutants. Forty mutant colonies (designated as A. oryzae strains RP-NTG-01 to RP-NTG-40) screened for gluconic acid, glucose dehydrogenase and glucose oxidase production using a 12-well plate method showed that 17 strains (positive mutants) produced high concentrations of these three products, whereas 12 strains (negative mutants) showed low concentrations and the remaining 11 strains (non-mutants) did not produce any of the three products. Detailed studies of A. oryzae RP-NTG-12, a positive mutant, produced gluconic acid of up to 72 g/L in batch fermentation, which was a 2.4-fold increase in yield to that of the strain and as expected it also possessed higher activities of cell-bound glucose dehydrogenase and glucose oxidase, key enzymes of the multi-functional gluconic acid synthesis pathway. We discuss changes in the cell-bound enzyme activities of the mutants and the wild type and speculate on a mechanism for this increase. The mutant strain, A. oryzae RP-NTG-12, and the random mutagenesis method used to increase bioproducts have a good potential for developing fermentation processes to an industrial scale as demonstrated by this study.",

    "abstract": "The well-known secondary metabolite-producing bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor is a natural choice for the development of super-hosts optimized for the heterologous expression of antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). In this study, we used S. coelicolor M145 and its derivative strain M1146 where all active BGCs have been deleted and generated high-resolution quantitative time series metabolite profiles under two cultivation conditions (phosphate and nitrogen limitation to cease growth and trigger secondary metabolism). Five targeted LC-MS/MS-based methods were used to quantify intracellular primary metabolites covering phosphorylated metabolites, amino acids, organic acids, (deoxy) nucleoside/sugar phosphates, Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), and Coenzyme A (CoA). The nitrogen limitation resulted in a sharp decline in respiration and an immediate drop in the cell mass concentration. Intracellularly, a reduction in the level of the metabolites next to α-ketoglutarate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and a decrease in the NADH pool were among the most prominent adaptation to this nutrient limitation. Phosphate limitation evoked a different adaptation of the metabolite pools as most of the phosphorylated metabolite pools except 6-phosphogluconic acid (6PG) pool were downregulated. 13C-isotope-labeling experiments revealed the simultaneous activity of both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis during the co-utilization of glucose and glutamate. The S. coelicolor M1146 strain had similar time-series metabolite profile dynamics as the parent M145 strain, except for a visibly increased 6PG pool in the stationary phase. In general, the nutrient limitation had a larger effect on the metabolite pool levels than the absence of secondary metabolite production in M1146. This study provides new insight into the primary carbon metabolism and its link to the secondary metabolism which is needed for further optimization of both super-host genotype and cultivation conditions.

    "abstract": "The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) prompted number of computational and laboratory efforts to discover molecules against the virus entry or replication. Simultaneously, due to the availability of clinical information, drug-repurposing efforts led to the discovery of 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) for treating COVID-19 infection. 2-DG critically accumulates in the infected cells to prevent energy production and viral replication. As there is no clarity on the impact of genetic variations on the efficacy and adverse effects of 2-DG in treating COVID-19 using in silico approaches, we attempted to extract the genes associated with the 2-DG pathway using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database. The interaction between selected genes was assessed using ClueGO, to identify the susceptible gene loci for SARS-CoV infections. Further, SNPs that were residing in the distinct genomic regions were retrieved from the Ensembl genome browser and characterized. A total of 80 SNPs were retrieved using diverse bioinformatics resources after assessing their (a) detrimental influence on the protein stability using Swiss-model, (b) miRNA regulation employing miRNASNP3, PolymiRTS, MirSNP databases, (c) binding of transcription factors by SNP2TFBS, SNPInspector, and (d) enhancers regulation using EnhancerDB and HaploReg reported A2M rs201769751, PARP1 rs193238922 destabilizes protein, six polymorphisms of XIAP effecting microRNA binding sites, EGFR rs712829 generates 15 TFBS, BECN1 rs60221525, CASP9 rs4645980, SLC2A2 rs5393 impairs 14 TFBS, STK11 rs3795063 altered 19 regulatory motifs. These data may provide the relationship between genetic variations and drug effects of 2-DG which may further assist in assigning the right individuals to benefit from the treatment.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13205-022-03363-4.",

Maximum amount of 254.6 ± 9.34 mg/kg of p-hydroxybenzoic acid was detected in the solid medium of corncob on 4th day of incubation using 10 mM p-coumaric acid as a sole carbon source. Consequently, P. variotii can be used as candidate fungi for the production of p-hydroxybenzoic acid. Solid wastes can be managed by using them for biotransformation of pharmaceutically important phenolic acids and hence cut down the cost of production of value-added compounds using a low-cost medium.",

    "abstract": "Antithrombin (AT) is a glycoprotein that inactivates the several physiological target enzymes of coagulation system. The effect of purification strategies plays a crucial role in getting maximum recovery of yield, purity and biological activity of recombinant human antithrombin (rhAT). In the present work, the task of purifying rhAT from Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741 has been carried out using two different approaches such as cross flow filtration (CFF) system and chromatography methods. In the first approach, the protein was concentrated and partially purified through CFF to achieve maximum recovery yield and purity of 87 and 94 %, respectively. In the second approach, purification involved a single step chromatography with various types of ion exchange and size exclusion resins to analyze the maximum rhAT recovery yield and purity. From the experimental results, it has been observed that the size exclusion chromatography (SEC) technique with Superose 12 matrix was suitable for the purification of rhAT and achieved the maximum recovery yield and purity of 51 and 97 %, respectively. Further, to acquire a high recovery yield and purity of rhAT, the effect of various chromatographic conditions such as mobile phase, mobile phase pH, flow rate, sample volume and sample concentration were also investigated. Under the optimal chromatographic conditions, rhAT was significantly recovered and purified in a single step with maximum recovery yield, purity and biological activity of 67, 99 % and 410 IU/L, respectively. Based on these investigations, it was concluded that SEC with Superose 12 matrix was a more suitable and a potential method for the purification of rhAT.",

The recombinant plasmid designated as pQ PE was transformed into E. coli M15 cells and induced with IPTG revealed the high level expression of 11.9 kDa His-fusion protein as estimated by migration in 15 % sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Recombinant PE protein was purified by Ni–NTA agarose chromatography. Polyclonal antibodies raised against purified recombinant PE protein reacted with expressed PE protein as well as with Map sonicate. The recombinant PE protein was also recognized by serum from goat with clinical paratuberculosis.

    "abstract": "Abstract The genomes of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium bacteriophages were analysed for gene shuffling in the lytic cassettes of bacteriophages infecting. It was found that enterococcal bacteriophages could be classified into well-defined groups based on the size of their genomes and each size group had its own conserved gene composition of lytic cassettes. Enterococcal bacteriophages use a relatively broad spectrum of holins and endolysins with variable cell-wall binding (CWB) and catalytic domains, and most of them utilise a lytic cassette with more than two genes. Enterococcal bacteriophages most commonly use endolysins with amidase catalytic domains and the CWB domain SH3_5. Some bacteriophages possess in their lytic cassette a holin-like gene with the XhlA domain protein, characteristic of hemolysin. Regardless of the shuffling of genes encoding holins and endolysins in lytic modules, a novel example of CWB domain shuffling within enterococcal endolysins was identified.",

From molecular phylogenetics, we found that DR5 and DR4, TNFR1 and DR3 and TNFR1 and DR3 had the same point of origin. Alternatively, Fas was found to be distant from the rest of the death receptors. A network map was developed to explain these proteins are not only interlinked among themselves, but also interlinked with several other proteins.

Identification of the motifs from the promoter region of the genes is an important and unsolved problem specifically in the eukaryotic genomes. In this paper, we present a niched Pareto genetic algorithm to identify the regulatory motifs. This approach is based on the maximization of two objectives of the problem that is the motif length and the consensus similarity score. A long motif means it is less likely to be a false motif. The similarity score represents a motifs probability of conservation in a given set of sequences. Proposed method can find multiple, variable length motifs. In this method, we represented a candidate motif as a combination of length and starting position of the motif in each sequence of the co-regulated genes. This enables the algorithm to identify multiple motifs of variable length. We applied this approach on various data sets and the results show that it can find multiple motifs of variable length in co-regulated genes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract ncgl2478 gene from Corynebacterium glutamicum encodes a thiol–disulfide oxidoreductase enzyme annotated as dithiol–disulfide isomerase DsbA. It preserves a Cys–Pro–Phe–Cys active-site motif, which is presumed to be an exclusive characteristic of the novel DsbA–mycoredoxin 1 (Mrx1) cluster. However, the real mode of action, the nature of the electron donor pathway and biological functions of NCgl2478 in C. glutamicum have remained enigmatic so far. Herein, we report that NCgl2478 plays an important role in stress resistance. Deletion of the ncgl2478 gene increases the size of growth inhibition zones. The ncgl2478 expression is induced in the stress-responsive extra-cytoplasmic function-sigma (ECF-σ) factor SigH-dependent manner by stress. It receives electrons preferentially from the mycothiol (MSH)/mycothione reductase (Mtr)/NADPH pathway. Further, NCgl2478 reduces S -mycothiolated mixed disulfides and intramolecular disulfides via a monothiol–disulfide and a dithiol–disulfide exchange mechanism, respectively. NCgl2478 lacks oxidase activity; kinetic properties of its demycothiolation are different from those of Mrx1. Site-directed mutagenesis confirms Cys24 is the resolving Cys residue, while Cys21 is the nucleophilic cysteine that is oxidized to a sulfenic acid and then forms an intramolecular disulfide bond with Cys24 or a mixed disulfide with MSH under oxidative stress. In conclusion, our study presents the first evidence that NCgl2478 protects against various stresses by acting as an MSH-dependent thiol–disulfide reductase, belonging to a novel DsbA–Mrx1 cluster.",

Protein spots were digested with trypsin for MALDI-TOF-MS analysis; protein sequences were obtained from MASCOT search. Sequences were aligned with template using Swiss Model server. Phyre-2 was used to predict homology modeling, RasMol was used to analyze the modeling structures, PSVS server was utilized to validate the protein structure by Ramachandran's plot analysis, physical and chemical properties were analyzed using ProtParam server, Phylogenetic tree was constructed by Mega4. UniProt search helps to find protein functional information of differentially expressed proteins, involved in catalytic activities, regulation mechanisms, DNA damage stimulus, anti-termination and termination process, protein binding, electron transport mechanism, and cell signaling process functions.

The control of the Johne's disease is hampered by lack of specific diagnostic tests. In this study, we have cloned and expressed the N-terminal region of the locus tag Map 1637c encoding 20.8-kDa (r20.8) protein of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis. The recombinant protein r20.8 was expressed in high levels in Escherichia coli. The protein r20.8 was purified by single-step chromatography using Ni-NTA agarose. The protein r20.8 was reacted with anti-r20.8 antibodies as well as cattle sera infected with Map on Western blot. ELISA using well-characterized sera (both positive and negative; n = 60 each) Map-infected and non-infected cattle, respectively, yielded a sensitivity of 73.3% and a specificity of 98.3%. The 20.8 kDa protein expressed in the present study will prove useful as reagent in diagnostic test.",

Androgen receptor inhibitors revealed several adverse events as decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory dysfunction, and gynecomastia. Hence, the emergence of complementary and alternative medications having safety profile-preferably, edible natural products-would be highly desirable. In-silico studies based on Maestro Molecular Modelling platform (version 10.5) by Schrӧdinger, LLC was used to identify the lead molecules. The in-vivo activity studied on rats gave the positive results. The findings based on experiments as antioxidant parameters showed the potential to quench the free radicals. The significant results were also seen in prostatic index and histopathological studies supported the above findings. Based on these data, sesamol and derivative have proven efficacy in protecting against testosterone induced BPH.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13205-021-02952-z.",

    "abstract": "In 2019, 229 million cases of malaria were recorded worldwide. For epidemiologic surveillance and proper treatment of persons infected with Plasmodium spp., rapid detection of infections by Plasmodium spp. is critical. Thus, Plasmodium spp. diagnosis is one of the indispensable measures for malaria control. Although microscopy is the gold standard for diagnosis, it has restrictions related mainly to the lack of qualified human resources, which is a problem in many regions. Thus, this review presents major innovations in diagnostic methods as alternatives to or complementary to microscopy. Detection platforms in lateral flow systems, electrochemical immunosensors, molecular biology and, more recently, those integrated with smartphones, are highlighted, among others. The advanced improvement of these tests aims to provide techniques that are sensitive and specific, but also quick, easy to handle and free from the laboratory environment. In this way, the tracking of malaria cases can become increasingly effective and contribute to controlling the disease.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this clinical research was to determine the relationship between carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), cardiovascular risk factors, and neuro-cognitive function in people living with HIV (PLHIV) and were on stable combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART). This is a cross-sectional study performed at a single center, including 149 patients who visited the anti-retroviral therapy center of our tertiary care hospital. Among the PLHIV of our research, 62.4% had at least one associated cardiovascular risk factor, and 61.1% of them had abnormally high cIMT (≥ 0.9 mm on any one side, p = 0.035). These factors and being the male gender (p = 0.028) were associated with a greater Framingham 10-year risk percentage. Hypercholesterolemia was observed in 30.9% of the PLHIV and a higher body mass index (≥ 25 kg/m2) was found in 26.8% of them. The cognitive impairment was milder in 71.8% of cases and moderate in 9.4% of PLHIV. The Chi-square test revealed that a higher proportion of participants who had lower HDL-C levels (p = 0.045), smokers (p = 0.029), systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg (p = 0.012), and lower educational status (p = 0.017) had a poorer cognitive performance. In our sample population, a higher prevalence of elevated cIMT, cardiovascular risk factors, and mild and moderate cognitive deficiency was observed in PLHIV, who were on stable cART. However, routine assessment of the neuropsychological functions and management of modifiable risk factors are not performed in our patients. Further exploration of the relationship between cardiovascular risks, cIMT, and cognitive impairment in PLHIV is essential to formulate the guidelines and delay the onset of neurocognitive disorders in these patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cases of diabetes are significantly increasing year by year, attracting the attention of medical professionals and researchers to focus on diabetes and its underlying complications. One among such are diabetic wounds which are difficult to heal, creating severe implications in the day-to-day chores of not only patients, but also family members. Dehydrozingerone (DHZ) is known to possess various effects like anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, antioxidant, and wound-healing properties. The effect of DHZ on different phases of diabetic wound healing remains untested. Hence, this study was proposed to find out the effect of oral and topical formulation of DHZ on day 5, 10 and 15 of diabetic wound healing. Excisional wounds were created on the dorsal side of animals using punch biopsy to mimic human diabetic wounds. Topical DHZ gel (100 mg in 1 gm of gel) was prepared using 1% Carbopol 934 and was applied twice a day. The treated groups had increased percentage of wound closure; western blotting suggested that DHZ significantly increased ERK and JNK levels and decreased TNF and MMP 2 and 9 levels. From histopathological studies, it was observed that angiogenesis, collagen formation, granulation tissue formation, and fibroblast proliferation were improved on days 5, 10, and 15 of diabetic wound healing. These findings indicate that DHZ (both systemic and topical) are effective during the early phases of wound healing which gets impaired in diabetic wounds. Dehydrozingerone accelerated diabetic wound healing by regulating the various hallmarks of wound healing process.",

S. ostrea was more efficient than P. chrysosporium in decoloration process. Different parameters pH, temperature, sources of carbon and nitrogen, stationary and shaking conditions were optimized for bleaching of dye by the fungal cultures. Optimal growth conditions for decoloration of dye by both cultures were pH 5.0, temperature 35 °C, glucose and fructose as best carbon source at 1 % level, peptone and urea as best nitrogen source and shaking conditions (150 rpm). Culture broth free of colour (99 % of decoloration) was achieved with S. ostrea as against 70 % decoloration by P. chrysosporium on 6th day of incubation. Adsorption of dye to fungal biomass as reflected by colour coating on biomass and participation of lignolytic enzymes in colour removal appeared to be mechanisms involved in decoloration process. The ability of both fungal cultures in removal of colour in effluents with dyes collected from silk saree-weaving cottage unit was tested. S. ostrea was also found to be more effective in colour removal from effluent. S. ostrea appears to be a promising culture for application of bioremediation in decoloration of dyes.",

UpCoT generates orthologs for each gene in target genome using bi-directional best blast hit against the reference genomes, then identifies potential orthologous transcriptional units using intergenic distance. Finally it generates the FASTA files containing upstream sequences of orthologous transcriptional units of each gene in target genome. The inputs of UpCoT are protein sequence files (*.faa), genome sequence files (*.fna) and gene co-ordinate files (*.ptt) for target and reference genomes. The clustered-upstream DNA sequences can be used by motif prediction tool, such as MEME, Bio-prospector, Gibbs motif sampler, MDscan for prediction of conserved DNA elements. We tested the performance of UpCoT by selecting the genome of Synechocystis sp PCC 6803 as the target and 13 different cyanobacterial genomes as reference. The clustered upstream sequences generated by UpCoT of groES, ycf24 and nirA were used for cis-regulatory element prediction. The results were consistent with the experimentally identified cis-regulatory elements. Therefore, UpCoT is a reliable and automated pipeline package for prediction of orthologs, orthologous transcriptional units, and orthologous upstream sequences of a selected prokaryotic genome. UpCoT can be downloaded from http://jssplab.uohyd.ac.in/upcot/ .",

The present study was undertaken to construct an estrogen-inducible system for expression of Cdc5-TAP to isolate the substrates of Cdc5 during meiosis, particularly, pachytene stage of meiosis I. Two yeast strains were constructed CDC5-IN (ndt80∆ pGAL1-CDC5-TAP) and Cdc5-kinase inactive mutant (ndt80∆ pGAL1-cdc5-N209A-TAP). The estrogen-inducible expression of Cdc5-TAP and cdc5-N209A-TAP was validated by Western analysis. The systems would serve as a valuable tool for purification of substrates binding to Cdc5-TAP by TAP affinity chromatography.",

    "abstract": "Accurate genome annotations in databases are a critical resource available to the scientific community for analysis and research. Inaccurate and inconsistent annotations exist as a result of errors generated from mass automated annotation, and currently act as a barrier to the application of bioinformatics. The purpose of this effort was to improve the SEED by improving the connection of functional roles to literature references. Direct literature references (DLits), found through searches of PubMed and other online databases such as SwissProt, were attached to protein sequences within the PubSEED to provide literature support for the roughly 2,500 distinct functional roles used to construct metabolic models within the Model SEED. Only DLits in which a researcher asserted the function of a protein were attached to sequences. Starting from a list of 1,072 functional roles that did not previously have DLit support, we were able to connect sequences to literature for 655 functional roles, at least 484 of which were in the original list of unsupported roles. When added to the existing set of sequences having DLits, the resulting set of DLit-sequence pairs (the foundation set) now connects approximately 4,300 DLits to approximately 5,600 distinct protein sequences obtained from approximately 16,000 genes (some of these genes have identical protein sequences). From the foundation set, we construct projection sets such that each set contains one member of the foundation set and projections of its functional role onto similar genes. The projection sets revealed 120 inconsistent annotations within the SEED. Two types of inconsistencies were corrected through manual annotation in the PubSEED: instances in which two identical protein sequences had been annotated with different functions, and instances when projected functions contradicted previous annotations. 26,785 changes to gene function assignment, 219 of which were to previously uncharacterized proteins, resulted in a more consistent and accurate set of input data from which to construct revised metabolic models within the Model SEED.",

In order to probe this interaction on cells, the current study attempts towards expressing 15N-labeled GIP using classical molecular biology tools. We have developed a methodology to obtain GIP devoid of extra amino acid(s); a prerequisite to the intended interaction study. The synthetic GIP cDNA with a Factor Xa protease site at the N-terminus of GIP was inserted in the vector pET32a(+); the fusion protein thus expressed was eventually cleaved to obtain GIP. After successful Factor Xa cleavage, the cleaved GIP was confirmed by western blot. Subsequently, the (15N)GIP was obtained using the aforementioned procedure and confirmed by MALDI-TOF.",

    "abstract": "The exorbitant yield loss incurred by Indian farmers every year (10-90%) in rapeseed-mustard (Brassica juncea) is chiefly attributed to the progressive infestation of mustard fields by Lipaphis erysimi (Kalt.), a major insect pest belonging to the family of Homoptera. Currently there are no successful tolerant cultivars developed by conventional means in Brassica juncea with systemic plant responses in the form of direct or indirect defenses against aphid attack. Lack of specific methods for screening large numbers of genotypes required in breeding for selection of tolerant cultivars in mustard is one of the main causes of slow progress in developing resistant varieties of Brassica juncea. Traditional phenotype-based breeding has to be augmented with recent molecular approaches for potential genotype selection and cultivar development in Brassica juncea. In current study a pathogen-responsive gene panel was developed which could be used for expression-assisted breeding program in mustard for selection of tolerant types against aphid infestation, minimizing the huge crop losses suffered by farmers every year.",

    "abstract": "Over the last two decades, an impressive progress has been made in the identification of novel factors in the translocation machineries of the mitochondrial protein import and their possible roles. The role of lipids and possible protein–lipids interactions remains a relatively unexplored territory. Investigating the role of potential lipid-binding regions in the sub-units of the mitochondrial motor might help to shed some more light in our understanding of protein–lipid interactions mechanistically. Bioinformatics results seem to indicate multiple potential lipid-binding regions in each of the sub-units. The subsequent characterization of some of those regions in silico provides insight into the mechanistic functioning of this intriguing and essential part of the protein translocation machinery. Details about the way the regions interact with phospholipids were found by the use of Monte Carlo simulations. For example, Pam18 contains one possible transmembrane region and two tilted surface bound conformations upon interaction with phospholipids. The results demonstrate that the presented bioinformatics approach might be useful in an attempt to expand the knowledge of the possible role of protein–lipid interactions in the mitochondrial protein translocation process.",

A partial genomic DNA fragment encoding HMGR conserved domain (denoted as AbHMGR) is isolated from Aconitum balfourii Stapf. It comprises 871 bp encoding 290 amino acids. In silico analysis reveals that it had extensive similarities to other plant HMGR gene. Domain analysis of AbHMGR showed two highly conserved NADPH and HMG CoA domains. Docking study predicted inhibitor, substrate and cofactor binding sites in the protein. Expression analysis revealed that AbHMGR is similarly expressed in all tested tissues with differential pattern. The highest expression was found in leaf tissue. However, fold expression in root and shoot tissue was almost similar. Enzyme activity of HMGR was found to be much higher in leaf tissue as compared to other tissues. The highest aconitine content (0.015 %) was obtained in root tissues. Our data laid a foundation for further investigation of HMGR role in Aconitum balfourii.",

Results from our previous study showed an alteration of various metabolomic parameters, indirectly resulting in an observable decline of growth in the mung seedlings upon incubation with phenol, toluene, xylene, and hexane. This study evaluates the role of these compounds upon plant growth and focusses to mitigate the effect of the same, using some isolated plant synergistic bacteria. We isolated Proteus sp., Streptococcus sp., and Enterococcus sp., and tested the synergism of them in mung seedlings (Vigna radiata) by hydroponics. Treatment with the above-mentioned compounds significantly reduced the root and shoot length of the seedlings when compared to the control. The bacterial treatment helped in reducing the adversity due to the xenobiotic insult, by improving the root shoot length of the treated seedlings. Proteus sp. was found to be the most promising among other isolates. In another experiment, plasmid profiling of the bacterial isolates was done, yielding a band of 4.5 kb common for all, serving as a clue to be the most probable plasmid responsible for the degradation of the compounds. Results from this study clearly indicate that Proteus sp. can be explored further for its plant synergism and xenobiotic degradative capability to exploit its potential in oil spillage land reclamation and establishing vegetation.",

In spite of this, there is no sequence information regarding this plant in literature. To provide understanding of the naturally occurring tea and drug-specific products and the key pathways for the biosynthesis of these molecules, we sequenced the leaf transcriptome using Illumina MiSeq platform and generated 2,590,652 paired-end reads that were assembled de novo into 45,450 high-quality transcripts. Annotation of these transcripts revealed best hits for homology to discover more than 17,800 functional genes and conserved domains. A total of 93 KEGG pathways and associated genes encoded by more than 90% of the coding transcripts are responsible for the biosynthesis of these life-saving metabolites. We validated and enriched the genes by GO annotation and linked this to enzyme-powered pathways through interactive network map. Caffeine metabolism, flavonoid, phenylpropanoid and terpenoids biosynthesis and xenobiotics degradation were typical in tea quality and drug therapy. The relatedness of more than 80 gene families encoding key enzymes was shown using unrooted phylogenetic tree. In conclusion, the M. burkeana leaf transcriptome gives insight into tea and drug-specific products, therefore representing basis in further investigation of the plant.",

To elucidate the complexity of alternative splicing present in the HC, high-throughput sequencing and analysis of HC and matching horn normal (HN) tissue were carried out. A total of 535,067 and 849,077 reads were analysed after stringent quality filtering for HN and HC, respectively. Cufflinks pipeline for transcriptome analysis revealed 4786 novel splice isoforms comprising 2432 exclusively in HC, 2055 exclusively in HN and 298 in both the conditions. Based on pathway clustering and in silico verification, 102 novel splice isoforms were selected and further analysed with respect to change in protein sequence using Blastp. Finally, fourteen novel splicing events supported both by Cufflinks and UCSC genome browser were selected and confirmed expression by RT-qPCR. Future studies targeted at in-depth characterization of these potential candidate splice isoforms might be helpful in the development of relevant biomarkers for early diagnosis of HC. The results reported in this study refine the available information on transcriptome repertoire of bovine species and boost the research in the line of development of relevant biomarkers for early diagnosis of HC.",

    "abstract": "MADS-box genes are a large family of transcription factors initially discovered for their role during development of flowers and fruits. The MADS-box transcription factors from animals have been studied by X-ray protein crystallography but those from plants remain to be studied. In this work, a MADS-box cDNA from mango encoding a protein of 254 residues was obtained and compared. Based on phylogenetic analysis, it is proposed that the MADS-box transcription factor expressed in mango fruit (MiMADS1) belongs to the SEP clade of MADS-box proteins. MiMADS1 mRNA steady-state levels did not changed during mango fruit development and were up-regulated, when mango fruits reached physiological maturity as assessed by qRT-PCR. Thus, MiMADS1 could have a role during development and ripening of this fruit. The theoretical structural model of MiMADS1 showed the DNA-binding domain folding bound to a double-stranded DNA. Therefore, MiMADS1 is an interesting model for understanding DNA-binding for transcriptional regulation.",

    "abstract": "The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been established now to be a deadly disease afflicting the whole world with worst consequences on healthcare, economy and day-to-day life activities. Being a communicable disease, which is highly pathogenic in humans, causing cough, throat infection, breathing problems, high fever, muscle pain, and may lead to death in some cases especially those having other comorbid conditions such as heart or kidney problems, and diabetes. Finding an appropriate drug and vaccine candidate against coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remains an ultimate and immediate goal for the global scientific community. Based on previous studies in the literature on SARS-CoV infection, there are a number of drugs that may inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and its infection. Such drugs comprise of inhibitors of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2), nonstructural protein 3C-like protease, nonstructural RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and many more. The antiviral drugs such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir and ritonavir as inhibitors for HIV protease, nucleotide analogue remdesivir, and broad-spectrum antiviral drugs are available to treat the SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Therefore, this review article is planned to gain insight into the mechanism for blocking the entry of SARS-CoV-2, its validation, other inhibition mechanisms, and development of therapeutic drugs and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Increasing evidence suggests a sizable involvement of hemotoxins in the morbidity associated with envenomation by the Indian spectacled cobra, Naja naja (N.N). This study investigates the ability of Indian polyvalent anti-snake venom (ASV), methanolic extract of Andrographis paniculata (MAP) and their combination in reversing the hemostatic abnormalities, viz. activated partial thromboplastin time(aPTT), prothrombin time(PT) and thrombin time(TT) in citrated plasma. These parameters were assessed in 2 groups of experiments. Group 1: Without the prior incubation of plasma with venom and Group 2: With prior incubation of plasma with venom for 90 min at 37°C. Venom caused significant ( p &lt; 0.001) prolongation in aPTT (175%), PT (49%) and TT (34%) in Group 1 and ASV could completely bring them back to normal. MAP showed a concentration-dependent reversal in aPTT, normalization of PT and prolongation of TT. When low concentration of ASV was supplemented with MAP, their combined effect in normalizing aPTT and PT improved by 37% and 26% respectively when compared to ASV alone. In Group 2, venom caused significant ( p &lt; 0.001) prolongation in aPTT (231%), PT (312%) and TT (245%). ASV had limited effect in reversing aPTT (52%), TT (31%) but completely normalized PT. MAP was marginally effective in reversing the prolonged aPTT and PT but caused further prolongation of TT. Combination of ASV and MAP was more effective than ASV alone in reversing venom-induced increase in aPTT (52%) and PT (29%). The study proved that, a drastic reduction of ASV by 70%, could be effectively supplemented by MAP in combating hemostatic abnormalities induced by NN venom.",

Hence, there is a need to establish a reliable, cost-effective, and robust molecular biomarker to distinguish among species and identify herbal plants and raw drugs from adulterants. The present study used suppressive subtractive hybridization and next-generation sequencing technology to identify novel DNA markers for Boerhavia diffusa L. and Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Miers . We identified two primer sets for B. diffusa and one for T. cordifolia. The DNA markers were validated in different accessions of B. diffusa and T. cordifolia and their common adulterants to determine the sensitivity and specificity of developed DNA markers. The designed DNA markers showed 100% sensitivity and specificity in detecting B. diffusa and T. cordifolia from their adulterants. The strategy described here can be extrapolated for developing DNA markers to authenticate other plant species.",

In this review, we identified 40 publicly available transcriptomic datasets related to parasite factors linked with sexual stage transmission, from which we analyzed two RNA-Seq datasets to identify potential genes crucial for the transmission of P. falciparum from humans to mosquito vectors. Differential expression analysis revealed 3500 (2489 upregulated and 1011 downregulated) common genes differentially expressed throughout sexual stage development of P. falciparum occurring in both humans (gametocyte stage II, V) and mosquitoes (ookinete). Among which 1283 (914 upregulated and 369 downregulated) and 826 (719 upregulated and 107 downregulated) genes were specific to female and male gametocytes, respectively. Also, 830 potential transition associated genes were identified that may be involved in the adaptation and survival of the parasite in between human and mosquito stages. Additionally, we reviewed the functional aspects of important genes highly expressed throughout the sexual stage pathway and evaluated their suitability as vaccine candidates. The review provides researchers with insight into the importance of publicly available transcriptomic datasets for identifying critical and novel gametocyte markers that may aid in the development of rational transmission blocking strategies.",

    "abstract": "A new expression cassette (EC0) consisting of the fused 5' and 3' intergenic regions (IGRs) of the Eremothecium cymbalariae translational elongation factor 1α (EcTEF1) gene was evaluated through expression of the bacterial hygromycin B phosphotransferase (hph) resistance gene in the common baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Progressively shorter versions of the hph-containing EC cassette (hphEC1 though hphEC6) with trimmed 5' and 3' EcTEF1 IGRs were tested for their ability to confer resistance to hygromycin B in S. cerevisiae. Hygromycin B resistance was retained in all six generated hphEC variants up to a concentration of 400 mg/L. The hphEC6 cassette was the shortest cassette to be assayed in this study with 366 and 155 bp of the EcTEF1 5' and 3' IGRs, respectively. When tested for deletion of the S. cerevisiae proline oxidase gene PUT1, the hphEC6 cassette was shown to successfully act as a selection marker on hygromycin B-containing medium. The hphEC6 cassette could be placed immediately adjacent to a kanMX4 G418 disulfate resistance marker without any discernable effect on the ability of the yeast to grow in the presence of both hygromycin B and G418 disulfate. Co-cultivation experiments under non-selective conditions demonstrated that a PUT1 deletion strain carrying the hphEC6 cassette displayed equivalent fitness to an otherwise isogenic PUT1 deletion strain carrying the kanMX4 cassette.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Proteins of the macroglobulin family are prime targets of venom enzymes in snake bite. A massive reduction in the active concentration of these multifunctional proteins in snake bite, makes the living system vulnerable to dysregulation. This study investigates the ability of Indian polyvalent anti-snake venom (ASV), methanolic extract of Andrographis paniculata (MAP) and their combination in rescuing human alpha 2-macroglobulin (A2MG) and its homologues in rat plasma, from inactivation by Naja naja (N.N) venom enzymes. In-vitro experiments were conducted with heparinized human plasma and in-vivo experiments with female Wistar rats. Along with appropriate controls, there were 3 test groups in in-vitro and 8 test groups in in-vivo experiments. The in-vitro test groups were exposed to N.N venom for zero, 30 or 90 min prior to incubation with ASV or MAP or reduced ASV supplemented with MAP and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. Chymotrypsin-bound esterase (CTBE) activity of A2MG was estimated. Rats were administered the venom intramuscularly and treated with ASV/MAP/ASV + MAP. CTBE activity of macroglobulin homologues was measured on day 1, 7 and 14. Survival of animals was noted. In human plasma, addition of ASV or MAP or ASV + MAP prevented loss of A2MG activity maximally to the extent of 88–100% ( p = 0.001). In rats, reduced concentration of ASV supplemented with MAP showed complete rescue of macroglobulin homologues and 90% survival. The compulsive evidence from this study, underscores the merits of using this multipronged strategy in rescuing the macroglobulins and improving survival in envenomation due to N.N.",
