In particular we show that any finite harmonic morphism of (non-augmented) metric graphs lifts. We also give various applications of these results. For example, we show that linear equivalence of divisors on a tropical curve C coincides with the equivalence relation generated by declaring that the fibers of every finite harmonic morphism from C to the tropical projective line are equivalent. We study liftability of metrized complexes equipped with a finite group action, and use this to classify all augmented metric graphs arising as the tropicalization of a hyperelliptic curve. We prove that there exists a d-gonal tropical curve that does not lift to a d-gonal algebraic curve. This article is the second in a series of two.",

To do this, we show that the Steinberg algebra of the skew product is graded isomorphic to a natural generalisation of the the Cohen-Montgomery smash product of the Steinberg algebra of the underlying groupoid with the grading group. In the second part of the paper, we study the minimal (that is, irreducible) representations in the category of graded modules of a Steinberg algebra, and establish a connection between the annihilator ideals of these minimal representations, and effectiveness of the groupoid.

Introduction.The purpose of this paper is twofold: on the one hand we show that techniques inspired by Kollár and Viehweg's study of weak positivity, combined with vanishing theorems for log-canonical pairs, lead to new consequences regarding generation and vanishing properties for direct images of pluricanonical bundles.On the other hand, we formulate the strongest such results as Fujita conjecture-type statements, which are then shown to govern a range of fundamental properties of direct images of pluricanonical and pluriadjoint line bundles, like effective vanishing theorems, weak positivity, or generic vanishing.Vanishing, regularity, and Fujita-type statements.All varieties we consider in this paper are defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero.Recall to begin with the following celebrated conjecture.Conjecture 1.1 (Fujita).If X is a smooth projective variety of dimension n, and L is an ample line bundle on X, then ω X ⊗ L ⊗l is globally generated for l ≥ n + 1.",

Similar congruences are conjectured to hold for all Ap\\'ery-like sequences. We provide a fresh perspective on the supercongruences satisfied by the Ap\\'ery numbers by showing that they extend to all Taylor coefficients $A (n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4)$ of the rational function \\begin{equation*} \\frac{1}{(1 - x_1 - x_2) (1 - x_3 - x_4) - x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4} . \\end{equation*} The Ap\\'ery numbers are the diagonal coefficients of this function, which is simpler than previously known rational functions with this property. Our main result offers analogous results for an infinite family of sequences, indexed by partitions $\\lambda$, which also includes the Franel and Yang--Zudilin numbers as well as the Ap\\'ery numbers corresponding to $\\zeta (2)$. Using the example of the Almkvist--Zudilin numbers, we further indicate evidence of multivariate supercongruences for other Ap\\'ery-like sequences.",

This extension is based on an intersection theory for tropical cycles with smooth weights. We prove a generalization of the Poincar\\'e-Lelong formula which allows us to represent the first Chern current of a formally metrized line bundle by a delta-form. We introduce the associated Monge-Amp\\`ere measure $\\mu$ as a wedge-power of this first Chern delta-form and we show that $\\mu$ is equal to the corresponding Chambert-Loir measure. The star-product of Green currents is a crucial ingredient in the construction of the arithmetic intersection product. Using the formalism of delta-forms, we obtain a non-archimedean analogue at least in the case of divisors. We use it to compute non-archimedean local heights of proper varieties.",

These results apply in particular to the antipode of $H$ (the case $n=-1$). We obtain closed forms for the generating function of the sequence of traces of the Adams operators. In the case of the antipode, the generating function bears a particularly simple relationship to the one for the dimension sequence. In case H is cofree, we give an alternative description for the characteristic polynomial and the trace of the antipode in terms of certain palindromic words.

We discover the existence of a new lower-order term which is not predicted by this powerful conjecture. This is the first family where the 1-level density is determined well enough to see a term which is not predicted by the Ratios Conjecture, and proves that the exponent of the error term $Q^{-\\frac 12 +ε}$ in the Ratios Conjecture is best possible. We also give more precise results when the support of the Fourier Transform of the test function is restricted to the interval $[-1,1]$. Finally we show how natural conjectures on the distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions allow one to extend the support. The most powerful conjecture is Montgomery's, which implies that the Ratios Conjecture's prediction holds for any finite support up to an error $Q^{-\\frac 12 +ε}$.",

Similar ideas have also been used by Liu, Wan and Xiao to study the boundary of the eigencurve. This all goes back to an idea of Coleman. In this article, we construct natural extensions of eigenvarieties for arbitrary reductive groups G over a number field which are split at all places above p. If G is GL(2)/Q, then we obtain a new construction of the extended eigencurve of Andreatta-Iovita-Pilloni. If G is an inner form of GL(2) associated to a definite quaternion algebra, our work gives a new perspective on some of the results of Liu-Wan-Xiao. We build our extended eigenvarieties following Hansen's construction using overconvergent cohomology. One key ingredient is a definition of locally analytic distribution modules which permits coefficients of characteristic p (and mixed characteristic). When G is GL(n) over a totally real or CM number field, we also construct a family of Galois representations over the reduced extended eigenvariety.",

Recall that a subset of $\\Omega$ is a base for $G$ if its pointwise stabiliser is trivial. We define the base size of $G$, denoted $b(G,H)$, to be the minimal size of a base for $G$. Determining the base size of a group is a fundamental problem in permutation group theory, with a long history stretching back to the 19th century. Here one of our main motivations is a theorem of Seress from 1996, which states that $b(G,H) \\leqslant 4$ if $G$ is soluble. In this paper we extend Seress' result by proving that $b(G,H) \\leqslant 5$ for all finite primitive groups $G$ with a soluble point stabiliser $H$. This bound is best possible. We also determine the exact base size for all almost simple groups and we study random bases in this setting. For example, we prove that the probability that $4$ random elements in $\\Omega$ form a base tends to $1$ as $|G|$ tends to infinity.",

    "abstract": "We study the conditions under which an algebraic curve can be modelled by a Laurent polynomial that is nondegenerate with respect to its Newton polytope. We prove that every curve of genus g ≤ 4 over an algebraically closed field is nondegenerate in the above sense. More generally, let M g be the locus of nondegenerate curves inside the moduli space of curves of genus g ≥ 2. Then we show that dimM g = min(2g +1, 3g − 3), except for g = 7 where dimM 7 = 16; thus, a generic curve of genus g is nondegenerate if and only if g ≤ 4. Subject classification: 14M25, 14H10 Let k be a perfect field with algebraic closure k. Let f ∈ k[x, y] be an irreducible Laurent polynomial, and write f = ∑ (i,j)∈Z2 cijx y . We denote by supp(f) = {(i, j) ∈ Z : cij 6= 0} the support of f , and we associate to f its Newton polytope ∆ = ∆(f), the convex hull of supp(f) in R. We assume throughout that ∆ is 2-dimensional. For a face τ ⊂ ∆, let f |τ = ∑ (i,j)∈τ cijx y . We say that f is nondegenerate if, for every face τ ⊂ ∆ (of any dimension), the system of equations (1) f |τ = x ∂f |τ ∂x = y ∂f |τ ∂y = 0 has no solutions in k ∗2 . From the perspective of toric varieties, the condition of nondegeneracy can be rephrased as follows. The Laurent polynomial f defines a curve U(f) in the torus Tk = Spec k[x , y], and Tk embeds canonically in the projective toric surface X(∆)k associated to ∆ over k. Let V (f) be the Zariski closure of the curve U(f) inside X(∆)k. Then f is nondegenerate if and only if for every face τ ⊂ ∆, we have that V (f)∩Tτ is smooth of codimension 1 in Tτ , where Tτ is the toric component of X(∆)k associated to τ . (See Proposition 1.2 for alternative characterizations.) Nondegenerate polynomials have become popular objects in explicit algebraic geometry, owing to their connection with toric geometry [4]: a wealth of geometric information about V (f) is contained in the combinatorics of the Newton polytope ∆(f). The notion was initially employed by Kouchnirenko [22], who studied nondegenerate polynomials in the context of singularity theory. Nondenegerate polynomials emerge naturally in the theory of sparse resultants [14] and admit a linear effective Nullstellensatz [8, Section 2.3]. They make an appearance in the study of real algebraic curves in maximal position [26] and in the problem of enumerating curves through a set of prescribed points [27]. In the case where k is a finite field, they arise in the construction of curves with many points [6, 23], in the p-adic cohomology theory of Adolphson and Sperber [2], and in explicit methods for computing zeta functions of varieties over k [8].

We define the adjoint polytope P^(s) as the set of those points in P, whose lattice distance to every facet of P is at least s. We prove a structure theorem for lattice polytopes P with high Q-codegree. If P^(s) is empty for some s < 2/(dim(P)+2), then the lattice polytope P has lattice width one. This has consequences in Ehrhart theory and on polarized toric varieties with dual defect. Moreover, we illustrate how classification results in adjunction theory can be translated into new classification results for lattice polytopes.",

Based on the analogy between factorizations of random elements of $\\mathbb{F}_q[T]$ into primes and the factorizations of random permutations into cycles, we give a simple but general formula for these variances in the large $q$ limit for arithmetic functions that depend only upon factorization structure. From this we derive new estimates, quickly recover some that are already known, and make new conjectures in the setting of the integers. In particular we make the combinatorial observation that any function of this sort can be decomposed into a sum of functions $u$ and $v$, depending on the size of the short interval, with $u$ making a negligible contribution to the variance, and $v$ asymptotically contributing diagonal terms only. This variance evaluation is closely related to the appearance of random matrix statistics in the zeros of families of L-functions and sheds light on the arithmetic meaning of this phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "We address Heath-Brown's and Serre's dimension growth conjecture (proved by Salberger), when the degree $d$ grows. Recall that Salberger's dimension growth results give bounds of the form $O_{X, \\varepsilon} (B^{\\dim X+\\varepsilon})$ for the number of rational points of height at most $B$ on any integral subvariety $X$ of ${\\mathbb P}^n_{\\mathbb Q}$ of degree $d\\geq 2$, where one can write $O_{d,n, \\varepsilon}$ instead of $O_{X, \\varepsilon}$ as soon as $d\\geq 4$. Our main contribution is to remove the factor $B^\\varepsilon$ as soon as $d \\geq 5$, without introducing a factor $\\log B$, while moreover obtaining polynomial dependence on $d$ of the implied constant. Working polynomially in $d$ allows us to give a self-contained and slightly simplified treatment of dimension growth for degree $d \\geq 16$, while in the range $5 \\leq d \\leq 15$ we invoke results by Browning, Heath-Brown and Salberger. Along the way we improve the well-known bounds due to Bombieri and Pila on the number of integral points of bounded height on affine curves and those by Walsh on the number of rational points of bounded height on projective curves. The former improvement leads to a slight sharpening of a recent estimate due to Bhargava, Shankar, Taniguchi, Thorne, Tsimerman and Zhao on the size of the $2$-torsion subgroup of the class group of a degree $d$ number field. Our treatment builds on recent work by Salberger which brings in many primes in Heath-Brown's variant of the determinant method, and on recent work by Walsh and Ellenberg--Venkatesh, who bring in the size of the defining polynomial. We also obtain lower bounds showing that one cannot do better than polynomial dependence on $d$.",

We bound the dimension $h^0(X,T_X)$ of the space of global vector fields on an elliptic surface $X$ if the generic fiber of $f$ is ordinary or if $f$ admits no multiple fibers, and show that, without these assumptions, the number $h^0(X,T_X)$ can be arbitrarily large for any base curve $C$ and any field of positive characteristic.

By comparing the determinant of this map with that of L_V (which can be computed via Perrin-Riou's explicit reciprocity law), we obtain a precise description of the images of the Coleman maps. In the case when V arises from a modular form, we get some stronger results about the integral Coleman maps, and we can remove many technical assumptions that were required in our previous work in order to reformulate Kato's main conjecture in terms of cotorsion Selmer groups and bounded p-adic L-functions.",

    "abstract": "A finite-dimensional representation of an algebraic group G gives a trace symmetric bilinear form on the Lie algebra of G. We give a criterion in terms of the root system data for this form to vanish. As a corollary, we show that a Lie algebra of type E8 over a field of characteristic 5 does not have a so-called “quotient trace form”, answering a question posed in the 1960s. Let G be an algebraic group over a field F , acting on a finite-dimensional vector space V via a homomorphism ρ : G → GL(V ). The differential dρ of ρ maps the Lie algebra Lie(G) of G into gl(V ), and we put Trρ for the symmetric bilinear form Trρ(x, y) := trace(dρ(x) dρ(y)) for x, y ∈ Lie(G). We call Trρ a trace form of G. Such forms appear, for example, in the hypotheses for the Jacobson-Morozov Theorem [Ca, 5.3.1]. We prove: Theorem A. Assume G is simply connected, split, and almost simple. Then the following are equivalent: (a) The characteristic of F is a torsion prime for G. (b) Every trace form of G is zero. The set of torsion primes for G is given by the following table, cf. e.g. [St 75, 1.13]: type of G torsion primes An, Cn none Bn (n ≥ 3), Dn (n ≥ 4), G2 2 F4, E6, E7 2, 3 E8 2, 3, 5 A prime p is called a torsion prime for G if the corresponding group G(C) over C (or, equivalently, its compact form) is such that one of its homology groups, with coefficients in Z, contains an element of order p. We also prove a generalization of Theorem A that removes the hypotheses “simply connected” and “split”; it is somewhat more complicated, so we leave the statement until Th. D (and Remark 4.6). Replacing the simply connected group G with a nontrivial quotient G changes the situation in two ways: the group G has “fewer” representations and the Lie algebras of G and G may be different. These two changes are reflected in the integers N(G) and E(G) defined below. As a particular example of Th. A, for G of type E8 over a field of characteristic 2, 3, or 5, Trρ is zero for every representation ρ of G. One may ask whether the same is true for the representations of the Lie algebra Lie(G). That is, for a representation ψ of Lie(G), we write Trψ for the bilinear form (x, y) 7→ trace(ψ(x)ψ(y)), and ask 2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 20G05 (17B50, 17B25).",

Roughly speaking, we view each generator of quantum matrices as a sum over paths in the graph, each path being assigned an element of the quantum torus. The quantum matrices relations then arise naturally by considering intersecting paths. This viewpoint is closely related to Cauchon's deleting-derivations algorithm. The second part of this paper is to apply the paths viewpoint to the theory of torus-invariant prime ideals of quantum matrices. We prove a conjecture of Goodearl and Lenagan that all such prime ideals, when the quantum parameter q is a non-root of unity, have generating sets consisting of quantum minors.

This representation yields perhaps the simplest nontrivial example of a prehomogeneous vector space that is not irreducible, and of a coregular space whose underlying group is not semisimple. We show that the nondegenerate integer orbits of this representation are in natural bijection with orders in cubic fields having a fixed \"lattice shape\". Moreover, this correspondence is discriminant-preserving: the value of the invariant polynomial of an element in this representation agrees with the discriminant of the corresponding cubic order. We use this interpretation of the integral orbits to solve three classical-style counting problems related to cubic orders and fields. First, we give an asymptotic formula for the number of cubic orders having bounded discriminant and nontrivial automorphism group. More generally, we give an asymptotic formula for the number of cubic orders that have bounded discriminant and any given lattice shape (i.e., reduced trace form, up to scaling). Via a sieve, we also count cubic fields of bounded discriminant whose rings of integers have a given lattice shape. We find, in particular, that among cubic orders (resp. fields) having lattice shape of given discriminant $D$, the shape is equidistributed in the class group $\\mathrm{Cl}_D$ of binary quadratic forms of discriminant $D$. As a by-product, we also obtain an asymptotic formula for the number of cubic fields of bounded discriminant having any given quadratic resolvent field.",

Moreover, we show that the weak version of the conjecture (for m at most n) implies the strong version of the conjecture.

The upshot is a description of the integral Bernstein center for GL_n in purely Galois-theoretic terms; previous work of the author shows that such a description implies the conjectural \"local Langlands correspondence in families\" of Emerton and the author.",

In most cases our group equals St, giving a presentation with many advantages over the usual presentation of St. This equality holds for all spherical root systems, all irreducible affine root systems of rank&gt;2, and all 3-spherical root systems. When the coefficient ring satisfies a minor condition, the last condition can be relaxed to 2-sphericity. Our presentation is defined in terms of the Dynkin diagram rather than the full root system. It is concrete, with no implicit coefficients or signs. It makes manifest the exceptional diagram automorphisms in characteristics 2 and 3, and their generalizations to Kac-Moody groups. And it is a Curtis-Tits style presentation: it is the direct limit of the groups coming from 1- and 2-node subdiagrams of the Dynkin diagram. Over non-fields this description as a direct limit is new and surprising. Our main application is that many Steinberg and Kac-Moody groups over finitely-generated rings are finitely presented.",

We also give a partial converse showing that when $R$ is the homogeneous coordinate ring of a smooth projective variety $X$, embedded by some multiple of its canonical divisor, then simplicity of $R$ as a $D_R$-module implies that $X$ is Fano and thus $R$ has rational singularities.",

The main technical difficulties are defining a version of hyperendoscopy that works for groups without simply connected derived subgroup and bounding the values of transfers of unramified functions.

    "abstract": "Let $K$ be a number field and let $C/K$ be a curve of genus 2 with Jacobian variety $J$. In this paper, we study the canonical height $\\hat{h} \\colon J(K) \\to \\mathbb R$. More specifically, we consider the following two problems, which are important in applications: (1) for a given $P \\in J(K)$, compute $\\hat{h}(P)$ efficiently; (2) for a given bound $B > 0$, find all $P \\in J(K)$ with $\\hat{h}(P) \\le B$. We develop an algorithm running in polynomial time (and fast in practice) to deal with the first problem. Regarding the second problem, we show how one can tweak the naive height $h$ that is usually used to obtain significantly improved bounds for the difference $h - \\hat{h}$, which allows a much faster enumeration of the desired set of points. Our approach is to use the standard decomposition of $h(P) - \\hat{h}(P)$ as a sum of local `height correction functions'. We study these functions carefully, which leads to efficient ways of computing them and to essentially optimal bounds. To get our polynomial-time algorithm, we have to avoid the factorization step needed to find the finite set of places where the correction might be nonzero. The main innovation at this point is to replace factorization into primes by factorization into coprimes. Most of our results are valid for more general fields with a set of absolute values satisfying the product formula. An analogous approach to (1) above for elliptic curves was used in our recent paper arXiv:1509.08748.",

Besser.Motivated by the previous result we also prove some of the Bloch-Ogus axioms for the syntomic cohomology theory, but viewed as an absolute cohomology theory.MSC: 14F43, 14F30, 19F27. Def. 2.5).An object M of pHD can be represented by a diagram of the form M rig → M K ← M dR where M ? is a complex of K-vector spaces endowed with a Frobenius automorphism when ? = rig and with a filtration when ? = dR.On pHD there is a naturally defined tensor product and we denote the unit object of pHD by K.The main difference w.r.t.[Ban02] being that the maps in the diagram are not necessarily quasi-isomorphisms.From [Bes00] we get (in Prop.5.7) that there are functorial p-adic Hodge complexes RΓ(X )inducing the specialization map in cohomology (i.e., taking the cohomology of each element of the diagram).Meanwhile we show how the constructions made by Besser may be obtained using the theory of generalized Godement resolution (also called the bar resolution).In particular we use the results of [vdPS95] in order to have enough points for rigid analytic spaces.Further we consider the twisted version RΓ(X )(i), which is given by the same complexes, but with the Frobenius (resp.the filtration) twisted by i (see Remark 2.9).Then we prove (see Prop. 5.10) that the syntomic cohomology groups H n syn (X , i) of [Bes00] are isomorphic to the (absolute cohomology) groups H n abs (X , i) := Hom pHD (K, RΓ(X )(i) [n]).This result generalizes that of [Ban02] (which was given for some particular V -schemes with good compactification) to any smooth algebraic V -scheme.For this absolute cohomology we can prove some of the Bloch-Ogus axioms.In fact we construct a p-adic Hodge complex RΓ c (X )(i) related to rigid and de Rham cohomology with compact support.So we can define an absolute cohomology with compact support functorial with respect to proper maps H n abs,c (X , i) := Hom pHD (K, RΓ c (X )(i) [n]) and an absolute homology theory H abs n (X , i) := Hom pHD (RΓ c (X )(i)[n], K).We want to point out that the above constructions are essentially consequences of the work done by Besser and Bannai, but it seems hard to prove the following results without the formalism of Godement resolutions we develop in § 3: let X be a smooth scheme over V , then (i) there is a cup product pairinginduced by the natural pairings defined on the cohomology of the generic and the special fiber (see Cor. 6.4);(ii) there is a Poincaré duality isomorphism (see Prop. 6.5);(iii) there is a Gysin map, i.e. given a proper morphism f : X → Y of smooth algebraic Vschemes of relative dimension d and e, respectively, then there is a canonical mapwhere c = ed (see Cor. 6.7). NotationIn this paper R is a complete discrete valuation ring with fraction field K and residue field k, with k perfect.We assume char(K) = 0 and char(k) = p > 0.We denote by R 0 the ring of Witt vectors of k and K 0 is its field of fractions.The Frobenius of K 0 is denoted by σ.The category of bounded complexes of K-vector spaces is denoted by C b (K).If V is a K-vector space, then V ∨ is the dual vector space.We use X, Y, ... for schemes over k or K; X, Y, ... for K-analytic spaces; P, Q for formal Kschemes and P K , Q K for the associated Raynaud fibers; X , Y for (algebraic) V -schemes, where V = Spec(R).Finally, the p-adic completion of a V -scheme X will be denoted by X .

Our results are the first of their kind on any p-adic arithmetic quotient. They may be understood as analogues of Lindenstrauss's theorem on the equidistribution of Maass forms on a compact arithmetic surface. The new ingredients here include the introduction of a representation-theoretic notion of \"p-adic microlocal lifts\" with favorable properties, such as diagonal invariance of limit measures, the proof of positive entropy of limit measures in a p-adic aspect, following the method of Bourgain--Lindenstrauss, and some analysis of local Rankin--Selberg integrals involving the microlocal lifts introduced here as well as classical newvectors.

Theorem 8.15.There is an open substack D ad,adm ϕ,N,µ ⊂ D ad ϕ,N,µ over which there exists a family E of semistable G K -representations such that D st (E) = (D, Φ, N, F • ) is the restriction of the universal family of filtered (ϕ, N )-modules on D ad ϕ,N,µ to D ad,adm ϕ,N,µ .This family is universal in the following sense: Let X be an adic space locally of finite type over the reflex field E µ of µ, and let E ′ be a family of semi-stable G K -representations on X with constant Hodge polygon equal to µ.Then there is a unique morphism f : X → D ad,adm ϕ,N,µ such thatThe corresponding result for crystalline G K -representations with constant Hodge polygon equal to µ, whose moduli space is D ad,adm ϕ,µ , is formulated and proved in Corollary 8.16.We finally briefly discuss how these results relate to Kisin's construction of potentially semi-stable deformation rings [Kis08].There is a precise relation between our universal family and Kisin's construction discussed in Proposition 8.5 in the body of the paper.It should be mentioned however, that the spirit of our approach differs from Kisin's: first of all our point of view is the study of families of p-adic Hodge-structures (i.e. the side of semi-linear algebra data) in the first place -and then we turn to cut out a subspace defining a Galois representation.Kisin starts with families of Galois representations (provided by deformation rings) and then cuts out a crystalline locus.Moreover, his definition of a crystalline family differs from ours: Kisin defines a family to be semi-stable if its base change to all finite dimensional Q p -algebras is semi-stable.In contrast we aim at giving a definition that is more in the spirit of Fontaine's definition using period rings.In fact, as we needed to correct some mistakes from the last section of [Hel13], we also changed the definition of crystalline representations from loc.cit: it seems to be a bit messy to deal with the filtration on a sheafified version of B cris , hence we rather use the ϕ-modules on the open unit disc as our p-adic Hodge structures and define the notion of a semi-stable representation using the comparison of a vector bundle on the open unit disc and a Galois representation after tensoring with (a relative version of) B + cris , see Definition 8.2.Notations: Let K be a finite field extension of the p-adic numbers Q p and fix an algebraic closure K of K. We write C p for the p-adic completion of K and let G K = Gal(K/K) be the absolute Galois group of K. Let K be the Galois closure of K inside K. Let K 0 be the maximal unramified subfield of K and W its ring of integers.Set f := [K 0 : Q p ], and let Frob p be the Frobenius automorphism of K 0 which induces the p-power map on the residue field of K 0 .We fix once and for all a uniformizer π of K and its minimal polynomial E(u) = mipo π/K 0 (u) ∈ W [u] over K 0 .It is an Eisenstein polynomial, and K = K 0 [u]/(E(u)).We choose a compatible system π n of p n -th roots of π in K and write K ∞ for the field obtained from K by adjoining all π n .",

    "abstract": "The degree of irrationality of a projective variety $X$ is defined to be the smallest degree rational dominant map to a projective space of the same dimension. For abelian surfaces, Yoshihara computed this invariant in specific cases, while Stapleton gave a sublinear upper bound for very general polarized abelian surfaces $(A, L)$ of degree $d$. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that the degree of irrationality of a very general polarized abelian surface is uniformly bounded above by $4$, independently of the degree of the polarization. This result disproves part of a conjecture of Bastianelli, De Poi, Ein, Lazarsfeld and Ullery.",

The cutting poset, constructed using a generalization of the notion of blocks in permutation matrices, almost forms a lattice on W. The construction of the biHecke monoid relies on the usual combinatorial model for the 0-Hecke algebra H_0(W), that is, for the symmetric group, the algebra (or monoid) generated by the elementary bubble sort operators. The authors previously introduced the Hecke group algebra, constructed as the algebra generated simultaneously by the bubble sort and antisort operators, and described its representation theory. In this paper, we consider instead the monoid generated by these operators. We prove that it admits |W| simple and projective modules. In order to construct the simple modules, we introduce for each w in W a combinatorial module T_w whose support is the interval [1,w]_R in right weak order. This module yields an algebra, whose representation theory generalizes that of the Hecke group algebra, with the combinatorics of descents replaced by that of blocks and of the cutting poset.",

The local density formula is known except in the case of a ramified hermitian lattice of residue characteristic 2. Let F be a finite unramified field extension of Q_2. Ramified quadratic extensions E/F fall into two cases that we call Case 1 and Case 2. In this paper, we obtain the local density formula for a ramified hermitian lattice in Case 1, by constructing a smooth integral group scheme model for an appropriate unitary group.

    "abstract": "One of the most significant discrete invariants of a quadratic form $ϕ$ over a field $k$ is its (full) splitting pattern, a finite sequence of integers which describes the possible isotropy behaviour of $ϕ$ under scalar extension to arbitrary overfields of $k$. A similarly important, but more accessible variant of this notion is that of the Knebusch splitting pattern of $ϕ$, which captures the isotropy behaviour of $ϕ$ as one passes over a certain prescribed tower of $k$-overfields. In this paper, we determine all possible values of this latter invariant in the case where $ϕ$ is totally singular. This includes an extension of Karpenko's theorem (formerly Hoffmann's conjecture) on the possible values of the first Witt index to the totally singular case. Contrary to the existing approaches to this problem (in the nonsingular case), our results are achieved by means of a new structural result on the higher anisotropic kernels of totally singular quadratic forms. Moreover, the methods used here readily generalise to give analogous results for arbitrary Fermat-type forms of degree $p$ over fields of characteristic $p&gt;0$. Related problems concerning the Knebusch splitting of symmetric bilinear forms over fields of characteristic 2 and the full splitting of totally singular quadratic forms are also considered.",

We introduce a refinement of Malle's conjecture, if $G$ is a group with a nontrivial Galois action then we consider the set of crossed homomorphisms in $Z^1(K,G)$ (or equivalently $1$-coclasses in $H^1(K,G)$) with bounded discriminant. This has a natural interpretation given by counting $G$-extensions $F/L$ for some fixed $L$ and prescribed extension class $F/L/K$. If $T$ is an abelian group with any Galois action, we compute the asymptotic growth rate of this refined counting function for $Z^1(K,T)$ (and equivalently for $H^1(K,T)$) and show that it is a natural generalization of Malle's conjecture. The proof technique is in essence an application of a theorem of Wiles on generalized Selmer groups, and additionally gives the asymptotic main term when restricted to certain local behaviors. As a consequence, whenever the inverse Galois problem is solved for $G\\subset S_n$ over $K$ and $G$ has an abelian normal subgroup $T\\trianglelefteq G$ we prove a nontrivial lower bound for $N(K,G;X)$ given by a nonzero power of $X$ times a power of $\\log X$. For many groups, including many solvable groups, these are the first known nontrivial lower bounds. These bounds prove Malle's predicted lower bounds for a large family of groups, and for an infinite subfamily they generalize Kl\\\"uners' counter example to Malle's conjecture and verify the corrected lower bounds predicted by T\\\"urkelli.",

Leonard and Pellikaan [2003] devised an algorithm for computing the integral closure of weighted rings that are finitely generated over finite fields. Previous algorithms proceed by building successively larger rings between the original ring and its integral closure [de Jong 1998; Seidenberg 1970; 1975; Stolzenberg 1968; Vasconcelos 1991; 2000]; the Leonard‐Pellikaan algorithm instead starts with the first approximation being a finitely generated module that contains the integral closure, and successive steps produce submodules containing the integral closure. The weights in [Leonard and Pellikaan 2003] impose strong restrictions, and play a crucial role in various steps of their algorithm; see Remark 1.7. We present a modification of the Leonard‐Pellikaan algorithm that works in much greater generality: it computes the integral closure of a reduced ring that is finitely generated over a finite field. We discuss an implementation of the algorithm in Macaulay 2, and provide comparisons with de Jong’s algorithm [1998].",

Assuming a plausible conjecture about primes in short intervals, they showed the following: for each N , the average of M E (N ) over a box with sufficiently large sides is ∼ K * (N )/log N for an explicitly given function K * (N ).The function K * (N ) is somewhat peculiar: defined as a product over the primes dividing N , it resembles a multiplicative function at first glance.But further inspection reveals that it is not, and so one cannot directly investigate its properties by the usual tools of multiplicative number theory.In this paper, we overcome these difficulties and prove a number of statistical results about K * (N ).For example, we determine the mean value of K * (N ) over all N , odd N and prime N , and we show that K * (N ) has a distribution function.We also explain how our results relate to existing theorems and conjectures on the multiplicative properties of #E(‫ކ‬ p ), such as Koblitz's conjecture.",

After that, we compare several classes of thick tensor ideals of $D^-(R)$, relating them to specialization-closed subsets of $Spec\\,R$ and Thomason subsets of $Spc\\,D^-(R)$, and construct a counterexample to a conjecture of Balmer. Finally, we explore thick tensor ideals of $D^-(R)$ in the case where $R$ is a discrete valuation ring.",

Second, when $Y$ is fibered over a smooth projective variety, we show a linear bound for twists by ample line bundles. These results additionally give effective non-vanishing statements. We also prove an effective weak positivity statement for log pluricanonical bundles in this setting, which may be of independent interest.

Cohen-Lenstra-Delaunay-style heuristics predict that the Tate-Shafarevich group of $A_s$ should contain an element of order $p$ for a positive proportion of quadratic twists $A_s$ of $A$. We give a general method to prove instances of this conjecture by exploiting independent isogenies of $A$. For each prime $p$, there is a large class of elliptic curves for which our method shows that a positive proportion of quadratic twists have nontrivial $p$-torsion in their Tate-Shafarevich groups. In particular, when the modular curve $X_0(3p)$ has infinitely many $F$-rational points the method applies to ``most'' elliptic curves $E$ having a cyclic $3p$-isogeny. It also applies in certain cases when $X_0(3p)$ has only finitely many points. For example, we find an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}$ for which a positive proportion of quadratic twists have an element of order $5$ in their Tate-Shafarevich groups. The method applies to abelian varieties of arbitrary dimension, at least in principle. As a proof of concept, we give, for each prime $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 9$, examples of CM abelian threefolds with a positive proportion of quadratic twists having elements of order $p$ in their Tate-Shafarevich groups.",

This conjecture follows from the generalized Riemann hypothesis and is known to hold for almost all primes p but remains open in general.In this paper, we show that Vinogradov's conjecture also follows from the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture on the distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions, thus providing a potential \"nonmultiplicative\" route to the Vinogradov conjecture.We also give a variant of this argument that obtains bounds on short centered character sums from \"Type II\" estimates of the type introduced recently by Zhang and improved upon by the Polymath project or from bounds on the level of distribution on variants of the higher-order divisor function.In particular, an improvement over the Burgess bound would be obtained if one had Type II estimates with level of distribution above 2 3 (when the conductor is not cube-free) or 3 4 (if the conductor is cube-free); morally, one would also obtain such a gain if one had distributional estimates on the third or fourth divisor functions τ 3 or τ 4 at level above 2 3 or 3 4 , respectively.Some applications to the least primitive root are also given.MSC2010: primary 11L40",

    "abstract": "Let p be a prime.We characterize those finite groups which have precisely one irreducible character of degree divisible by p.Minimal situations constitute a classical theme in group theory.Not only do they arise naturally, but they also provide valuable hints in searching for general patterns.In this paper, we are concerned with character degrees.One of the key results on character degrees is the Itô-Michler theorem, which asserts that a prime p does not divide the degree of any complex irreducible character of a finite group G if and only if G has a normal, abelian Sylow p-subgroup.In [Isaacs et al. 2009], Isaacs together with the fourth, fifth, and sixth authors of this paper studied the finite groups that have only one character degree divisible by p.They proved, among other things, that the Sylow p-subgroups of those groups were metabelian.This suggested that the derived length of the Sylow p-subgroups might be related with the number of different character degrees divisible by p.However, nothing could be said in [Isaacs et al. 2009] on how large p-Sylow normalizers were inside G. (As a trivial example, the dihedral group of order 2n for n odd has a unique character degree divisible by 2, and a self-normalizing Sylow 2-subgroup of order 2.)In this paper, we go further and completely classify the finite groups with exactly one irreducible character of degree divisible by p.Our focus now therefore is not only on the set of character degrees but also on the multiplicity of the number of irreducible characters of each degree.In Section 1, we define the terms semiextraspecial, ultraspecial, and doubly transitive Frobenius groups of Dickson type.",

In this situation, we establish a congruence between the anticyclotomic $p$-adic $L$-function of Bertolini-Darmon-Prasanna and the Katz two-variable $p$-adic $L$-function. From this, we derive congruences between images under the $p$-adic Abel-Jacobi map of certain generalized Heegner cycles attached to $f$ and special values of the Katz $p$-adic $L$-function. In particular, our results apply to newforms associated with elliptic curves $E/\\mathbb{Q}$ whose mod $p$ Galois representations $E[p]$ are reducible at a good prime $p$. As a consequence, we show the following: if $K$ is an imaginary quadratic field satisfying the Heegner hypothesis with respect to $E$ and in which $p$ splits, and if the bad primes of $E$ satisfy certain congruence conditions mod $p$ and $p$ does not divide certain Bernoulli numbers, then the Heegner point $P_{E}(K)$ is non-torsion, in particular implying that $\\text{rank}_{\\mathbb{Z}}E(K) = 1$. From this, we show that when $E$ is semistable with reducible mod $3$ Galois representation, then a positive proportion of real quadratic twists of $E$ have rank 1 and a positive proportion of imaginary quadratic twists of $E$ have rank 0.",

IntroductionThis paper continues the programme started in [Huber and Jörder 2014] (characteristic 0) and [Huber, Kebekus and Kelly 2017] (positive characteristic).For a survey see also [Huber 2016].Programme.Let us quickly summarise the main idea.Sheaves of differential forms are very rich sources of invariants in the study of algebraic invariants of smooth algebraic varieties.However, they are much less well-behaved for singular varieties.In characteristic 0, the use of the h-topology -replacing Kähler differentials with their sheafification in this Grothendieck topology -is very successful.It unifies several ad hoc notions and simplifies arguments.In positive characteristic, resolution of singularities would imply that the cdh-sheafification could be used in a very similar way.Together with the results of [Huber, Kebekus and Kelly 2017], we now have a fairly complete unconditional picture, at least for the sheaves themselves.We refer to the follow-up [Huber and Kelly 2018] for results on cohomological descent, where, however, many questions remain open.Results.There are a number of weaker cousins of the h-topology in the literature.They exclude the Frobenius morphism but still allow abstract blowups.The cdh-topology (see Section 2B) is the most well-established, appearing prominently in work on motives and K-theory, and having connections to rigid geometry; see [Friedlander and Voevodsky 2000; Voevodsky 2000; Suslin and Voevodsky 2000a;Cisinski and Déglise 2015;Cortiñas et al. 2008;Geisser and Hesselholt 2010; Cisinski 2013;Kerz et al. 2018; Morrow 2016], for example.We write n for the sheafification of the presheaf X 7 !.X; n X=k / with respect to the topology .",

Here, | A ( k ) | denotes the k -fold product set { a 1 ⋯ a k : a 1 , … , a k ∈ A } . Furthermore, our method of proof also gives the following l ∞ sum-product estimate. For all γ > 0 there exists a constant C = C ( γ ) such that for any A ⊂ ℚ with | A A | ≤ K | A | and any c 1 , c 2 ∈ ℚ ∖ { 0 } , there are at most K C | A | γ solutions to c 1 x + c 2 y = 1 , ( x , y ) ∈ A × A . In particular, this result gives a strong bound when K = | A | 𝜖 , provided that 𝜖 > 0 is sufficiently small, and thus improves on previous bounds obtained via the Subspace Theorem. In further applications we give a partial structure theorem for point sets which determine many incidences and prove that sum sets grow arbitrarily large by taking sufficiently many products. We utilize a query-complexity analogue of the polynomial Freiman–Ruzsa conjecture, due to Palvolgyi and Zhelezov (2020).

    "abstract": "We use the Taylor-Wiles-Kisin patching method to investigate the multiplicities with which Galois representations occur in the mod $\\ell$ cohomology of Shimura curves over totally real number fields. Our method relies on explicit computations of local deformation rings done by Shotton, which we use to compute the Weil class group of various deformation rings. Exploiting the natural self-duality of the cohomology groups, we use these class group computations to precisely determine the structure of a patched module in many new cases in which the patched module is not free (and so multiplicity one fails). Our main result is a \"multiplicity $2^k$\" theorem in the minimal level case (which we prove under some mild technical hypotheses), where $k$ is a number that depends only on local Galois theoretic information at the primes dividing the discriminant of the Shimura curve. Our result generalizes Ribet's classical multiplicity 2 result and the results of Cheng, and provides progress towards the Buzzard-Diamond-Jarvis local-global compatibility conjecture. We also prove a statement about the endomorphism rings of certain modules over the Hecke algebra, which may have applications to the integral Eichler basis problem.",

The present paper extends this vanishing theorem to a smooth projective variety X of arbitrary dimension. Specifically, given a line bundle B on X, we prove that if B is p-jet very ample (i.e. the sections of B separate jets of total weight p+1) then the weight one Koszul cohomology group K_{p,1}(X, B; L) vanishes for all sufficiently positive L. In the other direction, we show that if there is a reduced cycle of length p+1 that fails to impose independent conditions on sections of B, then the Koszul group in question is non-zero for very positive L.",

Suppose that ν * is a valuation of K * such that ν * dominates S. Let ν be the restriction of ν * to K .The associated graded ring gr ν (R) was introduced by Bernard Teissier.It plays an important role in local uniformization.We show that the extension (K , ν) → (K * , ν * ) of valued fields is without defect if and only if there exist regular local rings R 1 and S 1 such that R 1 is a local ring of a blowup of R, S 1 is a local ring of a blowup of S, ν * dominates S 1 , S 1 dominates R 1 and the associated graded ring gr ν * (S 1 ) is a finitely generated gr ν (R 1 )-algebra.We also investigate the role of splitting of the valuation ν in K * in finite generation of the extensions of associated graded rings along the valuation.We say that ν does not split in S if ν * is the unique extension of ν to K * which dominates S. We show that if R and S are regular local rings, ν * has rational rank 1 and is not discrete and gr ν * (S) is a finitely generated gr ν (R)-algebra, then S is a localization of the integral closure of R in K * , the extension (K , ν) → (K * , ν * ) is without defect and ν does not split in S. We give examples showing that such a strong statement is not true when ν does not satisfy these assumptions.As a consequence, we deduce that if ν has rational rank 1 and is not discrete and if R → R is a nontrivial sequence of quadratic transforms along ν, then gr ν (R ) is not a finitely generated gr ν (R)-algebra.Suppose that K is a field.Associated to a valuation ν of K is a value group ν and a valuation ring V ν with maximal ideal m ν .Let R be a local domain with quotient field K .We say that ν dominates R if R ⊂ V ν and m ν ∩ R = m R , where m R is the maximal ideal of R.

These are collections of positive integers on the AR-quiver of the category with relations inherited from the mesh relations on the category. In these finite type cases, many of the SL$_k$-friezes arise from specialising a cluster to 1. These are called unitary. We use Iyama-Yoshino reduction to analyse the non-unitary friezes. With this, we provide an explanation for all known friezes of this kind. An appendix by Cuntz and Plamondon proves that there are 868 friezes of type $E_6$.",

The proofs are partly based on convenient universal characterizations of several cobordism theories, which should be of independent interest. Using similar techniques, we also strengthen a result of Vezzosi on operational derived $K$-theory.

    "abstract": "In 1968 Tate introduced a new approach to residues on algebraic curves, based on a certain ring of operators that acts on the completion at a point of the function field of the curve. This approach was generalized to higher dimensional algebraic varieties by Beilinson in 1980. However Beilinson's paper had very few details, and his operator-theoretic construction remained cryptic for many years. Currently there is a renewed interest in the Beilinson-Tate approach to residues in higher dimensions. Our paper presents a variant of Beilinson's operator-theoretic construction. We consider an n-dimensional topological local field K, and define a ring of operators E(K) that acts on K, which we call the ring of local Beilinson-Tate operators. Our definition is of an analytic nature (as opposed to the original geometric definition of Beilinson). We study various properties of the ring E(K). In particular we show that E(K) has an n-dimensional cubical decomposition, and this gives rise to a residue functional in the style of Beilinson-Tate. Presumably this residue functional coincides with the residue functional that we had constructed in 1992; but we leave this as a conjecture.",

Quillen showed that solvable groups with trivial -core satisfy this property, and later, M. Aschbacher and S.D. Smith provided a list of all -extensions of simple groups that may fail this property if is odd.In particular, a group with this property satisfies Quillen's conjecture:has trivial -core and the poset A ( ) is not contractible.In this article, we focus on the prime = 2 and prove that the 2-extensions of the exceptional finite simple groups of Lie type in odd characteristic satisfy the Quillen dimension property, with only finitely many exceptions.We achieve these conclusions by studying maximal subgroups and usually reducing the problem to the same question in small linear groups, where we establish this property via counting arguments.As a corollary, we reduce the list of possible components in a minimal counterexample to Quillen's conjecture at = 2.",

We show that, over the ordinary locus, these operators agree with the $\\mod p$ reduction of the $p$-adic theta operators previously studied by some of the authors. In the characteristic $0$, $p$-adic case, there is an obstruction that makes it impossible to extend the theta operators to the whole Shimura variety. On the other hand, our $\\mod p$ operators extend (\"analytically continue\", in the language of de Shalit and Goren) to the whole Shimura variety. As a consequence, motivated by their use by Edixhoven and Jochnowitz in the case of modular forms for proving the weight part of Serre's conjecture, we discuss some effects of these operators on Galois representations. Our focus and techniques differ from those in the literature. Our intrinsic, coordinate-free approach removes difficulties that arise from working with $q$-expansions and works in settings where earlier techniques, which rely on explicit calculations, are not applicable. In contrast with previous constructions and analytic continuation results, these techniques work for any totally real base field, any weight, and all signatures and ranks of groups at once, recovering prior results on analytic continuation as special cases.",

In addition, we define new classes of morphisms, called $E$-smooth morphisms ($E\\in\\mathbb{N}$), which refine the (FRS) property, and use the methods we developed to provide uniform number-theoretic estimates as above for their fibers.

We show that the dynamical zeta function $\\zeta_\\sigma$ of $\\sigma$ is either rational or transcendental, the first case happening precisely when $\\sigma^n-1$ is a separable isogeny for all $n$. We call this condition very inseparability and show it is equivalent to the action of $\\sigma$ on the local $p$-torsion group scheme being nilpotent. The \"false\" zeta function $D_\\sigma$, in which the number of fixed points of $\\sigma^n$ is replaced by the degree of $\\sigma^n-1$, is always a rational function. Let $1/\\Lambda$ denote its largest real pole and assume no other pole or zero has the same absolute value. Then, using a general dichotomy result for power series proven by Royals and Ward in the appendix, we find that $\\zeta_\\sigma(z)$ has a natural boundary at $|z|=1/\\Lambda$ when $\\sigma$ is not very inseparable. We introduce and study tame dynamics, ignoring orbits whose order is divisible by $p$. We construct a tame zeta function $\\zeta^*_{\\sigma}$ that is always algebraic, and such that $\\zeta_\\sigma$ factors into an infinite product of tame zeta functions. We briefly discuss functional equations. Finally, we study the length distribution of orbits and tame orbits. Orbits of very inseparable endomorphisms distribute like those of Axiom A systems with entropy $\\log \\Lambda$, but the orbit length distribution of not very inseparable endomorphisms is more erratic and similar to $S$-integer dynamical systems. We provide an expression for the prime orbit counting function in which the error term displays a power saving depending on the largest real part of a zero of $D_\\sigma(\\Lambda^{-s})$.",

Ulmer suggests that this invariant is equal to what he calls the dimension of the Tate-Shafarevich group of A and that it is indeed the dimension of some canonically defined group scheme.Our first result is to verify his suggestions.He also gives a formula for the dimension of the Tate-Shafarevich group (which is now the µ-invariant) in terms of other quantities including the Faltings height of A and Frobenius slopes of the numerator of the Hasse-Weil Lfunction of A/K assuming the conjectural Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer formula.Our next result is to prove this µ-invariant formula unconditionally for Jacobians and for semistable abelian varieties.Finally, we show that the \"µ = 0\" locus of the moduli of isomorphism classes of minimal elliptic surfaces endowed with a section and with fixed large enough Euler characteristic is a dense open subset.",

IntroductionLet k be a perfect field, and C be a projective smooth geometrically connected curve over k.The geometric class field theory gives a geometric description of abelian coverings of C by using generalized jacobian varieties.Let us recall its precise statement.Fix a modulus m, i.e. an effective Cartier divisor of C and let U be its complement in C. Let Pic 0 C,m be the corresponding generalized jacobian variety.Let G 0 → Pic 0 C,m be an étale isogeny of smooth commutative algebraic groups and).We call such a covering connected abelian if G 0 is connected and G 0 → Pic 0 C,m is an abelian isogeny.There is a natural map from U to Pic 1 C,m sending a point of U to its associated invertible sheaf with a trivialization.The geometric class field theory states: Theorem 1.1.Let C be a projective smooth geometrically connected curve over a perfect field k.Fix a modulus m of C and denote its complement by U. Let Pic 0 C,m be the generalized jacobian variety with modulus m.Then a connected abelian covering) pulls back by the natural map U → Pic 1 C,m to a geometrically connected abelian covering of U whose ramification is bounded by m.Conversely, every such covering is obtained in this way.Originally this theorem was proved by M. Rosenlicht [7].S. Lang [5] generalized his results to an arbitrary algebraic variety.Their works are explained in detail in Serre's book [8].On the other hand, in 1980s, P. Deligne found another proof for the tamely ramified case by using symmetric powers of curves.The aim of this paper is to complete his proof by considering blow-ups of symmetric powers of curves.Recently Q. Guignard did a similar work to this paper, although we do not know his results in detail.Actually we prove a variant of Theorem 1.1 now stated.",

Motivated by Brussel's discovery of noncrossed products over Q((t)), we describe the \"location\" of noncrossed products in the Brauer group of general Henselian valued fields with arbitrary value group and global residue field. We show that within the fibers defined canonically by Witt's decomposition of the Brauer group of such fields, crossed products and noncrossed products are, roughly speaking, separated by an index bound. This generalizes a result of the first and third author for rank 1 valued Henselian fields. Furthermore, we prove that all fibers which are not covered by the rank 1 case, and where the characteristic of the residue field does not interfere, contain noncrossed products. We show by example that, unlike in the rank 1 case, the value of the index bound does not depend on the number of roots of unity that are present. Thus, the index bounds are in general of a different nature than in the rank 1 case.",

However, the angles fail to equidistribute on a thin set of exceptional radii, even in the presence of growing multiplicity. Surprisingly, the distribution of angles on hyperbolic circles turns out to be related to the angular distribution of $\\mathbb{Z}^2$-lattice points (with certain parity conditions) lying on circles in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, along a thin subsequence of radii. A notable difference is that measures in the hyperbolic setting can break symmetry - on very thin subsequences they are not invariant under rotation by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, unlike the Euclidean setting where all measures have this invariance property.",

This cohomology naturally appears in the theory of abelian extensions of finite dimensional Hopf algebras. We prove that Kac cohomology can be computed using relative cohomology and relatively projective resolutions. This allows us to use other resolutions, besides the bar resolution, for computations. We compute, in terms of relative cohomology, the first two pages of a spectral sequence which converges to the Kac cohomology and its associated five-term exact sequence. Through several examples, we show the usefulness of the five-term exact sequence in computing groups of abelian extensions.",

We then describe how product constructions and other methods can be used to construct difference sets in some of the remaining $2$-groups. We announce the completion of ten years of collaborative work to determine precisely which of the 56,092 nonisomorphic groups of order 256 contain a difference set. All groups of order 256 not excluded by the two classical nonexistence criteria are found to contain a difference set, in agreement with previous findings for groups of order 4, 16, and 64.

Then we establish a global analogue of this result. For this, let $E/F$ be a quadratic extension of number fields and let $\\pi$ be an $\\mathrm{SL}_n(\\mathbb{A}_F)$-distinguished square integrable automorphic representation of $\\mathrm{SL}_n(\\mathbb{A}_E)$. Let $(\\sigma,d)$ be the unique pair associated to $\\pi$, where $\\sigma$ is a cuspidal representation of $\\mathrm{GL}_r(\\mathbb{A}_E)$ with $n=dr$. Using an unfolding argument, we prove that an element of the L-packet of $\\pi$ is distinguished with respect to $\\mathrm{SL}_n(\\mathbb{A}_F)$ if and only if it has a degenerate Whittaker model for a degenerate character $\\psi$ of type $r^d:=(r,\\dots,r)$ of $N_n(\\mathbb{A}_E)$ which is trivial on $N_n(E+\\mathbb{A}_F)$, where $N_n$ is the group of unipotent upper triangular matrices of $\\mathrm{SL}_n$. As a first application, under the assumptions that $E/F$ splits at infinity and $r$ is odd, we establish a local-global principle for $\\mathrm{SL}_n(\\mathbb{A}_F)$-distinction inside the L-packet of $\\pi$. As a second application we construct examples of distinguished cuspidal automorphic representations $\\pi$ of $\\mathrm{SL}_n(\\mathbb{A}_E)$ such that the period integral vanishes on some canonical copy of $\\pi$, and of everywhere locally distinguished representations of $\\mathrm{SL}_n(\\mathbb{A}_E)$ such that their L-packets do not contain any distinguished representation.",

    "abstract": "We prove that the Galois equidistribution of torsion points of the algebraic torus $\\mathbb{G}_{m}^d$ extends to the singular test functions of the form $\\log{|P|}$, where $P$ is a Laurent polynomial having algebraic coefficients that vanishes on the unit real $d$-torus in a set whose Zariski closure in $\\mathbb{G}_m^d$ has codimension at least $2$. Our result includes a power saving quantitative estimate of the decay rate of the equidistribution. It refines an ergodic theorem of Lind, Schmidt, and Verbitskiy, of which it also supplies a purely Diophantine proof. As an application, we confirm Ih's integrality finiteness conjecture on torsion points for a class of atoral divisors of $\\mathbb{G}_m^d$.",

    "abstract": "Group schemes and local densities of ramified hermitian lattices in residue characteristic 2 Part I Sungmun ChoThe obstruction to the local-global principle for a hermitian lattice (L , H ) can be quantified by computing the mass of (L , H ). The mass formula expresses the mass of (L , H ) as a product of local factors, called the local densities of (L , H ).The local density formula is known except in the case of a ramified hermitian lattice of residue characteristic 2.Let F be a finite unramified field extension of ‫ޑ‬ 2 .Ramified quadratic extensions E/F fall into two cases that we call Case 1 and Case 2. In this paper, we obtain the local density formula for a ramified hermitian lattice in Case 1, by constructing a smooth integral group scheme model for an appropriate unitary group.Consequently, this paper, combined with the paper of W. T. Gan and J.-K.Yu (Duke Math.J. 105 (2000), 497-524), allows the computation of the mass formula for a hermitian lattice (L , H ) in Case 1. 1. Introduction 451 2.

They showed that such a group scheme G is necessarily of finite type over R, with geometrically connected fibres, and its geometric generic fibre is a reductive algebraic group; however, they found examples where the special fibre is nonreduced, and the corresponding reduced subscheme is a reductive group of a different type. In this paper, the formalism of vanishing cycles in etale cohomology is used to show that the generic fibre of a quasireductive group scheme cannot be a restriction of scalars of a group scheme in a nontrivial way; this answers a question of Prasad, and implies that nonreductive quasireductive group schemes are essentially those found by Prasad and Yu.",

We show that self-correspondences are divided into two classes: those that have only finitely many finite complete sets, and those for which C is a union of finite complete sets.The latter ones are called finitary, happen only when deg π1 = deg π2 and have a trivial dynamics.For a non-finitary self-correspondence in characteristic zero, we give a sharp bound for the number of étale finite complete sets.We give a brief description of the idea of the proof, which uses only elementary methods : the theorem of Riemann-Roch and linear algebra.The first étale finite complete set S is used to define, as above, the natural filtration (B S,n ) n≥0 , \"by the order of the poles\" of B S , which is stabilized by T D .Is this filtration split as a k[T D ]-filtration?In general, this has no reason to be true.But with a second irreducible étale complete set S ′ , one can show that this filtration is \"almost split\", namely that there exists for every n a T D -stable subspace V S,S ′ ,n in B S,n+1 such that B S,n + V S,S ′ ,n = B S,n+1 and dim V S,S ′ ,n bounded 2 independently of n.We prove this by defining V S,S ′ ,n as the space of functions in B S,n+1 that vanishes on S ′ at a suitable order, and using Riemann-Roch.Now a third finite étale complete set S ′′ give a second quasi-splitting V S,S ′′ ,n of the filtration B S,n .Using Riemann-Roch, we prove that the two filtrations are orthogonal, in the sense that V S,S ′ ,n ∩ V S,S ′′ ,n = 0 for n large enough.Then, a linear algebra argument shows that all eigenvalues of T D appearing in B S,n+1 (for n large enough) already appear in B S,n and Theorem 2 follows.",

Let $C_d$ be the union of closed geodesics with discriminant $d$ and let $\\beta\\subset \\mathbb{X}$ be a compact geodesic segment. As an application of Duke's theorem to the modular intersection kernel, we prove that $ \\{\\left(p,\\theta_p\\right)~:~p\\in \\beta \\cap C_d\\}$ becomes equidistributed with respect to $\\sin \\theta ds d\\theta$ on $\\beta \\times [0,\\pi]$ with a power saving rate as $d \\to +\\infty$. Here $\\theta_p$ is the angle of intersection between $\\beta$ and $C_d$ at $p$. This settles the main conjectures introduced by Rickards \\cite{rick}. We prove a similar result for the distribution of angles of intersections between $C_{d_1}$ and $C_{d_2}$ with a power-saving rate in $d_1$ and $d_2$ as $d_1+d_2 \\to \\infty$. Previous works on the corresponding problem for compact surfaces do not apply to $\\mathbb{X}$, because of the singular behavior of the modular intersection kernel near the cusp.

We also closely follow the work of Charollois, Dasgupta, and Greenberg. In fact, one of the key ingredients in this paper which enables us to deal with general number fields is the introduction of a new technique called the ``exponential perturbation'' which is a slight modification of the Q-perturbation studied in their work.",

We show that self-correspondences are divided into two classes: those that have only finitely many finite complete sets, and those for which C is a union of finite complete sets.The latter ones are called finitary, and happen only when deg π 1 = deg π 2 and have a trivial dynamics.For a nonfinitary self-correspondence in characteristic zero, we give a sharp bound for the number of étale finite complete sets.MSC2020:",

Again, by Kemer's theory it is known that such Σ exists.Then there exists a semisimple super algebra U with the following properties.(1) There exists an algebra A ∈ M Z 2 ,Γ with Wedderburn-Malcev decomposition as super algebrasits Wedderburn-Malcev decomposition as super algebras, then U is a direct summand of Bss as super algebras.Finally, we fully extend these results to the G-graded setting where G is a finite group.In particular we show that if A and B are finite dimensional G 2 := Z 2 × G-graded simple algebras then they are G 2 -graded isomorphic if and only if E(A) and E(B) are G-graded PI-equivalent.",

Our main result is that if Y is not P^1 or P^2, then the Picard number rho(X) of X is at most 18, with equality only if X is a product of surfaces. We also show that if a Fano 4-fold X has a dominant rational map X-->Z, regular and proper on an open subset of X, with dim(Z)=3, then either X is a product of surfaces, or rho(X) is at most 12.

    "abstract": "Let F be a local field of characteristic p > 0. By adapting methods of Scholze [44], we give a new proof of the local Langlands correspondence for GLn over F .More specifically, we construct ℓ-adic Galois representations associated with many discrete automorphic representations over global function fields, which we use to construct a map π → rec(π) from isomorphism classes of irreducible smooth representations of GLn(F ) to isomorphism classes of ndimensional semisimple continuous representations of W F .Our map rec is characterized in terms of a local compatibility condition on traces of a certain test function f τ,h , and we prove that rec equals the usual local Langlands correspondence (after forgetting the monodromy operator). CONTENTSB]) indicates that, roughly speaking, the local Langlands correspondence for GL n as in Equation (⋄) can be found in the cohomology of deformation spaces of certain 1-dimensional formal O-modules over κ.By the Dieudonné equivalence, 1-dimensional formal O-modules correspond to special examples of 1-dimensional effective minuscule local shtukas.The deformation spaces of general 1-dimensional effective minuscule local shtukas can be pieced together from those of 1-dimensional formal O-modules (see §1), and this mirrors how general irreducible smooth representations of GL n (F ) can be pieced together from cuspidal ones via parabolic induction (see §3).Therefore, to find a test function f τ,h satisfying Theorem A, we study deformation spaces of 1-dimensional effective minuscule local shtukas.We start by parameterizing these objects as follows.Write r := v(τ ), write F r for the r-th degree unramified extension of F , write O r for its ring of integers, and write κ r for its residue field.Then the Cartan decomposition for GL n (F r ) shows that isomorphism classes of 1-dimensional effective minuscule local shtukas over κ r correspond to elementswhere ̟ is a uniformizer of F .Form the deformation space of the corresponding 1dimensional effective minuscule local shtuka with Drinfeld level-m structure, and write R i ψ δ,m for the i-th ℓ-adic cohomology group of the adic generic fiber of this deformation space.As m varies, we use these cohomology groups to construct representationswhich have commuting actions of W Fr and GL n (O).From here, we can first define a functionotherwise, and then we let f τ,h be a transfer of φ τ,h to GL n (F ).Now that we have our test function f τ,h , let's discuss the proof of Theorem A. After constructing ρ(π) in special cases, we use the geometry of our deformation spaces, along with work of Bernstein-Zelevinsky [49] on the local automorphic side, to inductively piece together ρ(π) in the general case.The process of piecing together ρ(π) amounts entirely to local deformation theory and nonarchimedean harmonic analysis.This proceeds as in [44], except the necessary harmonic analysis is more difficult in characteristic p. Therefore we carefully give the argument and supply references for the relevant harmonic analysis in characteristic p.We use global techniques to construct ρ(π) in special cases.But instead of Shimura varieties as in [44], we use moduli spaces of D-elliptic sheaves, the latter of which is an equi-characteristic analogue of abelian varieties equipped with certain endomorphisms.For good reduction, these moduli spaces were first considered by Laumon-Rapoport-Stuhler [35] in their proof of the local Langlands correspondence for GL n over F , and we shall also crucially use a version of these moduli spaces with bad reduction (which corresponds to using Drinfeld level structures) as considered by Boyer [10] in his proof of the Deligne-Carayol conjecture for F .We explicitly define ρ(π) as a multiplicity space in the cohomology of the moduli space of D-elliptic sheaves.To show that ρ(π) satisfies our desired trace compatibility condition, we adapt Scholze's version of the Langlands-Kottwitz method to compute traces of Frobenius and Hecke operators on the aforementioned cohomology groups.These traces are related to our test function f τ,h via a Serre-Tate theorem for D-elliptic sheaves, which equates deformations of D-elliptic sheaves to deformations of certain associated local shtukas.For this, it is crucial to carry out the Langlands-Kottwitz method at bad reduction, which is new in positive characteristic.This global work yields the following construction of ℓ-adic Galois representations associated with certain discrete automorphic representations.Let F be a global function field, write A for its ring of adeles, and let {x 1 , x 2 , ∞} be three distinct places of F. Write G F for the absolute Galois group of F with respect to a fixed separable closure of F. Theorem B. Let Π be an irreducible discrete automorphic representation of GL n (A) whose components at x 1 , x 2 , and ∞ are either irreducible L 2 representations or Speh modules.Then there exists a unique n-dimensional semisimple",

The key to the proof is the theory of Hartl and Pink which gives an analytic classification of vector bundles on the Fargues-Fontaine curve in equal characteristic.",

    "abstract": "We study the fine distribution of lattice points lying on expanding circles in the hyperbolic plane $\\mathbb{H}$. The angles of lattice points arising from the orbit of the modular group $PSL_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})$, and lying on hyperbolic circles, are shown to be equidistributed for generic radii. However, the angles fail to equidistribute on a thin set of exceptional radii, even in the presence of growing multiplicity. Surprisingly, the distribution of angles on hyperbolic circles turns out to be related to the angular distribution of $\\mathbb{Z}^2$-lattice points (with certain parity conditions) lying on circles in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, along a thin subsequence of radii. A notable difference is that measures in the hyperbolic setting can break symmetry - on very thin subsequences they are not invariant under rotation by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, unlike the Euclidean setting where all measures have this invariance property.",

Our parameterization generalizes Gauss's classic parameterization of the roots of quadratic congruences using binary quadratic forms, which had previously only been extended to the cubic polynomial $F(X) = X^3 - 2$. We show that only a special class of ideals are needed to parameterize the roots $\\mu \\pmod m$, and that in the cubic setting, $d = 3$, general ideals correspond to pairs of roots $\\mu_1 \\pmod{m_1}$, $\\mu_2 \\pmod {m_2}$ satisfying $\\gcd(m_1, m_2, \\mu_1 - \\mu_2) = 1$. At the end we illustrate our parameterization and this correspondence between roots and ideals with a few applications, including finding approximations to $\\frac{\\mu}{m} \\in \\mathbb{R}/ \\mathbb{Z}$, finding an explicit Euler product for the co-type zeta function of $\\mathbb{Z}[2^{\\frac{1}{3}}]$, and computing the composition of cubic ideals in terms of the roots $\\mu_1 \\pmod {m_1}$ and $\\mu_2 \\pmod {m_2}$.",
