    "abstract": "Diabetes is a deadly and costly disease. The number of adults in the United States with newly diagnosed diabetes has nearly tripled from 1980 to 2011. At the current pace, 1 in 3 US adults will have diabetes in their lifetime. Currently, 14 classes of drugs are available to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus, but only 36% of patients with type 2 diabetes achieve glycemic control with the currently available therapies. Therefore, new treatment options are desperately needed.Despite the availability of many pharmacotherapies, in 2011 an estimated 3.1 million (14.9%) patients with type 2 diabetes still reported not taking medications to treat their diabetes. Patient compliance is a major obstacle facing practicing clinicians on a daily basis. New treatment options are desperately needed, but efficacy and tolerability are no longer the only criteria contributing to the success of a drug. Ease of administration, convenient dosing frequency, being weight control friendly, and having a low risk for hypoglycemia are important factors for the survival of a new drug in the US healthcare system. The present review is focused on important new drugs and drug classes in the pipeline, as well as on recently approved drugs, including sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 agents, and new insulin therapies, as well as on the technologic improvements in the delivery and dosing frequency of some of the currently available drugs.In the United States, diabetes can be expected to continue to wreak significant human and financial tolls. The associated complications will continue to climb if they are not controlled and stopped. New therapies for diabetes are clearly needed that will better address these unmet needs. The common threads among the emerging therapies are their convenience of administration and dosing frequency, which are important to the improvement of patient adherence.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Central nervous system (CNS) events are frequently reported among patients with advanced prostate cancer as a consequence of the treatments used in this patient population. OBJECTIVE To assess the incidence of CNS events in patients with advanced prostate cancer who initiated treatment with abiraterone acetate, bicalutamide, enzalutamide, or chemotherapy. METHODS The Truven Health MarketScan Research databases were used to retrospectively identify patients with prostate cancer who initiated treatment with abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, bicalutamide, or chemotherapy after September 1, 2012 (ie, the index date). The chemotherapy agents included cabazitaxel, docetaxel, mitoxantrone hydrochloride, and estramustine, and were used as monotherapy or as combination therapy. Patients were followed until December 31, 2014, the end of exposure to treatment, or until loss to follow-up. Kaplan-Meier rates and adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare the incidence of CNS events between the abiraterone acetate cohort and the other cohorts. A sensitivity analysis of patients with a diagnosis of metastasis was also conducted. RESULTS A total of 1067 patients receiving abiraterone acetate, 5524 receiving bicalutamide, 592 receiving enzalutamide, and 256 receiving chemotherapy were identified. After 12 months, patients who received abiraterone acetate were less likely to have a CNS event than patients who received enzalutamide (39.5% vs 46.0%, respectively; P = .0036) or chemotherapy (39.5% vs 51.1%, respectively; P = .0277), and were more likely to have a CNS event than patients who received bicalutamide (39.5% vs 34.2%, respectively; P = .0397). After multivariate adjustment, at 12 months, patients who initiated abiraterone acetate treatment had 20% (P = .0388) reduction in the risk for a CNS event compared with patients who initiated enzalutamide; 8% (P = .3622) versus bicalutamide; and 27% (P = .0456) versus chemotherapy. The sensitivity analysis yielded similar results. CONCLUSION The results of this large observational study suggest that among patients with metastatic prostate cancer, treatment with abiraterone acetate is associated with a significantly lower likelihood of having a CNS event compared with treatment with enzalutamide or chemotherapy, but not with bicalutamide, even when controlling for metastatic disease.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 130 million to 170 million individuals worldwide, including 3.2 million Americans, are infected with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV), making it the most common blood-borne disease.1,2 Chronic HCV infection is a silent epidemic; the disease can remain quiescent for decades before clinically significant symptoms appear.3\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of HCV and its complications are expected to rise as Americans who are currently living with HCV enter their 50s and 60s.4 Research indicates that by 2015, more than 3 million individuals will have HCV infection that has been present for 20 years or more, which will result in a significant increase in the incidence of advanced liver disease, including cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, and liver cancer.5,6 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that for every 100 individuals infected with HCV, 1 to 5 will die from liver cancer or cirrhosis.1\r\n\r\nIn addition to causing substantial morbidity and mortality, HCV is associated with significant financial consequences.3,7 A 2000 study estimated that between 2010 and 2019, the direct medical expenditures for HCV-related conditions will reach nearly $11 billion, the cost of morbidity from disability related to decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma would reach approximately $21 billion, and the societal cost of premature mortality for patients aged <65 years will exceed $54 billion (in 1999 US dollars).7\r\n\r\nHCV is currently the only chronic viral infection that is curable with antiviral therapy. The goals of current anti-HCV approaches are to eradicate infection, to avoid complications, and to prevent the spread of HCV to others.8\r\n\r\nIn the early 1990s, single-agent interferon was the standard of care for patients with HCV infection. Single-agent interferon represented a significant therapeutic advancement, because until then there was no treatment available for HCV infection; however, single-agent interferon offered a sustained virologic response (SVR) rate of less than 10% in patients with HCV genotype 1, the most common HCV subtype.8 Interferon was then used in combination with ribavirin, increasing the SVR rate by another 14% to 22%.8 In the early 2000s, once-weekly pegylated forms of interferon were introduced. The combination of pegylated interferon with ribavirin increased SVR rates to more than 50% in patients with HCV genotype 1. However, HCV genotype 1 was less responsive than HCV genotype 2 or 3.9,10 Because of this variability in HCV response, low response rates in common HCV subpopulations (ie, black patients, patients with cirrhosis), and side effects associated with interferon and ribavirin, there remained a need to develop novel antiviral therapies.8\r\n\r\nThe treatment options for patients with HCV have evolved significantly in the past several years. In 2011, 2 first-generation protease inhibitors, telaprevir and boceprevir (also known as direct-acting antiviral drugs), were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).11,12 Both agents offered significant efficacy in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection as measured by SVR rates.11,12\r\n\r\nIn December 2013, the FDA approved sofosbuvir (Sovaldi) in combination with ribavirin—the first interferon-free, all-oral regimen—for the treatment of patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3.13,14 In addition, sofosbuvir in combination with interferon and ribavirin is approved for the treatment of patients with HCV genotype 1 and genotype 4.13,14 Candidates for sofosbuvir therapy include patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who meet Milan criteria (ie, awaiting liver transplantation) and patients with HCV/HIV-1 coinfection.13,14 Sofosbuvir regimens require less treatment time than older combination regimens—12 weeks for patients with HCV genotype 1, 2, or 4; and 24 weeks for patients with HCV genotype 3.14\r\n\r\nIn October 2014, the FDA approved the fixed-dose combination capsule of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir (Harvoni) for the treatment of patients with HCV genotype 1 infection.15 This once-daily combination tablet was the first regimen approved for HCV genotype 1 without interferon or ribavirin.15\r\n\r\nInterest in novel therapies for HCV remain strong in light of the increasing incidence of HCV (and its costly complications), unmet patient needs, and the identification of new drug targets.16 Efforts continue, with the goals of improving the pharmacokinetics and the tolerability of these agents, as well as determining treatment strategies––interferon-containing and interferon-free (all oral) regimens––that optimize outcomes.17",

Objectives To review the capabilities and limitations of 5 of the most notable value frameworks in oncology that have emerged in recent years and to compare their relative value and application among the intended stakeholders. Methods We compared the methodology of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Value Framework (version 2.0), the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Evidence Blocks, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center DrugAbacus, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review Value Assessment Framework, and the European Society for Medical Oncology Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale, using a side-by-side comparative approach in terms of the input, scoring methodology, and output of each framework. In addition, we gleaned stakeholder insights about these frameworks and their potential real-world applications through dialogues with physicians and payers, as well as through secondary research and an aggregate analysis of previously published survey results. Results The analysis identified several framework-specific themes in their respective focus on clinical trial elements, breadth of evidence, evidence weighting, scoring methodology, and value to stakeholders. Our dialogues with physicians and our aggregate analysis of previous surveys revealed a varying level of awareness of, and use of, each of the value frameworks in clinical practice. For example, although the ASCO Value Framework appears nascent in clinical practice, physicians believe that the frameworks will be more useful in practice in the future as they become more established and as their outputs are more widely accepted. Conclusions Along with patients and payers, who bear the burden of treatment costs, physicians and policymakers have waded into the discussion of defining value in oncology care, as well as pharmaceutical companies that seek to understand the impact of these value frameworks on each stakeholder, as they model the value and financial threshold of innovative, high-cost drugs.",

The prevalence of narcolepsy is approximately 0.05%, and onset generally occurs during the first 2 decades of life. Narcolepsy is believed to be an autoimmune disorder with destruction of hypocretin-producing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. OBJECTIVES To provide an enhanced understanding of narcolepsy and establish the need for early diagnosis and rapid initiation of effective treatment for patients with narcolepsy. DISCUSSION Narcolepsy reduces daily functioning and is associated with a substantial medical and economic burden, with many patients being on full disability. The annual direct medical costs are approximately 2-fold higher in patients with narcolepsy than in matched controls without this condition ($11,702 vs $5261, respectively; P <.0001). Further contributing to the overall burden is a lack of recognition of the signs and symptoms of narcolepsy and an absence of easily measurable biomarkers, resulting in a diagnostic delay that often exceeds 10 years and may be associated with misdiagnosis and inappropriate resource utilization. Because narcolepsy generally has an onset in childhood or in adolescence, is often misdiagnosed, has no known cure, and requires lifelong treatment, it is an important disease from a managed care perspective. Clinical features, as well as objective testing, should be used to ensure the timely diagnosis and treatment of patients with narcolepsy. CONCLUSION Policies for the diagnosis and treatment of narcolepsy should be based on the current treatment guidelines, but they should also encourage shared decisions between clinicians and patients to allow for individualized diagnostic and treatment choices, as suggested in best practice recommendations.",

OBJECTIVES To evaluate treatment patterns and patient adherence to abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide therapy in real-world practice, and to examine the factors that may be associated with medication dose reduction in patients with metastatic CRPC. METHODS Retrospective analyses were conducted using the Truven Health MarketScan research databases among patients with metastatic CRPC who initiated treatment with abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide between October 1, 2012, and December 31, 2014 (index date). The patients were followed for up to 12 months, and their baseline characteristics were assessed during the 6 months before the index date. Medication adherence was measured at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postindex using medication possession ratios (MPRs), and dose reduction was measured using refill gaps and relative dose intensity over the entire observation period. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between the initial treatment and the risk for dose reduction. RESULTS The study included 2591 and 807 patients who initiated treatment with abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide, respectively. At 6, 9, and 12 months postindex, the patients who initiated abiraterone acetate had higher MPRs than the patients who initiated enzalutamide. In addition, the patients who initiated abiraterone acetate had lower Kaplan-Meier rates of dose reduction across 4 measurements for dose reduction. All hazard ratios for treatment (abiraterone acetate vs enzalutamide) were significantly lower than 1 (range, 0.57-0.80), indicating a lower risk for dose reduction associated with abiraterone acetate. CONCLUSION Patients who initiated abiraterone acetate therapy had higher medication adherence and lower risk for dose reduction than those who initiated enzalutamide therapy. Improved medication adherence may be associated with longer duration of treatment, which in turn may lead to better survival. Further research is needed to assess the potential effect of medication adherence on the overall survival of patients with metastatic CRPC.",

    "abstract": "Oral anticoagulation has changed drastically in the past 4 years with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of 3 new agents—dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban. Warfar-in has had a primary role in oral anticoagulation therapy for many decades. Although its efficacy and safety have been established, therapy with warfarin is associated with significant challenges, including the need for frequent monitoring, drug interactions, a delayed time to onset, and a narrow therapeutic index.1,2 The challenges associated with warfarin not only affect its efficacy, but they also impact patient satisfaction. These concerns have contributed to the development of novel oral anticoagulants, beginning with dabigatran etexilate.\r\n\r\nDabigatran etexilate, a direct thrombin inhibitor, was approved by the FDA in October 2010 and is the first novel oral anticoagulant approved to reduce the risk for stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF).3 Results from the Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy (RE-LY) study demonstrated the superiority of dabigatran 150 mg orally twice daily compared with warfarin for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF.4 In that study, the rate of major bleeding was similar between the agents; however, dabigatran demonstrated a lower risk for intracranial hemorrhage, but with an increased risk for major gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, compared with warfarin.4\r\n\r\nA recent analysis performed by the FDA confirmed these findings.5,6 In this analysis, compared with warfarin, dabigatran demonstrated lower rates of ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and death; however, dabigatran was associated with a significant increase in major GI bleeding.5,6 In April 2014, dabigatran received new FDA indications for the treatment of patients with deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) and for the risk reduction of recurrent DVT and PE in previously treated patients. Two studies, RE-COVER and RE-COVER II, compared dabigatran 150 mg twice daily with warfarin for the treatment of DVT and PE after 5 to 10 days of parenteral anticoagulation. Both studies demonstrated dabigatran's noninferiority to warfarin.7,8 When the RE-COVER study was initiated, dabigatran was the only agent approved by the FDA for the risk reduction of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE).\r\n\r\nIn November 2011, rivaroxaban, a factor Xa inhibitor, was the second novel oral anticoagulant to receive FDA approval to reduce the risk for stroke in patients with NVAF.9 Results from the ROCKET AF trial demonstrated the noninferiority of rivaroxaban to warfarin for the first occurrence of stroke or systemic embolism.10 In November 2012, rivaroxaban received an additional indication for the treatment of and reduction in the risk for recurrent VTE. Two studies, EINSTEIN-DVT and EINSTEIN-PE, compared rivaroxaban (at an initial dose of 15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks, followed by 20 mg once daily) with enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice daily for at least 5 days with warfarin and then continued with warfarin after the target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0 was reached.11,12 Both studies demonstrated the noninferiority of rivaroxaban to warfarin in time to first recurrent DVT or PE event.11,12\r\n\r\nIn December 2012, the factor Xa inhibitor apixaban was the newest novel oral anticoagulant to receive FDA approval to reduce the risk for stroke in patients with NVAF.13 The ARISTOTLE trial compared apixaban 5 mg twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily in select patients) with warfarin.14 Apixaban was superior to warfarin for the primary end point of reducing the risks for stroke and systemic embolism. Superiority to warfarin was primarily attributable to reductions in hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic transformation compared with warfarin.14\r\n\r\nIn AVERROES, patients with NVAF who were not candidates for therapy with warfarin were randomized to treatment with apixaban 5 mg twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily in select patients) or to aspirin 81 mg to 324 mg once daily.15 The primary objective of the study was to determine if apixaban was superior to aspirin for preventing the outcomes of stroke or systemic embolism. This trial was stopped early on the basis of a prespecified interim analysis that showed significant reductions in stroke and systemic embolism with apixaban compared with aspirin, but apixaban was associated with a modest increase in major bleeding.15\r\n\r\n\r\nKEY POINTS\r\n▸ Anticoagulation has changed drastically in the past 4 years in the United States with the FDA approval of novel oral anticoagulants, starting with dabigatran in 2010, rivaroxaban in 2011, and apixaban in 2012.\r\n▸ These new anticoagulants present a safe alternative to warfarin for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in the setting of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF).\r\n▸ However, although anticoagulation has been simplified with the novel oral drugs, many safety issues must be considered when prescribing these agents.\r\n▸ This retrospective chart review at a community hospital analyzed the appropriateness use of dabigatran, the first novel anticoagulant to receive FDA approval for the treatment of NVAF.\r\n▸ Of the 458 patients included in this study, 76 patients were prescribed an inappropriate, mostly too high, dose of dabigatran.\r\n▸ Although dabigatran is only approved for the treatment of NVAF, 13 patients had valvular disease.\r\n▸ The majority of the patients were also receiving concomitant medications that are known to have drug interactions with dabigatran.\r\n▸ These results indicate that high-risk medications require better monitoring of prescribing habits to improve patient safety and outcomes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe current guidelines for the treatment of atrial fibrillation provide a class I recommendation for warfarin (level of evidence A) and dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban (level of evidence B) for the prevention of thromboembolism in patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of ≥2.16\r\n\r\nDabigatran provides an effective alternative therapy to warfarin. It offers a predictable pharmacokinetic profile, which eliminates the need for routine monitoring of serum drug concentrations. Approximately 80% of dabigatran is excreted renally and requires dose reductions for patients with reduced creatinine clearance.17 Although dabigatran addresses some of the challenges associated with warfarin, there are remaining issues regarding the use of dabigatran.\r\n\r\nWarfarin interacts with numerous medications, disease states, and a variety of foods containing vitamin K; however, there is a great deal of clinical experience and resources available to effectively manage many of warfarin's interactions.1 Unlike warfarin, dabigatran is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes and has fewer drug interactions. Although several drug interactions with dabigatran and P-glycoprotein inducers and inhibitors have been identified, little guidance has been provided on how to address them in practice.18\r\n\r\nAdditional concerns surrounding dabigatran include the lack of a reversal agent and the lack of availability of laboratory testing to determine its degree of anticoagulation activity. Dabigatran prolongs markers of coagulation, such as the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and ecarin clotting time, and may potentially impact INR values. The aPTT can only provide an approximation of the anticoagulation effect of dabigatran, and the INR is relatively insensitive to the degree of anticoagulation. The ecarin clotting time is a more specific parameter to determine the effect of anticoagulation19; however, most laboratories are not adequately equipped to perform the laboratory test. Without laboratory parameters to guide dosing adjustments, it is unclear how to balance the drug interactions that have been identified to potentially increase or decrease dabigatran serum concentrations. The lack of monitoring also makes it difficult to manage special populations that typically require dosage adjustments (eg, the elderly, obese patients, underweight patients, and those with renal dysfunction).\r\n\r\nSince dabigatran became the first oral anticoagulant to be introduced to the US market, and the first to be included on hospital formularies, there has been a dramatic shift in the approach to anticoagulation. Laboratory markers of anticoagulation effect are no longer reliable, drug interactions require significantly less dose adjustments, and renal function continually needs to be addressed.20 The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of dabigatran at a community hospital between December 2010 and June 2012 and to identify prescribing areas that can be improved to ensure appropriate use and patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Background Approximately 24% of adults in the United States have visible varicose veins, and an estimated 6% have evidence of advanced chronic venous disease. The majority of individuals with varicose veins seek treatment because of symptoms, such as aching, throbbing, fatigue, pruritus, ankle swelling, and tenderness, rather than cosmetic reasons. Furthermore, varicose veins are a manifestation of chronic venous insufficiency, which can progress to leg pain, leg edema, chronic skin changes, and nonhealing ulcers. Objective To assess varicose vein treatment patterns and their corresponding outcomes, including additional treatment rates, disease progression to new ulcers, and associated costs from a US perspective. Methods We conducted a retrospective claims database study using data from the Truven Health MarketScan database. Adults who were newly diagnosed with varicose veins between January 1, 2008, and June 30, 2010, and met the study inclusion criteria were eligible to participate and were divided into 6 cohorts based on the type of first or initial therapy they received after the index diagnosis date, including surveillance and compression therapy, surgery, laser ablation, radiofrequency ablation, sclerotherapy, or multiple therapies. The patients were followed for 2 years after the index diagnosis date to assess their treatment patterns and outcomes. Results A total of 144,098 patients met the study criteria. Of these patients, 100,072 (69.5%) were under surveillance for disease progression and/or received compression therapy; 14,007 (9.7%) received laser ablation; 9125 (6.3%) received radiofrequency ablation; 4778 (3.3%) received sclerotherapy; 4851 (3.4%) had surgery; and 11,265 (7.8%) received multiple therapies. During the 2-year follow-up period, among patients receiving interventional treatment, 54.7% of patients received additional interventional treatment (either with the same mode or a different mode from the initial treatment); 30.1% had >1 postintervention claim for symptomatic varicose veins (not including additional procedures) at 8 weeks; and 44.2% had >1 postintervention claim for symptomatic varicose veins at 1 year after the initial interventional therapy. Conclusions A majority of the patients in the study received conservative management. For patients receiving interventional therapy, the outcomes varied based on the treatment cohort. The surgery cohort was associated with the most favorable outcome regarding the need for additional treatment and evidence of postintervention claims for symptomatic varicose veins, followed by the multiple therapies cohort. A better understanding of these treatment outcomes in the real-world setting may affect new strategies to improve the management of patients with varicose veins.",

    "abstract": "Background Spending on biologic drugs is a significant driver of drug expenditures for payers in private health plans. Biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are some of the most effective and costly treatments in a physician's arsenal. Understanding the total annual expenditure, the average cost per prescription, and the impact of cost-sharing is important for drug benefit managers. Objective To assess drug utilization, expenditures, out-of-pocket (OOP) cost, and price trends of biologic DMARDs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a large managed care organization. Methods We conducted a retrospective database analysis of pharmacy claims data from January 2004 to December 2013 using the Optum Clinformatics Data Mart database, which covers 13.3 million lives. Pharmacy claims for 40,373 patients with RA were identified during the study period. In all, 9 biologic DMARDs approved for the treatment of RA, including infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, certoizumab, golimumab, tocilizumab, anakinra, abatacept, and rituximab, and 1 nonbiologic oral, small molecule-targeted synthetic drug, tofacitinib, were included in this study. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the total annual number of prescriptions, the total annual expenditures, the average annual cost per drug (a proxy of drug price), and the average OOP cost (copay plus deductible and coinsurance). All measurements were also stratified by study drugs and by insurance type. Results Of the 40,373 patients with RA included in the study, approximately 76% were female (mean age, 55 years at diagnosis). Approximately 77% of the patients were white, and almost 48% lived in the South or Midwest region of the United States. Approximately 62% of patients had a point of service insurance plan. Expenditures on biologic DMARDs increased from $166 million in 2004 to $243 million in 2013, and the number of prescriptions and refills increased from 59,960 in 2004 to 105,295 in 2013. Prescriptions for biologic DMARDs increased more than 20% per patient from 2004 to 2013. The average cost per prescription remained relatively unchanged, at approximately $2300 per prescription, but the OOP expenditures increased from $36 (2.5%) per prescription to $128 (7%) during the study period. The OOP expenditures increased the most in HMO plans and in plans categorized as other (284% and 388%, respectively). Conclusions Spending on biologic DMARDs has been primarily driven by an increase in prescribing rates, as the average amount reimbursed per prescription remained relatively unchanged over time, despite a regular annual increase to the average wholesale acquisition cost of 2% to 10%. The OOP burden for patients has increased, but this does not appear to have limited the use of biologic DMARDs. The entrance of new biologic and nonbiologic DMARDs into the market in the past few years is eroding the market share for several established drugs, and may lead to different results, warranting a study of new trends.",

These objectives become particularly laudable for patient populations receiving biologic agents to treat chronic or life-threatening conditions.\r\n\r\nIn this article, the value proposition for biosimilars is characterized as one that moves beyond the cost reduction argument appropriately encountered for small-molecule generic drugs and into a framework that is more nuanced, incorporating the perspective of regulators, physicians, patients, and payers into an overall statement of value.\r\n\r\nUsing a nonprobability-based survey sampling from 17 payers (convenience sample in the United States [N = 7] and in the European Union [N = 10]), 50 practicing physicians (convenience sample within the United States [N = 15] and in the European Union [N = 35]), and 91 international investigative sites (purposive sample),2 as well as a review of the available published evidence, we developed a framework for assessing value for biosimilars.\r\n\r\n\r\nKEY POINTS\r\n▸ A biosimilar drug is a biological compound that is very similar to the reference drug, with no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, and potency.\r\n▸ There are significant international differences in the experience related to the development and clinical use of biosimilar drugs.\r\n▸ In March 2015, the FDA approved the first biosimilar in the United States.\r\n▸ As the US market for biosimilars transitions from clinical development to commercialization, multiple stakeholders who influence formulary placement, reimbursement, and the adoption of a biosimilar will shape the value proposition of biosimilars.\r\n▸ This article presents survey data from payers, providers, and international drug investigation sites showing that conflicting and convergent demands exist for biosimilars.\r\n▸ The authors build on and extend the current literature on biosimilars' market entry, arguing that payers expect biosimilars to induce price competition leading to potential positive economic returns.\r\n▸ Addressing the barriers and challenges related to payers, providers, and patients during clinical trial development will help to ensure a successful adoption and commercialization of biosimilars into the US market.\r\n▸ Although the impetus for a biosimilar development originally might have been solely economic, the authors argue that manufacturers should devise a value proposition for biosimilar compounds that moves beyond price, demonstrating value to payers, physicians, and patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese data provide milestones to guide critical development and commercialization decisions related to biosimilars.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that has a substantial economic impact on patients. Patients with RA are at an increased risk for disability and for loss of income. The inclusion of biologic drugs in RA therapy has increased the cost of treatment. Little is known about the relationship between sociodemographic characteristics and the out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditures for prescription drugs for patients with RA, including biologics, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, and analgesics. OBJECTIVES To explore the relationship between sociodemographic characteristics, personal characteristics, and OOP expenditures associated with RA prescription medications. A secondary objective was to measure the average OOP expenditures for different therapeutic classes of RA medications, including biologics, DMARDs, NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and analgesics. METHODS In this retrospective analysis of Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data from 2009 to 2012, we identified a patient sample of 1090 adults with RA, which represented approximately 9.71 million patients in the MEPS database. The total OOP expenditure was calculated based on the OOP expenditure for each prescription drug corresponding to an individual. Patient variables included age, race, sex, insurance status, number of comorbid conditions, region, area of living, annual family income, and marital status. Logistic regression and generalized linear models were used for analysis. The mean OOP expenditure for therapeutic classes was estimated using nonparametric percentiles from 1000 cluster bootstrap estimates. RESULTS Overall, the mean annual OOP expenditure was $273.99 (95% confidence interval [CI], $197.07-$364.75). The OOP expenditures were lower for privately insured (0.31; 95% CI, 0.21-0.45) patients and publicly insured (0.18; 95% CI, 0.12-0.27) patients versus uninsured patients, and for poor (0.60; 95% CI, 0.43-0.84) and low-income (0.69; 95% CI, 0.49-0.97) patients versus high-income patients. The mean annual OOP expenditure decreased with age (0.98; 95% CI, 0.97-0.99), was lower (0.73; 95% CI, 0.58-0.92) for male patients than for female patients, and increased with the presence of comorbidities (1.16; 95% CI, 1.07-1.25). The average annual OOP expenditure was highest for biologics ($2556.73), followed by DMARDs ($89.37). The average annual OOP expenditures were $27.97, $52.36, and $72.51 for corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and narcotic analgesics, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Age, sex, race, income level, insurance status, and comorbidity status significantly affected patient OOP expenditure. Higher OOP expenditures among the uninsured, female patients, patients with low income levels, and patients with several comorbidities could adversely affect RA therapy. The use of expensive biologics needs to be monitored to reduce prescription-related cost-sharing among patients with RA.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Increasingly, third-party payers are requiring patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) to participate in specialty pharmacy management programs to improve their adherence to their prescribed medications. The effects of specialty pharmacy care on MS clinical outcomes have not yet been comprehensively examined in the literature. OBJECTIVE To compare the effectiveness of specialty pharmacy care and usual community pharmacy care MS outcomes. METHODS Inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy claims for patients with MS were extracted from a major national pharmacy benefit management company's databases for this retrospective cohort study. Enrollees with continuous medical and pharmacy benefits were followed for 3 years. MS relapse status was defined by a specific algorithm and was compared in patients who had specialty pharmacy care and those with usual community pharmacy care. The outcome measures included time to the first and second disease relapses and the number of relapses. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed on the time to first and second relapses, and generalized linear regression models were performed on the number of disease relapses. RESULTS The study cohort included 1731 eligible patients with MS, of whom 1427 received specialty pharmacy care. During the study period, between 2006 and 2009, 1634 relapses were identified, with a mean annual relapse rate of 0.3 among the specialty pharmacy care group versus 0.4 among the usual pharmacy care group. Specialty pharmacy care was associated with a lower risk for disease relapse, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.607-0.871) for the first relapse and HR of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.610-1.002) for the second relapse. When controlling for demographics, comorbidities, and index medications, specialty pharmacy care was associated with a lower risk for disease relapse with HR of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.680-0.985) for first relapse versus usual pharmacy care. The time to second relapse was not significantly different between the 2 groups in the unadjusted and adjusted Cox regression models. In addition, a generalized linear regression model showed that specialty pharmacy care, index age, geographic North region, 3-year Chronic Disease Score, and Elixhauser comorbidity measure were significantly associated with the number of disease relapses. CONCLUSION These results show that specialty pharmacy care is associated with a significantly lower risk for disease relapse in patients with MS (specifically the first relapse) and fewer relapses compared with usual community pharmacy care.",

Adverse events associated with the use of topical medications for rosacea may lead to a lack of treatment adherence. Previous studies have reported low treatment adherence rates among patients with rosacea. Objective To describe the rate of treatment discontinuation resulting from adverse events and the associated healthcare costs among patients with rosacea who are receiving a topical medication. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with rosacea based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code 695.3 who were newly initiating topical treatment with metronidazole, azelaic acid, sodium sulfacetamide/sulfur, or benzoyl peroxide between January 1, 2009, and September 30, 2013. Patients were identified from the MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database and the Medicare Supplemental database and had to be aged ≥30 years, have continuous coverage with medical and pharmacy benefits ≥12 months before treatment and ≥3 months after treatment inititation, and have no evidence of oral antibiotic use or ocular rosacea during the study period. The 3-month period immediately after the index date (ie, first topical rosacea treatment) was defined as the postindex period and was used to evaluate the outcome measures, which included the rate of adverse events, treatment patterns, and healthcare costs. Results The final cohort included 49,351 patients, with a mean age of 54 years, and 74.5% of the patients were female. Metronidazole was the most common (72.7%) treatment, followed by azelaic acid (21.7%), sodium sulfacetamide/sulfur (3.4%), and benzoyl peroxide (2.2%). A total of 6270 (12.7%) patients had a coded adverse event, of whom 199 (3.2%) continued treatment despite the adverse event, 466 (7.4%) switched to another treatment within 8.8 days, and 5605 (89.4%) discontinued therapy within 31.1 days. Patients with adverse events incurred, on average, a cost of $325 (medical, $143; pharmacy, $182) in rosacea-related costs; patients without adverse events incurred, on average, a cost of $172 (medical, $14; pharmacy, $157) in rosacea-related costs. Conclusions The majority of adverse events associated with current topical drugs for rosacea resulted in treatment switch or discontinuation. Drugs with a different mechanism of action or new formulations of existing drugs may provide additional treatment options for patients and may lead to improved adherence and better symptom control.",

    "abstract": "Background Prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in men in developed countries. Using molecular testing may help to improve outcomes in this clinically challenging group. Since 2011, the Prostate Core Mitomic Test (PCMT), which quantifies a 3.4-kb mitochondrial DNA deletion strongly associated with prostate cancer, has been used by more than 50 urology practices accessing pathology services through our laboratory in New Jersey. However, the use of a molecular test can only be beneficial if it affects patient management and improves outcomes. Objective To determine whether repeated biopsy decision-making was affected in a quantifiable manner through the adjunct use of molecular testing with the PCMT. Methods In this observational study we conducted 2 independent, structured query language database queries of our patient records at our laboratory, QDx Pathology Services, in Cranford, NJ. Query 1 included all men who had a negative prostate biopsy and a negative PCMT between February 1, 2011, and June 30, 2013. Men with a previous diagnosis of cancer were excluded. Query 2 included all men who had a negative prostate biopsy and a repeated biopsy between February 1, 2011, and September 30, 2013. The data exported for each query included the unique specimen number for an index biopsy, the interval between biopsies where present, the unique specimen number for a follow-up biopsy where present, histopathology for all biopsies, the biopsy procedure dates, the patient's date of birth, and the PCMT result when utilized. The patient rebiopsy rates and intervals were compared between the patients who were using PCMT and those who were not to assess whether the adjunct use of the PCMT impacted the rebiopsy decision-making process. Results Query 1 identified 644 men who had a negative biopsy and a negative PCMT result within the study period. Query 2 identified 823 men with a repeat biopsy after the initial negative index biopsy within the study period. Of these men, 132 had PCMT to inform their care. This patient population of 1467 men originated from US-based clinical urology practices. Evaluation of the impact on physician behavior demonstrated a general trend toward the earlier detection of prostate cancer on repeat biopsy by an average of 2.5 months and a coincident increase in cancer detection rates for urologists using the deletion assay in their rebiopsy decision-making process. Importantly, this trend was only observed when men with atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP) on index biopsy were not considered. In the 644 men with a negative PCMT result, only 35 (5.4%) were subjected to a follow-up biopsy, with 5 (14.3%) of the 35 men identified as having cancer. Finally, the cohort of 132 men who had PCMT and repeat biopsy was compared with the published data supporting PCMT's ability to predict rebiopsy outcome. The key metrics of sensitivity and negative predictive value were comparable and within the 95% confidence intervals of the reported work. Conclusion Molecular tests, such as the PCMT, are useful in addressing the sampling error of prostate needle biopsy and providing additional evidence to inform the clinical uncertainty regarding initial negative prostate biopsy when ASAP is not present. Longitudinal monitoring of clinical impact indicators provides the necessary inputs to better allocation of healthcare resources in the short- and long-term.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), the 2 subtypes of pulmonary hypertension, are chronic, debilitating, and life-threatening conditions. Despite the differences in etiologies between PAH and CTEPH, both are primarily characterized by vascular remodeling that results in progressive right heart failure and death.1–3 Based on a recent US analysis of risk stratification in patients with PAH, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates are 92%, 75%, and 66%, respectively.4 Similarly, in a UK-based study conducted between 2001 and 2006, the 1- and 3-year survival rates for patients with inoperable CTEPH were 82% and 70%, respectively.5\r\n\r\n\r\nKEY POINTS\r\n▸ Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) are debilitating, progressing, and life-threatening conditions.\r\n▸ Despite improved outcomes with prostacyclin analogs, endothelin receptor antagonists, and PDE-5 inhibitors, PAH remains a progressive and fatal disease, with poor survival.\r\n▸ Riociguat is an oral, first-in-class soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator and is the only FDA-approved agent for the treatment of patients with either condition—PAH or CTEPH.\r\n▸ This is the first budget impact analysis of adding riociguat to a US health plan for the treatment of patients with PAH or CTEPH.\r\n▸ In this analysis, the per-member per-year cost of adding riociguat to the treatment regimen was $0.27 and the per-member per-month (PMPM) cost was $0.02.\r\n▸ A sensitivity analysis indicated that the economic impact increased by $0.01 PMPM, with a 25% increase in base-case parameter values.\r\n▸ This study shows that providing insurance coverage for this first-in-class, effective treatment for patients with PAH or CTEPH, has a minimal economic impact on a health plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the United States, the prevalence of PAH per 1 million individuals is estimated to be 109 patients in persons aged <65 years, and 451 patients in older persons aged ≥65 years.6 The prevalence of CTEPH per 1 million individuals is estimated to be 63 patients in persons aged <65 years and 1007 patients among older persons aged ≥65 years.6 However, the true prevalence of PAH and of CTEPH is difficult to measure, because of the underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis of these diseases, and the lack of specific International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification codes for these 2 conditions.6,7\r\n\r\nThe existing strategies that are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of PAH involve the use of prostacyclin analogs, such as treprostinil and iloprost (including inhaled, injectable, or oral prostanoids); endothelin receptor antagonists, such as ambrisentan and bosentan; and/or phosphodiesterase (PDE)-5 inhibitors. Although not approved by the FDA for PAH, calcium channel blockers, in particular L-type calcium channel blockers (eg, nifedipine), can be effective, but they are only safe for patients who respond to a one-time vasodilator challenge (ie, vasoreactive-positive patients).8 Despite improved outcomes with prostacyclin analogs, endothelin receptor antagonists, and PDE-5 inhibitors, PAH remains a progressive and fatal disease, with poor survival rates.4\r\n\r\nIn patients with CTEPH, the treatment of choice is pulmonary endarterectomy; however, in 20% to 40% of patients, CTEPH is deemed to be inoperable. In addition, 10% to 20% of patients who undergo pulmonary endarterectomy have persistent or recurrent pulmonary hypertension after surgery.9–11 In these patients, there is a significant unmet need for an effective alternative treatment to surgical intervention or for a bridging therapy before pulmonary endarterectomy.\r\n\r\nThe safety and efficacy of riociguat, an oral, first-in-class soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, have been evaluated in 2 phase 3 randomized controlled clinical trials, 1 trial in patients with PAH12 and 1 trial in patients with CTEPH.13 Riociguat has a dual mode of action of increasing the sensitivity of soluble guanylate cyclase to nitric oxide and directly stimulating the soluble guanylate cyclase independent of nitric oxide availability, which can increase hemodynamic and exercise capacity in patients with PAH.12,13\r\n\r\nIn October 2013, riociguat was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults with PAH (World Health Organization [WHO] Group 1) to improve exercise capacity and WHO functional class and to delay the clinical worsening, and for the treatment of patients with inoperable or with persistent or recurrent CTEPH (WHO Group 4) to improve exercise capacity and WHO functional class.14\r\n\r\nThe objective of the present study was to measure the economic impact of adding riociguat to the drug formulary of a US health plan for the treatment of patients with PAH who are inoperable or who have persistent or recurrent CTEPH.",

Many automated systems have replaced manual systems but may be fraught with challenges, especially when multiple users are involved. OBJECTIVE To describe the characteristics of controlled substance discrepancies observed in a Level I trauma hospital for Medicare. METHODS Discrepancy data were captured for each user involved in a transaction for a controlled substance at the Level I trauma hospital (in Ben Taub Hospital, Houston, TX), and the information was stored in a computerized database repository. Data for the 1-year study period (from January 1 through December 31, 2013) were collected for Medicare beneficiaries, using an Excel 2013 spreadsheet, and were analyzed according to basic discrepancy characteristics and descriptive statistics. RESULTS During the 12-month study period, 114,000 controlled substance discrepancies were found for 100,000 Medicare patients at this Level I trauma hospital. Vending activities accounted for the majority (52.6%) of these discrepancies. Discrepancies were most likely to occur on Wednesdays, and the medications involved most frequently were combination drugs of hydrocodone and acetaminophen. CONCLUSION Approximately 1 (1.14) discrepancy involving a controlled substance occurred for each Medicare patient treated at the study facility. Healthcare institutions need to improve their efforts to ensure high-quality care and prevent diversion of drugs.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Given the positive association between primary care and overall health, several health plans are offering doctors' visits without patient copay, with the intent to increase primary care use. However, the effectiveness of these offers has not been established in the literature. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the impact of a free primary care provider (PCP) office visit offered by a health plan on primary care-seeking behaviors. METHODS This nonrandomized concurrent control study used event/trials logistic regression to compare the differences in primary care utilization between new exchange enrollees in Mississippi who were offered a free nonpreventive PCP visit and concurrent controls from Georgia and Tennessee who were not offered a free visit, between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2014, which was the first year of the exchange plans. Regression models adjusted for age, sex, plan type, rural-urban designation, and enrollment month. Visits to alternative sites of care were also assessed. RESULTS The adjusted number of nonpreventive PCP visits did not differ between the states (odds ratio [OR], 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97-1.00). Mississippi residents were significantly more likely to go to the emergency department than the Georgia-Tennessee cohort (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.28-1.39), but they were less likely to visit an urgent care center (OR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.09-0.11) or a retail clinic (OR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.11-0.17) than their counterparts. CONCLUSIONS Despite being eligible for a free nonpreventive visit, enrollees in Mississippi were no more likely than their counterparts in Georgia and Tennessee to visit a PCP. These findings suggest that removing the cost barrier alone may be insufficient to change primary care-seeking behaviors, and other barriers to care should be addressed.",

    "abstract": "Oncology continues to be a major focus for all healthcare stakeholders, attracting intense investments in drug development for new therapies and diagnostics that keep fueling innovation while increasing concerns for the ever-rising cost of cancer care. The call for value-based strategies in oncology has become mainstream, with providers, payers, drug manufacturers, and ultimately patients searching for ways to improve access to new therapies and best practices, implementing clinical pathways, new reimbursement metrics, and patient support services.\r\n\r\nThe growing economic challenges in oncology are taking center stage in medicine. The urgency to consider cost-effective strategies in cancer therapy is of top concern for payers, as is evident in this annual Hematology/Oncology Theme Issue from American Health & Drug Benefits. Therefore, health economics research features prominently in this issue.\r\n\r\nLorie A. Ellis, PhD, and colleagues present a cost analysis and utilization patterns associated with 2 new therapies for patients with metastatic prostate cancer, abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide, which were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in the past 5 years. Although no head-to-head study has yet been conducted, the authors use real-world claims data to compare these novel therapies in a large patient population. Their analysis can help payers to evaluate differentiating characteristics related to these therapies and guide their “management strategies to promote the use of cost-effective treatment regimens,” suggests Matthew Mitchell, PharmD, MBA, FAMCP, in his perspective on this study. “The ability to evaluate…real-world data, such as in the article by Ellis and colleagues, help[s] payers evaluate coverage decisions for patients with prostate cancer,” he observes.\r\n\r\nThe growing need for economic modeling in oncology can provide insight into the complex pharmacoeconomic concerns in oncology and enhance clinical decision-making based on cost, quality, and value considerations, as was discussed previously in this journal.1 Perhaps responding to that call to action, Anuja Roy, PhD, MBA, and colleagues present a model framework for estimating the costs per patient with multiple myeloma using 7 common treatment regimens, to facilitate further budget impact analyses and cost-effectiveness comparisons with these regimens. As James T. Kenney, Jr, RPh, MBA, says in his perspective on this study, “The challenge for health plans is to apply the learning from this research, and to make an effort to assess treatment costs in clinical practice. As pointed out by the authors, clinical trial experience is a good starting point for this analysis; however, real-world evidence is needed to effectively validate the results…. The type of cost analysis presented in this article is critical to the management of future oncology treatments in managed care markets.”\r\n\r\nApplying the implications of health economics research in oncology into everyday patient care provides new opportunities to improve access to best, and affordable, therapies; enhance clinical outcomes; and reduce overall healthcare costs to patients, payers, and the healthcare system as a whole.\r\n\r\nAlso in this issue, Michael Kleinrock, of IMS Health, reflects on innovation in oncology and continuing challenges outlined in the 2015 oncology report from the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics. “Cancer is already the largest clinical area of drug spending in the United States, and a cluster of innovative medicines utilizing new mechanisms of action for patients with a wide variety of tumor types promise to further increase cancer-related spending,” he suggests. In its new report, IMS found that “the total global spending on cancer and supportive care medicines reached the $100 billion threshold globally in 2014,” a full 4 years ahead of its projections last year.\r\n\r\nFinally, the oncology pipeline article in this issue highlights the many promising therapies in late-stage development that may soon become available for a variety of cancers and hematologic malignancies. Certain themes are apparent in the current oncology pipeline, all pointing toward continuing innovation in cancer drug development and a concomitant urgency to address value and cost-effective therapies on a national level. This theme issue is an invitation to all healthcare stakeholders to join this discussion.",

    "abstract": "The high clinical and economic burdens associated with cardiometabolic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity, in the United States present ongoing challenges for patients, providers, payers, drug manufacturers, and the entire healthcare system. Heart disease continues to lead the morbidity and mortality trends in the United States,1 with diabetes lagging not far behind, especially when factoring in individuals with prediabetes.2 Also, the number of obese Americans, especially among the younger population, continues to rise,3 despite efforts by healthcare professionals and the federal government to increase awareness of the risks associated with excess weight.\r\n\r\nThe numbers associated with cardiometabolic conditions in the United States are staggering. In 2011, 76.4 million patients in the United States had hypertension, 16.3 million had chronic heart disease, 7 million had stroke, and 5.7 million had heart failure—all directly increasing the mortality risk from heart disease.1 In 2007, approximately 25.8 million US patients had diabetes, and many millions more had prediabetes.2 Of note, according to new reported published in October 2014, the rate of diabetes doubled between 1990 and 2008 but plateaued between 2008 and 2012, although it increased in some subpopulations.4 Perhaps most alarming, in 2012, 34.9% of US adults and 17% of US youth were obese,3 and it is projected that approximately 21% of the US population will have type 2 diabetes by 2050.5 These numbers should give pause to anyone involved in the attempt to stem these conditions or manage patients with 1 or more of these conditions.\r\n\r\nDespite the wealth of treatment options for heart disease and diabetes, heart disease remains the leading cause of disease-related mortality in the United States,6 and less than 50% of patients with diabetes reach the American Diabetes Association's glycemic goal of hemoglobin A1c <7%.7 Advances in the search for biomarkers and in personalized medicine may help to better understand the biologically and genetically based risk factors for cardiometabolic complications. A barrier in the treatment of obesity is overcoming the issue of lifestyle behavior as the main cause of this condition and accepting it as a medical condition with a unique pathophysiology.8\r\n\r\nThe economic outlook for cardiometabolic conditions is as dire as the clinical picture. In 2007, the estimated total cost associated with diabetes in the United States was $174 billion.2 In 2008, the estimated total cost for obesity was $147 billion. And in 2010, the US healthcare system spent $272.5 billion in direct costs on the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease. Yet, these numbers pale in comparison to the current projections of $818.1 billion that the United States will likely spend by 2030 for the treatment of cardiovascular disease,9 or the $957 billion projected to be spent on obesity by 2030.10 These figures may be enough of an incentive to encourage the pharmaceutical industry and the federal government to devote increasing resources and efforts on innovative therapies for the promotion of cardiometabolic health in the United States and potentially worldwide.\r\n\r\nThis issue of American Health & Drug Benefits includes important contributions to the medical literature in cardiometabolic health, highlighting the need for new strategies to address the ever-growing clinical and economic conundrums associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity in the United States, and the need to improve compliance with clinical guidelines.\r\n\r\nTran and colleagues analyze the implications of the 2013 guidelines issued by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) for the treatment of high blood cholesterol, which present a paradigm change in the approach to the prevention of heart disease.11 Using real-world claims data, the authors project that the new ACC/AHA recommendations will have a significant impact on the use of cholesterol-lowering medications: nearly 25% more patients in the United States are expected to be starting statin therapy in the next 3 years. Furthermore, they calculated that this 25% increase in statin use would be accompanied by a 68% reduction in nonstatin prescriptions for patients with elevated cholesterol. In his Stakeholder Perspective, Jackson suggests that because the majority of statins today are available as generics, “the projected increased utilization of statins that Tran and colleagues highlight may actually save money for health insurance plans and other payers.”12\r\n\r\nCai and colleagues investigated the level of adherence to anticoagulation guidelines in the real world using claims data from a large national database.13 The current clinical guidelines recommend the early initiation of warfarin with parenteral anticoagulation therapy for the treatment of patients with acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) and for the prevention of VTE recurrence, which is especially high in the early months of an acute event. Although acute VTE is associated with a high mortality risk and long-term complications, Cai and colleagues found that many patients are not managed according to the current treatment guidelines. In their study, only 25% of the 4403 patients with acute VTE received warfarin on the same day as initiating parenteral anticoagulant therapy, and more than 50% of patients received warfarin 3 days after initiating parenteral anticoagulant therapy.13 This research points to a gap in patient care that could result in unnecessary morbidity and mortality in this high-risk patient population.\r\n\r\nFinally, Miller and colleagues review the efforts in drug development to address the diabetes challenge.14 They review the evidence for new drug classes for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes, including drugs that were recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or drugs that are currently in development.14 The authors focus on the new class of sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and the new glucagon-like peptide-1 agents, as well as a few other recently approved drugs.\r\n\r\nAlthough 14 classes of drugs are currently available for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, Miller and colleagues show that in 2011, almost 15% of patients with type 2 diabetes were not taking a medication for their disease.14 This lack of patient adherence, says Bourret in his accompanying Stakeholder Perspective, remains a major barrier to proper glycemic control.15 It is also likely the reason that the majority of the new oral drug classes recently approved by the FDA or that are in development include once-daily agents, which potentially could improve adherence. In addition, the new injections entering the market, according to Miller and colleagues, are now offered in a pen format, again with the goal of improving adherence.14\r\n\r\nPerhaps most important, according to Miller and colleagues, the new agents entering the market or being developed for the treatment of patients with diabetes are either weight-friendly or can induce weight loss, an important aspect in diabetes management. The new drugs are also associated with a lower risk for hypoglycemia; considering the mean total cost of $17,564 per hypoglycemic episode requiring hospitalization, this can be a meaningful improvement to the healthcare system as a whole, Miller and colleagues note.14\r\n\r\nWith the rise in life expectancy and the aging of the US population, as well as the growing number of obese patients, the unsustainable clinical and economic predicament of cardiometabolic conditions can be expected to persist, requiring new solutions. The sample of articles assembled in this issue provides insight into some of the challenges facing all healthcare stakeholders—providers, payers, researchers, drug developers, and policymakers—and the need for heightened innovation in the search for new and improved solutions. Applying the implications from health economics research and personalized medicine into patient care may open new opportunities to improve the clinical and economic outcomes in cardiometabolic health.\r\n\r\nWe invite all readers to submit comments, critiques, and letters related to the topics discussed in this issue at www.AHDBonline.com.",

    "abstract": "The outlook for cardiometabolic health remains suboptimal in 2013, despite considerable awareness of the health consequences and the associated costs of cardiometabolic risk factors, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and obesity. There is not much that has not been said about these top killers of Americans. Yet despite all the research and the published literature, new treatments, and well-documented high morbidity and mortality associated with heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and obesity, the incidence of each of these conditions continues to climb.\r\n\r\nAs an example, in 2011, 16.3 million Americans had chronic heart disease, 76.4 million had hypertension, 5.7 million had heart failure, and 7 million had a stroke—all directly increasing the mortality risk from heart disease.1 In 2007, approximately 25.8 million Americans had diabetes, and many millions more had prediabetes.2 Unless new approaches to diabetes therapy become available in the coming years, it is projected that approximately 21% of the American population will have type 2 diabetes by 2050.3\r\n\r\nHeart disease remains the leading killer of Americans,4 and even with the many antihyperglycemic drug classes, less than 50% of patients with diabetes reach the American Diabetes Association's glycemic goal of hemoglobin A1c <7%.5 Why has the transition from epidemiologic research and well-conducted clinical trials into standards of care apparently been so ineffective? Are the therapeutic options inadequately perceived in terms of efficacy, safety, cost or convenience, even in the presence of data that would suggest otherwise? As with so many other facets of medicine, potential contributors are diverse, and remediation requires a concerted effort on the part of many stakeholders to isolate, and then address each of the mediating variables.\r\n\r\nFor example, considering the serious health implications of obesity, it is surprising that it took until 2013 for the American Medical Association to classify it as a disease,6 possibly because obesity was mainly assumed to be the result of lifestyle or behavior. It may take yet another generation of personalized medicine research to fully identify biologically based risk factors for development of obesity and cardiometabolic complications, beyond those which already can be deduced in diabetes, and as has already begun in heart disease. As in so many other conditions, it may be the interaction of genetic, sociodemographic, and other characteristics that yielded the highest specificity and sensitivity in this regard.\r\n\r\nA number of recent developments are noteworthy in their ability to disentangle these issues. Hulsmans and Holvoet recently noted that not all obese patients are at the same risk of developing cardiometabolic complications.7 Therefore, they say, “there is an urgent need for novel biomarkers for early identification of obese patients at high risk. Possible candidate biomarkers are microRNAs, which are highly conserved non-coding RNA molecules of approximately 22 nucleotides that exert post-transcriptional effects on gene expression.”7 This is a promising start that will enable more effective targeting of subgroups of obese patients with efficient risk-mitigation strategies.\r\n\r\nObviously, the costs associated with the management of illnesses linked to the presence of cardiometabolic risk factors continue to rise in tandem. In 2007, the estimated total US cost for diabetes was $174 billion.2 In 2010, the direct cost for cardiovascular disease was $272.5 billion, which is expected to reach $818.1 billion by 2030.8 Similarly, the total cost related to obesity is projected to reach $861 billion to $957 billion by 2030.9 These numbers alone are sufficient to drive home the link between clinical and economic priorities.\r\n\r\nThe articles in this theme issue of American Health & Drug Benefits provide significant contributions to the literature and highlight for all healthcare stakeholders the importance of focusing on cardiometabolic risk factors.\r\n\r\nSpinler and colleagues have conducted the first non–claims-based analysis of data from the national cardiovascular registry PINNACLE, to identify Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic cardiovascular conditions who are eligible for medication therapy management (MTM), a modality that has been shown to improve outcomes and reduce costs in patients with chronic diseases. The authors point out that many eligible patients are not participating in MTM programs, in large part because of a lack of knowledge of these programs’ benefits. These data therefore not only support tailored therapy for Medicare beneficiaries at risk, but also imply the need for an effective communication program within the subpopulation, a theme that is apparent in other articles in this issue. Spinler and colleagues charge providers to explain to patients the benefits of MTM programs and encourage their participation. They call on providers to educate patients on why enrolling in such programs can help to improve their health outcomes and reduce overall costs. Tzeel aptly notes in his perspective, “as the authors so eloquently state, ‘we believe that promoting the utilization of such programs to eligible patients should be the responsibility of all healthcare providers within the framework of care advocated by the ACC within the framework of the patient-centered medical home for CV care.’”\r\n\r\nAlso in this issue, Banerji and Dunn elucidate the increasing prevalence of diabetes and the staggering economic implications, focusing their analysis of the literature on a lack of medication adherence among patients with type 2 diabetes as one of the principal culprits for the dire state of this disease. Banerji and Dunn call for innovation in drug therapies that will focus on patient convenience and ease of use to enhance adherence, suggesting that these are crucial to improving outcomes and reducing the morbidity and mortality rates far beyond the trends seen with currently available medications. Their article serves to emphasize that issues of cost and convenience are as important as efficacy and safety in promoting adherence. They provide some hope in their review of new treatment approaches in the current pipeline that may offer new solutions to lagging adherence as well. As Bourret observes, “Banerji and Dunn aptly make the case for a call to action for aggressive change and innovation in the management of patients with type 2 diabetes and the development of new pharmaceuticals that reduce cardiovascular risk, result in less weight gain, and improve adherence and health outcomes.” The status quo, they suggest, is no longer acceptable.\r\n\r\nAnd in a one-of-its-kind presentation, Hawkins-Taylor and Carlson resurrect the events surrounding the case of BiDil, noting the need to consider sociocultural parameters, including race and ethnicity, in drug development. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of this first and only drug specifically indicated for a racial group resulted in a controversy that, the authors show, has implications for the future development of targeted therapies, especially in the age of personalized medicine. In 2005, when BiDil was approved for the treatment of heart failure in African Americans, the potential impediments associated with introducing combination therapy as a unique treatment in a self-identified patient subgroup was not fully appreciated by different stakeholders, although it was mentioned in the FDA's approval.\r\n\r\nAs Murphy notes, “In a literature replete with references to personalized medicine tailored to variations in genetics and disease-related phenotypes, the case study presented by Hawkins-Taylor and Carlson … emphasizes the importance of incorporating sociodemographic variables into this definition.” With all the focus on race, the authors emphasize, lost was the main clinical message— the need to manage heart failure with a combination of vasodilator therapies in African Americans. The role of genetics and biology, extracting information from data which would resonate with a demographic minority and their providers, did not factor in within the debate about the utility of this particular therapy, but in the age of personalized medicine, resurrecting this case from its recent past has important implications for drug developers, policymakers, providers, and payers. The lesson, Murphy says, is that “failure to achieve meaningful adoption after approval, despite a methodologically rigorous pedigree, emphasizes the importance of ensuring clinical and commercial stakeholder convergence during, not after, the drug development process.”\r\n\r\nFinally, Mahgerefteh and colleagues review the evidence for the 2 new therapies approved by the FDA in mid-2012 for the treatment of obesity, highlighting the current public crisis of obesity and the need for improved therapies. The authors focus on the potential benefits seen in clinical trials with these 2 drugs, with independent and new mechanisms of action, which, in addition to weight reduction, have also been shown to improve blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and lipid levels. As Felicetta says in his perspective, “Time, and real-world data, will tell whether these … medications are indeed able to live up to the promises they offer.”\r\n\r\nWith the aging of the US population and increasing life expectancy, the toll of heart disease, diabetes, and obesity will reach unsustainable levels that may exceed current projections. This theme issue is a call to action to patients, providers, payers, researchers, drug manufacturers, and policymakers. The challenges are many, and the needs for innovation and change are urgent.",

    "abstract": "Cancer has always been a devastating and deadly disease. Unlike many other illnesses, it does not discriminate among populations, and it spares neither young nor old. As our population ages, and the menu for diagnostic tools and treatments becomes more expansive and sophisticated, cancer has been evolving as an increasingly dominant disease for research and discussion. Only 30 years ago, our ability to differentiate subclasses, subtypes, and even the stage of cancer was significantly more limited than it is today. Our understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis, as well as the pathobiology of cancer, has dramatically increased. In addition, the investment by the industry and government in cancer research and treatment has expanded dramatically since President Richard Nixon signed the National Cancer Act of 1971, which expanded and provided additional resources to battle this disease.\r\n\r\nWe have witnessed significant progress in screening, diagnosis, and treatment since the “war” on cancer began. The reality, however, is that despite this progress, many of our new diagnostic modalities and treatments, although costly, provide only incremental benefit. The more dramatic strides in the understanding of cancer biology on a molecular level have been translated into more effective treatments; however, with rare exception, the degree of progress that we have seen in the understanding of cancer biology has lagged in the clinic.\r\n\r\nMany types of cancer remain incurable and, in many cases, are diagnosed at a stage when treatment is limited in its ability to prolong life. That being said, cancer rates have decreased in recent years,1 and fewer people are dying from cancer in the United States compared with several decades ago.2 Specifically, an age-specific analysis of cancer mortality based on data from the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) program indicated a reduction in mortality during the past several decades in the United States.3 However, a significant contribution to this decreased mortality can be attributed to smoking cessation, a greater focus on cancer screening efforts, and early detection of cancer.1\r\n\r\nA number of factors have impeded our ability to improve our approaches to cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment, as well as to finding a “cure” for cancer. Some of these factors include the level of biologic complexity and cellular and molecular heterogeneity of the disease on a global level and on an individual patient level.4 The complexity of cellular interactions and cell signaling within the tumor microenvironment, and the challenges associated with testing new treatment modalities, have hampered our progress in the battle against cancer. Despite these challenges, more patients are living with cancer and are surviving cancer than in the past.\r\n\r\nImprovements in our understanding of the disease have led to dramatic strides in our ability to classify cancer and prognosticate based on molecular diagnostic tools. These tools have contributed to our ability to expand the resources available to treat cancer. The ability to target therapy and personalize treatments has been furthered by advances in our understanding of the molecular basis of the disease.\r\n\r\nThe diversity of our diagnostic tools and treatments, and the increasing cost of treating cancer care, have contributed to a focus on guidelines and pathways based on evidence-based medicine, with the goal of increasing the prevalence of an evidence-based approach to cancer management. More recently, the concept of “value” has entered the discussion of treating cancer.\r\n\r\nThis issue of American Health & Drug Benefits is representative of the research and efforts in oncology in 3 important areas—cancer epidemiology, the management of treatment-related toxicity, and current and emerging trends in the management of cancer in the United States from the perspective of payers who face increasing challenges as a result of the mounting costs, not only for drugs but also for other treatment modalities.\r\n\r\nQuang Nguyen, DO, FACE, and colleagues have made an important contribution in their comprehensive review of the literature, addressing the increasing evidence for the relationship between diabetes and cancer and the potential impact of antidiabetes medications on cancer risk. This is an important article, given the significant increase in the prevalence of patients with diabetes in the United States, and even more so, the increasing public health hazards associated with obesity, which portend an increasing prevalence of diabetes, further reinforcing the importance of managing both of these diseases in the United States.\r\n\r\nKamakshi V. Rao, PharmD, BCOP, CPP, and colleagues review the literature on chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. In their critical review article, the authors highlight the advances that have occurred in the treatment of these toxicities, which are considered by many oncologists to be one of the most significant advances in the past 2 decades in the management of treatment-related side effects in cancer.\r\n\r\nRecent estimates put the costs of cancer care at $100 billion annually, with projections that the cost could rise up in excess of $200 billion by the end of this decade.5 Much of this cost is borne by government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and much of the remainder being paid for by commercial health insurance companies. Cancer care is an area ripe for cost-saving and quality-improvement interventions, because it is marked by high and rapidly escalating costs, suboptimal adherence to evidence-based guidelines, and wide variations in pricing across regimens that provide similar efficacy. Even in the absence of increasing unit costs for a treatment, the aging of the US population alone will have profound effects on cancer-related spending.\r\n\r\nRhonda Greenapple, MSPH, has provided significant insight into the emerging trends in the management of cancer-related costs and other strategies incorporated or anticipated to be introduced by health plans and pharmacy benefit managers, given the dramatic increase in oncology-related treatment options and costs during the past 5 years and those that are expected in the next 5 years. This important article provides competitive insight into innovative approaches, as well as state-of-the-art cancer cost management in light of reimbursement challenges and the expected impact of the Affordable Care Act.\r\n\r\nThis issue of the journal also includes a discussion by the Steering Committee of the 2nd Annual Conference of the Association for Value-Based Cancer Care, held on March 28–31, 2012, in Houston, TX, and attended by more than 200 payers, providers, manufacturers, and other stakeholders associated with cancer care delivery and oncology-focused research in the United States.\r\n\r\nThis panel of thought leaders addresses the challenges placed on managing patients with cancer by the increasing cost of cancer treatment and discusses and debates the concepts and paths necessary to achieve a value-based approach to cancer care.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to additional oncology/hematologyfocused peer-reviewed articles in future issues of this journal to assist providers, payers, and other stakeholders who are actively involved in the battle against this devastating disease.",

    "abstract": "Cancer continues to be a major clinical area attracting investment in research and development for new therapeutics and new diagnostics, as well as a significant driver for innovation in care delivery and a patient-focused, value-based approach to care. Immunotherapies are rapidly becoming an enhanced focus for research, as better understanding of the biology of cancer is increasing the pool of patients who can benefit from these new developments. In tandem, patient navigation and survivorship programs are providing opportunities for improved quality of life for patients with cancer, as many now live longer through improved therapies, and as tumor remission and extended periods of disease-free survival are becoming a reality for an ever-growing number of patients.\r\n\r\nThe rapid discovery of new biomarkers and advancements in molecular sequencing and diagnostic modalities are gradually encouraging cancer researchers to focus on subpopulations of patients, charting a clear pathway for personalized medicine, despite ongoing doubts about the applicability of this approach in the real world.\r\n\r\nBut all this new energy and increased innovations do not come “cheap.” The cost of cancer care continues to be a top concern for patients, payers, and policymakers, while reimbursement issues are taking center stage for the entire cancer care team. The growing economic challenges in the face of great strides in oncology management might have led the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) to issue its first-ever comprehensive report on the current state of cancer to the nation in a publication titled “The State of Cancer Care in America, 2014.”1 In addition to its “recommendations for addressing the cancer care delivery system's most pressing concerns, this landmark ASCO report also examines the rapid expansion of health information technology and the growing emphasis on quality measurement and value.”2\r\n\r\nThe present annual oncology/hematology theme issue from American Health & Drug Benefits highlights some of these top concerns, addressing issues facing the oncology community in 2014 from a variety of perspectives.\r\n\r\nThe rapid approvals of new therapies and novel diagnostics for cancer by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)—as evidenced by the growing number of so-called breakthrough therapies for cancer approved by the FDA, and the agency's frequent use of the priority review process to accelerate patient access to new and improved drugs— have shifted the focus of cancer drug management from traditional pharmacy benefit management to specialty pharmacy, where the majority of new oncolytics are increasingly being managed. This growth in oncology specialty pharmaceuticals has created a significant management challenge for health plans and an opportunity for innovation, says James T. Kenney, Jr, RPh, MBA, in his perspective in this issue.\r\n\r\nInnovation is also the focus of the article by Jeffrey D. Miller, MS, and his team of health economics researchers. They issue a call to action for the health economics community, noting that as innovative, yet high-cost, therapies for cancer continue to come to market, the need for economic modeling is growing as a way of providing better insight into the meaning of “value”—perhaps the most prevalent word in 2014 used to define the current focus on quality and cost in cancer care. However, Mr Miller and his colleagues suggest that serious methodologic and policy challenges are facing modeling-based analyses as a decision-making tool in oncology; the team is inviting researchers and other members of the oncology community to take part in this discussion and to help promote these complex pharmacoeconomic concerns in an attempt to chart new directions toward improved decision-making based on cost, quality, and value considerations.\r\n\r\nSaurabh Ray, PhD, and colleagues offer insight into the treatment and cost of glioblastoma multiforme—the most common and malignant brain tumor in adults—a malignancy associated with challenging treatment issues and poor survival, leaving much room for innovation and further research. The authors raise questions about the cost-effectiveness of the current standard of therapy for this disease, which involves radiotherapy in combination with temozolomide. As can be expected, the use of this expensive drug in the treatment regimen adds significant costs, but, as Dr Saurabh and colleagues show, the median survival time is highest in patients who receive neither temozolomide nor radiation therapy. Additional cost-effectiveness and quality-of-life analyses, the authors suggest, are critical to better understand the role of temozolomide in this patient population and to improve outcomes.\r\n\r\nKirk J. Wojno, MD, and colleagues discuss the issue of repeated biopsies that are often used in connection with the diagnosis of prostate cancer. As an invasive procedure, a prostate biopsy places the patient at risk for complications and is subject to significant sampling errors. Dr Wojno and his team provide data from a small study in a real-world setting investigating the use of an epigenetic test—which is currently being used in clinical practice—as a means to assess the need for repeated biopsy in men with no history of prostate cancer. Based on the data from several urology groups in the United States, men who had a negative result on the epigenetic test had a <5% rate of repeated prostate biopsies, suggesting a potential 10-fold reduction in repeated biopsies compared with the current rates. This type of epigenetic testing, the authors conclude, can help to reduce the number of unnecessary repeated biopsies for the diagnosis of prostate cancer, the most common type of cancer in men.\r\n\r\nFinally, Michael S. Broder, MD, MSHS, and his colleagues conducted the first systematic review of the published literature to investigate the economic burden of prophylactic therapy for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), an ongoing topic of concern with any type of chemotherapy, despite new developments in oncology drugs. The risk for CINV continues even with new therapies, and proper management is key to improved patient quality of life and the control of significant side effects associated with current chemotherapy. Based on the data from clinical studies, Dr Broder and colleagues suggest that significant differences exist among the different therapies available for the prevention and management of CINV.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the costs of these therapies vary significantly, but cost alone cannot determine the selection of the prophylactic agent, because a more expensive therapy may actually result in lower overall costs when considering the cost of uncontrolled CINV side effects. This first systematic analysis of the impact of prophylactic therapy with 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonists (5-HT3RAs) for CINV on cost and utilization shows that the use of palonosetron for CINV prophylaxis is indeed associated with higher total acquisition costs but also with lower use of rescue medications and lower outpatient and inpatient utilization compared with other 5-HT3RAs in the United States. In addition, they note that the use of palonosetron is recommended as the preferred 5-HT3RA agent by the majority of oncology societies and organizations in the United States and Europe, reflecting its superior outcomes, which therefore result in reduced utilization and lower costs overall.\r\n\r\nThis sample of articles offers insight into the type of challenges, some old and some new, facing the oncology team today—all indicating a need for innovation in the search for new solutions. Applying the results and implications of health economics research in oncology into everyday patient care can provide new opportunities to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.\r\n\r\nWe invite your comments, perspectives, and letters related to this collection of articles.

    "abstract": "This cardiometabolic health theme issue of American Health & Drug Benefits highlights diabetes as a major contributor to cardiometabolic disease, with enormous clinical and economic burden. In 2012, more than 29 million Americans were diagnosed with diabetes,1 and in 2010, diabetes was the seventh cause of death in the United States.2 Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of disease-related mortality in the United States; the role of diabetes as a major risk factor for heart disease is well-documented. Nevertheless, <50% of patients with diabetes achieve the current glycemic goal of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level <7%,3 suggesting there is much room for improvement.\r\n\r\nThis issue is focused on the clinical and economic aspects of diabetes, with an update on a new drug approved for heart failure, which is caused by coronary artery disease, diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Heart failure was a contributing cause of death in 1 of 9 US deaths in 2009.4\r\n\r\nFitch and colleagues discuss the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy screening rates among patients with diabetes and the associated costs.5 They show that although diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of chronic diabetes and the leading cause of blindness in working-age adults in the United States, screening for diabetic retinopathy is underutilized in this patient population, even though such screening is recommended by professional guidelines.5 Furthermore, Fitch and colleagues show that the mean increase in healthcare spending for patients with type 2 diabetes during the 10 years after diagnosis does not increase significantly with screening for diabetic retinopathy.5 In 2013, the direct cost of eye disorders in US adults aged ≥40 years was estimated to be $139 billion.6\r\n\r\nLopez and colleagues compare the costs of the 3 sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, and empagliflozin, which reduce renal glucose reabsorption that leads to reductions in HbA1c levels.7 They cite the American Diabetes Association (ADA) estimates that in 2012 the total cost of diabetes in the United States was $245 billion, a significant increase from the ADA's estimate of $174 billion in 2007.7 Lopez and colleagues, therefore, set out to analyze the impact of each of the SGLT2 agents to consider which one may deliver the best response to therapy at the lowest cost.7\r\n\r\nBhounsule and Peterson focus on the recent recommendation to use HbA1c testing as a uniform diagnostic measure to diagnose patients with diabetes.8 The authors investigated whether the use of this test, which is slightly more expensive than older tests, would result in increased healthcare costs for patients with newly diagnosed diabetes. They also analyzed the associated factors related to the total healthcare expenditures among diabetic patients before and after HbA1c was implemented as a standard diagnostic factor. Their results show that the recommendation to use HbA1c testing did not result in increased costs, at least for the short duration since the 2010 recommendation. Surprisingly, the authors also found that the overall healthcare expenditures per person with diabetes decreased slightly in the past few years,8 but the reason for this is unclear.\r\n\r\nThe aging of the baby boomers and the growing numbers of patients with diabetes, obesity, and heart disease, further contribute to the dire prognosis for cardiometabolic health in the United States, despite the new pharmacotherapeutic options entering the market. This is a further indication that the unsustainable clinical and economic predicaments of cardiometabolic conditions can be expected to persist, requiring new solutions. The articles presented in this issue highlight some of the major challenges facing the healthcare system and all stakeholders, and the need for continuing innovation for improved patient outcomes while controlling costs.\r\n\r\nWe welcome your comments, critiques, and letters related to the topics discussed in this issue, which can be submitted at www.AHDBonline.com.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND The Affordable Care Act (ACA) initiated federally and state-run health insurance exchanges, or marketplaces, with health plans offering subsidies for plan members as well as coverage for essential health benefits, to help individuals, families, and small businesses find health plans that fit their specific needs. A recent study found that the value of these healthcare subsidies varied with the number of health plans in the different geographic rating areas, but that study only examined the premiums and the deductibles of those health plans. OBJECTIVES To examine the value of subsidies of health plans, including cost-sharing for prescription drugs in the health insurance marketplace. METHODS We have used publicly available health plan data from HealthCare.gov and from county population data obtained from the US Census Bureau in June 2015. The average-weighted premium; medical deductible; medical maximum out-of-pocket spending; and cost-sharing for generic drugs, preferred and nonpreferred brand-name drugs, and specialty drugs were calculated for the second lowest-cost silver plan in each geographic rating area. These were then compared across geographic areas with different numbers of plans to determine the value of the subsidies. We also compared the difference between the cost of the average silver plan and the second lowest-cost silver plan for each area to determine the cost to enrollees if they selected the average silver plan. RESULTS The monetary value of the subsidies provided by health plans was lower in areas with a larger number of plans, because the second lowest-cost silver plans in these areas tended to have lower premiums and higher deductibles. For the most common type of cost-sharing for generic and for preferred brand-name drugs, plan enrollees would likely have a lower or similar copayment if they selected the average-cost silver plan instead of the second lowest-cost silver plan. However, they may end up paying approximately $8 less in copayment for nonpreferred branded drugs and approximately 4% less for coinsurance after a deductible for specialty drugs if they resided in a geographic area with fewer than 11 plans. CONCLUSION The value of subsidies provided by the ACA-initiated health plans in the healthcare marketplace, including cost-sharing for prescription drugs, varies across geographic areas with different numbers of health plans. This suggests that potential enrollees should consider cost-sharing for prescription drugs in addition to health plans' premiums and deductibles when choosing their health plan.",

    "abstract": "The numbers are staggering. According to the American Heart Association, 76.4 million Americans have hypertension, 16.3 million have chronic heart disease, 5.7 million have heart failure, and 7 million have stroke.1 Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that 25.8 million Americans had diabetes and many millions more had prediabetes in 2007.2 The link between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes is well known,2 and the numbers of overweight and obese Americans continue to climb, further fueling the prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors that can be categorized under the umbrella of a newly defined cardiometabolic disease.\r\n\r\nCardiometabolic disease consists of a constellation of risk factors associated with CVD and metabolic syndrome that include dyslipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance, and high abdominal fat. In practical terms, it is impossible to separate the risk assessment and management of CVD and metabolic syndrome.\r\n\r\nDespite the many advances in CVD interventions, heart disease continues to be the number one killer of Americans.3 And even with the availability of many antihyperglycemic drug classes, less than half of diabetic patients reach the American Diabetes Association's glycemic goal of hemoglobin A1c <7%.4\r\n\r\nAdd to this the astronomical costs utilized independently to manage CVD, dyslipidemia, diabetes (and its complications), and obesity, and the picture becomes truly gloomy: In 2007, the estimated total US costs for diabetes were $174 billion.2 In 2008, the estimated total costs for obesity were $147 billion. In 2010, the direct costs for CVD were $272.5 billion, and these are expected to reach $818.1 billion in 20305—at a time when the US economic outlook is not too promising.\r\n\r\nIt may indeed take a crisis of illness and economics of this magnitude to get providers, payers, manufacturers, patients (especially patients), and policymakers to collaborate on a mutual goal of changing people's attitudes toward health and disease and helping to transform our healthcare system from one that spends billions of dollars on postdisease interventions to one that embraces predisease prevention efforts as key to cardiometabolic health. To make a real difference in this growing epidemic that is in part dependent on lifestyle and personal choices, it is necessary to fully engage individuals in their own cardiometabolic wellness, in addition to any pharmacotherapeutic interventions, as the authors in this issue make clear.\r\n\r\nThis theme issue of American Health & Drug Benefits is a step toward raising awareness of the cardiometabolic constellation of risk factors and the urgent need for collaboration among stakeholders. Colombi and Wood present their study's results on the impact of obesity on care utilization and cost of cardiovascular conditions for a large employer, demonstrating that worksites with the highest rates of obesity had significantly more episodes of care (of any type) than sites with leaner workers. In their call to action, Page and colleagues sound the alarm about the growing risk for CVD among American young adults, focusing on the need to develop prevention strategies for this population and not only for older adults. Nguyen and colleagues outline the many drug therapies available for diabetes and discuss the new drugs in development, many of which have new mechanisms of action and fewer side effects, such as weight gain. Riordan and colleagues highlight the association between CVD and schizophrenia, noting that CVD is the most common cause of natural mortality in schizophrenia, with increased prevalence of dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, and diabetes in this patient population.6 Finally, Daniel provides a comprehensive review of current lipid goals in diabetic patients, outlining the appropriate use of available pharmacotherapies when lifestyle changes fail.\r\n\r\nA single issue cannot cover the full scope of cardiometabolic risk factors and potential solutions. Readers are invited to submit articles to the journal that begin to chart novel ways of transitioning the US healthcare system into a new era of cardiometabolic health and wellness.",

    "abstract": "Researchers have made great strides in unlocking the biology of cancer, especially on the molecular and immunologic levels, and this is rapidly being translated into new therapies. With more than 900 oncology compounds currently in development,1 advancements in molecular sequencing, and new diagnostic modalities, cancer care has become a major focus for investment and research, and with it come challenges and opportunities.\r\n\r\nNew therapies and novel diagnostics for cancer are coming to the market at a greater rate than for other clinical categories, and this trend is reflected in increased rates of survival and lower cancer-related US mortality since the 1990s.2 Cancer care is changing, as evident in new payer–provider collaboration efforts and new approaches to cancer drug management that are described by James T. Kenney, Jr, RPh, MBA, and by Michael Kolodziej, MD, FACP, in their editorials in this theme issue of American Health & Drug Benefits.\r\n\r\nHowever, such rapid development and growth come with a high price tag, raising the question of how to pay for these expensive therapies. Indeed, cost in oncology has become a top concern not only for patients, but also for oncologists and, increasingly, for payers. Recent estimates put the cost of cancer care at $100 billion annually, and this is projected to rise to $200 billion by 2020.3 The growing cost of treating cancer has contributed to a heightened focus on evidence-based treatment and pathways to ensure appropriate use of therapies, minimize waste, and control costs. Thus enters “value” into the conversation at all oncology settings.\r\n\r\nA unique attempt at defining value in oncology is presented in this issue in the report from the Steering Committee of the Third Annual Conference of the Association for Value-Based Cancer Care, which was held on May 2–5, 2013, and addressed “value” from the point of view of different stakeholders in oncology. The need for change in oncology reimbursement is a repeated theme in this discussion and has recently been echoed in the medical literature.4\r\n\r\nErin Zagadailov, PharmD, MS, and colleagues make an important contribution to the literature by highlighting the growing importance of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in oncology drug management. The authors review cancer drugs that were approved with PRO information as a significant measure that may need to be taken into account by payer decisions. This important article brings to the fore the challenges and the opportunities of incorporating oncology-related PRO data into payer decision-making.\r\n\r\nRhonda Greenapple, MSPH, focuses on the introduction of new care delivery models in oncology and emerging payment models, based on results of a new payer survey. Anticipating a rapid expansion of innovative approaches to cancer management over the next 2 years, health plans are supporting new delivery models, such as pathways and palliative care, as well as new payment models, focusing on pay for performance as a cost-effective way to enhance outcomes.\r\n\r\nFinally, Michael M. Wong, MD, PhD, and colleagues evaluate the increase in the economic burden of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), looking for the most cost-effective way to control the cost of this tumor type and to guide treatment and policy decisions. Their analysis shows that targeted therapies are cost-effective in the setting of refractory mRCC, and that oral therapies have an economic advantage over intravenous agents. However, comparative effectiveness research is lacking and is sorely needed in this area.\r\n\r\nOncology continues to be an area with unique opportunities for reducing waste, cost-savings, and improving quality of care and outcomes. This theme issue provides a sample of key topics facing patients with cancer, oncologists, payers, and other stakeholders in the care continuum. The challenges are many, and yet they also present many opportunities for innovation and change.",

    "abstract": "Background A 3-axis prioritization algorithm was proposed and was evaluated in a US multispecialist pilot study to obtain uniform consensus regarding effective practices for the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy. Objective The primary objective was to use consensus-building methodologies to rate disease states for IVIG utilization while considering disease severity and the efficacy of alternative therapeutic options to IVIG from the perspective of US multispecialists. Methods A 7-member multispecialty physician expert panel was surveyed to rate 50 disease states and to determine their level of agreement with the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) evidence-based medicine (EBM) ratings. The disease states were then rated across the 2 domains of disease severity and the perceived efficacy of therapeutic alternatives. An interquartile deviation (IQD) of ≤0.5 was used to determine consensus for disease states within each domain. Disease states reaching consensus across both domains were ranked according to a 2 × 4 algorithmic scale to establish priority for IVIG utilization. Results Overall, a high level of agreement was found with the AAAAI ratings for EBM. Based on an IQD of ≤0.5, the panel reached consensus on the severity of all 50 disease states. Of the 50 disease states, consensus was reached on the efficacy of therapeutic alternatives for 39 disease states. Using the same panel of experts, the 11 disease states without consensus in the first survey were resurveyed, and consensus was subsequently reached on 4 of them. Discussion among the experts, and the resurvey, resulted in expert consensus increasing from 78% to 86% postdiscussion and a change in the overall rating of IVIG on 4 conditions. Conclusions Multispecialty input of 7 experts on evidence-based IVIG use, augmented with disease severity and efficacy of therapeutic alternatives, enables a balanced perspective on IVIG therapy prioritization. Moreover, multispecialty dialogue improved consensus building among panel members on the effective use of IVIG therapy in several clinical conditions.",
