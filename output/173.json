    "abstract": "Ma and Griffith first described in 1977 a percutaneous technique for the repair of acute Achilles tendon rupture. In 1992, Delponte popularised a new percutaneous technique with Tenolig. The authors report a series of 124 cases of Achilles tendon rupture treated with Tenolig in their institution from 1993 to 1998. There were 79 men and 45 women. The mean age was 41.5 years, with a peak from 30 to 39 years. The rupture occurred during sports activities in 69 cases. The mean duration of follow-up was 1.9 years. Surgical complications noted were: unbending of one of the harpoon wires in 5 cases, rupture of the harpoon wire in one case and tendon re-rupture in 12 cases. The rate of re-rupture was similar to the rate noted with conservative treatment (10%). Skin necrosis at the entrance wound was noted in 10 cases, and injury of the sural nerve in 8 cases. Full weight-bearing without crutches was regained for 95% of patients within 3 months. In conclusion, this report shows a high rate of re-rupture and sural nerve entrapment with percutaneous surgery (Tenolig). The high rate of re-rupture can be due to the progressive but immediate weight-bearing allowed without an orthosis, or to inadequate apposition of the tendon ends, or to delay before repair. The high rate of sural nerve entrapment is due to its proximity to the Achilles tendon. We believe that a limited open technique is more reliable and has the advantage of allowing direct visualisation of the repair site and controlling adequate apposition of the tendon ends.",

Although almost all the current literatures provide some evidence on the benefits of this technique compared with Visco- supplementation, no studies have been performed to compare their Clinical outcomes. The purpose is to compare the Clinical outcomes provided by intra- articular injection of either Platelet rich plasma or Hyaluronic acid to treat knee Osteoarthritis. Study Design: Randomized Controlled Trial 200 Patients with a history of Symptomatic knee Osteo- arthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2 or 3) were randomized to undergo 3 blinded intra-articular in- jections of either Platelet rich plasma or Hyaluronic acid. The Interval between successive injections was 2 weeks. Patients were evaluated prospectively before the injection and then at 2, 6, 12, 24, 30 and 36 months. Evaluation was based on International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Visual analog scale, VOMAC Score and the re- injection rate; 189 patients reached the final evaluation. Both platelet rich plasma and Hyaluronic acid were effective in improving knee Symptoms and functional status over time and remained stable over time up to 18 months Post-injection (No re-injection has been performed to any patient incorporated in this study during the first 18 months). The performed re-injections have been significantly lower in the PRP group. Both platelet rich plasma and Hyaluronic acid were effective in improving knee Symptoms and functional status over time and remained stable over time up to 18 months Post-injection. The rate of the required re-injections has been significantly lower in platelet rich plasma group. platelet rich plasma provide longer duration of symptomatic relief, longer duration of functional status improvement and lesser number of needed re-injections than Hyaluronic acid when the patients have been followed through 36 months.",

    "abstract": "In the past decade, the indications for hip replacements broadened and media induced patients' expectations in terms of function and longevity have been rising steadily. Improved technology addressed wear and fixation issues. However, more attention should be given to optimising hip biomechanics as this is essential to restore function. Pre-operative hip templating allows anticipating the correct implant position and potential difficulties prior to surgery. As such it is an essential part of the implantation process. We propose a four-step approach for hip templating on a standardised standing pelvic radiograph: 1. Identify anatomical landmarks (the medullary canal, the greater and lesser trochanter, the acetabular roof and the teardrop); 2. Assess the quality of the radiograph (femoral rotation, pelvic inclination and symmetry); 3. Identify mechanical references (the original acetabular and femoral rotation centre, the femoral and acetabular offset and the leg length and hip length discrepancy); 4. Optimise implant positioning to restore hip biomechanics. Hip templating helps recognising \"difficult hips\" where restoration of the original hip anatomy is no option. These hips should be approached carefully with a well defined pre-operative plan to minimise the chances of complication while maximising hip function. Although it is mainly under these circumstances that hip templating is a major asset, we believe that performing systematically a standardised preoperative templating should contribute to improved hip arthroplasty function and outcome.",

Nowadays, there isn’t a strict consensus on the diagnosis. Nevertheless, the criteria established by the musculoskeletal infection society (MSIS) are generally used by the scientific community. The objective of this retrospective study case and literature review is to establish that the MSIS criteria are insufficient to diagnose PSI. We did a retrospective monocentric analysis concerning PSI. Out of the 25 shoulder arthroplasty revisions conducted in our institution from January 2010 till January 2022 (including primary implants placed in other facilities), 10 had a positive periprosthetic culture from samples taken during surgery. In 60% of cases, the diagnosis of PSI has been made because of 2 positive periprosthetic cultures (major criterion). In 10% of cases, the diagnosis of prosthetic shoulder infection was recognized from the presence of a cutaneous fistula in communication with the joint implants (major criterion). In no case was the diagnosis of PSI determined by the presence of 4 out of 6 minor MSIS criteria. In 30% of cases, the MSIS criteria were insufficient to establish the PSI diagnosis. The MSIS criteria are insufficient to establish the diagnosis of PSI and should be considered as a methodological bias in published studies on this subject.",

    "abstract": "Addressing severe proximal femoral bone loss in revision hip surgery is a challenging reconstructive problem. The use of modular proximal femoral megaprostheses is one of many available options to address this. This is a retrospective review of 15 patients who had undergone limb salvage at our institution using a modular proximal femoral replacement. There were 8 males and 7 females with a mean age of 67 years (34 to 85) and a mean follow-up of 60 months (1 to 99). Indications included re-implantation for deep infection in nine patients, aseptic loosening in three, periprosthetic fracture in two and painful excision arthroplasty in one. Mean Harris hip score increased from 28 (13 to 49) pre-operatively to 69 (39 to 85) at final follow-up (paired t-test, p < 0.0001) and mean Toronto Extremity Salvage score increased from 26% (14 to 40) to 71% (35 to 82) (paired t-test, p < 0.0001). Prosthesis survival with revision as the endpoint was 87% at 5 years. There were two dislocations (14%) and there was failure to eradicate deep infection in two. Modular proximal femoral replacement provided good function and versatility with an acceptable complication rate for patients with severe proximal femoral bone loss with or without infection.",

    "abstract": "Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a highly effective surgical procedure, but in some patients TKAs fail early due to a variety of underlying factors. About 11% of revision TKAs within one year of primary TKA are the result of aseptic loosening of the tibial component at the cement-implant interface. Literature regarding the most important factors associated with this type of loosening is scarce. The objective is to give an overview of the literature regarding factors associated with aseptic loosening of the tibia component at the cement-implant interface in total knee arthroplasty. A narrative literature review based on publications identified through PubMed and CINAHL databases. Twelve studies were identified, which describe a total of 299 cases of early aseptic loosening of the tibia component at the cement-implant interface. The main associated factors reported were cementa- tion factors. These factors included the use of high viscosity cement (HVC), cement application methods and cement thickness. Other main reported associated factor related to implant design factors, which included component shape and surface roughness. The least frequently reported associated factors related to the patient characteristics of body mass index (BMI). Several factors associated with early aseptic loosening of the tibial component at the cement-implant inter- face in total knee arthroplasty were identified in this review. The most frequently reported associated factors related to cementation factors and implant design factors. Because the literature in this area is scarce, further research is warranted in an effort to prevent early aseptic loosening in future TKAs.",

    "abstract": "Navicular stress fractures in athletes are notoriously difficult to diagnose, resulting in an average delay in diagnosis of 4 months after the onset of symptoms. There are various reasons for this delay. Navicular stress fractures are characterised by an unspecific symptomatology combined with a paucity of physical findings. Furthermore there is difficulty in visualising stress fractures on plain radiographs, with only 33% of fractures visible on the initial films. There are several factors contributing to this: the vast majority (83%) of fractures are incomplete fractures at initial presentation and those that are complete are often non displaced and not visible because bony resorption at the fracture site requires 10 days to 3 weeks to occur. For this reason, 3-phase Tc99bone scan is the examination of choice, with almost 100% sensitivity after 72 hours. A favourable outcome can be expected with early diagnosis and proper management. Delayed diagnosis and subsequent improper management can lead to a poor outcome with adverse effects on the activities of the athlete. Treatment consists of 6-8 weeks in a non weight bearing cast for incomplete fractures and non displaced complete fractures. Surgical treatment consists of screw fixation with or without bone graft. Some authors advocate aggressive treatment of non displaced complete fractures. It is imperative to maintain a high index of suspicion when treating patients, especially sprinting athletes, who present with vague mid-foot or ankle pain associated with weight bearing.",

Forty percent of patients receiving a suction drain had a haemoglobin level less than 10 g/dL at 24 hours, compared to 35% with no drain and 28% with an ABT drain. Patients that had no drains had wounds that were dry significantly sooner, mean 3.0 days compared to a mean of 3.9 days with an ABT drain and a mean of 4 days with a suction drain. Patients that did not have a drain inserted stayed in hospital a significantly shorter period of time, compared with drains.

    "abstract": "When dealing with prosthetic joint infections (PJI) there is often the need to start antibiotic therapy without having identified the underlying pathogen. Under these circumstances there is no consensus regarding which antibiotic to use. We aimed to produce local recommendations for empirical antibiotic treatment of PJI by describing the microbiological spectrum involved and respective antibiotic susceptibility profile. We examined the records of 75 consecutive patients that underwent surgery for prosthetic joint infection from July 2001 to December 2008. There were 49 women and 26 men with an average age of 63 years. Ninety culture results were available from 41 hips and 34 knee replacements. Staphylococcus sp. was present in most infections (72.8%) regardless of surgical site or classification. The prevalence of methicillin-resistance among staphylococci was 64.2% with no relevant difference between sub-groups. Vancomycin is 100% effective against most commonly isolated Gram positives. Gram negative pathogens were present in about 15% of all cases, especially in haematogenous and chronic infections. Carbapenems and aminoglycosides are the most effective antibiotics against these pathogens. Our results suggest that in acute post-operative infections, treatment should start with vancomycin. In chronic and haematogeneous infections, vancomycin in combination with carbapenems appears to be an effective regimen. Treatment should be adjusted as soon as preliminary or definitive microbiology results are available.",

In this consecutive case series study using a prospectively collected database, 80 consecutive patients (80 ankles) having ankle arthroscopy with the finding of osteoarthritis or impingement were identified and their outcome at five years was ascertained. Fifty five (69%) patients had soft tissue impingement, and 25 (31%) patients had osteoarthritic degenerative changes. Seven (9%) patients had further major surgery and 6 (8%) had repeat arthroscopy. The surgery was required for 7 arthritic ankles among which, however, survival analysis showed no significant difference between those under 50 and those over 50 years. Twenty-eight percent of osteoarthritic patients progressed to major ankle surgery, within 5 years of arthroscopic treatment. None of the patients with impingement symptoms required further major surgery. In conclusion, arthroscopically treated impingement ankles were found to have an excellent prognosis, while osteoarthritic ankles had a less favoured prognosis, with a high proportion requiring further major surgery.

A retrospective questionnaire survey was conducted on 180 patients with knee osteoarthritis who underwent total knee arthroplasty. The questionnaire consisted of a general information questionnaire, the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) for anxiety, the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) for depression, the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), the Pittsburgh sleep quality Index (PSQI), and the American Knee Society Scores (AKSS). The same questionnaires were administered preoperatively and at 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively, and the results were statistically analyzed. The prevalence of anxiety in preoperative knee osteoarthritis patients was 29.2% and the prevalence of depression was 37.5%. At 3, 6, and 12 months after total knee arthroplasty, anxiety and depression, pain levels, sleep disturbances, and functional status of the knee were significantly improved in patients with knee osteoarthritis compared with the preoperative period (all P&lt;0.05). Patients with knee osteoarthritis have significant anxiety and depression before surgery, and total knee arthroplasty can significantly improve their anxiety, depression and prognosis, and should be performed as early as possible in patients with knee osteoarthritis.",

    "abstract": "Aseptic loosening due to bone remodeling and osteolysis is the main reason for revision hip arthroplasty. At present, there is no established prophylaxis for this complication. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that bisphosphonates prevent bone loss around total hip arthroplasties (THA). The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of oral bisphosphonate risedronate for the prevention of deleterious changes in bone metabolism after hip replacement. Twenty-four patients who underwent THA were randomised to two treatment arms: 35 mg risedronate once weekly for 6 months (12 patients) and no treatment for controls (12 patients). Markers of bone turnover bone specific alkaline phosphatase, serum osteocalcin and urinary deoxypiridinoline were evaluated at baseline, third and sixth postoperative month. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry of the nonsurgical hip was performed preoperatively and at 6 months postoperatively. There were no significant differences in clinical or radiographic findings between the two groups at either 3 or 6 months. In the two groups, all biochemical marker responses at the third postoperative month were suppressed compared with baseline. Values of bone resorption marker urinary deoxypiridinoline increased significantly at six months in the control group. For the 10 risedronate patients with bone densitometry bone mineral density reached 1.01% increase at 6 months. Administration of oral risedronate led to a significant reduction in bone metabolism at 6 months after hip replacement. This therapeutic strategy may improve the results and longevity of total hip arthroplasty. The beneficial effect of risedronate should be confirmed in further studies including larger number of patients and longer follow-up. The action of risedronate could prevent aseptic loosening of hip arthroplasty by preserving periprosthetic bone stock.",

The present prospective study aimed at measuring the scattered dose to the thyroid using an Unfors EDD dosimeter during DHS/IMHS for fractures of the neck of the femur and IM nailing for long bone fractures. In 32 procedures, the dose of 65 microSv was exceeded 13 times; 8 times during DHS/IMHS and 5 times during IMN. The average thyroid dose was 142 microSv during IMN and 55 microSv during DHS. Only 9 of the total 223 (4%) theatre personnel were using a thyroid shield in spite of its availability. These results suggest that the thyroid is frequently exposed to potentially harmful radiation during these procedures. Strict inclusion of a thyroid shield as a part of routine radiation protection is recommended.",

    "abstract": "Several classification systems are in use for Legg-Calve-Perthes disease. Three of them: Catterall, Salter Thompson and Herring (Lateral Pillar) are most commonly used. There has been debate on which is most reliable. The purpose of this paper was to systematically analyse the literature when the classifications were compared. The Ovid (Medline) Database was used and the MeSH terms Perthes Classification and Reliability were inserted. Eleven studies were retrieved but only five were suitable for analysis as they attempted to compare the classifications. Most studies used kappa agreements as the principal outcome measure, although intraclass coefficients and percentage agreements were also used. Only four studies assessed for both intraobserver reproducibility and interobserver reliability. A further study from the references appendages was found to be suitable, and was included in the analysis. Kappa ranged from poor to fair (Salter Thompson), fair to moderate (Catterall) and moderate to good (Herring). The outcome from Legg-Calve-Perthes disease is extremely variable. Inconsistent interpretation of the plain films may explain this, although it is likely this is multifactorial. The papers in this study show that on balance, the Lateral Pillar classification was most reliable, probably secondary to ease of use. A persistent theme was that the subchondral fracture line in the Salter Thompson system was difficult to interpret and not always present. It also showed that whilst reliability and reproducibility tended to improve with experience, disagreement was not always restricted to more junior personnel. Each classification has its merits but reliability and reproducibility remains unsatisfactory. Digital technology in the future may help delineate the lesions better and improve agreement.",

From 2006 to 2015, 17 hip arthroplasties (with the Proxima stem) were performed in group of 17 patients for the treatment of acute femoral neck fractures Garden type III and IV. The mean follow-up period was 112.7 (range: 64-148) months. Patients were evaluated retrospectively - clinically and radiographically, using the Harris hip scoring system during the year 2020. Seven males and ten females (mean age: 45.0 years) were included in the study. Each of them had one or more risk factors (time delay, comminution of the femoral neck, corticosteroids usage, the presence of coxarthrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, alcohol abuse, etc…), because of which the osteosynthesis was not performed. Harris hip scores were 6.3 preoperatively and 82.9 at the final follow-up. Three patients (17.6%) had complications: luxation, aseptic stem loosening (migration with subsidence - \"varisation\" and thigh pain) and deep infection. One patient (5.9%) with infection was revised. In carefully selected younger patients with displaced intracapsular femoral neck fracture, where the osteosynthesis as first treatment option should be associated with high risk of complication (avascular femoral head necrosis, non-union) due to the presence of risk factors, the primary total hip arthroplasty could be performed. The ultra-short cementless stem offers promising results in these rare cases in the midterm.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the type and frequency of lower limbs axial deviation and limb length discrepancy and the type of exostoses being risk factors for theses deformities. We retrospectively reviewed standing full-length radiograph of 32 HME patients (64 limbs) followed in our institution between October 2009 and December 2020. Patient demographics were recorded. Radiographic analysis of the coronal limb alignment was performed, limb length discrepancy was measured and topography of the exostoses was recorded. We propose a classification of lower legs in 2 groups and 4 types according to the presence and the location of exostoses. In group I, there is an intertibio- fibular exostose with fibular origin at the level of the tibiofibular joints. In type IA, at the level of the distal tibiofibular joint with ascension of the distal fibula; in type IB at the level of the proximal tibiofibular joint with a bracketing effect on the proximal tibia and a lateral slope of the proximal tibial growth plate; the type IC is combining features of both IA and IB. In group II, there is no intertibio-fibular exostose coming from the fibula and no growth abnormality is obvious. A clinically notable lower limb discrepancy (LLD) of ≥2 cm was found in 19% of our patients. Approximately 33% of patients had a knee valgus deformity and 44% had an ankle valgus deformity. The knee valgus deformity was due to fibular growth anomalies and not to distal femur anomalies. The majority of lower legs had fibular growth anomalies (72%) which was a significant risk factor for knee valgus deformity and leg length discrepancy. On the contrary, we found no correlation between number, location and volume of distal femoral exostoses and genu valgum nor leg length discrepancy. Presence of intertibio-fibular exostoses is a risk factor for knee valgus deformity and leg length discrepancy. The presence of these exostoses should lead to a close follow-up of the patient.",

The aims of the study is to compare the outcomes achieved in anatomic ACLR involving QUAD vs. Hamstring (HT) autografts. A total of 52 consecutive patients underwent an ACLR, 25 patients with QUAD graft and 27 with HT graft. The same surgical technique, fixation method and postoperative protocol were used in both groups. The following parameters were evaluated: functional status (Lysholm, Tegner, subjective IKDC scores), joint stability (Lachman and pivot shift tests), surgical reoperation rate, complications, degree of satisfaction and return to previous level of activity. Descriptive statistics were analysed using the Student's t-test. Forty four patients were evaluated (20 QUAD, 24 HT), with a mean follow-up of 27.4 months. Two patients were re-operated in the QUAD group (including one ACL revision), and one patient in the HT group required an ACL revision. There were no significant differences between the two groups in postoperative scores: Lysholm (96.05 vs. 96.05), IKDC (86.2 vs. 91.2) and Tegner (6 vs. 5) scales. The percentage of negative Lachman and pivot shift tests was similar in the two groups (45% vs. 50% and 40% vs. 45.8%, respectively). There were no significant differences between the groups in the degree of satisfaction (95.8% vs. 80%, p = .16) or in the percentage who returned to their previous level of activity (62.5% vs. 45%, p = .17).

    "abstract": "Knee stiffness due to mismanaged trauma is still common in underdeveloped countries. Many patients with distal femoral fractures, patellar injuries or other local trauma present with intra-articular and extra-articular adhesions between the quadriceps and anterior femur. Nineteen knees with post trauma stiffness due to combined intra- and extra- articular aetiology were taken up for arthroscopic aided release after failing an aggressive physiotherapy protocol. Ultrasound was used to identify the extra-articular adhesions. The intra-articular part of the release was done by a standard protocol involving the release of all infrapatellar, suprapatellar and gutter adhesions, and then the extra-articular proximal adhesions were released by using special long periosteal elevators and arthroscopic scissors. We were able to release the adhesions as high as 9 inches above the patella, and in one case bony ankylosis between the patella and the femur was arthroscopically osteotomised (after 11 years of stiffness). Delay before surgery averaged 2.7 years (6 months-11.3 years). Mean active flexion at one year follow-up improved from 27.3 degrees to 119.3 degrees (average increase: 92 degrees). Mean preoperative extension lag reduced from 6 degrees to 1 degrees postoperatively. No CPM machine was available, and patients had to undergo daily manual and assisted therapy, with appropriate analgesia. Overall patient satisfaction was excellent; one patient developed a supracondylar fracture (infected old fracture with bone loss and severe contracture) and was retrospectively a wrong case selection. Arthroscopic aided quadriceps adhesion release is a good option in cases of neglected trauma; results are excellent even without sophisticated CPM machines, and the periosteal elevators needed are cheap and indigenous.",

The extracapsular hip fracture group were found to have significantly increased peri-operative blood loss as measured by changes in the haemoglobin level, and in transfusion requirements when analysed against the intracapsular hip fracture group.

Fifty-six cases of osteo-articular infections (acute/subacute osteomyelitis, osteo-arthritis, septic arthritis, spondylodiscitis, sacro-iliitis) treated between 2001 and 2007 were retrospectively reviewed, focusing on clinical, biological, microbiological and radiological data. Septic arthritis, acute osteomyelitis, septic osteoarthritis and sacro-iliitis often have a loud clinical (fever, pain, inflammatory signs) and biological presentation. Subacute osteomyelitis and spondylodiscitis are almost asymptomatic, but for functional impairment. The responsible pathogen was isolated in 38% of the cases. The most frequent pathogen was Staphylococcus Aureus, followed by Pneumococcus, Streptococcus A and B, Kingella Kingae, and Haemophilus. None of them were resistant to usual antibiotics. Functional impairment is the only constant symptom of osteo-articular infections. Other clinical and biological symptoms may be absent, making diagnosis often difficult. We recommend oxacillin (> 5 years) or a combination of oxacillin with cefotaxime (< 5 years) in the empirical treatment of osteo-articular infection, and a total of 4 weeks of treatment.",

Suitable matches were found for a subgroup of 5 patients (6 LISS plates). No statistically significant differences were found in the Oxford knee scores (p = 0.749) or quality of life scores (p = 0.440) between the two groups. Our data suggest favourable outcomes after LISS plate fixation of supracondylar periprosthetic femoral fractures above total knee replacement.",

    "abstract": "Pain is the main symptom of acetabular osteolysis from metastatic carcinoma, and it is frequently associated with pathologic fractures. Radiotherapy alone usually is not effective for pain control, and it does not allow weight bearing. Surgical procedures requiring an aggressive approach and consequently high morbidity are rarely indicated in patients with multiple metastases. Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) has been widely used in oncologic and spinal surgery as a bone filler. We evaluated the functional results of percutaneous injection of PMMA in 20 patients (24 acetabula) with acetabular osteolysis from metastatic carcinoma. Patients were assessed before and after percutaneous acetabuloplasty, evaluating pain, mobility of the hip joint, general condition, use of analgesics, using the SF-36, QLQ-C30, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Scale and Harris Hip Score. There was a marked clinical improvement in all patients during the first six post-operative months, with gradual worsening thereafter from deterioration of their general condition over the 12-month follow-up period. Percutaneous acetabuloplasty is reliable and effective in the short term, with a statistically significant reduction of pain and improvement in quality of daily life.",

At the end of the follow-up period, all patients were evaluated clinically for pain and a daily living activity score, and radiologically regarding the time and quality of bone healing, using a modified Neer grading system. Satisfactory clinical outcome without pain or impairment of daily living activities was seen in 97.1% of patients.

The average time to healing was 19.9 weeks and all reported complications were minor, unrelated to the composite graft itself, and did not affect the functional outcome.

A hypersensitivity reaction to the metal-on-metal bearing, although rare, is a reported complication and is a novel mode of failure of these implants. Differentiating failure secondary to infection from failure secondary to metal hypersensitivity represents a significant diagnostic challenge. A retrospective review of all cases of hip arthroplasty using metal-on-metal bearings over a 5-year period at a tertiary referral centre identified 3 cases of failure secondary to metal hypersensitivity. Clinical presentation, serological markers, radiological imaging and histological analysis of all cases identified were evaluated. Histological analysis of periprosthetic tissue in all 3 cases identified characteristic features such as perivascular lymphocytic aggregates and chronic inflammation consistent with aseptic lymphocytic vasculitis-associated lesions (ALVAL). This study highlights that failure secondary to metal hypersensitivity must be considered in patients presenting with the reappearance of persistent pain, marked joint effusion, and the development of early osteolysis in the absence of infection.",

Currently, osteotomy to achieve a neutral or slightly pronated position is widely accepted for the management of patients who have severe pronation. The present study evaluates the result of two-stage double-level rotational osteotomy of both the radius and ulna in the treatment of severe congenital radioulnar synostosis. Nine children with severe congenital radioulnar synostosis underwent two-stage double-level rotational osteotomy of both the radius and ulna at Mansoura University Hospital. There were seven boys and two girls with a mean age of 5.6 years who were followed up for a mean of 26 months. The position of the forearm was improved from a mean pronation deformity of 76 degrees (60 degrees to 85 degrees) to 30 degrees of pronation in the affected dominant extremities and 20 degrees of supination in non-dominant extremities in all cases. Bony union was achieved by 5.9 weeks with no loss of correction. The advantages of this technique are that it is easy, safe, with absence of severe postoperative complications and requires a small surgical scar. A drawback of the technique is that the rotation correction depends only on a cast, so that a correction loss might occur if the plaster cast loosens.",

    "abstract": "The creation of an optimal environment, whenever major joints are opened or metal is implanted into bone, is important to reduce infection following orthopaedic surgery. Following normal hand washing protocols, it is possible that pathogenic bacteria can remain on the skin. These bacteria may inadvertently be transferred to the surgical gown during the glove donning procedure and therefore contamination of the surgical wound could follow. We aimed to determine whether there is a difference between three differing glove donning techniques, open, closed and scrub staff assisted, in terms of accidental gown contamination, as the optimum method is unknown. Three differing glove donning techniques were assessed using ultra-violet (UV) lotion, applied to the hands after the scrub, to demonstrate patches of contamination on the surgical gowns. Two studies were carried out. An initial pilot study with theatre personnel and the main study by a single surgeon rehearsed in the various techniques. The region and size of contamination patches were documented. In the pilot study 12 out of 13 individuals were seen to have patches of UV fluorescent gown contamination following an observed scrub. In the main study, both the open and closed technique had a 100% gown contamination rate. This was concentrated around the cuff region. There were no contamination patches in the scrub staff assisted technique. Glove donning, using the scrub staff assisted technique can minimise the possibility of gown contamination. This is important in surgical procedures where the results of infection can be devastating.",

Sixty-two knees in 62 patients were followed for two years to evaluate the possible clinical implications of the femoral and tibial tunnel enlargements noted after ACL reconstruction. The reconstructions were done with hamstring tendons using the cross-pin technique. Evaluation was based on calculated clinical scores (IKDC and Lysholm knee scores) and quantified by KT-1000 measurements. Sagittal and coronal plane computed tomography and conventional radiography were performed 3 days after operation and were repeated after 3 and 6 weeks, 6, 12 and 24 months, to assess early tunnel enlargement. Although it seems that tunnel enlargement after ACL reconstruction has no impact on the clinical results, long-term implications and potential need for revision surgery must be assessed. In this study, tunnel enlargement was noted fairly early after operation and was thought to be related with drilling of the tunnels. A possible solution to this problem may be drilling the tunnels to a diameter 1 mm smaller than the measured graft diameter, then to enlarge the tunnels to the graft diameter with the appropriate tunnel dilator.",

There were 90 patients in each group. All were examined and asked to complete a questionnaire so as to determine Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) score, Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score, Bartlett patellar score and a Visual Analogue score (VAS) for any persistent anterior knee pain at rest. We failed to identify any significant differences in terms of anterior knee function between these two groups of patients. The re-operation rate was similar for both groups. It would appear that primary knee replacement for rheumatoid disease is met with a similarly good outcome for anterior knee function despite absence of patellar resurfacing.

We wonder if complications can be anticipated and correlated to patient demographics, lifestyle, fracture or surgery related factors. We retrospectively reviewed all medical reports of patients who underwent ankle fracture surgery between 2013 and 2017. We focused our risks factors analysis on 5 common complications : poor wound healing, surgical site infection, malunion, nonunion and chronic pain. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to analyze significant risk factors for these complications. We identified 433 patients. Complications were present in 26% of the cases. The most frequent complication was poor wound healing (10%) associated with deep surgical site infection in 6%. Malunion was found in 7% and nonunion in 3%. Seven percent of patients suffered from chronic pain. More severe fractures happened to be a risk factor for poor wound healing (p = 0,032) and malunion (p < 0,001). Open fractures had respectively 6 to 9 times more mal- (p = 0,012) and nonunion (p = 0,018). Overweight patients with alcohol abuse were doubling their chances of cutaneous (p = 0,030) and infectious (p = 0,040) complications, and tripling their risks of ankle fracture nonunion (p = 0,003). Female and patients operated at night (p = 0,045) seemed to be more at risk to develop chronic pain (p = 0,028). Complications of ankle fracture treatment are frequent and their risks increases with more complex and open fractures. This study brings new evidence concerning the combined effect of overweight and alcohol abuse on poor wound healing, surgical site infection and non-union.",

In this study, we report our results with the Ilizarov method of bone transport to overcome bone defects of forearm bones due to infection. This series included 16 patients with bone defects of forearm bones, following either debridement of osteomylitis or infected nonunion. The mean time from injury to the Ilizarov procedure was 11.7 months. The mean number of operative procedures before application of the Ilizarov device was 3.4. The mean length of the defects after debridement was 6.4 cm. Monofocal osteotomy was performed. The mean external fixation index, distraction index and maturation index were 41.5 days/cm, 19.8 days/ cm, and 21.7 days/cm respectively. The mean time in the frame was 8.9 months. The mean total duration of treatment was 11.4 months. There were 14 complications in 11 patients including pin-track infection, premature consolidation, delayed union at the docking site and refracture.

We found better results in the mobile-bearing group for pain scores and subjective preference, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Within the time limits of this study, radiological analysis showed no osteolysis in either group, but longer follow-up will be needed to confirm this.",

We report a case of congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia treated with a composite implant consisting of a biocoral frame, collagen carrier, and native bovine BMP extract. A six-year-old boy had persisting congenital proximal tibial pseudarthrosis despite six prior operations. At surgery, the sclerotic surfaces of both fragments were excised, fixation was performed using Ilizarov's device, and the composite implant and an autograft were applied to the nonunion site. Three months after the operation, radiographs showed union, and at four months, the Ilizarov device was removed. Two years later, the proximal pseudarthrosis remained clinically and radiologically united. It is concluded that BMP may contribute to the healing of congenital tibial pseudarthrosis of the tibia.",

The authors wanted to assess retrospectively the clinical and radiological outcome of PLIF + IPLF performed by the senior author. Between July 1997 and December 2003, 75 patients underwent PLIF with cages and IPLF with transpedicular instrumentation, for either degenerative disc disease, stenosis, spondylolisthesis or post-discectomy syndrome. The clinical outcome was evaluated according to the criteria of Kirkaldy-Willis. Flexion/extension radiographs and CT-scans were obtained in cases where there was any doubt about the fixation/fusion status. The mean age was 48.7 years (range: 30 to 75). The mean duration of follow-up was 29.17 months (range: 12 to 67). The clinical outcome was excellent or good in 85.3% of the patients. There were 4/75 patients (5.3%) who failed to return to their original occupation. Four posterolateral fusions were uncertain, but all anterior fusions succeeded: thus circumferential fusion was obtained in 71 out of 75 cases, or 94.6%. Three patients sustained a neurological complication, but only one was left with a partial drop foot. The results were comparable with similar studies. Therefore the authors recommend further use of PLIF + IPLF in painful lumbar degenerative spinal disease where conservative management has failed.",

Outcome measures including non-union, peri-implant fracture, post-operative function and mortality were similar between groups. Proximal screw cut-out and consequently re-operation rate were significantly higher for the PFN. A number of variables may predispose a patient to develop screw cut-out including gender, experience of surgeon, fracture pattern, implant design and tip-apex distance. As such a multivariable logistic regression model was used to investigate the independent effects of these variables on proximal screw cut-out. Only tip-apex distance was found to have a significant association with proximal screw cut-out and differences between implant designs could be accounted for by surgical technique rather than implant design. The results of this study suggest that both implants have similar post-operative outcome measures and complication rates when implanted correctly.",

    "abstract": "Neurogenic heterotopic ossification (NHO), mostly defined as a benign process of formation of bone outside the skeletal system, after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a musculoskeletal disorder that causes pain and reduces the range of motion, often leading to marked impairment of quality of life. The pathogenic factors that link the brain and bone and cause the formation of heterotopic bone are largely unknown. This article will try to summarize the current literature on the pathogenesis of NHO and accelerated fracture healing after TBI. The heterotopic formation of bone after TBI seems to be inducted by a complex interplay between local and systemic factors. For all different forms of HO, the same three conditions are required for the formation of ectopic bone : The presence of osteoprogenitor cells, a permissive environment, and a stimulating factor. The osteoprogenitor cells are thought to be of mesenchymal origin, however recent research suggests a possible neural origin. The permissive environment is created mainly by reactions to hypoxia and both local and sensory nerve inflammation. Many possible inducing factors have been described ; the endogenic route is thought to be the most dominant in the stimulation of HO formation after TBI. The pathogenesis of NHO remains largely unknown, recent research, however, has discovered interesting topics for further research and new possible targets in the prevention of NHO.",

In this study, we aimed to examine the possible effects of intra-articular Hyaluronic Acid(HA) and platelet-rich plasma(PRP) injections on femoral cartilage thickness and to investigate their possible superiority over each other in KOA. A total of 40 KOA patients were included in the study and randomized to the HA and PRP groups. Pain complaints, stiffness, and functional status were evaluated with the Visual Analog Scale(VAS) and Western Ontario and Mc Master Universities Osteoarthritis(WOMAC) indices. Ultrasonography was used for measuring the femoral cartilage thickness. At the 6th month measurements, significant improvements were observed in VAS-rest, VAS-movement, and WOMAC scores in both HA and PRP groups compared to the measurements performed before the treatment. No significant difference was observed between the effects of the two treatment methods. There were significant changes in the medial, lateral and mean cartilage thicknesses on the symptomatic knee side in the HA group. The most important finding of this prospective randomized study, in which we compared the effects of PRP and HA injections on KOA, was the increase in knee femoral cartilage thickness in the HA injection group. This effect started in the 1st month and continued until the 6th month. No similar effect was detected with PRP injection. In addition to this basic result, both treatment approaches had significant positive effects on pain, stiffness, and function and no superiority was observed over each other.",

It discovered 10,140 patients: 92% (9320/10,140) admitted acutely: 81% (7535/9320) own homes, 19% (1755/9320) care homes, &lt;1% (31/9320) from other non-NHS origins.

No difference in ages: 80.1 years acutes vs 80.2 years inpatients, p=0.73. Gender was significant amongst inpatients: males 11% (317/3009) vs females 7% (504/7133), p&lt;0.001. The inpatient hip fractures had longer inpatient stays than the acutely admitted hip fractures (40 vs 17 days, p&lt;0.001) and spent a longer time in rehabilitation (32 vs 25 days, p&lt;0.001).

A transverse distal humerus fracture was generated in 5 cadaveric specimens. Rotation of the distal humeral fragment was performed on the medial column with a stable lateral column, as well as rotation of the lateral column with a stable medial column. Elbow flexion and extension range of motion were measured and repeated with an additional 5° and 10° of sagittal flexion and extension fracture deformity. All 4 fracture types suffered extension loss with increasing rotation. A peak extension loss was found within the range of 10-14° rotational deformity. A significant decrease in flexion of up to 50° was found in type MS2 fractures due to the interference of the radial head and the humeral metaphysis. Conversely, increased flexion motion was found in MS1 types. Fracture types and rotational malalignment should be considered when analyzing distal humeral fractures to predict future mobility with conservative treatment. The radial head seems to be the dominant factor in type MS fractures to predict flexion increase or limitation, while the extension limitation will gradually increase in both LS and MS type fractures. Future in vivo radiological and clinical studies are needed to validate these results. Level of Evidence: 3b.",

Recent studies have questioned this practice and suggested arthroplasty may be a more appropriate treatment method. Methods: 54 patients with an undisplaced intracapsular fracture were randomised between a cemented polished tapered stem hemiarthroplasty and internal fixation with Targon hip screws. The principle outcome was regain of mobility. Secondary outcomes included degree of residual pain, mortality, secondary surgery and surgical complications. Follow-up was by a nurse blinded to the implant and continued till three years from surgery for the surviving patients. Results: No significant differences in the primary outcome of regain of mobility were noted. Arthroplasty was associated with lower degrees of residual pain. No surgical complications were encountered in the arthroplasty group. In the fixation group there was one case of later fracture around the implant requiring surgery and two cases of avascular necrosis of the femoral head. There were no notable differences in mortality, hospital stay or general medical complications between the two groups. Conclusions: Arthroplasty may lead to improved outcomes compared to internal fixation in the treatment of an undisplaced intracapsular fracture in the elderly but further studies are required to confirm this.",

Stress shielding was found proximally in zones 1 and 7, while cancellous condensation was found distally in zones 3, 4, and 5. The postoperative bone mineral density of the femoral condyle was greater than that preoperatively in all zones, with the highest and lowest bone mineral density in zones 5 and 1, respectively, in all medullary configurations. In Dorr type C, there was no postoperative femoral pain or stem subsidence.

    "abstract": "Introduction. The health care sector is the fifth largest contributor to greenhouse emissions globally. Results of several studies have demonstrated that altering surgical practices from inpatient to outpatient service was associated with cost savings, reduction of medical waste and energy expenditure. The objective of this study was a comparison of costs and energy expenditure for hand surgeries performed in an operating theatre versus a ward procedure room. The analysis included the cost of materials, cost of sterilization of surgical instruments and energy expenditure for sterilization generated at standard hand surgery operations, including carpal tunnel release, surgery for Dupuytren’s disease, benign tumor and ganglion cyst excision, de Quervain’s disease, or trigger finger release. Typical hand surgery operations performed in a procedure room at the surgical ward generated lower costs (amounting to 53% of main theatre costs), 1 kg less clinical waste and were associated with significant (67%) reduction in energy expenditure compared to surgeries performed in the main operative theatre. Performing common hand surgery operations in a ward procedure room instead of the operating theatre resulted in significant economic and environmental benefits without compromising patient safety.",

    "abstract": "Background: Aim of the randomised controlled trial was to compare the long-term outcomes following external fixation with wrist distractor and Kirschner wires (EF) with those after internal fixation with volar locking plates (IF) of displaced, intra-articular distal radius fractures in patients 18 to 65 years of age. Methods: Surgery was performed after taking informed written consent following inclusion and randomisation. The primary outcomes were the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH) score and Jakim’s score, and secondary outcomes included wrist range of motion, grip strength and pain. Linear mixed models were employed to assess and compare the 2 groups. Results: The patients in both groups had comparable mean Quick DASH and Jakim’s score, range of motion, and grip strength with no significant differences between the groups at all follow-ups. The overall complication rate was equivalent between the 2 groups, although, the rate of reoperations was higher in the IF group (p=0.03). Implant prominence or impingement was responsible for the IF group result values falling short of normal limb values even on long-term follow-up. While, results of EF group homogenously and successfully achieved normal limb functionality. At 3 years the rate of follow-up was 97%. Conclusions: Biological healing through EF offers more natural anatomical restoration of the distal radius as evident by better long-term scores and statistically significant low reoperations rate. Absence of long-term bone-implant contact in EF group is identified as the sole factor promoting complete functional and clinical recovery. Level of Evidence: Therapeutic Level I.",

Similarly, approximately 20% of patients remain dissatisfied postoperatively. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and precision of the custom ORIGIN® TKA and assess the learning curve for its implementation. This retrospective, single-institution cohort study was conducted from March 2023 to June 2024. Forty-one patients with end-stage primary osteoarthritis, treated with custom TKA, were included. Primary outcomes measured alignment precision comparing the preoperative plan and the postoperative result on weightbearing full leg radiographs; secondary outcomes assessed the learning curve for operation time and alignment using cumulative summation (CUSUM) analysis. No significant differences between the planned and postoperative coronal alignment parameters were found, with a difference in means of -0.30° [95% CI: -1.40; 0.70] for HKA (P &gt; 0.41), 0.30° [95% CI: -0.40; 1.60] for mLDFA (P &gt; 0.43) and 0,10° [95% CI: -0.80; 1.00] for mMPTA (P &gt; 0.75) . However, significant deviations were observed in sagittal alignment, with a difference of -2.5° [95% CI: -5.10; -0.50] and -2.7° [95% CI: -4.00; -1.70] for PDFA (P &lt; 0.01) and PPTA (P &lt; 0.000) respectively. This indicates a loss of tibial slope and femoral flexion compared to the preoperative plan. CUSUM analysis indicated an inflexion point in operative time after twenty- six procedures. Linear regression did not show a significant correlation between the number of cases and operative time. No learning curve for alignment could be demonstrated. Custom TKA with patient-specific instruments provides high precision in coronal alignment but shows variability in sagittal alignment. The learning curve for operative time is short, indicating the practicality of integrating this technology into surgical practice.",

We aimed to evaluate the relationship between preoperative NCS and the outcome of patients who underwent carpal tunnel release (CTR). Medical records of patients who underwent CTR from January 2018 to December 2023 were reviewed retrospectively. Demographic, clinical characteristics and NCS reports were extracted. CTS severity was graded according to the Canterbury criteria. The outcome was defined as improved or not improved based on subjective symptoms at 2 months post-surgery. A total of 283 CTR cases were identified, with a mean patients age of 58.0±15.1 years and predominantly females (n=189, 75.0%). The main risk factors were obesity (34.6%) and diabetes mellitus (27.0%). Surgeries were performed on the right hand in 60.4% of cases. The mean duration of symptoms and the interval between NCS and surgery were 16.4±21.6 months and 10.1±13.4 months, respectively. Of the 201 reports of NCS, the majority had very severe CTS (25.4%), followed by mild (20.4%), moderate (18.9%), severe (17.4%), extremely severe (11.4%), normal (6.0%) and very mild (0.5%). From multivariate analysis, younger age (OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.91-0.99; p=0.024), more items of preoperative history and physical examination (OR 1.58; 95% CI 1.01-2.47; p=0.045) and preoperative NCS severity (p=0.006) were associated with improved outcomes. In addition to known prognostic factors, the utilization of NCS before CTR is crucial as the severity of preoperative NCS can be a predictor of postoperative outcomes.",

The question was if the dynamic component of muscle length changes after orthopedic surgery. A retrospective study was performed on ambulatory children with cerebral palsy who underwent either hamstring lengthening or gastrocnemius/Achilles tendon lengthening. A total of 135 consecutive patients with an average age of 13 years were included in the study. A single random side was selected for children with bilateral surgery and the affected limb was analyzed for those undergoing unilateral surgery. The popliteal angle measurement was performed with a quick and slow stretch, as well as the ankle dorsiflexion, and measurements were made using a goniometer. The difference (delta ml) between initial grab with fast stretch and end of range (EOR) with slow stretch was used as a measure of spasticity. The Bohannon modification of the Ashworth score was also assessed. Postoperatively, 18 degrees popliteal angle improvement in end-of-range and 32 degrees improvement in quick stretch in the hamstrings group were noted, with change in slow stretch, quick stretch and delta ml (comparison between quick and slow stretch) being significant at p < .0001. In the triceps surae group, 14 degrees ankle dorsiflexion improvement in end-of-range, and 18 degrees improvement in quick stretch were noted postoperatively, with change in slow stretch, quick stretch and delta ml at p < .0001, p < .0001, and p < .0180 respectively.

The role of supplementary operations performed prior to or concomitantly with the triple arthrodesis is crucial for correction of the deformity. Triple arthrodesis is a reliable procedure which generally produces good and satisfactory results.

In the Image group the occurrence rate of postoperative periprosthetic femoral fractures was higher (9.36%) compared to the Profile group (2.99%) and fractures occurred earlier (1.69 y vs. 8.84 y). The bulkier proximal part, the thinner cylindrical distal two thirds and the larger offset probably resulted in less rotational stability and increased proximal torsional load transfer during activities of daily living. This resulted in femoral fractures after minor trauma, without osteolysis.

We evaluated the effects of a fibular head based isometric reconstruction of the posterolateral knee corner with a double bundle semitendinosus tendon. From February 2001 to February 2005, 18 isometric reconstructions of a chronic posterolateral corner (PLC) injury of the knee were performed using the semitendinosus tendon. The average age of the patients was 39 years, ranging from 19 to 52 years. Twelve were male and 6 female. The time interval between injury and treatment ranged from 1.5 to 14 months. Three patients had simple PLC injuries, 10 had combined PLC-posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries and two of them had undergone a PCL reconstruction elsewhere 6.5 months prior to referral. Three other patients had an associated anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and two had a combination of PLC with ACL and PCL injury. A doubled semitendinosus tendon was threaded through bony tunnels in the fibular head running from the insertion of the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) to the fibular insertion of the popliteo-fibular ligament and both ends were fixed proximally into bony tunnels of the lateral femoral condyle at their respective isometric point. The varus stress test and the posterolateral rotation test were used to evaluate stability of the posterolateral structures. Isometry was optimal between the femoral attachment site of the popliteal tendon to the anatomical insertion of the popliteofibular ligament at the fibular head. The fibular insertion of the LCL is isometric to the anterior or antero-inferior 8-10 mm of the femoral insertion of the LCL. The average follow-up period was 32 months (30-42 months). There was no varus knee instability in full extension. At 30 degrees of flexion two cases demonstrated a grade I varus instability. A fibular head based isometric reconstruction is a reproducible and reliable technique for reconstruction of the posterolateral corner of the knee.",

    "abstract": "Giant cell tumour rarely involves the distal ulna; the literature has sporadic cases reported, and the need for reconstruction after distal ulnar resection remains controversial. The uncommon presentation often leads to diagnostic delays, and some of the cases reported have attained large sizes prior to diagnosis, leading' to procedures which range from soft tissue stabilization to bone graft reconstruction of the surgical defect. We analyzed our cases with specific reference to the need for additional reconstruction; the radiological and functional outcome of extraperiosteal distal ulna resection without reconstruction in 4 patients with giant cell tumour of the distal ulna was assessed at a mean follow-up of 9 years post surgical excision. In our experience there was no radiological evidence of recurrence, radioulnar convergence and ulnar translocation of the carpus. Functional outcome was graded as excellent in 3 and good in one patient. In conclusion, it could be suggested that there is no need for reconstruction after distal ulna resection for GCT as an adequate functional outcome is seen even in late diagnosed cases. Reconstructive procedures, which come at the cost of additional morbidity and complications, and requires special technical skills, are not routinely justified for this rare condition.",

The study included 122 male patients who underwent primary ACL reconstruction with a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft. Preoperative loss and change in muscle strength in both extensor and flexor muscle groups after ACL reconstruction were calculated separately at 60 degrees/sec and 180 degrees/sec angular velocities. We evaluated the effect of surgical delay on the preoperative deficit and on its change after surgery. Muscle strength change after ACL reconstruction was also evaluated in relation to patient compliance to treatment. The longer the delay of ACL reconstruction the more the muscle strength deficit of flexor and extensor muscles increased. In the ACL deficient knees with high strength deficit, improvement in muscle strength was higher after ACL reconstruction for both muscle groups. When delay of ACL reconstruction was short and the patient was compliant to treatment, flexor muscle strength recovery was early. Shortening the delay to reconstruction had a positive influence on muscle strength after ACL reconstruction when preoperative muscle strength deficit was high.",

    "abstract": "Fibrodysplasia (or Myositis) Ossificans Progressiva (FOP) is a rare genetic disease with variable expression, characterized by the association of congenital anomalies of the toes and fingers and progressive appearance of ectopic bone within the skeletal muscles, often following a trauma or an infection. FOP initially affects the nape and thoracic paravertebral muscles. With age, there is a progression of ossifications to other muscular groups following a proximodistal and cranio-caudal extension. Patients develop a restrictive respiratory insufficiency with atelectasis. The diagnosis of FOP is clinical and does not require biopsy. Circumscribed post-traumatic ossifying myositis is the most important differential diagnosis. It is characterized by the appearance of painful ossifications, in young adults, following a trauma and is limited to one localisation. The conservative treatment of FOP remains unsatisfactory. Surgical removal of osteomas to restore joint mobility leads to the development of additional heterotopic ossifications. Each surgical attempt brings about a quasi-inevitable recurrence. Anaesthesia of patients with FOP is difficult because of spinal rigidity and ankylosis of the jaw. Surgery is indicated only with a focused indication to correct an invalidating deformity.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study is to assess the results of indirect reduction and hybrid external fixation in management of comminuted tibial plateau fractures. The study included 28 patients with high-energy tibial plateau fractures (Schatzker type V and VI). The ages ranged from 22 to 58 years with an average of 35 years. The trauma was a road traffic accident in 16 cases and a fall from a height in 12 cases. Concomitant soft tissue injuries were present in 18 cases such as skin wounds in 6 cases, excessive swelling with skin blisters in 9 cases, and compartment syndrome in 3 cases. After clinical and radiological evaluation all the patients were treated by indirect reduction using a traction table and a hybrid external fixator. The average time to healing was 3.2 months. At the final follow-up the range of knee movement ranged from 0 degrees-140 degrees with an average of 110 degrees. The results were satisfactory in 23 cases and unsatisfactory in 5 cases according to the Rasmussen knee functional score. Complications included pin tract infection in 12 cases, an extension lag in 2 cases, varus deformity of about 15 degrees in one case, deep infection in one case and early osteoarthritic changes in 2 cases. Hybrid external fixation is a good method for treatment of comminuted tibial plateau fractures. It allows for early joint movement and reduces the risk of serious complications.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to identify factors that inde- pendently predict increased rates of transfusion following total hip arthroplasty (THA) surgery. A retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing THA surgery over 12 months was performed. Electronic operative records were analysed to determine the following patient factors: American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, body mass index (BMI), co-morbidities, indication for surgery, surgical technique, type of implant used, haematological markers, hospital length of stay (LOS) and complications. A total of 244 patients were included. There were 141 females (58%) and 103 males (42%). The median age was 65±12. The median pre-operative blood volume was 4500mls (IQR; 4000-5200). The median blood loss was 1069mls (IQR; 775-1390). The total number of patients requiring transfusion was 28 (11%), with a median of two units being transfused. Pre-operative haemoglobin (p<0.001) level, haematocrit (p<0.001) level and weight (p=0.016) were found to be predictive of transfusion requirement as well as ASA grade (p=0.005). Application of an intra-operative surgical drain was associated with higher rates of transfusion (p<0.001). Our study strengthens the evidence that pre-operative haemoglobin and haematocrit levels are valuable predictors of patients requiring transfusion. Additionally, ASA grade may be viewed as a helpful factor in predicting risk of transfusion. A strategy incorporating pre-operative optimisation of modifiable factors may reduce rates of transfusion requirement.",

The aims of this prospective study were to identify gait deviations in children with osteogenesis imperfecta compared to age-matched controls and establish relationships with clinical features. We evaluated 22 patients with different types of osteogenesis imperfecta using three-dimensional gait analysis. The incidence and location of frac- tures, fracture at birth, age at first fracture, use of intramedullary rodding and number of surgical in- terventions in the lower extremities, bone mineral density, hypermobility and number of injections of bisphosphonates were recorded for each patient. Step length was lower in the osteogenesis imperfecta group compared with the control group. Kinematics showed that sagittal pelvic and transversal hip range of motion were higher in the osteogenesis imperfecta group, whereas sagittal knee range of motion during swing phase was reduced. Regarding kinetics, hip flexion moment and hip negative power peak were significantly decreased in the osteogenesis imperfecta group. Mechanical and energetic parameters were considered as normal. The principal component analysis revealed that the bone mineral density was increased in children who had received more in- jections of bisphosphonates and these had also less deficit in kinematic parameters. Main modifications in gait parameters were observed in spatiotemporal, kinematic and kinetic data. More studies are necessary to allow stratification of severity of the osteogenesis imperfecta disease, help improve its challenging multidisciplinary treatment and ob- jectively assess treatment outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Tibial plateau fractures are complex injuries which carry significant morbidity and economic burden. They can present complex geometry depending upon the direction of the force and position of the limb and are often associated with significant soft-tissue injury. While the goals of adequate reduction, stable fixation, and early mobilization remain unchanged, the management of these injuries can be challenging even to experienced orthopaedic surgeons. Lacking consensus, this review aims to provide a summary of current state of orthopaedic practice in the face of tibial plateau fractures. A PubMed search for relevant recent articles as well as a reading of classical articles on tibial plateau fractures was carried out. The focus remained on articles concerned with management modalities and recent advances. A review of some classification systems was also done and included. A great majority of these fractures need operative fixation while respecting the soft tissues. Numerous methods have been reported in the literature including but not limited to plates, screws, external fixators, arthroscopy assisted methods, balloon-cement tibioplasty, or a combination thereof. There is a shortage of randomized controlled trials comparing various operative methods. This article provides a review of various techniques and latest advances made in the management of tibial plateau fractures. The key to achieving optimal functional outcome is using a tailored approach to the individual patient accounting for factors related to the injury pattern, type of host, surgical skills and experience, and local availability of implant devices while taking care of soft tissue. While there is no gold standard, a staged procedure is recommended with early spanning and definitive fixation at later stage by any appropriate methods while respecting the soft tissue, achieving anatomical reduction and adequate fixation and, early rehabilitation.",

Sixty patients (66 hip joints) with ONFH were included in this retrospective cross-sectional analysis (mean follow-up: 58 months, 19-110 months). Potential ONFH risk factors and comorbidities (ONFH stage, age, sex, alcohol, smoking, cortisone medication, chemotherapy) were recorded. The influence of specific parameters on the joint preservation rates was evaluated by a multivariate logistic regression analysis. Finally, patients with preserved hip joints underwent an assessment of their last available X-rays. The joint preservation rate depended on the initial ONFH Steinberg stage (I+II: 82.8%, III: 70.8%, ≥ IVa: 38.5%). Initially collapsed ONFH (p ≤ 0.001) and cortisone therapy (p = 0.004) significantly decreased the joint preservation rates. In case of progressed ONFH, the presence of ≥ 2 risk factors resulted in higher THA conversion rates (stage III: OR 18.8; stage ≥IVa: OR 12). In 94% of the available X-rays, the ONFH stage improved or did not progress. No complications could be attributed to the E-Stim device or procedure. The present surgical protocol including minimally invasive E-Stim revealed high joint preservation rates for non-collapsed ONFH after mid-term postoperative follow-up. Especially in progressed ONFH, the-risk profile seems to be crucial and hence, for joint preserving surgery, careful patient selection is recommended.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Arthrodesis is the gold standard for treating distal interphalangeal arthropathy of the long fingers (IPD) and interphalangeal arthropathy of the thumb (IP). While many surgical techniques have been documented to have high consolidation rates (80–100%), none appeared to be superior to the others. In 2008, the intramedullary X-Fuse implant (Stryker, Switzerland) demonstrated favorable clinical and radiographic outcomes in a limited study with short-term follow-up. Building upon these findings, this study aimed to evaluate the objective and subjective findings of arthrodesis of IPD and IP using the X-Fuse® implant over a medium-term period. Patients and methods: We retrospectively included 53 patients (49 women and 4 men) who underwent arthrodesis of the IPD or IP joint surgery between May 2012 and January 2021. All surgeries were performed by senior hand surgeons at the same hospital, employing identical surgical techniques. Afterward, patients were immobilized for 6 weeks postoperatively. For analyses, data were extracted from patients’ medical records. Results: A total of 64 arthrodeses were assessed (with 6 patients lost to follow-up). The average follow-up period was 59.8 (±28) months. The mean QuickDASH score at the last review was 17.1 (±17), and the mean visual analog scale score was 0.64 (±1.6). Notably, more than 90% of patients reported good or excellent satisfaction with the surgery, and radiographic fusion was achieved in over 90% of cases, with an average fusion period of 12.9 weeks (±1.3). However, six cases of pseudarthrosis were documented, with only one requiring revision surgery due to symptoms. Discussion: X-Fuse® implant arthrodesis yields satisfactory clinical and radiographical outcomes, providing good long-term stability and low complication rates. This technique is considered reliable and reproducible for patients with primary osteoarthritis, inflammatory conditions, and post-traumatic arthropathies.",

    "abstract": "Total hip replacement revision surgery has become increasingly prevalent in today's society. This causes issues since, for each revision surgery, the quantity of accessible bone stock decreases and the complexity of surgery increases. As a result, readily available implants may not always address the patient's individual demands. For those patients, custom- made implants may be a feasible option. This paper is a retrospective cohort-analysis of 5 patients who received an aMace custom-made acetabular implant produced by Materialise, placed by a single surgeon. At the time of writing, we conducted a cross-sectional cohort analysis of patients who received this custom-made acetabular implant between 2014 and 2016. The mean follow-up time of 5 patients was 7.8 years (range: 6.3 - 10.6 years). All patients achieved excellent outcomes; there were no implant failures or known adverse events. Radiographic images demonstrate significant implant ingrowth with no signs of loosening. All patients expressed satisfaction and withheld no to minor complaints. Harris Hip Score (HHS) values ranged between 70.7 and 99.5, with a mean score of 85.6. The aMace custom-made acetabular implant is a feasible option in patients with severe acetabular defects undergoing revision arthroplasty. At this moment, the primary issues are the cost of the cup and the reimbursement criteria.",

The trabecular structures of the femoral neck of 130 patients (57 with right-sided hip joint OA and 73 with left-sided hip joint OA) were evaluated and compared with the Fractal Analysis Method, taking into account gender and hip joint orientation. The fractal dimension calculated from the femoral neck on the right and left sides was similar to the healthy side in individuals with OA (p=0.647, p=0.929, respectively). When OA and healthy joints were compared separately on the right and left sides, the value on the osteoarthritic side was found to be significantly lower (p<0.05). When examined without distinguishing between the right and left sides, the fractal dimensions were found to be significantly lower in osteoarthritic joints than in the healthy side (p=0.001). When gender was taken into account, the fractal dimension calculated in both healthy individuals and individuals with OA was found to be similar in women and men (p>0.05). The fractal dimensions of the femoral neck trabecular structure of the osteoarthritic hip joint that was evaluated in pelvis radiography were low on the osteoarthritic side.

While there is an abundance of studies concerning chondral repair techniques, there have been relatively few studies that have examined outcomes following cartilage repair in skeletally immature patients. Therefore, we planned to answer the following question: does the AMIC® technique result in positive outcomes for the repair of cartilage lesions in the knee in adolescent patients ? Our hypothesis was that the AMIC® technique improves outcomes for skeletally immature patients with an ICRS stage III or IV osteochondral lesion two year after the surgery. This was an European retrospective, multicenter study, including 27 patients aged from 12 to 19 years. We included adolescents with open epiphysis on x-ray, with an ICRS stage III or IV symptomatic lesion of the knee. The average defect size was 2.3 cm2. All patients had been treated with the surgical technique AMIC®. Post-operative outcomes were assessed by the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Results showed a significant improvement at a mean follow-up of 2.6 years (min 2; max 6 years) across all KOOS domains: 55 vs. 69% (p<0.001) on symptoms, 58 vs. 87% (p<0.001) on pain, 31 vs. 71% (p<0.001) on quality of life, 29 vs. 73% (p<0.001) on sports and leisure activities, and 67 vs. 90% (p<0.001) on activities of daily life. AMIC® technique performed for the repair of stage III or IV ICRS articular cartilage lesions in the knees of adolescent patients, provides clinical improvements 2.6 years after surgery, but results are not perfect with adolescents who may still symptomatic.",

Data were collected on dislocation rate, directions, timing, associated risk factors, and revision surgeries. Hip function outcomes were assessed using the Oxford Hip Score (OHS), comparing patients with and without dislocations. The dislocation rate was 0.7% (n=21), with 81% of dislocations occurring in the anterior direction and 86% occurring within the first postoperative month. Dislocations were most commonly associated with sitting or rising from a seated position. Patients with dislocations had a higher mean Body Mass Index (29.6 vs 27.0 kg/m², p=0.007). Five patients (24%) required revision surgery. At one-year follow-up, no significant differences in OHS were observed between patients with and without dislocations. Dislocation after DAA THA are rare, with the majority being anterior. Dislocations occur in different positions, but mostly in a seated position, suggesting that specific postoperative precautions may be unnecessary.

    "abstract": "Numerous papers present in-vivo knee kinematics data following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) from fluoroscopic testing. Comparing data is challenging given the large number of factors that could potentially affect the reported kinematics. This paper aims to understand the effects of some of the most pertinent factors: 1. What is the role of post-cam interaction and implant geometry in total knee kinematics? 2. Do tibiofemoral kinematics vary with different activities? 3. Is there a correlation between landmark-based and contact points kinematics? Thirty patients who underwent TKA between 2014 and 2016 were assessed at a minimum follow-up period of six months. Given the use of three different posterior stabilized implants in the hospital, the first ten patients per implant who attended follow-up consultations and demonstrated a minimum of 90° knee flexion, were included in the study. The tibiofemoral kinematics during both open kinetic chain flexion-extension and closed kinetic chain exercises, such as rising from a chair and squatting, were examined using fluoroscopy. Single-plane fluoroscopic analysis (2D) was used to record the data, which was subsequently converted to 3D implant positions to evaluate the tibiofemoral contact points and landmark-based kinematic parameters. Significantly different anteroposterior translations and internal-external rotations were observed between the considered implants. Comparing the activities, a significantly more posterior position was observed for both the medial and lateral compartments in the closed chain activities during mid-flexion. A strong and significant correlation was found between the contact points and landmark-based analysis methods. However, large individual variations were also observed, yielding a difference of up to 25% in anteroposterior position between both methods. In conclusion, all three evaluated factors significantly affect the obtained tibiofemoral kinematics. Diagnostic, Level IV Case series.",

The radius fracture was located in the middle third for 71% of cases. The average distal radio- ulnar index was 3.6 mm. Osteosynthesis of the radius was carried out using a screwed plate before stability testing of the distal radio-ulnar joint. In case of instability, ulno-radial pin fixation wirst in supination was done for 45 days. At the mean follow-up of 38 months, all patients were evaluated using Mestdagth score. Bone consolidation was achieved within an average time of 75 days. At a mean follow-up of 38 months, internal fixation by radial plate and ulno-radial pinning achieved a good functional result in 73.7% of cases (p=0.03). Patients treated only by pinning without use of plate had a poor functional score. The treatment of Galeazzi fractures using a radial screwed plate and radioulnar pinning provides satisfactory results and a low complication rate.",

    "abstract": "Since most clinical studies on humeral shaft fractures exclude polytraumatized patients, the epidemiology in this population is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to describe the fracture type, treatment, and outcome of humeral shaft fractures in adult polytraumatized patients. A case series with a single follow-up questionnaire was performed in patients aged 16 years or older with a humeral shaft fracture and an injury severity score of 16 or higher, admitted to a level 1 trauma center between January 1, 2007, and July 31, 2021. Details on injuries, treatment, and clinical outcome were collected from the national trauma registry and medical records. Patients were asked to complete the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH), EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D), and Short Form-36 (SF- 36). Twenty-nine patients were included. The median age was 41 years and 18 (62%) were male. Most fractures were type A (N=19; 66%). Most patients were treated operatively (N=26; 90%) within three days. Radial nerve palsy at presentation was reported in five (20%) patients. Infection occurred in one (4%) patient and nonunion in six (27%) patients. The patient-reported outcome measures were as follows (median; quartiles): DASH (20.0; P25-P75 5.6-35.2), EQ utility (0.75; P25-P75 0.58-0.88) and visual analog score (0.80; P25-P75 71-95), SF-36 physical (49; P25-P75 43- 55) and mental component summary (58; P25-P75 47-61). Humeral shaft fractures in adult polytraumatized patients were most often AO-type A and treated operatively. Radial nerve palsy at presentation and nonunion rates were high. Patients still reported upper extremity disability at approximately five years post trauma. Level of evidence: Prognosis study Level IV: Case series.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the anatomical incongruity between the proximal humerus and the PHILOS plate, which may lead to varus malreduction when this plate is used for indirect reduction. Fifty Asian cadaveric human humeri were included in the study. Three-hole and five-hole PHILOS plates were appropriately positioned on the lateral cortex of the proximal humerus. The gap distance between the plate and the lateral surface of the proximal humerus at each screw hole was measured using a digital vernier caliper. A Kirschner wire was inserted into the humeral head, guided by the locking sleeve. The angle between the plate and the lateral cortex was then measured. Differences in plate-bone distance and angles between the different plate lengths were analyzed using a paired t-test. The correlation between demographic variables and mismatched data was evaluated using Pearson correlation. All measurements were conducted by two observers to assess inter-observer reliability. In all specimens, the maximum gap distance was observed at the most proximal screw hole. The average plate-bone distance at this location was 2 mm for the 3-hole plate and 3 mm for the 5-hole plate. The average plate-bone angle was 2.9 degrees for the 3-hole plate and 3.2 degrees for the 5-hole plate. No correlation was found between total humeral length and either the plate-bone distance or the plate-bone angle. Due to the anatomical mismatch between the PHILOS plate and the proximal humerus, caution is advised when using the plate for indirect reduction, as it may lead to secondary varus malreduction.",

    "abstract": "Managing greater tuberosity (GT) fractures, especially those with glenohumeral (GH) dislocations, poses a challenge in balancing stable fixation while promoting early mobilization. While surgical fixation is often required for significant displacement, the optimal fixation technique remains debated due to the risk of complications and inconsistent outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of the Modified Hook Wiring (MHW) technique for open reduction and internal fixation of isolated displaced GT fractures. Thirteen patients with a mean age of 49.4±4.7 years were treated using the MHW technique, with 84.6% presenting concomitant GH dislocations. The mean follow-up was 16±3.3 months. The functional evaluation using the Constant-Murley and ASES scores yielded averages of 77.9±16.9 and 83.1±19.6 at one year, with no relevant changes at the final follow-up. The average range of motion showed forward flexion of 148°±31° and abduction of 142.3°±26.2°. The mean subjective shoulder value reached 81.5%±13.6%, while the mean visual analog scale score was 1.46±1.7. Radiographic analysis confirmed complete fracture healing in all cases by 9.7±1.3 weeks, with no evidence of displacement or malunion. Two patients (15.3%) experienced postoperative stiffness, and one developed a superficial wound infection. The results suggest that the MHW technique offers stable fixation, reliable union, and satisfactory shoulder function, making it a promising alternative for treating displaced GT fractures, particularly in the setting of GH dislocation. Its facilitation of early shoulder mobilization and low complication profile highlight potential benefits over conventional fixation methods. This study provides Level IV evidence.

This review compares open and arthroscopic dorsal capsulodesis techniques for chronic (pre-)dynamic SLIL tears, aiming to identify the most effective method for optimizing outcomes and preventing SLAC wrist progression. A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library was performed. Fourteen studies met inclusion criteria. Included studies assessed long-term clinical, patient reported and radiographic outcomes (≥6 weeks post-injury). Studies combining dorsal capsulodesis with other techniques (except primary ligament repair) were excluded. Heterogeneous outcome measures precluded statistical comparison. While older techniques (Lavernia, Blatt) resulted in significant ROM loss and failed to prevent SLAC wrist, newer open procedures (Berger, Modified Viegas) showed improved results, with the Modified Viegas technique demonstrating less ROM decrease. The all-arthroscopic Mathoulin procedure showed the most promising results regarding clinical, patient-reported outcomes, and SLAC wrist prevention. Thermal shrinkage/abrasion showed the worst outcomes. Since open procedures also require arthroscopy, all-arthroscopic techniques may be more cost efficient. The Mathoulin procedure appears the most effective even in severe tears and less favorable cases, although this review suggests some open procedures may not necessarily lead to greater ROM loss than arthroscopic ones. The Mathoulin procedure shows promise for chronic SLIL tears without arthritis and may fit into current treatment algorithms. However, larger trials with longer follow-up are needed.",

    "abstract": "Upper extremity fractures are increasingly common in Western Europe due to an aging population and rising osteoporosis rates. Treatment approaches vary significantly, influenced by fracture type, bone quality, and patient- surgeon preferences, with limited consensus on optimal rehabilitation. A key challenge is identifying when to initiate safe, early functional rehabilitation, as guidelines lack clarity on progressive mobilization. A prospective observational study of operatively treated proximal humeral and distal radius fractures was performed. Feasibility was assessed through clinical observation of patient progress using patient- reported outcome measures and feedback from both medical and paramedical professionals. Twenty patients and 10 professionals participated. Feasibility questionnaires indicated high protocol usability, though suggestions included simplifying it into a pocket card. Rapid functional improvement was observed within six weeks, with one complication (material failure) noted. The PERFoRM protocol is safe and feasible, though larger-scale studies are needed. Future research should examine its applicability to a broader patient population, potentially extending to all upper extremity fractures except hand fractures.",

Retrospective study investigated 51 feet in 48 patients with central primary metatarsalgia between the 2nd and 4th metatarsal. Associated procedures included hallux valgus and lesser toe corrections. Patients were evaluated radiographically with comparison of their forefoot morphotypes after the DMMO procedure to their preoperative state regarding the Maestro criteria. A subgroup of 17 patients was evaluated for union in 3 months and functionally by the AOFAS and VAS scale. Ten percent of the 48 patients were male and ninety percent were female with a mean age of 52.1 ± 11.7 (range 23 to 70) years. In total 148 DMMOs were performed in 51 feet. Osteotomies were localized on M2 and M3 in 10% and on three metatarsals (M2-M3-M4) in 90%). In 84% associated procedures were performed. All radiographic parameters of the Maestro criteria were significantly different preoperative compared to postoperative (p<0.05). In 94% patients of the subgroup there was a bony consolidation at three months. There was a mean AOFAS-score of 76.8 ± 15.1 (range 49-95) and a mean VAS-score of 2.7 ± 1.7 (range 1-6). There were late complications in 8% of the patients. DMMO is effective for treating primary central metatarsalgia unless the ideal harmonious forefoot was not restored. For DMMO the Maestro criteria have no predictive value for clinical outcome in preoperative planning. Further studies are necessary to correlate the functional improvement.

    "abstract": "Intertrochanteric fractures and knee osteoarthritis are prevalent among elderly patients; however, the relationship between the complexity of these fractures and the severity of knee osteoarthritis remains poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between the complexity of intertrochanteric fractures and the severity of knee osteoarthritis in elderly patients. A total of 130 elderly patients with knee osteoarthritis, admitted between February 2021 and June 2023, were divided into a non-fracture group (77 patients) and a fracture group (53 patients). The fracture group was further stratified into a simple fracture subgroup (23 cases) and a complex fracture subgroup (30 cases). The Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) score, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score, and Kellgren-Lawrence (K-L) grade were compared across the groups. Pearson correlation analysis was employed to assess the relationship between these variables and fracture complexity. Results revealed that the non-fracture group exhibited significantly higher HSS scores (64.88 ± 9.87 vs. 57.36 ± 10.08) and a greater proportion of mild K-L grade cases (80.52% vs. 20.75%) compared to the fracture group. Conversely, the fracture group demonstrated higher WOMAC scores (35.67 ± 8.19 vs. 43.22 ± 10.77) and a higher proportion of severe K-L grade cases (19.48% vs. 79.25%). Within the fracture group, the simple fracture subgroup had higher HSS scores (63.14 ± 9.27 vs. 55.43 ± 9.54) and lower WOMAC scores and severe K-L grade proportions compared to the complex fracture subgroup. HSS scores were negatively correlated with fracture occurrence (r = -0.351), while WOMAC scores and K-L grades were positively correlated with fracture complexity (r = 0.372, 0.592). These findings suggest a positive correlation between the complexity of intertrochanteric fractures and the severity of knee osteoarthritis, indicating that more severe osteoarthritis may be predictive of more complex fractures.",

However, there is no evidence-based consensus on the optimal age for correction. Purpose: This study aims to determine best age for optimal correction of the knee alignment. Methods : All medical records of patients in our department treated by percutaneous hemiepiphysiodesis for idiopathic genua valga between 2007 and 2017 were reviewed. Skeletal age was determined pre-operatively. The hip-knee-ankle angle was measured on a standard frontal full leg radiograph, preoperatively, at time of removal of the screws and at skeletal maturity. The occurrence of correction loss and progression and the velocity of correction based on skeletal age were evaluated. Results: A total of 164 legs were reviewed, of which 120 were followed until skeletal maturity. We perceived more insufficient valgus correction when treated at a skeletal age approximating skeletal maturity, however, also rebound valgus was noted in patients with only a short time to skeletal maturation at time of treatment. Overcorrection after screw removal was only perceived in 4.27%. A large individual variation in velocity of correction was observed. Conclusion: In our study protocol with hemi-epiphysiodesis at 2 years from skeletal maturation, good results were obtained. Velocity of correction can be calculated to determine a patient specific timing for clinical and radiographical follow-up to avoid overcorrection. Level of evidence: IV",

Periprosthetic bone density in two comparable groups (30 each) of cemented and uncemented knee replacements was measured with DEXA scanner. Bone loss was more in the area posterior to the anterior femoral flange in the cemented subgroup, nearing statistical significance (p = 0.059). In both groups, the reported bone density at a median of four years postoperatively was reduced at several periprosthetic sites. However, the method of fixation could not be clearly demonstrated to influence the bone loss differentially. This brings into question the use of the more expensive cementless implants. Reduction in bone density in both groups at several periprosthetic sites remains a concern. Whether or not this can be addressed with medical intervention like post arthroplasty bisphosphonate treatment needs further consideration.",

This allowed for early unimpeded movement in wrist and hand together with ease of wire removal in clinic. Reduction was maintained in all patients until fracture healing, and there were no malunions. One was re-done owing to inadequate reduction intra-operatively, which thereafter united. One re-fractured and was subsequently treated non-operatively. There were two superficial infections. One patient was lost to follow-up at 4 weeks; the rest regained a full range of pain-free movement. In a final assessment of 62 patients, the mean DASH score was 4.6. We recommend this technique for metacarpal fractures that are: transverse and off-ended; angulated transverse or short oblique; multiple transverse or short oblique. We do not recommend this technique for long oblique or rotationally malaligned fractures.",

Between January 2004 and January 2020, 45 patients underwent treatment of presumed aseptic non-union of the humeral shaft by osteosynthesis combining intramedullary nailing and a screw plate. The minimum radio-clinical follow-up was one year postoperatively. The series included 19 men and 26 women with a mean age of 53 years (range 19-84 years). Bone consolidation was achieved in 43 patients, a rate of 95.5%. Comparing patients who achieved bone consolidation with the two failed consolidations did not reveal any statistically significant factor. Interobserver agreement was almost perfect (k=0.93) for the use of the RUST for humeral shaft fractures treated with intramedullary nailing and screw plate. In our study, the treatment of presumed aseptic non- union of the humeral shaft with an osteosynthesis combining intramedullary nailing and screw plate gives, with 95.5% of bone consolidation, results equal to or even superior to the different treatments currently described in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Osteoarthritis is a prevalent degenerative disease that affects many people worldwide. The use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the setting of osteoarthritis has been explored by many clinical trials in the literature. Exploring these clinical trials is important for assessing the benefit of this modality in the setting of osteoarthritis. Methods: On November 9, 2022, a search was conducted on PubMed/MEDLINE databases to explore clinical trials involving MSC injections for osteoarthritis. Only articles that were clinical trials, explored the use of MSC injections in osteoarthritis, involved human subjects, and written in English language, were included. Relevant data was extracted from the included trials. Results: A total of 43 trials were included (N=43). The knee was most the commonly explored joint (95.4%), and adipose tissue was the most commonly utilized MSC source (49%). All but one trial (97.7%) reported clinical improvement in the MSC group on follow up, and 33 trials (76.7%) reported better clinical outcomes in the MSC groups when compared to control groups. Twenty-three trials (53.5%) used imaging to evaluate outcomes following MSC injections, out of which twenty (46.5%) reported improvements in the affected joint. Similarly, four trials (9.3%) used second look arthroscopy, out of which three (7%) reported better outcomes on follow up. Conclusion: While published trials show good therapeutic potential for MSC injections in the setting of osteoarthritis, several discrepancies render the efficiency and reliability of this modality equivocal. The adoption of standardized protocols, employment of comprehensive evaluation tools, and reporting negative results is essential in order to appropriately assess the utility of MSC injections for the treatment of osteoarthritis.",

    "abstract": "Despite advancements in surgical techniques for rotator cuff repair, retear rates remain a significant concern. This study systematically reviews the evidence on the effectiveness of the Regeneten Bioinductive Implant in improving healing outcomes. A systematic review of the literature was conducted by searching on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection and Cochrane Library. Studies reporting on effectiveness, safety, radiological, clinical outcomes, or patient- reported outcomes after Regeneten use, with at least 12 months of follow-up, were considered. 17 articles were included in this review, encompassing data on 1062 rotator cuff tears, of which 966 were treated with Regeneten. The implant use resulted in retear rates of 0% up to 18% after 5 years in PT tears and 0% up to 35% after 2 years in FT tears. In 1 randomised trial, the retear rate was significantly lower in the implant group compared to the control group. Constant- Murley Score (CMS) and the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score showed a sustained improvement compared to pre-operative scores across all studies. MRI showed increased tendon thickness starting from 6 months, with MRI signals suggesting that the implant was integrating with the native tendon and becoming indistinguishable. While using Regeneten for rotator cuff tears of various sizes and chronicity is associated with reduced retear rates in some studies, the clinical outcomes remain within the same range as those seen with traditional rotator cuff repair. Additional randomized controlled trials are required to validate these results and clarify the appropriate indications for using this implant.",

The incidences of bilateral tibial fractures and bilateral femoral shaft fractures were 3.8% and 4.6% respectively. The median Injury Severity Score (ISS) in TF group was 13 (9-29) compared to 16 (9-34) in the FF group (p = 0.169). The mean resuscitation requirements were 4.2 (3-11) litres of colloids and crystalloids and 1.7 (0-10) units of blood in the TF group and 10.6 (6-16) litres of colloids and crystalloids and 9.2 (5-25) units of blood in the FF group (p = 0.002).

Patients with bilateral tibial shaft fractures revealed lower ISS, resuscitation requirements, ARDS, associated injuries, and mortality when compared to bilateral femoral shaft fractures. This is probably due to the anatomical difference in the morphology of the bones, volume of liberated intravascular marrow fat, organisation and layout of the venous capillary network and severity of associated injuries.",

During trauma and orthopaedic surgery, the use of power tools increases spraying of bodily fluid, hence resulting in an increased risk of infectious splash injury to the face. This prospective study involved 25 patients. The visors worn by the operating team were examined postoperatively to identify any visible blood, fat and body tissue splashes. Eleven patients underwent knee arthroplasty. Splash counts to the surgeon's mouth/lip, nose/cheek and eye regions were 217, 105, and 62 respectively; they were 258, 147, and 82 for the assistant. Fourteen patients had hip replacement; splash counts to the surgeon's mouth/lip, nose/cheek and eye regions were 214, 90, and 53 respectively, and 137, 39 and 27 for the assistant. To conclude, the face is vulnerable to material and fluid strikes during joint arthroplasty surgery. The visor is a reliable barrier to blood, fat and body tissue splashes and minimises the risk of exposure to blood-borne viruses. Therefore, a visor should be worn during all joint arthroplasty procedures and any procedure that involves the use of power tools.",

    "abstract": "Calcific myonecrosis is a rare, late complication of compartment syndrome in the lower extremity. In this condition an entire single muscle of the leg is replaced by a fusiform mass with central liquefaction and peripheral calcification. Calcific myonecrosis presents a diagnostic dilemma to the clinician; it has to be considered in the differential diagnosis of a calcifying soft tissue tumour in the lower extremity. The purpose of this report is to highlight the importance of recognition of the lesion and its key clinico-pathological presenting features leading to appropriate management. We describe the unique presentation, diagnosis and surgical management of calcific myonecrosis involving only the flexor hallucis longus muscle of the leg in a middle-age adult. We found MRI Scan as the most useful method of investigation. Diagnosis can be confirmed by yellow-brown paste like material within the lesion intra-operatively or by aspiration and further by histology. We recommend complete excision of the lesion and closure of the wound with compression dressing, to avoid secondary infection.",

All scaphoid fractures were immobilised until union was achieved. One hundred twenty one skeletally immature patients were referred for a suspected fracture of the scaphoid. Fourteen patients (11.5%) did have a scaphoid fracture, an incidence of 15 per 100,000 (0.55% of all paediatric injuries referred). Mean delay in being seen was 2.6 days, and mean follow-up time was 52.3 days. Only plain radiography was used to diagnose and follow up scaphoid fractures. Fractures of the scaphoid in skeletally immature individuals are uncommon, are usually undisplaced, occur more commonly in the distal portion of the bone, and carry a good prognosis.",

The aim of this study is to investigate whether an advanced cryotherapy device does not increase the risk of complications and improves knee function or decreases swelling. A prospective cohort of TKA patients was formed by a cryotherapy group and a control group. The primary outcome was complication ratio. Our secondary outcomes were functional results and swelling. No significant differences were found in complication ratio between 31 patients in the cryotherapy group and 31 patients in the control group. The cryotherapy group showed a significant better knee flexion and less swelling in the early rehabilitation phase. No differences were found at the other follow-up moments or in the other outcomes. This advanced cryotherapy device is safe in respect of postoperative complications, improves knee function and decreases swelling in the early rehabilitation phase. However, it is questionable if an advanced cryotherapy device with its additional costs is necessary to provide the desired effects of cryotherapy.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of patients who had the \"fix and replace\" construct for complex posterior hip fracture dislocation treated at our tertiary referral pelvic unit. This was a retrospective review of prospectively collected data for patients who underwent this procedure between 2011-2018 with a minimum of 3 year follow up. Data collected were: patient demographics, date of injury, injury pattern, fixation methods, type of implants used and post-operative complications. There were 14 patients with a mean age of 63.2 years (range 43-94 years) who underwent this procedure between 2011-2018. The mean follow up was 58 months. All cases involved a posterior wall fracture and six cases had an associated posterior column involvement. Femoral head autograft was used in 13 patients (93%). Six patients (43%) had their posterior acetabular wall reconstructed with a femoral head autograft. Seven patients had a fully cemented (THR) and the seven others had a hybrid implant. There were no surgical related complications. From our study we can conclude that the acute \"fix and replace\" construct for complex posterior hip fracture dislocation yields good clinical outcomes in the short and medium term with low complication rate. It is best performed by a surgeon who specialises in both acetabular and hip arthroplasty surgery.",

There are evidence that Hyaluronic Acid (HA) and Platelet-rich Plasma (PRP) have different mechanisms of action in the treatment of arthropathy for this reason we decided to use both components. The aim of this study is to compare, the efficacy, safety and duration of a single intra-articular injection of PRP against PRP+HA for pain, bleeding episodes and joint health, in the same patient with bilateral hemophilic knee arthropathy. Twenty-one men patients (42 knee joints) were treated with intra- articular injections of PRP or PRP+HA. All of them were haemophilia type A severe. The mean age was 36.6 years (21-72). All patients were evaluated for: Haemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS), pain (VAS), the number of bleeding episodes (BE) in the last 30 days, before treatment, at three and six months after treatment. Statistically significant improvement were shown for both knee joints at three and six months after treatment for VAS and BE (P < 0.00001). The HJHS score did not significantly improve for either knee in the 6-month period after injection. A single PRP or PRP+HA injection is safe and effective in treating haemophilic arthropathy of the knee for up to 6 months follow-up, reducing pain, bleeding episodes and delaying total knee arthroplasty.",

Thirty-nine patients with moderate-severe stable SCFE were evaluated regarding their vitamin D level and to which extent the severity of vitamin D deficiency, if present, can be correlated with the severity and bilaterality of the slip. Vitamin D serum level was assessed pre- operatively for all patients. In case of deficiency, the patient underwent in situ pinning unless performed before his/her presentation. Alongside, he/she received a vitamin D course until correction prior to the definitive surgery (Imhäuser osteotomy with osteochondroplasty) 6-12 weeks after. Thereafter, osteotomy healing and physis closure were monitored radiologically. Results show that all patients but one had vitamin D deficiency, with an average of 14.39 ng/mL, necessitating vitamin D therapy before proceeding to the definitive surgery. No correlation existed between vitamin D level and Southwick angle severity with a p-value of 0.85. A negative correlation existed between vitamin D level and bilaterality, but not statistically significant (p-value 0.192). Patients' osteotomy healing was uneventful, and physeal closure was achieved in all the cases that had in situ pinning. We conclude that the severity of Vitamin D deficiency could be linked to the bilateral development of SCFE but not the severity of slippage. Treatment of Vitamin D deficiency facilitates physeal closure.",

We conducted a study of the incidence, predisposing factors, and treatment of RTSA instability to risk stratify patient and identify the most reliable treatment methods. We retrospectively searched for RTSAs performed between 2008 and 2017 at our institution by one surgeon using the same technique. We identified post- operative dislocations or symptoms of instability. 103 patients underwent 103 RTSAs (97 primary, 6 revision). 6 patients had 5 dislocations (3 in primary RTSAs, 3 in revision RTSAs). Mean time from surgery to diagnosis was 32.6 days (range, 10-60 days). One dislocation occurred immediately after surgery, 0 after falls, 3 from low-energy mechanisms of injury, and 2 without known inciting events. All dislocations were treated in the operating room; no dislocation was successfully treated with simple closed reduction in the clinic. Although dislocation after RTSA is uncommon, the risk is higher for patients with higher BMI and for patients undergoing revision surgery. The highest risk of instability occurs in RTSAs done for severe proximal humerus fracture; where the anatomy of the shoulder is changed. In these cases, approximately one in four patients will have a recurrent dislocation. In patients with persistent instability or with risk factors for instability, consideration should be given for use of larger glenospheres and increasing the lateral offset at the time of RTSA. Besides, peri- glenoid release, the suitable tension of the soft tissues tend to be the key of the stability.",

Forty patients with a diagnosis of scaphoid nonunion who underwent unilateral pseudarthrosis surgery were included in this study. Notably, the scaphoid nonunion was unilateral, and the contralateral wrist was asymptomatic with normal function, per the physical and radiological examinations. Pronator quadratus vascularized pedicled muscle flap was used in 16 patients (group 1), and autologous bone graft was used in 24 patients (group 2). Patients were compared used Scapholunate angles, Natrass carpal height ratio and Mayo wrist score pre and postoperatively. Fifteen of the 16 (93.3%) patients in group 1 and 19 of the 24 (79.2%) patients in group 2 achieved bone union. Four of twelve patients in group 2 with avascular necrosis (AVN) and one of eight in group 1 with AVN were not able to achieve union. The group 2 (34%) had higher nonunion rate than group 1 (12%) in AVN patients. The scapholunat angle was significantly decreased and the Natress ratio was significantly increased postoperatively compared to the preoperative measurement in both group. There was no statistically significant difference in the postoperative measurement. The postoperative Mayo wrist score showed no statistically significant differences between both groups. The pronator quadratus vascularized pedicled muscle flap was superior to non-vascularized bone grafting in the treatment of scaphoid nonunion with AVN. However, management of the patients without avascular necrosis is not requiring the vascularized pedicled muscle flap technique.",

A significant correlation was found between the angle and length of the PCS with the values of VAS, AOFAS and FFI (p<0.05). We observed that PCSs with a slope of less than 30 degrees and shorter than 10 mm do not create a serious clinical picture. If there is severe pain and functional impairment in individuals with this characteristic spur, investigation of other possible causes of heel pain must be considered.",

Data on fracture type, epidemiology, trauma-mechanism, and treatment had been recorded by the treating physician. Patients had been sent an outcome questionnaire including EQ-VAS, EQ-5D, and the SMFA at the time of injury and 12 months after. A total of 12 199 cases with AO/OTA type C fracture were identified. AO/OTA type C1 fracture was most common, with 5400 cases, followed by AO type C2 with 4304 and AO/OTA type C3 with 2495. Cast treatment and surgical treatment with volar locking plate fixation were the most common treatments. Patient-reported outcome measures worsened significantly one year after the fracture, and 56% reported moderate problems with pain and discomfort one year after the fracture. Patients treated with a volar plate reported a significantly larger deterioration in EQ-5D outcome compared to patients treated with a cast. No treatment method was found to be superior. A good outcome after a type C fracture is possible, but many patients do not recover completely. Our findings indicate a relatively better self-reported outcome for patients treated with a cast, but as treatment was not randomized the clinical relevance is unclear.",

No complication occurred due to anesthesia. WALANT is a much simpler option and can be safely used in place of general anesthesia or regional blocks for fixation of fractures of the upper limb, with added advantages of no need for a tourniquet and better intraoperative assessment of fracture fixation.",

Titanium elastic nailing is a safe, reliable method of internal fixation for irreducible or unstable fractures of both bones of the forearm in children. Open reduction of fracture was associated with higher complications. Despite higher overall complications, we noted excellent functional results in most cases.",

    "abstract": "Although controversy surrounding the use of metal-on-metal (MoM) arthroplasty implants continues to exist, satisfactory clinical and radiological outcomes have been reported following Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (BHR) at long-term follow-up, leading to an Orthopaedic Data Evaluation Panel (ODEP) rating of 13A. The purpose of this study was to systematically review the literature to evaluate the functional outcomes, radiological outcomes and revision rates following BHR at a minimum of 10 years follow-up. Using the PRISMA guidelines, two independent reviewers performed a literature search using Pubmed, Embase and Scopus databases. Only studies reporting on outcomes of BHR with a minimum of 10 years’ follow-up were considered for inclusion. A total of 12 studies including 7132 hips (64.8% males), with mean follow-up of 11.5 years (10-15.3), met our inclusion criteria. Of included patients, 94.3% of patient underwent BHR for osteoarthritis at a mean age was 52.0 years (48-52). At final follow-up, 96% of patients reported being satisfied with their BHR, with mean Harris Hip Scores of 93.6 and Oxford Hip Scores of 16.5. Rates of radiological femoral neck narrowing of greater than 10% and non-progressive radiological loosening were reported as 2.0% and 3.8% respectively. At final follow-up, the overall revision rate was 4.9% (334/7132), deep infection rate was 0.4%, metal allergy/insensitivity rate was 1.6%, metal reaction rate was 0.3%, rate of peri-prosthetic fracture was 0.9% and aseptic loosening rates were 1.6%. This systematic review demonstrates that BHR results in satisfactory clinical outcomes, acceptable implant survivorship, low complication rates and modest surgical revision rates in the long-term at minimum 10-year follow-up.",

The diagnosis of unilateral C1-C2 osteoarthritis was confirmed by an open-mouth radiograph, a bone-scan, a computerised tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging. C1-C2 fusion was performed using a computer assisted navigation system and posterior instrumentation. This resulted in marked relief of pain, and distinct improvement in quality of life. The prevalence of atlantoaxial osteoarthritis is about four per cent in patients suffering from peripheral or spinal osteoarthritis. However, many primary-care providers are not familiar with this entity. C1-C2 fusion remains rare, due to the difficulties related to the diagnosis of atlantoaxial osteoarthritis, its established non-operative treatment options, and the fact that it has not received adequate attention in the orthopaedic literature. However, based on review of the literature, it can be stated that C1-C2 fusion is an effective and safe procedure providing distinct reduction of pain and increased quality of life in case of failure of conservative treatment.",

All patients had their fractures stabilised within 6 hours from admission by means of external fixation. After a follow-up of 11 months (range 4-20), 28 fractures had healed within 6 months (range 4.5-8) and 13 developed non-union which was treated successfully with secondary intramedullary nailing. One patient developed deep infection following secondary nailing and another patient died from adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We conclude that external fixation of severe femoral fractures in critically ill patients is an easy and quick method of stabilisation which does not compromise their condition. If however it is intended to be used as a final method, these patients require a close follow-up since the rate of delayed and non-union is high.",

Of the 131 allografts stored in our bone bank, only 20 were discarded. Postoperative follow-up showed good ingrowth of the grafts except for one graft failure. There were no superficial or deep postoperative infections. All cultures taken during implantation remained negative. These data suggest that bone banking in a community hospital is a safe and practical alternative to address the ongoing demand of bone grafts in a small orthopaedic practice. Financial costs are reasonable. In our experience, bone banking also broadens the spectrum of orthopaedic operations that can be performed in an orthopaedic unit.",

The sensitivity and specificity, and potential learning effects were measured. Effects of the colours and rank number of the images were analysed. The sensitivity was 71% and the specificity 85%. The repeatability was 0.5267 and the reliability was 0.4967. No significant relation was found between the rank number and the rating. There was a significant correlation between the colour pallet and the rating (r = 0.76). Although the colour pallet used partly explained the variance in the rating scores, this study shows that observer assessment of thermographic images may distinguish between CRPS1 patients and healthy controls.

Clinically, a right hemihyperplasia affecting the trunk and lower limb was evident, as well as a right convex lumbar scoliosis. CT and MRI demonstrated severe spinal cord compression resulting from intraspinal lipomatosis, overgrowth of right facet joints (T8 to L5), and kyphoscoliosis. Surgical decompression was undertaken. A lumbar scoliosis of 48 degrees was partially corrected by means of dual-rod instrumentation. The neurological deficit improved significantly, and ambulation was progressively restored. The patient carried the diagnosis of Proteus syndrome for several years, but reevaluation of clinical features prompted the diagnosis of Hemihyperplasia Multiple Lipomatosis syndrome (HHML). This rare sporadic disorder is often confused with Proteus syndrome. As in Proteus syndrome, spinal cord compression in patients with HHML can result from lipomatous infiltration and/or significant spinal abnormalities including kyphoscoliosis and overgrowth. HHML and Proteus syndrome are discussed and compared with special emphasis on spinal and orthopaedic pathologies.",

The microbiology of spine infection resulting from direct spread is not well documented but the few cases reported suggest a wide range of causative organisms. For this reason in cases of spinal infection resulting from epidural catheterisation every effort should be made to obtain a direct tissue sample for pathogen identification and one should not simply rely on blood cultures or nonspecific empirical antimicrobials.

Average follow-up was 38 months (range, 12 to 47 months). All fractures united with anatomical alignment within an average of 8 weeks (range 6 to 12 weeks). There were no deep infections and no significant limb length discrepancies. At the latest follow-up, no patient had any restriction of activities.

Bicipital tendonitis occurred in five cases and secondary displacement of the fragments in four others. The small diameter of the pins used in the mini external fixator has the advantage of allowing the orthopaedic surgeon to fix the fracture in more than one plane and achieve an early acceptable range of motion.

The early clinical and radiographic results of 85 consecutive PAOs performed in this academic orthopaedic unit were reviewed. The mean Merle-d'Aubigné score increased from 12.4 preoperatively to 16 at follow-up. Pre-operatively 73 hips were anteverted and 12 were neutral or retroverted. The mean angle of Wiberg improved from 5 degrees to 21 degrees (p < 0.0001) in anteverted hips, and from 9 degrees to 30 degrees in neutral or retroverted hips. The mean angle of Lequesne and de Sèze improved from 6 degrees to 35 degrees (p < 0.0001) in anteverted hips, and in neutral or retroverted hips from 9 degrees to 30 degrees (p < 0.0001). The acetabular index improved from 26 degrees to 8 degrees (p < 0.0001) in anteverted hips, and from 21 degrees to 7 degrees (p < 0.0001) in neutral or retroverted hips. Over the 7 year period the blood loss and operative time improved from 2000 ml to 900 ml and 4 hours to 2 hours respectively. Four hips (four patients) required conversion to total hip replacement. The radiographic correction and improved clinical scores are similar to those in previous studies. This study shows a survival rate of 94% at 58 months following periacetabular osteotomy. The learning curve and the early results of this procedure performed in our academic unit are encouraging.",

This study aims to explore what events orthopaedic surgeons consider to have the highest emotional impact as well as support, coping strategies and mental health. A questionnaire was emailed to all members of the Dutch Society of Orthopaedic Surgeons which included resident, attending, non-practicing and retired orthopaedic surgeons. The questionnaire in- cluded questions about demographics, personal experiences and subsequent support and coping. Also the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Trauma Screening Questionnaire were included, which are validated screening instruments for anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), respectively. A total of 292 questionnaires were eligible for analysis. Most common events considered a high emotional impact stressor were : missing a diagnosis (59.2%), when a patient becomes severely handicapped (36.6%) or doubting whether one is making the right decision (36.6%). The prevalence of depression was higher compared to the general population with a high income in the Netherland (4.8 vs. 3.0 %,) and for anxiety as well (8.3 vs. 6.0%). Fifty-seven (19.5%) participants expe- rienced an adverse event as traumatic. Prevalence of PTSD was 0.3% among the whole sample. Most common coping strategies after adverse events were support from colleagues (80.7%), support from friends and family (59.3%) or doing sports (26.6%). Orthopaedic surgeons are exposed to many adverse events over the course of their career, which may have a high emotional impact. The prevalence rate found for depression and anxiety were both higher compared to the general population, while the rate for PTSD was lower. Still, more awareness must be created for the mental health of physicians as well as the implementation of a well-organized support system.",

However, the choice for a spinal fusion has to be weighed against the risks of major surgery in this vulnerable population. Paediatricians are frequently consulted preoperatively to assess the (respiratory) risk involved, but data on this question specific for CP are rare. Therefore, we investigated the complication rate after scoliosis surgery in children with CP, compared to idiopathic scoliosis (IS), and we searched for risk factors for the most common complications. In a retrospective monocenter study we analyzed the medical records from all children with CP and IS undergoing scoliosis surgery from 2010 until 2014. Duration of hospitalization and postoperative complications were compared within a 6-month follow-up. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify risk factors. The study included 44 patients with CP (mean age 15y0mo) and 78 patients with IS (mean age 14y6mo). Children with CP experience a higher rate of complications : respiratory and cardiovascular, as well as wound infections and decubitus ulcers (p&lt;0.05). Postoperative pneumonia was the most frequent complication in both patient groups (43% and 18% in CP and IS respectively), with epilepsy being a significant risk factor (OR 3.85, p= 0.037) in children with CP. Intensive care unit and total hospital stay were longer in the CP group (p&lt;0.001). These results may add information on perioperative care and surgical decision making.",

A retrospective single center study including all children with the diagnosis of transient synovitis of the hip between 2013 and 2018 was performed. 242 patients with the diagnosis of one or more transient synovitis episodes were included, 102 of whom underwent a follow up X-ray. Persistence or recurrence of symptoms were recorded for all patients, as well as the results of follow-up hip X-rays. 12 children did not remain symptom-free after the episode of transient synovitis. Of these patients 10 had a normal follow-up X-ray and 3 were diagnosed with Perthes disease. 1 patient of those 3 had a normal X-ray but was diagnosed with Perthes disease on MRI. Of the children which remained symptom-free after the episode of transient synovitis, none were diagnosed with Perthes disease afterwards. A follow-up X-ray to exclude Perthes disease after a diagnosis of transient hip synovitis appears to be necessary only in patients with persistent or recurrent symptomatology.",

The objective of this study was to analyze the clinical and radiological outcomes at a 2-year minimum follow-up. In this retrospective study, patients operated between 2009 and 2016 with Dynesys® stabilization were included. 5 different etiologies were included: disc herniation, lumbar stenosis, revision for adjacent seg- ment disease (ASD), spondylolisthesis, and scoliosis. Clinical and radiological evaluations were performed. Postoperative complications and revisions were recorded. 136 patients were included: 34 for lumbar spinal stenosis, 19 for disc herniation, 29 degenerative spon- dylolisthesis, 41 revisions for ASD, and 13 scoliosis. Mean age was 64.8. Average clinical follow-up was 46 months. Postoperative clinical results showed a mean lumbar VAS of 3.07, a mean radicular VAS of 3.01 and an ODI score of 31.8%. The ASD rate was 16.2%, and overall revision rate was 11.8%. 2 cases (1.5%) of screw loosening were identified. Clinical outcomes, ASD rate and revision rate were more favorable in the spondylolisthesis and disc herniation groups. This study has one of the largest Dynesys® cohort in literature. Spinal dynamic stabilization by Dynesys® presents good long-term clinical and radiological out- comes with a lower rate of complications than pre- viously published cohorts and lumbar fusions.

The aim of this review is to update the evidence base for the efficacy of arthroscopy in knee osteoarthritis. The authors searched CINHAL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and CENTRAL for randomised controlled trials that compared arthroscopic surgery in knee osteoarthritis with a control group (e.g. lavage, best medical care). The primary outcome measure was patient reported functional outcome. The study methodology was registered on Prospero, a systematic review register: Registration number CRD42012002891. Five randomised controlled trials included 516 patients, almost double the 271 episodes contained in previous reviews. Two high quality studies, according to the Jadad classification, published since the Cochrane review, addressed many of the methodological flaws criticised in previous reviews. However, certain subgroup analyses (e.g. patients with meniscal tears and mechanical symptoms) are still underpowered.",

    "abstract": "Cervical alignment or lordosis evolution is still attained by direct radiography in standing position because an ideal cervical curvature is essential to maintain a horizontal gaze with minimal energy consumption. However, upright cervical lordosis changes in supine position. Anterior fusion surgery and more sophisticated radiological examinations, such as Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), are performed in lying position. Therefore, if upright cervical alignment can be simulated in the supine position, true (upright) cervical lordosis can be demonstrated on CT and MRI and also a more proper anterior cervical fusion can be performed in operation with better surgical outcomes. Forty-nine (49) adult patients underwent radiological examinations, including upright cervical radiography and three session of supine MRI in different positions. MRI was performed in (1) conventional neutral supine position, (2) supine position with a 5-cm-high pillow, and (3) supine position with a 10-cm-high pillow under the shoulders. MRI results were analyzed. Wilcoxon, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and Spearman correlation tests were used to analyze MRI the validity in compared with those of cervical radiography. Cervical lordosis (C2-C7 Cobb angle) of the radiography group was similar to that of supine MRI group using a 5-cm-high pillow, and they have a strong correlation. The T-1 slope from radiography group was similar to and correlated with that of supine MRI groups with both pillows. Cranial tilt measurements of radiography group were different but correlated with the MRI group using a 5-cm-high pillow. Simulating upright cervical lordosis in the supine position is possible by adding a 5-cm- high pillow under the shoulders of the patients. This simulation reduces the need for direct radiography. Anterior cervical fusion surgery performed in this position can provide better surgical results.",

There are studies reporting excellent short-term results, however long- term data is lacking. There is also a paucity of studies comparing the most frequently utilised augments, metaphyseal sleeves, and cones. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate and compare the mid to long term outcomes of metaphyseal cones and sleeves. We conducted systematic search of 4 databases (Medline, Embase, CINALH and PubMed). Seventeen studies were found to be eligible for inclusion of which ten investigated metaphyseal sleeves and the remaining seven investigated cones. Mean follow up across all studies was 6.2 years. The total number of patients included in the studies was 1319 and the number of knees operated on was 1431. We noted a higher revision rate of metaphyseal cones when compared to sleeves 10.85% vs 6.31 (p=0.007). Reoperation rates were also higher in cones compared to sleeves, 13.78% vs 3.68% (p&lt;0.001). Prosthetic joint infection was the most common reason for revision. The difference in conversion rates, based on augment location was statistically significant p=0.019. When undertaking further sub-analysis; there was no statistically significant difference when comparing revision rates of; tibial vs femoral augments p=0.108, tibial vs tibial &amp; femur p=0.54 but a difference was seen between femoral vs tibial &amp; femoral augments p=0.007. Based on our data, metaphyseal sleeves demonstrate significantly lower revision rates compared to metaphyseal cones. However overall, both demonstrate reliable mid to long-term outcomes.",

Following this audit, patients undergoing primary TKA were no longer routinely cross matched, a Haemovigilance Nurse was employed in compliance with the National Blood Users Group guidelines, and post-operative cell salvage was introduced for patients with a preoperative haemoglobin level of less than 12 g/dl. A prospective audit was then performed over a nine month period, from 1st January to 30th September 2003, to assess the impact of these changes on our transfusion practice. Data was collected on 233 patients who had primary TKA performed during the period of our prospective audit. Patients were transfused if their blood loss exceeded a pre-calculated maximal allowable loss, or based on a 48 hour post-operative haemoglobin level. Seventeen of the 233 patients (7 %) received allogeneic blood. The average amount received was two units. Pre-operative anaemia and advanced patient age were predictive for increased risk of transfusion. Thirty six per cent of patients who were given a cell saver did not collect sufficient blood for re-transfusion. Ten per cent required further transfusion with allogeneic blood. There was no statistically significant difference in either the percentage of patients transfused or the volume of blood given to each patient between the two periods of audit. We did not find post-operative cell salvage to be an effective method of reducing allogeneic blood use.",

We had no major complications. We only found minor sensory and pain complications. We were able to procure large amounts of cancellous bone graft through this method. This method of cancellous grafting reduces the rate of major complications, but there is no difference in the occurrence of postoperative pain as compared with standard techniques. The minor sensory complications are comparable with other methods of iliac spine harvesting.

We report a case of femoral neck fracture following revision arthroplasty of the ipsilateral knee. Contributing factors may have been the patient's osteoporosis and a period of immobilisation before the revision arthroplasty. The patient was treated successfully with hemiarthroplasty of the hip. In patients who have undergone total knee arthroplasty, complaints of groin pain that radiates to the involved knee should alert to the possibility of a stress fracture of the femoral neck.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate if force- and weight-bearing asymmetry correlate with patient-reported outcomes (PROMs). Twenty patients were prospectively analysed up to 6 months after TKA. Quadriceps- and hamstring force were measured using a hand-held dynamometer. Vertical ground reaction forces during sit-to-stand, stair descending and squatting were assessed by force plates. Patients were asked to complete the KOOS, OKS and 2011 KSS. The symmetry-ratios during sit-to-stand, squat and stair-descent improved significantly. Preopera-tive quadriceps-force was positively correlated with KOOS-Symptoms (r=0.583, p=0.037). The pre-operative load-symmetry ratio during STS was negatively correlated with improvement in KOOS Pain (r=-0.675, p=0.011) and Symptoms (r=-0.674, p=0.008). In deep flexion, preoperative bodyweight ratio was positively correlated with postoperative OKS (r=0.601, p=0.039), KSS-Satisfaction (r=0.675, p=0.011) and improvement in KSS-Satisfaction (r=0.684, p=0.029). Weight bearing and force asymmetry do exist before TKA and take up to at least 6-months to fully recover. The more symmetry in muscle-force and weight-bearing is found preoperatively, the better the PROMs will be at 6 months after surgery.",

Within a six-week interval in the summer of 2009, twin brothers, both elite track and field athletes, presented to us with medial foot pain. Plain radiographs were negative but a radioisotope bone scan and CT scan revealed an incomplete navicular fracture in both of them. The fracture was typically located in the proximal dorsal cortex of the central portion of the navicular bone. The presence of such a stress fracture in high performing, monozygotic twins, has never been described. As extrinsic and intrinsic risk factors, their comparability of mechanical stresses and kinematics as well as a genetic predisposition can be put forward. This case report suggests that a complex interaction between mechanical and genetic risk factors exists in the development of navicular stress fractures.",

Thirty children with non-operatively managed unilateral fractures of the shaft of the femur were studied. The mean age was 6.5 years (range: 1.2 to 12). Axial, angular and rotational malunion were assessed clinically and radiologically by plain films and computed tomography (CT). All children had shortening of the fractured limb with a mean shortening of 1.8 cm (range: 0.5 to 3.5). A significant level of shortening was seen in children over 7 years. In the sagittal plane, all had anterior angulation ranging from 4 degrees to 31 degrees (mean: 17.8 degrees) and in the coronal plane, lateral angulation (varus) was seen in 90% (27 patients) with a mean angle of 8.9 degrees. Rotational malunion ranged from -43 degrees to +43 degrees (mean: 9.5 degrees), 30% had rotational malunion of > 20 degrees compared to the uninjured side; 73% had internal rotation malunion and 27% had external rotation malunion. We conclude that non-operative management of fractures of the shaft of the femur in children often results in malunion at the fracture, particularly in the older age group and in comminuted fractures. Perhaps a longer follow-up might have shown lower levels of malunion. Frequent monitoring of fracture position may reduce the occurrence of deformity.

    "abstract": "Open tibia fracture (OTF) treatment is well documented in developed countries. Yet, this fracture pattern remains challenging because it is associated with an increased risk of infection and delayed union, particularly in case of Gustilo III B and C open fractures. Since access to healthcare is limited in Sub- Saharan African countries, this paper explores the results of OTF management in this setting. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using current databases such as MEDLINE, Cochrane, EMBASE, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar in order to identify prospective studies with cohorts of patients treated for OTF. Studies were included based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The quality of studies was analyzed by the Coleman Methodology Score (CMS). Eight papers met the inclusion criteria and had an average CMS of 70 (range 54-73). The most common treatment was non-operative management of the fracture with cast immobilization (67%). Gustilo Type II and III fractures were associated with a higher risk of complications. The infection rate was 30%. Malunion, chronic osteomyelitis and nonunion were observed in 14.5%, 12.3%, and 7% of the cases, respectively. More complications were observed with non-operative treatment (cast immobilization) than with surgical fixation. Although the surgical environment does not allow for internal fixation, poor results of non-operative management of open fractures should lead to the introduction of trainings on the proper use of external fixators. It is also advisable to support the development of locally produced external devices that utilize local source materials, which would make external fixation available at a reasonable cost.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the clinical and radiological results of a tapered femoral stem (Corail®) and uncemented threaded acetabular cups (Tropic®) and in addition an analysis of the complications and retrieved implants was conducted. Between January 1990 and September 1998, 301 total hips arthroplasties in 268 patients were implanted. 78 patients (87 hips) had died and 9 patients (12 hips) had been lost to follow-up, leaving at the time of the latest follow-up 180 patients (202 hips). The mean age at surgery was 56,1 (27-75) years. Of the 154 unrevised hips, the median Harris and Merle d´Aubigne and Postel hip scores were 83,3 points and 15,3 points respectively at the latest follow-up. The median follow-up time was 16.9 years (10,4-25). No femoral component was revised for aseptic loosening ; osteolysis was observed in the 9,5% of the implants (13 stems). 48 hips (23%) were revised and 27 cups (56,2%) needed revision surgery because of massive polyethylene wear. Pelvic osteolysis was found out in 80 cups (58,8%). 87 hips (63,9%) showed signs of a progressive wear of the liner, more than 2mm in 48 hips. Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis at 15 years follow-up was 81.2% with revision for any reason (85.8% for mechanical or radiographic loosening). High rates of polyethylene wear and the high prevalence of pelvic osteolysis are serious matters in these types of implants with high rates of revision at 15 years follow-up so we decided to abandon the concept of a threaded cup design in favor of a press-fit acetabular cup.",

In 31 consecutively enrolled patients with primary gonarthrosis, 33 customized TKA (custTKA) and in 31 patients, a conventional TKA (convTKA) was implanted. Perioperative and postoperative management were identical. Radio- graphic evaluation, ROM, KSS (Knee society score) and WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) were performed and patients satisfaction was evaluated after 3 and 12 months. Groups were comparable for age, sex, body mass index and extension/flexion. After 92 days average flexion in the convTKA group was significantly higher (119 vs. 113 degrees; unpaired t-test). At 375 days, mean flexion in both groups was 120 degrees. There was a significant higher number of outliers of neutral mechanical axis for convTKA patients (11 vs. 3; Chi-squared test). After 92 days there was no difference for KSS (convTKA: 160, custTKA: 167) but significant better results for WOMAC (19 vs. 40) in the custTKA group (unpaired t-test, p= 0.02). In addition, significantly better KSS (181 vs. 156) and WOMAC (99 vs. 42) were found for the custTKA group at 375 days (unpaired t-test, p= 0.002 and 0.001). Patients with the custTKA implant reported significant higher fulfillment of their ex- pectations regarding function and knee strength. In the present study, the patients with a custTKA implant showed significantly superior short-term clinical results and fulfillment of their expectations regarding knee function.",

This article provides a comprehensive, up-to-date literature review on the assessment of complex limb injuries, and the variables that affect decision-making and outcomes in both limb salvage and amputation. Initial assessment involves using a systematic approach, saving life before limb, with early involvement of the relevant surgical specialities and multidisciplinary team. The decision to attempt limb salvage or perform amputation can be extremely difficult. Scoring systems can be used as a guide but should not be wholly relied upon; instead more emphasis should be placed on the surgeon’s experience, extent of soft tissue damage, and patient factors and wishes. Outcomes following amputation versus limb salvage are comparable, with some studies suggesting amputation may be favourable. It is important to advise patients and families on what treatment is in their best interest so they can make an informed decision, and this must utilise a multidisciplinary approach.",

This effect has not been previously studied for 90-day mortality or in the United Kingdom (UK). Our aim was to investigate the effect of LOS on 30-day and 90-day mortality following hip fracture in a UK population. In this single-centre study, we retrospectively identified consecutive patients with a hip fracture from the National Hip Fracture Database over 3 years. We excluded patients who died as inpatient during their index admission. The main end-points were 30-day and 90-day mortalities and risk factors for these were examined using stepwise univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Of 1228 patients, mortality at 30-days was 1.2% (15 patients) and 7.8% (96 patients) at 90-days. Mean LOS was 24 days and a total of 206 patients had a LOS of 10 days or less. Following cariate analysis, the highest risk factor for 30-day mortality was a LOS of 10 days or less with a hazard ratio of 7.26 (95% confidence interval 2.56-20.51). Other risk factors for 30-day mortality included increasing age, male gender and chest infection. A LOS of 10 days or less was not associated with increased mortality at 90-days. A short LOS was associated with higher risk of early mortality. We recommend that hip fracture patients be fully rehabilitated prior to discharge to reduce the risk of early mortality.",

None of operative methods were superior to others. Excellent treatment outcomes were achieved more often in younger patients (p=0.004), and the median duration of symptoms in operatively treated patients was shorter (p=0.018). If operative treatment is used after unsuccessful conservative treatment, it should be considered early in adolescence and also within a relatively short period after the onset of symptoms. The best operative method could not be found. More research and RCTs are needed concerning the conservative methods and different operative techniques.",

However, there is no consensus on optimal pinning configuration in the literature.

We performed a retrospective review on children that were treated with K-wire pinning for supracondylar fracture at our institution between August 2017 and August 2019. Intra-operative antero-posterior view fluoroscopic images were used to measure the pin separation ratio (PSR), pin crossing angle (PCA), medial inclination angle (MIA) and lateral inclination angle (LIA). Pearson Correlation was used to identify the relationship between the variables. Ninety-one patients were included for analysis (39 male: 52 female), with a mean age of 6. Average PCA in the crossed pin and lateral-entry only technique CA was 75° and 12°, respectively. Mean crossed pin and lateral-entry only technique PSR is 0.54 and 0.17, respectively. There was a significant difference in both mean PSR and PCA between the configurations (p &lt;0.01). In subgroup analysis, optimal PSR &gt; 0.33 and PCA &gt;90° were best achieved in crossed pinning using 1 medial and 2 lateral pins. Assessing the biomechanical characteristics of the different fixation techniques, we have found that 2 lateral divergent pins and 1 medial pin using the crossed pin technique optimized both the PSR and PCA. We would recommend this configuration to optimize the stability of the fixation construct.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Approximately 5 to 10% of all patients with fractures experience deficient fracture healing that results in fracture nonunions. Previous studies have shown that nitric oxide production from arginine could improve fracture healing by improving local blood supply, supplementing growth factors, and improving collagen synthesis. Apart from its simple oral mode of administration, this amino acid provides a non-toxic and inexpensive option for fracture healing. To date, no systematic reviews regarding oral L-arginine supplementation for fracture healing are available. We present the first systematic review of oral L-arginine supplementation for fracture healing. Methods: A systematic literature search was carried out using PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect until February 1, 2021 using a combination of text words. No date limits were set. Studies investigating the use of oral L-arginine supplementation for fracture healing were included. Reference lists of relevant publications were assessed for additional references. In addition, bibliographies from other reviews were searched. Results: Four studies were included. Of these, 3 were animal studies, and the other one was an in vitro study. Animals that were given oral L-arginine supplementation had significantly increased angiogenesis, reduced defect area, higher osteoblasts and osteoclasts, and higher rate of bone formation compared to controls. Conclusions: The available preclinical studies suggest that oral L-arginine supplementation is a potential new therapy for fracture healing. This amino acid supplement is not only affordable and non-toxic; it is also simple. Further clinical studies are required to investigate the optimal dose of oral L-arginine supplementation for fracture healing in human subjects.",

We report outcomes of implant survivorship based on design phi- losophy using data from NJR's 2020 annual report. All TKR implants with an identifiable design philosophy from NJR data were included. Cumulative revision data for cruciate-retaining(CR), posterior stabilised(PS), mobile-bearing(MB) design philosophies was derived from merged NJR data. Cumulative revision data for individual brands of implants with the medial pivot (MP) philosophy were used to calculate overall survivorship for this design philosophy. The all-cause revision was used as the endpoint and calculated to 15 years follow-up with Kaplan-Meier curves. 1,144,384 TKRs were included. CR is the most popular design philosophy (67.4%), followed by PS(23.1%), MB (6.9%) and least commonly MP (2.6%). MP and CR implants showed the best survivorship (95.7% and 95.6% respectively) at 15 years which is statistically significant at, and beyond, 10 years. Observed survivorship was lower at all time points with the PS and MB implants (94.5% for both designs at 15 years). While all design philosophies considered in this study survive well, CR and MP designs offer statistically superior survivorship at and beyond 10 years. MP design performs better than CR beyond 13 years yet, remain the least popular design philosophy used. Publishing data based on knee arthroplasty design phi- losophy would help surgeons when making decisions on implant choice.",

Its use has increased in recent years because public transportation is less preferred during the covid-19 pandemic and in parallel, the publications reporting e-scooter accidents are increasing. There is no article examining the relationship between e-scooter and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in current literature. We aim to examine the relationship between e-scooter accidents and ACL injury incidence. Patients over the age of 18 years who applied to our orthopedics outpatient clinic with the diagnosis of ACL injury between January 2019- June 2021 were evaluated. 80 e-scooter accidents resulting with ACL tears were reviewed. The electronic medical records of the patients were reviewed retrospectively. Information about the age, gender, trauma history of the patients, and type of trauma was obtained. Fifty-eight patients had a history of falling while stopping the scooter, and 22 patients had a history of falling after hitting something. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was performed with hamstring tendon grafts in 62(77,5%) of the patients included in the study. 18 (22,5%) patients were followed up with functional physical therapy exercises because they did not want to be operated on. Various bone or soft tissue injuries while using e-scooters have been reported in the literature until now. ACL injury is also seen quite frequently after these traumas, and necessary information and warnings should be given to the users to prevent ACL injuries.",

    "abstract": "Fracture Neck of Femur (FnF) is a major cause of loss of independence, morbidity and mortality in a vulnerable group of elderly patients; as well as a substantial economic burden on healthcare systems across the world. An increasingly ageing population has resulted in a rise in incidence and prevalence of FnF. Over 76,000 patients were admitted with FnF in the United Kingdom in 2018, with the resulting health and social costs estimated to be in excess of £2 billion. It is therefore important that the outcomes of all management options be evaluated to ensure constant improvement as well as allocation of resources as appropriate. It is widely agreed that patients presenting with displaced intracapsular FnF injuries are managed operatively; with options including internal fixation, hemiarthroplasty or Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA). The volume of THA performed for FnF has significantly increased in recent years. However, compliance with national guidelines on FnF patient selection for THA has been shown to be inconsistent. The aim of this study was to review current literature with regards to the use of THA in management of FnF patients. The literature describes managing FnF in ambulant and independent patients by THA with dual-mobility acetabular cup and cemented femoral component via the anterolateral approach. There is scope for further research in assessing the outcomes of different prosthetic femoral head sizes and choice of bearing surfaces (tribiology) used for THA as well as cementation of the acetabular cup component specifically in FnF patients.",

Proximal and distal CSAs of the median nerve and wrist skin thickness were measured ultrasonographically. Demographic and disease characteristics of the patients were recorded. Patients were evaluated with the Historical-Objective scale (Hi- Ob) for clinical staging, the Functional status scale (FSS) for functional status, and the Boston symptom severity scale (BSSS) for symptom severity. Ultrasonographic findings were correlated with demographic and disease characteristics, electrophysiological findings, Hi-Ob scala, Functional status scale (FSS), and Boston symptom severity scale (BSSS). Proximal median nerve CSA median was 11.0 (7.0-14.0) mm2, distal median nerve CSA median was 10.5 (5.0-18.0) mm2, and wrist skin thickness was measured 1.10 (0.6-1.40) mm. Median nerve CSAs were positively correlated with the CTS stage and FSS, negatively correlated with the sensory nerve action potential of the median nerve (SNAP) and the compound muscle action potential of the median nerve (CMAP) ( p<0.05). Wrist skin thickness was positively correlated with disease characteristics, including the presence of paresthesia and loss of dexterity and FSS and BSSS levels. Ultrasonographic measurements in CTS are associated with functionality rather than demographics. Especially the increase in wrist skin thickness leads to an increase in symptom severity.",

Data was gathered on study design, implant type, patient demographics, survivorship, clinical outcome scores and the indications for revision. Methodological quality was assessed using a ten-point risk of bias scoring tool. Eighteen studies were included in the final review. The mean follow-up of studies ranged between 2-11 years. The primary outcome of survival demonstrated 5 year survivorship ranged between 91.7-100.0% and 10-year survivorship between 91.0-97.5%. Clinical and functional outcome scores were found to be excellent in the majority of studies with the remaining reporting good results. Revisions represented 2.7% of the total operations performed. There were 145 revisions with an overall revision rate of 0.8 per 100 observed component years. Osteoarthritis disease progression (30.2%) and bearing dislocations (23.8%) were the most common causes of implant failure. This review finds uncemented UKAs demonstrate comparable survivorship, clinical outcomes and safety profile to cemented UKAs to consider this fixation a suitable alternative in clinical use.",

    "abstract": "The posterolateral tibial plateau fracture is an uncommon intra-articular injury and mostly needed surgery. However, its surgical approach remains controversial. This manuscript describes an anterolateral approach to treat posterolateral tibial plateau fractures and evaluates the patient's functional outcomes. From June 2018 to July 2021 seventeen patients with posterolateral tibial plateau fractures were surgically treated through an anterolateral approach. The intraoperative and postoperative follow-up indicators were recorded. The reduction quality of fractures was assessed using Rasmussen radiological score, and postsurgical functional recovery was estimated using Rasmussen clinical score and Lysholm score. The mean follow-up interval was 28.71 ± 9.61 months (range 18-44). The surgery time and blood loss were 111.06 ± 15.62 min (range 85-140) and 118.12 ± 38.45 mL (range 80-250) separately. Postoperatively, the Rasmussen radiological score was 16.24 ± 2.33 (range 12-18). The average time of bone union was 14.29 ± 1.53 weeks (range 12-18). At the final follow-up, the average PTS and MPTA were 9.71 ± 2.76° (range 5-14°) and 86.82 ± 2.04° (range 84-90°) separately. A satisfactory articular reduction was achieved in 16 patients (94.1%). The final ROM was 123.29 ± 19.70° (range 60-142°). The Rasmussen clinical score and Lysholm score were 25.71 ± 5.74 (range 10-30) and 91.47 ± 6.50 (range 75-98) separately. Anterolateral approach has minimal risk of intraoperative neurovascular injuries in the popliteal fossa with satisfactory results. The hardware removal was also facilitated. This approach is feasible, safe and efficient.",

    "abstract": "Despite a fast-growing evidence-base examining the relationship of certain clinical and radiological factors such as smoking, BMI and herniation-type with rLDH, there remains much debate around which factors are clinically important. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify risk factors for recurrent lumbar disc herniation (rLDH) in adults after primary discectomy. A systematic literature search was carried out using Ovid-Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane library and Web of Science databases from inception to 23rd June-2022. Observational studies of adult patients with radiologically-confirmed rLDH after ≥3 months of the initial surgery were included, and their quality assessed using the Quality-In-Prognostic-Studies (QUIPS) appraisal tool. Meta-analyses of univariate and multivariate data and a sensitivity-analysis for rLDH post-microdiscectomy were performed. Twelve studies (n=4497, mean age:47.3; 34.5% female) were included, and 11 studies (n=4235) meta-analysed. The mean follow-up was 38.4 months. Mean recurrence rate was 13.1% and mean time-to-recurrence was 24.1 months (range: 6-90 months). Clinically, older age (OR:1.04, 95%CI:1.00-1.08, n=1014), diabetes mellitus (OR:3.82, 95%CI:1.58-9.26, n=2330) and smoking (OR:1.80, 95%CI:1.03- 3.14, n=3425) increased likelihood of recurrence. Radiologically, Modic-change type-2 (OR:7.93, 95%CI:5.70-11.05, n=1706) and disc extrusion (OR:12.23, 95%CI:8.60-17.38, n=1706) increased likelihood of recurrence. The evidence did not support an association between rLDH and sex; BMI; occupational labour/driving; alcohol-consumption; Pfirmann- grade, or herniation-level. Older patients, smokers, patients with diabetes, those with type-2 Modic-changes or disc extrusion are more likely to experience rLDH. Higher quality studies with robust adjustment of confounders are required to determine the clinical bearing of all other potential risk factors for rLDH.",

The methodological quality of each was assessed in- dependently. Meta-analysis was performed for comparative trials. From the 5 included studies (2 RCTs, 3 CCTs), 208 cases were divided into TMA group (n = 107) and LRTI group (n =101) groups. Compared with the TMA group, PRWHE, tip pinch strength and palmar abduction was better in the LRTI group. There was no statistical difference in DASH score, VAS, kapandji score, grip strength, key pinch strength, total IP joint motion, total MCP joint motion and complications. The LRTI group had more obvious advantages in term of PRWHE, tip pinch strength and palmar abduction. Moreover, there was no statistical difference in DASH score, VAS, kapandji score, grip strength, key pinch strength, total IP joint and total MCP joint motion and complications. Therefore, we concluded LRTI was more recommendable for more management of TMC osteoarthritis. Certainly, high-quality studies are required in long-term follow-up.",

Lengthening with an intramedullary device would be expected to retain good knee movements since it avoids soft tissue transfixation. To ascertain this we looked at the knee movements recorded in 27 patients before, during and after bilateral simultaneous femoral lengthening using Albizzia nails. The mean gain was 6.2 cm and the mean follow-up 28.6 months. No significant difference was noted between the mean preoperative and final knee flexions (148.3 degrees vs. 148.4 degrees) and the mean preoperative and final knee extensions (2.3 degrees vs. 3.4 degrees). By their last visit, all patients were flexing to at least 120 degrees and only one patient had a flexion deformity over 5 degrees. Thus maintenance of good knee motion and early return to activities is possible when an intramedullary device like the Albizzia nail is used for femoral lengthening.",

Twenty-two consecutive patients received either the Donor retransfusion system (n=12 patients) or the Bellovac ABT retransfusion system (n=10). Both systems differ with respect to the type of filter, a Pall Lipiguard filter and a Sangopur filter, respectively. At the beginning of the retransfusion, blood samples were taken before and after the filter. The filter of the Donor system significantly decreased the amount of leukocytes and erythrocytes, whereas the filter of the Bellovac system did not. As a result the haemoglobin level of retransfused blood with the Donor system was significantly lower than with the Bellovac system. It can be concluded that the type of filter integrated in two postoperative autologous blood retransfusion systems significantly affected the amount of blood cells retransfused in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.",

The tissue response, dominated by macrophages, with production of inflammatory mediators and matrix-degrading enzymes, triggers a self-accelerating cycle of osteolysis, ultimately resulting in failure of the arthroplasty, high treatment cost and poor patient outcome. Vitamin D is frequently used as a treatment for osteoporosis, but might also contribute to osteolysis in inflammatory joints. Here, we review the effects of extrarenal vitamin D3 activation by macrophages in the joint space. The summarized pathways contribute to increased bone resorption in the setting of the inflammatory micro-environment at the bone-prosthesis interface. If further evidence confirms a role of oral vitamin D3 as a risk factor for aseptic loosening, this might influence the current treatment strategies for patients at risk for this condition.",

The mean stay duration was 412.15 days in the study group as opposed to 187.2 days in the control group. Nearly 45% had developed pressure sores in the study group as compared to 25% in the control group.

Patients who had been surgically treated for patellar instability filled out the NPI and BPII together with the Kujala Knee Score, numeric rating scales, Knee disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and SF-36.  We assessed internal consistency and construct validity. We evaluated the presence of ceiling and floor effects. Results Ninety-seven patients completed the online questionnaires. The internal consistency of the NPI and BPII score was excellent for both outcome measures. The BPII and NPI had good correlations with other PROMs. For the BPII we found no floor nor ceiling effect. For the NPI we found a floor effect but no ceiling effect. Conclusion Our results indicate that the Dutch version of the BPII and the NPI can be used for patients with patellar instability. Both PROMs have specific (dis)advantages.",

    "abstract": "Reduced impact loading or anti-gravity training has recently been introduced as a new tool in the rehabilitation of orthopaedic conditions that require restricted weight bearing. The purpose of this strategy is to speed up the functional rehabilitation while at the same time protect the healing structures from harmful effects associated with impact loading. Anti- gravity treadmills (AlterG ® ) and harness suspension devices seem to be the two most promising techniques. It is however today unclear how effective these devices are. The purpose of our study was therefore to perform a systematic literature review on the actual technology available and its effect on impact load reduction, as well as its effectiveness in accelerating functional recovery after meniscal and chondral injury to the knee. The results from our work demonstrate that only a limited number of studies are available, usually of moderate quality. The data suggest a variable effect on cartilage regeneration, and a potential for accelerated functional recovery in gait and running dynamics both with anti-gravity treadmill as well as suspension harness systems.",

    "abstract": "To investigate pain in patients with Dupuytren disease, we analyzed the literature on pre- and post-interventional pain and complex regional pain syndrome. The pre-interventional pain intensity score of primary Dupuytren ranged from 0.3/10 to 2.0/10. One year after surgery or needle fasciotomy, no significant change of pain could be found. Collagenase therapy significantly reduced the mean pain intensity score from 1.3/10 [SD 2.2] to 0.5/10 [1.5] (p<0.01) after one year. The prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome after fasciectomy ranged from 0% to 12.8%, after needle fasciotomy from 0% to 6.3%, and after collagenase therapy from 0% to 3.0%. We conclude that for most Dupuytren patients, pain is not an issue. A minority seems to suffer pain and collagenase treatment appears to reduce this complaint significantly. However, complex regional pain syndrome is a known complication of Dupuytren treatment, with a low incidence after minimal invasive treatment.",

Abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) of 265 adolescents (9-19 years old) who were admitted to the emergency department between 2011 and 2016 were evaluated retrospectively. Radial reformatted CT images from the femoral neck were created using the multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) method. The femoral neck was divided into 12 segments and alpha angle (AA), femoral head-neck ratio (FHNR) and center-edge angle (CEA) were measured from each segment. Additionally, images were evaluated for the physiological status (open or closed) of the triradiate- cartilage and proximal femoral epiphyses. 204 hips from 102 patients (32 females, 70 males) were retrospectively reviewed. There were 27 (26.5%) patients with cam-type morphology and 18 (17.6%) patients with pincer-type morphologies. No statistically significant difference was detected between the prevalences of cam and pincer morphologies between the two genders. Cam deformity was most frequently seen in anterosuperior segment. All of the patients (100%) with pincer-type morphology and 88% of the patients with cam-type morphology had closed triradiate cartilage, 89% of the patients with cam morphology and 83% with pincer morphology had open proximal femoral physis. Our results showed that prevalence of cam and pincer-type morphology in asymptomatic adolescents is similar to asymptomatic adults. Our findings also indicate that cam- and pincer-type FAI morphologies likely develop during late adolescence after closure of triradiate cartilage and before closure of proximal femoral physis.

We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Database to identify all articles published between 2000 and July 2020 that evaluated the outcome of patients undergoing BTKA either in simultaneous or staged manner. Ten articles were identified which met the inclusion criteria. Functional outcome was reported in terms of Knee Society score (KSS), range of motion (ROM), Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and Western Ontario and McMaster University score (WOMAC) in seven, five, four and two studies respectively. KSS gained on average 66.6 points (47.5-95.3) for simBTKA and 65.1 points (44.4-97.2) for staBTKA without significant difference between two groups. There was no difference in post-operative ROM (maximum post-operative flexion being 124.4 and 125.1 for simBTKA and staBTKA groups respectively). Mean improvement in OKS ranged from 20 to 32.6 for simBTKA and 21.6 to 33.1 for staBTKA.

It is not known if a high HSA in early childhood leads to a high HSA in adulthood. This study aims to characterize the evolution of HSA and compares it with the more commonly known NSA in healthy children. We measured radiographs of 84 different healthy hips of children between 3 and 14.5 years old who underwent at least 2 radiographs of the pelvis, corresponding to 286 measurements. We used a linear mixed model to determine the covariance between random intercept and slope while allowing each individual hip to change over time. The covariance for HSA between random intercept and random slope was -4.262 (p &lt; 0.001), corresponding to a high negative correlation of -0.717, for NSA -2.754 (p = 0.031) or a high negative correlation of -0.779. HSA and NSA were strongly correlated, a value of 0.736 (p &lt; 0.001) was measured. The high negative correlation for random intercept and random slope means that the higher the initial value (intercept), the steeper the decline (slope). Therefore HSA decreases faster in hips with high HSA at an early age. Hips with high HSA in early childhood do not necessarily lead to hips with high HSA in adulthood. Our results may aid in future clinical decision making in patients with developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) with high HSA in particular.",

The aim of this systematic review is to provide this equipoise with some clarity. We conducted this study following both the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Statement (PRISMA) and the Cochrane Handbook for systematic reviews and meta-analysis. Studies comparing the MP and PS knees from all regions and written in any language were included. Twenty- one studies were included in this meta-analysis. They were prepared and analysed using Review Manager V5.0 [Computer Program] (RevMan5). We calculated the risk ratio to measure the treatment effect, taking the heterogeneity of the studies into consideration. Random-effect models were also utilised. MP knees were found to have a significant advantage over PS knees in terms of WOMAC score at the midterm follow up, and insignificant advantages over PS knees in terms of ROM and FJS at one and two years follow- up. Additionally, the PS knees demonstrated an in significantly higher Knee Society Score (KSS) at short and midterm follow up. In terms of ROM, KSS, OKS and FJS this meta-analysis suggests a non-significant advantages for the MP knee compared with the PS prothesis in the short term. The MP implant also showed a significantly superior WOMAC score at short-term follow-up. An extended follow-up period is required to evaluate whether the MP knee is superior than the PS in the long-term.",

Sixty three patients with primary knee osteoarthritis (37 female, 26 male; average age: 67.0 years, average BMI 31.2) underwent primary cemented TKA with a PS high flex insert.

The radiographic evaluation showed no influence of the implant positioning on the final flexion. Compared to the results obtained in a 5 year follow-up study of 100 cases in combination with the PS standard insert, the improvement in final flexion range found in this study did not appear not to be great enough to generally recommend the PS high flex insert in terms of a proven higher flexion result.",

There is, however, evidence that swab cultures have limited sensitivity. We therefore prospectively compared two ways of screening femoral heads. Bacterial recovery from swabs in Amies transport medium taken intraoperatively, sub sequently transported to the microbiology laboratory and inoculated on agar and in broth was compared with the recovery from a bone fragment also taken intraoperatively but immediately inoculated into Wilkins Chalgren broth. Forty femoral heads were tested with both methods. Bacteria were cultured neither from the femoral surface swabs nor from the femoral fragments. Consequently no distinct conclusions regarding the sensitivity of both techniques could be drawn. In addition the bacterial yield of two swabs in Amies transport medium streaked on a variety of culture media other than the conventional agar plates was also studied. Culturing of these swabs resulted in the detection of bacteria that are predominantly considered contaminants.",

    "abstract": "Humerus fractures are common ; their management remains controversial. Infection, neurovascular injury, joint problems and non-union are recognised complications of surgical treatment. These complica tions can be decreased by opting for a surgical treat ment that is less invasive and safe. We present a series of 59 patients treated with retrograde Ender nailing ; 56 healed in an average of 9.1 weeks, 2 had delayed union (> 15 weeks) and one went on to non-union, which healed after secondary plate fixation. Nail back out occurred in 8 cases, of which only 3 required nails repositioning. The mean Constant score at final follow-up (mean 19 months) was 91 ; it was significantly lower in patients over 50 years of age and in those with segmental fractures. In this series, Ender retro grade nailing gave overall satisfactory results and appeared as a safe and efficient technique.",

Limb salvage is the goal of treatment, and this entails sacrifice of the common peroneal nerve as well as the anterior tibial artery. Also the loss of the lateral collateral ligament and biceps attachment leads to unavoidable knee instability which requires special reconstructive procedures. From 2002 to 2008, eight patients with osteosarcoma of the fibular head were treated in our institution with Malawer type II resection. Seven of these patients are still alive without evidence of disease. Our results indicate that the sacrifice of the common peroneal nerve ensures a wide margin of resection which in turn correlates with long-term survival. Furthermore, our technique of reconstruction of lateral knee structures has produced good functional outcome without significant postoperative knee instability.",

Strong signals were detected for BMP-4 at the end of the distraction period and for BMP-6 during the entire experimental period. Signals for BMP-7 (Osteogenic Protein-1) were very low, suggesting a less important role during the normal process of distraction bone healing. Immunohistochemical staining revealed the presence of BMP-4 in the early chondroblasts, while BMP-6 was detected in the more mature cartilage cells.

The independent variables included age, gender, body mass index, and comorbidities, along with external factors of fracture pattern, nailing settings, and treatment processing time. A multiple logistic regression was used to identify infection risk factors. The risk of infection significantly increased according to the open grading, the fractures' classification, time until antibiotic administration, and time until nailing. Gustilo type I fractures presented a higher rate of infection than expected, explained by a longer delay before surgery. The probabilistic equation allows infection prediction with high sensitivity and specificity. In total, we showed that no antibiotics' prescription in emergency service and a transverse fracture pattern were predictors of infection. An infection risk score can be computed, aiding surgeons in decision making. Outcomes could improve keeping these observations in mind. Level of evidence: Retrospective cohort study. Level iii.",

The mean (-SD) FJS for the cruciate-retaining group was 78,4-25.1 compared to 67.6-27.6 for the posterior stabilized group. No significant difference in OKS was detected. The total ceiling effect for FJS and OKS was 32.2% and 45.5%, respectively. In conclusion, patients with cruciate-retaining TKA showed a better FJS in comparison to posterior stabilized TKA.

Eleven patients with a mean age of 36 years were included. All presented with an infected multi-tissue defect. The mean length of the tibia defect was 4.4 cm and the mean area of the soft-tissue loss was 32 cm2 . Pedicled flap coverage was required in all cases. At the mean follow-up time of 15 months bone union was achieved in nine of 11 cases, after additional inter-tibiofibular grafting was performed in four cases. Infection recurrence was noted in five of 11 cases. Most patients presented medium-quality soft-tissue coverage and suboptimal function.

Forty patients were randomly divided into the arm slings only (group S) or arm sling with kinesiotaping therapy group (group K). The outcome measures included the visual analog scale (VAS) score, Constant score, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, union time, magnitude of shortening, and time to return to work.

Arthroscopic ankle arthrodesis has been shown in non-haemophiliac patients to provide similar or superior rates of fusion to open ankle fusion. However, the literature regarding ankle arthrodesis in patients with haemophilia is limited. Our aim was to compare the rate of successful fusion between open and arthroscopic assisted ankle arthrodesis in patients with haemophilia. A retrospective study was performed. All patients with haemophilia who underwent ankle arthrodesis at our centre were included. Outcomes including peri- and post-operative complications, and lengths of stay were extracted from patients' records. Radiographs were reviewed for signs of successful arthrodesis. Seventeen arthrodesis procedures were performed in 13 patients between 1980 and 2017. Nine procedures were performed arthroscopically and eight were open. Ten patients were diagnosed with haemophilia A and three with haemophilia B. The success rates of arthroscopic and open tibiotalar arthrodesis were 100% and 87.5% respectively. Four complications occurred. In the open technique group, there was one non-union. The same patient also developed subsequent haematoma after revision surgery. One patient developed a superficial wound infection which resolved with antibiotics. In the arthroscopic group, one patient developed a pseudoarthrosis of the distal tibiofibular joint which required a revision procedure. The results of this study suggest that arthroscopic ankle fusion for haemophilia- associated arthropathy is a viable option, with the rate of successful fusion being comparable to open procedures.",

The aim of this study is to assess medial meniscus extrusion at increasing varus forces utilizing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in order to evaluate the contribution of the adduction moment of the knee during gait. We prospectively enrolled 19 patients (38 knees). Patients underwent gait analysis testing to calculate adduction moment, followed by an MRI at rest and with increasing varus forces according to the patient's specific adduction moment. Meniscal extrusion and root gap at increasing varus forces were measured and compared. Functional outcomes and their association to meniscal extrusion was analyzed. We found the average meniscal extrusion at rest, 100% and 150% applied varus force for the control group to be 1.7mm, 1.7mm and 1.9mm, respectively; and for the index group average meniscal extrusion was 5.3mm, 6.4mm and 6.8mm, respectively. Meniscal extrusion increase from rest to 100% varus force was significantly higher in the index group (p=0.0002). Further meniscal extrusion and root gap increase from 100% varus force to 150% varus force did not show a statistically significant difference (p=0.39).

Members of the Royal Belgian Society for Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology (SORBCOT) and the Belgische Vereniging voor Orthopedie en Traumatologie (BVOT) were asked to answer a 28-question questionnaire on the internet about the application of surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis measures and to compare them with current inter- national recommendations. 228 practicing orthopedic surgeons responded to the survey from different regions (Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels), different hospitals (university, public and private), different levels of experience (&lt; 5 years, 5 to 10 years and &gt; 10 years) and different subspecialties (lower limb, upper limb and spine). Regarding the questionnaire: 7% systematically perform a dental check-up. 47.8% of the participants never carry out a urinalysis, 41.7% when the patient presents symptoms and 10.5% carry it out systematically. 2.6% systematically propose a pre-operative nutritional assessment. 5.3% of respondents suggest stopping biotherapies (Remicade®, Humira®, rituximab®, etc.) before an operation and 43.9% do not feel comfortable with this type of treatment. 47.1% suggest smoking cessation before the operation and 22% of them advise smoking cessation for a period of 4 weeks. 54.8% never carry out MRSA screening. 68.3% systematically per- formed hair removal, 18.5% when the patient had hirsutism. Among them, 17.7% use shaving with razors. Alcoholic Isobetadine is the most used product with 69.3% when disinfecting the surgical site. 42.1% of the surgeons chose a delay between the injection of antibiotic prophylaxis and the incision of less than 30 minutes, 55.7% between 30 and 60 minutes and 2.2% between 60 and 120 minutes. However, 44.7% did not wait for the injection time to be respected before incising. An incise drape is used in 79.8% of cases. The response rate was not influenced by the surgeon’s experience. Most international recommendations in terms of prevention of surgical site infection are correctly applied. However, some bad habits are maintained. These include the use of shaving for depilation and the use of non-impregnated adhesive drapes.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate a reduction method that is based on the theory of Evans to reduce angulated greenstick fractures of the distal forearm with a rotation manoeuvre, to evaluate an immobilisation technique and to evaluate a brief survey on surgeon practice for treatment of these fractures. A retrospective study was performed on 21 patients. Fractures were reduced with a pronation or supination manoeuvre depending on the angulation of the fracture and were immobilised in pronation or supination. A good reduction was achieved in all patients. Six weeks after manipulation a loss of reduction was seen in 6 out of 21 patients, but with a reangulation of less than 15 degrees. There was no significant difference between fractures immobilized in pronation or in supination. There was no need for remanipulation. At the 2008 Osteosynthesis and Trauma Care Foundation (OTC) meeting, a brief informal survey was performed concerning the reduction method and the use of K-wires after reduction. No surgeons indicated they would perform only a rotation manoeuvre.",

    "abstract": "The standard dorsal portals are the most commonly used in wrist arthroscopy. This cadaveric study aims to determine safe zones, by quantitatively describing the neurovascular relationships of the dorsal wrist arthroscopy portals: 1-2, 3-4, midcarpal radial, midcarpal ulnar, 4-5, 6-radial and 6-ulnar. The neurovascular structures of twenty-one fresh frozen human cadaveric upper limbs were exposed, while the aforementioned portals were established with needles through portal sites. The minimum distance between portals and: dorsal carpal branch of radial artery, superficial branch of radial nerve, posterior interosseous nerve and dorsal branch of ulnar nerve, were measured accordingly with a digital caliper, followed by statistical analysis of the data. The median and interquartile range for each portal to structures at risk were determined and a safe zone around each portal was established. Free of any neurovascular structure safe zones surrounding 1-2, 3-4, midcarpal radial, midcarpal ulnar, 4-5, 6-radial and 6-ulnar portals were found at 0.46mm, 2.33mm, 10.73mm, 11.01mm, 10.38mm, 5.95mm and 0.64mm respectively. Results of statistical analysis from comparisons between 1-2, 3-4 and midcarpal radial portals, indicated that 1-2 was the least safe. The same analysis among 3-4, midcarpal radial, midcarpal ulnar and 4-5 portals indicated that midcarpal portals were safer, while 3-4 was the least safe. Results among midcarpal ulnar, 4-5, 6-radial and 6-ulnar portals indicated that 6-radial and specifically 6-ulnar were the least safe. This study provides a safe approach to the dorsal aspect of the wrist, enhancing established measurements and further examining safety of the posterior interosseous nerve.",

The aim of this study was to describe the 5-years learning curve of a surgeon. Objective was to assess clinical and radiological results; and to assess factors which could influence this learning curve. Between November 2015 and May 2020, patients with an acetabular fracture operated by the surgeon during the 5-years learning curve with an anterior approach were included in this single-center retrospective study based on a prospective database. Epidemiological, operative, clinical, radiological and complications data’s were collected. To assess learning-curve effect the series was divided into two groups: first 2.5-years and last 2-years. Subgroup analysis were performed according to the surgical approach, to the reduction quality and the prognostic factors. In total, 46 patients were included, 23 in period 1 and 23 in period 2. 16 patients (35%) had ilioinguinal approach and 30 patients (65%) had modified Stoppa-Cole approach. At mean follow-up of 24 months, 38 patients (83%) were reviewed. Anatomical reduction (&lt; 1 mm) was achieved in 28 patients (60.9%) with a 9% rate of perioperative complications and 37% rate of post-operative complications. In conclusion, this study gives a realistic overview of the learning curve of anterior approaches in acetabular fractures surgery. Our results should encourage surgeons, while keeping in mind how much this surgery can be challenging, with high rate of complications and difficulty to obtain a systematic anatomical reduction.",

Controversies surrounding metal-on-metal (MoM) hip resurfacing have, however, led to a significant decline in the popularity of the HRA. Despite this, substantial evidence supports the use of specific implants in a selected group of patients. This is a continued retrospective analysis of a single surgeon series of the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (BHR). Initial medium-term analysis was done in 2011 and published by Van der Bracht et al.13. This analysis includes a long-term follow-up of 7 to 12 years, including functional scoring (HHS, HOOS and UCLA activity score), metal ion evaluation and survival analysis. Failure was defined as revision for any cause. A total of 267 resurfacing procedures with the BHR were included in 247 patients. We had a mean follow-up of 8.3 years. Overall survival at ten years was 94.8%(97.2% for males and 90.1% for females). There was a statistically significant increase in mean HHS score at follow-up (56.03 - IQR 47-65 to 96.07 - IQR 96-100). Elevated metal ions were correlated with a statistically significant increase in the probability of complications. This cohort study further proved that hip resurfacing arthroplasty with the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing implant provides a good alternative to conventional total hip arthroplasty in young patients. There was a significant increase in functional scores at follow-up. There is further evidence of less favorable outcomes in female patients.",

However, contemporary literature reports conflicting results. Our working hypothesis was that LIA renders better postoperative VAS-scores and reduces the need for oral analgetics. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aimed at examining the effectiveness of LIA in THA. A total of 90 patients were included for statistical analysis. Our primary endpoint was the Visual Analogue Scale, VAS, (0: no pain, 10: unbearable pain) preoperatively, at the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 12th hour postoperative intervals and at discharge. Our secondary endpoints included the postoperative opioid consumption, as well as patient satisfaction at 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively, measured using the Numeric Rating Scale, NRS. LIA has a tendency for superior results regarding VAS- Scores at 3 and 4 hours postoperatively. There were no notable statistical distinctions observed in terms of patients necessitating rescue opioid consumption. Patient satisfaction using the NRS at both the 2-week and 6-week postoperatively did not differ significantly between both groups. The administration of LIA could offer advantages during the initial stages of postoperative recovery, which could be particularly valuable in rapid recovery programs.",

To assess the effect of KJD, a 3D gait analysis was performed preoperative and one year postoperative. In this patient, preoperative 3D gait analysis revealed an increased knee adduction moment (KAM) compared to healthy levels. Postoperative the KAM decreased, approaching healthy levels, suggesting potential improvements in disease status or in gait. Consequently, further investigation into the effectiveness of Knee Joint Distraction (KJD) as a treatment option for relatively young patients with knee OA is warranted.

Methods: Four databases were searched for studies presenting pain outcomes following surgical intervention for BTJA. Pain scores were reported using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and compared against the pre-established threshold for Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) of 1.65. Results: Eighteen studies with 763 patients treated with AD(n=102, 13%), TRAP(n=428, 56%), and JR(n=233, 31%) between 2010 and 2023 with a mean follow-up period of 38 ± 28 months were included. There were 25 groups including 4 AD, 14 TRAP, and 7 JR. The mean difference between pre- and post-operative VAS pain was 4.9 ± 2 for all groups. Meta-analysis demonstrated a mean delta VAS of 3.6 (95%CI 1.79-5.38, for AD, 5.1(95%CI, 4.20-6.02) for TRAP and 6.8(95%CI, 5.93-7.97) for JR. ANOVA showed a significant difference between groups (P=0.016). Post-Hoc testing showed a significant difference between AD and JR (P=0.014). A significant improvement in pain scores, surpassing the MCID threshold, was obtained in all surgical interventions. Change in pain score was 2.6 times MCID for AD, 2.9 times for TRAP, and 3.6 times for JR. Conclusions: All interventions showed significant improvement in pain. Variability in treatment options and improvement depends on patient selection and surgeon’s preference. This data can be used to counsel patients regarding the expected pain relief. However, longevity, and long-term outcomes warrant further study.",

    "abstract": "Fatty infiltration is a degenerative condition of the tendon-muscle unit of rotator cuff muscles, characterized by fatty accumulation within and around the muscles. This study compares a 3D method to the Goutallier classification for evaluating fatty infiltration of the rotator cuff muscles. Employing a retrospective study design, four researchers performed 3D segmentation of the rotator cuff muscles on 65 CT scans of patients with rotator cuff arthropathy. The Goutallier classification was graded on screenshots of the Y view and two axial slices. Measurements, including HU, volume, cross-sectional area, and Goutallier grade, were performed on the 3D segmentations and the respective 2D slices. The inter- and intra-rater variability for 2D and 3D methods were calculated using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). The ICC for 2D and 3D methods was excellent (ICC: 0.90-0.95 and 0.81-0.99, respectively) and good for the Goutallier classification (ICC: 0.62-0.81). Overall, the relative 3D fatty infiltration was 0% for Goutallier grade 0 muscles, 7% for grade 1, 19% for grade 2, 33% for grade 3, and 37% for grade 4. The relative 2D fatty infiltration was 0%, 8%, 25%, 37%, and 43%, respectively. We conclude that 3D segmentation on CT scans is better reproducible and evaluates the muscle entirely. However, the time-intensive nature of the 3D method currently limits its clinical practicality. Quantitive 2D evaluation is excellently reproducible but may overestimate the actual fatty infiltration percentage of the whole muscle.",

    "abstract": "Osteotomies to correct hallux valgus are usually secured using metal implants. Their main disadvantage is the need for a repeat surgery for removal of implanted material. Bioresorbable implants would make it possible to overcome this complication. Few studies analyse the results of using bioresorbable pins. The primary objective of this study is to compare hallux valgus correction radiographic results with the use of two types of bioresorbable pins. The secondary objectives are to screen for possible complications related to the use of these bioresorbable pins. This is a descriptive, retrospective, single-centre study carried out between May 2018 and May 2022 in the orthopaedic surgery department of the Centre Chirurgical Emile Gallé at the CHRU in Nancy (France). The study involved 105 hallux valgus (98 patients) operated on by open double metatarsal and phalangeal osteotomy. Osteotomies were stabilised with resorbable polylactic acid (PLLA) pins (Arthrex® TRIM-IT® drill pin) in 57 cases (53 patients), and with resorbable polylactic acid-polyglycolic acid copolymer (PGLA) pins (Bioretec® ActivaPins®) in 48 cases (45 patients). The efficacy of hallux valgus correction was analysed in terms of changes in preoperative and postoperative radiographic parameters at 1 and 6 months on a weight-bearing foot. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the demographic and radiological parameters of each group. The mean age was 59.7 years (range 25-81 years) in the PLLA group and 56 years (range 23-78 years) in the PGLA group. The mean preoperative HVA was 30° (range 15-63°) in the PLLA group and 30.8° (range 15-57°) in the PGLA group. The mean preoperative IMA was 14.4° (range 7-30°) in the PLLA group and 13.8° (range 7-20°) in the PGLA group. There was a statistically significant correction of hallux valgus in the PLLA (p=5.24 X 10-15 ) and PGLA (p=3.56 X 10-13 ) groups. The mean correction for the hallux valgus angle was 13° in the PLLA group and 12° in the PGLA group. There was no statistically significant difference in hallux valgus correction between the PLLA and PGLA groups, particularly in terms of hallux valgus severity. There was no radiological or clinical complication in the groups related to bioresorbable pins. The use of bioresorbable pins allows effective stabilisation of osteotomies to correct hallux valgus. There was no significant difference in correction between PLLA and PGLA implants, regardless of the severity of the hallux valgus. We did not observe any obvious clinical or radiological complications related to their use. The use of bioresorbable osteosynthesis material in forefoot surgery seems to offer interesting advantages, providing patients with safer and less invasive treatment solutions.",

The study incorporated individuals who had a Sanders type 1 fracture that was both closed and non-displaced and were treated with conventional plaster. The current study retrospectively reviewed medical records to gather demographic data, duration of immobilization, smoking habits, administration of VC supplementation, and presence of diabetes mellitus (DM). The Budapest criteria were employed to make the clinical diagnosis of CRPS. The study cohort comprised 258 (75.9%) males and 82 (24.1%) females aged between 18 and 90 years who had sustained Sanders type 1 calcaneal fractures and were managed non-operatively. CRPS was detected in 42 (12.4%) of the 340 subjects. CRPS patients had a statistically higher immobilization duration than those without CRPS (p&lt;0.05). Smoking and DM were more common among patients with CRPS (p&lt;0.05) and CRPS patients had a much lower rate of VC consumption (4.8%) (p&lt;0.05). The current study is the first to examine risk variables for CRPS after calcaneal fractures. Long periods of immobility, female gender, and lack of VC supplementation increase the risk of CRPS. CRPS also increases with diabetes and smoking.",

Reconstruction with fascio-cutaneous and fascial flaps are the most widely used in the literature, few cases are reported using muscular free flap. We report our experience with the use of the free gracilis muscle flap for palmar soft tissue reconstruction in patients with complex hand traumas. Methods: We review nine cases of complex soft tissue reconstruction to the palm of the hand using the free gracilis muscle flap performed over a period of 20 years. Eight cases involved acute trauma with damage to underlying structures, necessitating multiple surgical procedures. Results: With an average follow-up of 36 months, the free gracilis muscle flap reconstruction enabled patients to achieve good grip, with skin quality resistant to chronic mechanical stress. All patients recovered a protective sensation to deep pressure. The hand’s aesthetic appearance was restored in all cases. Flap harvesting altered neither the function nor silhouette of the donor site. Conclusion: The optimal palmar reconstruction technique depends on patient characteristics, associated trauma, and defect size. In our opinion, the gracilis muscle flap technique is both straightforward and effective in restoring mechanical function of the hand, particularly when a large area of the palm has been impacted.",

It has the potential to alter the growth of the head or acetabulum and prevent the best outcomes. While past literature has evaluated the risks of AVN and strategies to avoid it, studies on the impact of AVN on the outcomes are scarce. In this systematic review, we aim to study the extent of the effects of AVN on the outcomes, in the management of DDH. In this systematic review series for 1990 to 2021 were pooled. The clinical and radiological outcomes of the AVN and non-AVN groups were compared. The effects of other modifying factors were also evaluated. A total of 170 AVN and 585 non-AVN hips from 21 papers were compared. The analysis did not show any statistically significant difference between the AVN and non-AVN groups in terms of clinical or radiological parameters. Interestingly patients who had the index surgery at a younger age had a higher risk of further surgery, with acetabular osteotomy being the most common secondary procedure. The negative impact of AVN may not be as severe as previously thought. Thus, the fear of AVN should not take precedence over the primary goal of DDH management i.e. obtaining a stable concentric mobile hip.",

PubMed and Medline databases were searched in October 2023 for studies reporting outcomes of arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and stable medial meniscal ramp lesion treatment. Studies focused on diagnostic approaches, biomechanical properties, unstable ramp lesions, isolated ramp lesions, and concomitant intraarticular/extraarticular pathologies other than ACL rupture are excluded. A total of 314 studies were obtained after the initial search. Six studies met the inclusion criteria. Data from 186 stable medial meniscal ramp lesions that were left unrepaired were retrieved. At the last follow-up, mean preoperative Lysholm and IKDC scores were significantly improved and similar with repair patients and no ramp lesion patients, postoperatively. Healing rate was reported between 58.6% and 87.8%. Knee stability was similar in repaired and nonrepaired patients and a ramp existed and no ramp lesion patients. Although the return to sports rate was similar between ramp existed and no ramp lesion patients, the time to return to sports was higher in ramp existed patients than no ramp patients. Improved functional outcome scores, similar healing rates, knee stability, and return to sports rates can be obtained in repaired and nonrepaired patients as well as ramp lesions existing and no ramp lesion patients when the stable ramp lesions are left unrepaired. The time to return to sport is significantly higher than no ramp lesion patients. Level of Evidence III",

    "abstract": "Several studies suggested that total hip arthroplasty (THA) was more technical demanding following previous pelvic osteotomy (PO), resulting in poor outcomes compared with primary THA. However, the other studies regarding this topic had reported contradictory results. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to compare the clinical results and other parameters between total hip arthroplasty following pelvic osteotomy and primary total hip arthroplasty. We systematically searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO and Web of science from inception to September 2020. This study compared the outcomes between THA following previous PO and primary THA with respect to operative time, blood loss, Harris hip score (HHS), revision rates, complication rates, cup position, cup size, cup coverage and hip joint center. 14 studies with 3913 participants were included. The THA after PO group had longer operative time (MD, 13.8 mins; 95% CI, 4.73 to 22.87 mins; P=0.003), greater blood loss (MD, 82.21 ml; 95% CI, 27.94 to 136.48 ml; P=0.003), worse HHS (MD, -2.79 points; 95% CI, -4.08 to -1.50 points; P&lt;0.00001), smaller acetabular anteversion angle (MD, -3.98°; 95% CI, -6.72 to -1.24°; P=0.004), larger cup size (MD, 1.52 mm; 95% CI, 0.75 to 2.28 mm; P=0.0001), more lateral (MD, 2.83 mm; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.43 mm; P=0.0005) and superior (MD, 2.26 mm; 95% CI, 1.11 to 3.40 mm; P=0.0001) hip joint center. No statistically significant differences were demonstrated between the THA after PO group and primary THA group in revision rates, complication rates, acetabular abduction angle, cup coverage. THA after pelvic osteotomy was associated with inferior intraoperative outcomes, lower functional scores and worse inferior positioning of acetabular component compared with primary THA. Due to the alerted anatomical structure after PO, the findings of current study implicated that preoperative assessment such as computed tomography scan should be conducted in order to achieve satisfactory results.",

The delay between the arrival at the emergency department and transfer to the operating room, as well as the mortality are evaluated. The length of hospital stay, the operating time, the ASA score, and the Charlson Index were also examined. A total of 734 cases were analysed, with 384 patients pre-DOTR and 350 patients post-DOTR.

    "abstract": "Delayed fracture healing (DFH), a common complication of post-fracture surgery, exhibits an incompletely understood pathogenesis. The present study endeavors to investigate the roles and underlying mechanisms of miR-656-3p and Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2 (BMP-2) in DFH. It was recruited 94 patients with normal fracture healing (NFH) and 88 patients with DFH of the femoral neck. Serum miR-656-3p and BMP-2 expressions were quantified using RT-qPCR and the diagnostic potential of them for DFH was evaluated using ROC analysis. Factors influencing fracture healing were identified through logistic regression analysis. Osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells was induced, followed by evaluations of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation capabilities utilizing CCK-8, flow cytometry, and mRNA expression analysis of osteogenic markers. The targeting relationship between miR-656-3p and BMP-2 was validated through luciferase reporter assays. The levels of miR-656-3p were significantly elevated in DFH patients compared to those with NFH, whereas BMP-2 levels exhibited a decrease, a negative correlation between their expression patterns. Logistic regression analysis revealed that miR-656-3p and BMP-2 serve as influential factors in fracture healing, with their combined assessment exhibiting enhanced predictive value for DFH. Downregulation of miR-656-3p promoted proliferation and differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells while inhibiting apoptosis. BMP-2, identified as a target of miR-656-3p, negated the effects of miR-656-3p downregulation when BMP-2 expression was inhibited. miR-656-3p modulates osteoblast function by targeting BMP-2, offering novel therapeutic and diagnostic targets for the management of DFH.",

    "abstract": "The current study aimed to objectively evaluate the fit of a rectangular, tapered stem to the severely dysplastic hips on the basis of the proximal femoral anatomy and the dimensional properties of the stem. It was hypothesized that the stem size planned with accordance to the diaphyseal canal width alone can accommodate the distal femur successfully with no sizing mismatch. Forty-six patients (53 hips) suffering from secondary osteoarthritis due to hip dysplasia scheduled for total hip arthroplasty (THA) with a subtrochanteric transverse shortening osteotomy were included. All hips were Crowe type 4. All patients underwent preoperative computed tomography imaging. Height of femoral head center (HCH) was determined. Medullary canal diameter measurements at different levels were made. These were made at a level (1) 35% of HCH above the lesser trochanter (DT +35), (2) 70% of HCH below the lesser trochanter (DT -70), and (3) at the level of isthmus (Di). Medullary canal flare indices were calculated from the individual parameter ratios. Similar measurements were carried out for the different sizes of the femoral stem. The mean DT +35 was 41.9 ± 6.4 mm, the mean DT-70 was 17.3 ± 2.2 mm, and the mean Di was 12.8 ± 1.9 mm. In all femurs, the width of the isthmus was wider than that of the corresponding femoral stem isthmus. The femoral stem sizes established with respect to the diaphyseal width of the femur were all compatible with the isthmus width of the femur. Tapered and rectangular stems can accommodate the proximal femur above and below the osteotomy level in Crowe type IV hip dyplasia patients, thereby constituting a viable option as the femoral stem in this patient group with technically demanding difficulties.",

    "abstract": "High tibial osteotomy (HTO) is a widely used procedure for delaying knee arthroplasty, correcting alignment, and relieving symptoms in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Recently, proximal fibular osteotomy (PFO) has emerged as a less invasive and more cost-effective alternative. This study compares the outcomes of HTO and PFO to evaluate whether PFO can deliver results comparable to HTO in similar patient populations. A total of 96 patients treated between 2018 and 2022 were analyzed, with 54 patients undergoing HTO and 42 undergoing PFO. Subgroups were also created based on body mass index (BMI): non-obese HTO, obese HTO, non-obese PFO, and obese PFO. For each patient, we recorded demographic data, preoperative and 1-year postoperative Oxford Knee Scores (OKS), visual analog scale (VAS) scores, medial joint space (MJS) measurements, mechanical axis deviations (MAD), Kellgren- Lawrence grade (KL), medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA), and any complications. Both HTO and PFO led to significant improvements in OKS, VAS, MJS width, and MAD. Age, KL grade distribution, BMI, and MPTA values were comparable across the groups. Overall, HTO showed superior clinical (OKS, VAS) and radiological (MJS, MAD) outcomes, particularly in non-obese patients. Among obese patients, HTO and PFO achieved similar clinical improvements, although HTO maintained a radiological advantage. Importantly, a lower preoperative MPTA was associated with poorer clinical outcomes in the PFO group. In conclusion, while PFO can produce meaningful clinical and radiological improvements, HTO remains the more effective option in terms of both clinical and radiological outcomes in patients with a BMI below 30. For patients with a BMI over 30, HTO preserves its radiological superiority, although its clinical benefits are comparable to those of PFO. Additionally, a low preoperative MPTA is significantly linked to worse OKS scores in patients undergoing PFO.",

Color Doppler ultrasonography was performed one month after operation, and the ultrasonographic features were recorded. DVT was diagnosed according to the results of venography, based on which the patients were divided into a DVT group and a non-DVT group. Their basic and treatment-related data were compared. The risk factors for postoperative DVT were screened by multivariate logistic regression analysis. A total of 63 cases were diagnosed with DVT by venography, with a detection rate of 70.00%. A total of 69 cases were diagnosed with DVT by ultrasonography, with a detection rate of 76.67% (P&gt;0.05). The concurrent internal medicine diseases, associated injuries, no preventive measures for thrombosis, operation time ≥2 h, no active or passive exercise after operation, pelvic and proximal femoral fractures, knee fractures and tibiofibular fractures were risk factors for postoperative DVT in patients with lower limb fractures (P&lt;0.05). Ultrasonography is effective for diagnosing postoperative lower limb DVT in patients with lower limb fractures. Related preventive measures should be taken promptly to control the risk factors.",

Artefact on MRI was less evident with CFR-PEEK nails when hybrid imaging and metal artefact reduction techniques were used. The advantages of CFR-PEEK nails might not be realised in clinical practice for most patients with MBD requiring IM nailing except for in those likely to require prolonged disease surveillance.",

We retrospectively reviewed the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database for patients diagnosed with primary chondrosarcoma from 1973 to 2015. We evaluated the patients for both descriptive characteristics as well as cancer specific characteristics. We then performed a propensity matched analysis and other analyses to compare difference in cancer characteristics as well as survival. There were 3048 patients with chondrosarcoma of the bone during our study period of which 188(6.2%) patients did not undergo operative treatment either due to refusal of cancer directed surgery or contraindicated to surgery. A one unit increase in age was significantly associated with increased odds of not undergoing surgery(Odds Ratio 1.04;95% CI, 1.03- 1.05). No statistically significant difference(P = 0.9) in survival was noted between patients with long bone, grade 1 chondrosarcomas regardless of if they did or did not undergo operative treatment. This study provides data to inform the patient on their decisions for or against surgery and may assist the surgeons in counseling patients regarding the surgical treatment of chondrosarcomas. Patients not undergoing operative treatment for chondrosarcomas are at statistically significantly increased risk of mortality.",

Bicruciate retaining (BCR) TKA offers superior knee kinematics and proprioception, but many surgeons abandoned its use because of complications and technical difficulties. Recently, two new BCR implant designs were introduced : Vanguard XP (Zimmer Biomet) and Journey XR (Smith&amp;Nephew). We searched Pubmed, Limo, Embase and Cochrane, screened reference lists of eligible studies and included studies that met the inclusion criteria. We included 35 articles reporting on ten different BCR implants, including three articles presenting results of the Vanguard XP prosthesis. Unfortunately, no articles reporting on the results of the Journey XR prosthesis had been published. The BCR implants of the early 1970s showed good functional results, but a high rate of complications, mainly loosening and infections. The Townley Anatomic TKA was the first BCR implant with good clinical results, a low incidence of loosening and a high survivorship. One article of the three reporting on the Vanguard XP yielded high patient satisfaction (94%) with two revisions (1.4%). The two other articles reported three revisions (5%) after one year of follow-up and 19 revisions (13.4%) after three years of follow-up. Throughout history, the functional results of BCR TKA improved, with lessening of the complications. The short-term results of the Vanguard XP implant showed good functional results, but two out of three articles reported a high rate of loosening. Based on the results reported in this review, the use of BCR TKA is still debatable. Further high-level evidence research is necessary to assess the clinical benefit of BCR TKA.",

    "abstract": "The management of displaced radial neck fractures in children is still a controversial topic. The objective of this study is to examine the outcomes of modified Metaizeau technique in the children with displaced radius neck fractures. The retrospective study included 15 children with displaced radial neck fracture with an angulation of more than 30° who were managed with the use of leverage technique by mosquito clamps and internal fixation with elastic stable intramedullary nailing (ESIN). Radiological and functional assessments were performed during follow-up. Additionally, the patients were evaluated using Mayo Elbow Per- formance Score (MEPS). All the children could be managed with clamp-assisted closed reduction. The average duration of follow up was 25.5 ± 6.1 months (15-36 months). An excellent elbow function was achieved in all but one patient. Based on Metaizeau classification, excellent, good, fair, and poor outcomes were achieved in 11, 1, 2, and 1 patients, respectively. The average postoperative MEPS score was 98.7 ± 5.1 (80-100). Clamp-assisted closed reduction and fixation with ESIN is a good choice in the children with displaced radial neck fractures. This technique is associated with good functional and radiologic outcomes in the medium-term. Further studies are warranted with larger sample sizes.",

    "abstract": "Current classifications of midshaft clavicle fractures are based on radiography. The aim of the study was to evaluate the fracture pattern of clavicle fractures using 3-dimensional computed tomography (3D CT). A retrospective analysis was performed on CT scans of 65 acute clavicle fractures. Using quantitative 3D CT reconstruction techniques, the fracture of the clavicle was virtually reduced. Based on these reconstructions, a group-based fracture heat map and small fragment heat map, and the location of the most common fracture line were determined. Also, the direction and amount of displacement were evaluated. Three fracture patterns could be distinguished. The primary fracture line in type 1 is going from posteromedial to anterolateral and located between 50% and 68% of the clavicle’s length. In type 2, a transverse fracture line is located around 55%, and in type 3, a superolateral to inferomedial line is located between 47% and 56%. Wedged fracture fragments can be seen in types 1 and 2 and are mainly situated inferiorly. The displacement is similar in all types, but the main direction of displacement is specific for the different types (posterior, anterior, inferior). We can conclude that several fracture patterns can be seen in clavicle fractures. Most fractures are located laterally at the midshaft of the clavicle. Wedged segments are mainly located inferiorly, and at the posterior part of the clavicle, no comminution is ever seen. The direction of displacement depends on the fracture pattern.",

    "abstract": "Infection after total hip or total knee arthroplasty is a serious complication implying great costs for the health care system. Amongst the different treatment options, the two-step exchange using a spacer in the interval is a valid option. We evaluate the economic impact of our self-made antibiotic-loaded hip and knee cement spacers compared with prefabricated spacers and spacer molds. Costs to prepare self-made cement spacers are detailed for each spacer type. We also assess the intraoperative time spent for fabricating our self-made hip and knee spacers. The price of these self-made knee spacer is 514 CHF (450 EUR / 505 USD) if non-articulated and 535 CHF (470 EUR / 525 USD) if articulated ; the price for the self-made hip spacer is 749 CHF (760 EUR / 735 USD). Our average preparation time is 14 minutes for our self-made knee spacers and 16 minutes for our self-made hip spacers. While the senior surgeon is fabricating the self-spacers, another surgeon of the team continues intensive irrigation and debridement. Thus, no time is lost waiting for the self-spacer to be fabricated. In our hands, self-made hip and knee spacers are at least 40-50% cheaper than prefabricated spacers and spacer-molds. This is a serious economic advantage in this already expensive surgery. When done in teamwork, self-spacer fabrication does not increase the surgery time. The economic advantage is added to the main and most important advantage of self- made spacers, which remains the possibility of patient adapted anatomical reconstruction of the joint.",

As such, we devised a study to compare templating precision between the operated hip joint versus the healthy side for patients with osteoarthritis (OA). The study hypothesis was that preoperative templating accuracy of THA on the ipsilateral diseased hip joint would be higher compared to the contralateral healthy hip in patients with OA. We retrospectively reviewed 100 patients who underwent THA for unilateral OA at our center from January 2018 to January 2020. Retrospective preoperative digital templating was performed separately on both the operated hip joint and the healthy contralateral hip joint by a single surgeon who was blinded by the in-situ components sizes. Accuracy of each group was compared to the implanted components. Assessment of the 100 included cases demonstrated superior acetabular component size prediction when templating was performed using the diseased hip compared to the healthy contralateral side (68.0% versus 51.0%, p&lt;0.001). No differences between the cohorts were found regarding templating accuracy of femoral stem sizes (72.0% and 69.0%, p=0.375) or neck offset (73.0% and 69.0%, p=0.289). Templating acetabular cup size using the ipsilateral diseased hip is more accurate than using the contralateral healthy hip in patients with unilateral OA.",

In response, different hypoallergenic metal coatings have been developed for TKAs. How- ever, possible adverse effects of these different metals (cobalt-chromium-molybdenum, zirconium, titanium and tantalum) have been neglected. The aim was to summarize the local and systemic adverse effects (including metal hypersensitivity), survival ratios, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and the plasma metal ion concentrations of the different TKA coatings. A literature search on PubMed and EMBASE was performed. In total, 15 studies were found eligible. Common adverse effects of TKA were infection, loosening, pain, instability and hyper- coagulation disorders. Serious adverse effects related to TKA implants were not reported. The survival ratios and patient-reported outcome measures seem to confirm these good results. In contrast with chromium and cobalt, no significant differences were reported in the nickel, molybdenum and titanium concentrations. No significant differences between the hypoallergenic and standard TKA implants were found in terms of adverse effects, survival ratios and PROMs. A causal relationship between the common adverse effects and the different metals is unlikely. Due to the heterogeneity of the TKA implants used, no firm conclusions could be made. Further research with longer follow-up studies are needed to find possible adverse effects and differences. Thus far, the hypoallergenic implants seem to perform equal to the standard implants.",

Further examinations were normal. Pseudodystrophy was diagnosed and intensive physiotherapy was started. This resulted in complete functional recovery. Pseudodystrophy is typically found in children, adolescents and young women. The clinical features usually include severe pain at a joint or part of a limb with major functional disability, cyanosis, coldness and oedema or atrophy. This is caused by disuse of the affected limb after a minor trauma. The physical lesions may be improved or cured by means of intensive physiotherapy, sometimes combined with medication. As psychogenic factors often play an important role, one of the important elements of treatment is psychotherapy. The most important differential diagnosis is reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD).

Thirty-nine cemented ABG II stems with a centralizer were compared with thirty-nine stems without a centralizer. We evaluated positioning of the tip of the stem according to a standard selection of criteria, using conventional AP and lateral X-ray imaging. The centralizer supplied with the ABG II was found to have no additional value in guaranteeing optimal varus-valgus positioning. If a stem was not placed neutral, generally it was placed in a slight valgus position. The number of deficient cement mantles was not influenced by the three-fin centralizer. Furthermore, the distal centralizer of the ABG II prosthesis adds a length of 27 mm to the stem, and the distal cement plug found in stems with centralizer was almost twice as long on average. The ABG II centralizer was found in this study to provide insufficient guiding of this anatomical stem and to add excessive length to the distal cement plug.",

In this retrospective study, we randomly selected 98 female volleyball players competing in several divisions. Data were obtained from self-administered questionnaires in which the athlete noted data about volleyball practice, whether they had had ankle sprains and the number of these events. Plantar footprint was photographed by a plantoscope classifying each foot as normal, flat or cavus (196 feet). Of the 196 feet, 145 (74.0%) were normal, 8 (4.1%) were flat 43 and (21.9%) were cavus. Thirthy-five athletes reported at least one AS during volleyball practice. In total 65 sprain injuries were reported (35 to the right side and 30 to the left side). In 22 ankles (14 right, 8 left) sprain reinjure (AS >1) have been reported. A higher AS reinjury rate is correlated to the cavus footprint pattern (p = 0,005). Cavus foot associates to a higher risk of reinjury for ankle sprains in female volleyball players. Knowing the athletes which are more likely to sustain a reinjure may be helpful for the orthopedic surgeon to plan preventive strategies.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors underlying treatment nonresponses to denosumab in elderly patients following hip fracture. This retrospective study included 130 patients treated with denosumab after osteoporotic hip fracture between March 2017 and March 2020. The patients were categorized as denosumab nonresponders if they had a T-score <-3 that persisted between dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans, a >3% decrease in bone mineral density (BMD), or an incident fracture on denosumab therapy. We examined the baseline characteristics associated with blunted BMD responses and compared the groups following denosumab treatment for 12 months. Of 130 patients with baseline data, 105 patients (80.8%) were considered responders. No difference in baseline vitamin D, calcium, BMI, age, gender, prior fracture history, or bisphosphonate use was observed between responders and nonresponders. A longer interval between denosumab injections was associated with suboptimal BMD response at both spine and total hip (p<0.001 and p=0.04, respectively). The overall L-BMD and H-BMD were significantly increased compared with pretreatment levels after denosumab treatment (5.7% and 2.5%, respectively). This study revealed that nonresponse was not strongly associated with certain baseline variables and it appears that the reponders and nonresponders were reasonably comparable in this study population. The results of our study highlight the importance of timely denosumab administration when using this drug for osteoporosis management. Physicians should keep these results in mind in clinical practice so that they can improve utilization of 6-month denosumab.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to identify the variables associated with fixation failure in intertrochanteric fractures treated with cephalomedullary nailing (CMN). We retrospectively analyzed 251 consecutive patients who underwent surgery between January 2016 and July 2019. In order to identify predictors of failure (cut-out, cut-through, and/or nonunion), we analyzed: gender, age, fracture stability (according to the AO/OTA Classification), femoral neck angle (FNA), FNA as compared to the contralateral hip, lag screw position, and tip-apex distance (TAD). The failure rate was 9.6%: there were 10 cut-outs (4%), 7 non-unions (2.8%), and 7 cut-throughs (2.8%). Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that the risk factors for fixation failure were: female sex (p= 0.018), FNA <125° (p= 0.003), a difference in FNA of 7.5° as compared to the contralateral hip on the lateral radiograph (p= <0.0001), superior (p= 0.0141) and anterior position (p= <0.0001) of the lag screw, and TAD >25mm (p= 0.016). According to the multivariate analysis, female gender (OR 12.92 ; p 0.0019), the difference in FNA on the lateral view (OR 1.36; p < 0.001), and the anterior position of the screw in the femoral head (OR14.01;p <0.001) were confirmed as independent predictors of failure. In order to avoid failures in intertrochanteric hip fractures treated with CMN, this study confirmed the importance of achieving an accurate reduction on the lateral plane and avoiding the anterior position of the screw on the femoral head.",

    "abstract": "There are concerns that selective sonographic screening for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) may be suboptimal. Our aim was to test this hypothesis by identifying trends in presentation and surgical treatment in patients with DDH. This is a retrospective review of children born between 1997-2018 who were treated surgically for DDH at our sub- regional paediatric orthopaedic unit. Demographic data, risk factors, age of diagnosis and surgical treatments were analysed. Late diagnosis was defined as greater than 4 months. 103 children (14 male, 89 female) underwent surgery. 93 hips were operated for dislocation and 21 for dysplasia. 13 patients presented with bilateral hip dislocations. The median age at diagnosis was 10 months (95% CI: 4-15). 62/103 (60.2%) were diagnosed late (after 4 months) and the median age for diagnosis in this group was 18.5 months (95% CI: 16-20.5). Significantly more patients were referred late (p=0.0077). The presence of risk factors (breech presentation or family history) was associated with early diagnosis. Over the duration of our study the operation rate per 1000 live births gradually increased, and on Poisson regression analysis there was a statistically significant increasing trend towards late diagnosis in recent years (p=0.0237), which necessitated more aggressive surgical management. In the UK, the current selective sonographic screening programme for DDH has shown a deterioration over the years of this study and this questions its current effectiveness. It appears that the majority of irreducible hip dislocations are diagnosed late, with an increased need for surgical management.",

    "abstract": "Femoral shortening in children is a challenging condition with complex functional and psychological implications. We study the results of Ilizarov external fixator (IEF) lengthening compared to lengthening and then plating (LAP) in the management of femoral shortening in children. Forty patients were included in the study and equally divided randomly into 2 groups, in group I LAP was used and in group II lengthening by IEF only was done. The two groups were analyzed for postoperative variables to adjudge the surgical outcomes. The mean follow up time was 24.05 ± 2.99 months, The gained length was 5.60 ± 0.60 cm in group 1 and 5.48 ± 0.64 cm in group II, group I had a shorter external fixator period (3.96 ± 0.22) months, better healing index (24.6 ±2.76) days/cm, earlier complete weight-bearing (5.55 ± 0.78) months than group II. The period of hospitalization for group I was longer more than group II. The complications were less in group I (n=7, 35%) than in group II (n=11, 55%). There was no significant correlation between the healing index with age, also no significant difference was detected between the healing index and gender. There was a significant correlation between the gained length and complete weight-bearing. This study efficiently demonstrates that LAP may be better than lengthening with IEF alone in the management of femoral shortening in children.",

There is lack of consensus in the literature about the preferred surgical technique to address this deformity. Study aim: To evaluate and synthesize the outcome of different surgical techniques for pronation deformity in patients with cerebral palsy. Methodology: The databases MEDLINE and Embase were searched for publications up to December 2021. Articles were considered eligible for inclusion when the included patients had a pronation deformity caused by cerebral palsy and results of surgical intervention for pronation deformity were examined. Evaluation of the quality of the retrieved study was conducted using the MINORS tool. Meta-analysis was not possible due to the heterogeneity of interventions and reported outcomes. Results: Nineteen studies, involving 475 patients and eight different techniques were included. All studies reported gain of active supination in most patients. The effect of surgery on functional gain was less clear and there was a large heterogeneity of reported functional outcome measures. There were 46 reported complications. Overall quality of study design was poor, illustrated by the average MINOR score of 6.9/16. Overall, there is a high risk of bias due to poor internal and external validity of the studies. Conclusion: Despite positive reports on gain in supination and functionality after most procedures addressing pronation deformity in CP patients, no conclusions can be drawn concerning the preferred technique due to the low quality of the evidence.",

Multiple treatment modalities have been described, but still no consensus is stated. In the absence of degenerative changes, we promote a novel non-surgical approach. The aim of this study was to examine all patients with digital mucous cysts without underlying osteoarthritis, undergoing this injection technique and to assess outcome and complications of this procedure. This was a single center study (2018-2019) of 17 patients who received a long needle trajectory aspiration and injection for treatment of digital mucous cysts. Exclusion criteria were prior surgical treatment, post-traumatic cyst formation and the presence of radiographic distal interphalangeal joint osteophytosis. A total of 15 patients were found eligible for inclusion. The patient reports were retrospectively analyzed with a follow-up of 6 months. The primary study outcome was resolution of the cyst; secondary outcomes were complications of the procedure. Twelve (80%) resolved completely and three (20%) had limited local recurrence at 6 months. No complications were reported. None of the patients with limited recurrence desired further treatment. We believe that this technique offers a non-invasive, low-cost treatment option for digital mucous cysts, particularly in the subset of patients with ample evidence of degenerative articular changes in the distal interphalangeal joint. The described technique can be performed in an office-based setting and avoids typical surgical as well as aspiration-associated complications.",

Posterior approach is suitable for isolated posterior fractures. The addition of a specifically contoured rim plate can enable fixation of posterior fragments through a modified lateral approach.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the advantages and limitations of this novel technique. We present a prospective series of 16 tibial plateau fractures with posterolateral depression, operated over a period of 7 years (04.2014-09.2021). The mean age of the patients was 52 years .They were followed for an average period of one year.Clinical and functional assessment was performed according to the criteria of Knee Society Clinical Rating Score. The lateral and posterior component of the fracture was stabilised by a horizontal rim plate, through a posterolateral approach, with or without fibular osteotomy. 9 patients had excellent, 5 had good, 2 had average ratings. The average objective rating was 87,5 (70- 97), and the average functional rating was - 74,4 (40-100). The average ROM was 110° (100°-120°). Two of the fractures healed in 5° varus and 8° valgus respectively. One knee joint ended up with 10° flexion deficit. Three knees had medio- lateral instability, with no functional impairment. In 4 cases the K wires of the weber fibular osteotomy fixation migrated. The absence of late articular collapse of the treated fractures may be attributed to the initial stability of fixation.The addition of a rim plate addresses the posterior comminution and makes early rehabilitation safe.",

The coronal spinal parameters [Cobb angle, apical vertebral rotation (AVR), lateral trunk shift, coronal alignment, biacromial slope and pelvic asymmetry] and the thoracic cage parameters [T1- 12 height, T1-S1 height, thoracic transverse diameter, and apical vertebral body-rib ratio (AVB-R)] of 89 child and adolescent patients were measured on posterior-anterior full-spine radiographs at pre-brace and in-brace conditions using Surgimap software. The initial in-brace correction (IBC) was calculated as a percentage decrease in the Cobb angle on the in-brace radiographs. The mean IBC rate for the primary curve was 37% (range = 10-100%). In the in- brace condition, the Cobb angle (p<0.001), AVR (p<0.001) and lateral trunk shift (p<0.001) decreased significantly; no statistically significant difference was found in the biacromial slope (p=0.713) and the coronal alignment (p=0.074). The T1-12 height and the T1-S1 height increased significantly (p<0.001) whereas the thoracic transverse diameter and the AVB-R decreased significantly (p<0.001). Unlike IBC rate was below 30% as IBC rate was above 30%, the T1-12 height (p<0.001) increased and the AVB-R decreased (p<0.001). The bracing improved the lateral trunk shift, the AVB-R, the thoracic and spine heights, but decreased the thoracic transverse diameter. The thoracic cage parameters may be better when the IBC rate is above 30%.",

The primary aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the need for revision surgery and graft diameter following primary ACL reconstruction (ACLR) using hamstring autografts. The secondary aim of the study was to clarify relationships between anthropometric characteristics and graft diameter. Patients who underwent ACLR with hamstring autografts were included in this retrospective study. The age, body mass index, height, and weight of all patients were recorded preoperatively and the diameters of the grafts were recorded during surgery. The relationship between revision rate and graft diameter and the relationships between anthropometric measurements and graft diameter were investigated for these patients at least one year after surgery. This study included 58 people with graft diameters of ≤7 mm and 261 people with graft diameters of &gt;7 mm. A statistically significant difference was found between the graft diameters of the group that needed revision surgery and the group that did not (p&lt;0.001). A positive relationship was also found between the patient’s height and graft diameter (r=0.168). In this study, it was found that the risk of ACL revision surgery increased by 5.5 times among patients with graft diameters of ≤7 mm. The positive relationship between the patient’s height and graft diameter can make a significant difference in terms of the need for revision surgery.",

    "abstract": "A key component in fast-track total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is early mobilization. Preoperative fasting might cause orthostatic hypotension and -intolerance which both can interfere with early mobilization. It was hypothesized that consuming a carbohydrate drink 2-3 hours prior to surgery is a viable option to reduce orthostatic hypotension, and as a result, improve rehabilitation. In this randomized controlled trial, all consecutive unilateral primary TKA patients were reviewed for eligibility. Exclusion criteria were American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class above 3, older than 80 years of age, Diabetes Mellitus, and an insufficient comment of Dutch language. Patients were distributed in two groups. The control group was allowed to eat till 6 hours and drink clear fluids till 2 hours before surgery (standard treatment). The intervention group consumed, additionally to the standard treatment, a carbohydrate drink 2-3 hours before surgery. Blood pressure was measured both lying and standing as a measure for orthostatic hypotension during first time postoperative mobilization on day of surgery. A total of 168 patients were included. Prevalence of orthostatic hypotension in the control- and intervention group was 24 patients (34%) and 14 patients (19%) respectively, (p=0.05). Prevalence of orthostatic intolerance was 13 patients (19%) in the control group and 9 patients (13%) in the intervention group (p=0.32). No drink related adverse events occurred. In conclusion, taking a carbohydrate drink 2-3 hours before TKA significantly lowers the number of patients with orthostatic hypotension in early mobilization. However, the clinical relevance of the carbohydrate drink has to be studied further.",

Surgeons believe this helps improve visualisation and reduce operative time. However, tourniquet use has been associated with many complications including increased pain, neurovascular injury, venous thromboembolism, haematoma formation, and others. In this article, we describe a method allowing comparable arthroscopic visualisation to be achieved without the aid of a tourniquet for ACLR procedures. The literature evidence relating to this technique as well as tourniquet use for ACLR is also reviewed. Tourniquet-less ACLR can be achieved through the combined application of hypotensive anaesthesia, intravenous tranexamic acid, and use of adrenaline-supplemented irrigation fluid and local anaesthetic. Performing ACLR without a tourniquet avoids the risks associated with its use and reduces the severity of post-operative haemarthrosis which may contribute to the patient’s pain and limit their ability to perform their rehabilitation exercises.",

The objective of this retrospective observational study was to calculate the incidence of secondary displacement after osteosynthesis of these fractures and to identify possible risk factors. 185 cases were reviewed and all osteosynthesized fractures between January 2008 and December 2016 were included. Data collected included age, sex, body mass index, alcohol and tobacco use, bone mineral density of the proximal humerus, fracture type, initial displacement, management time, type of treatment, surgeon’s experience and expertise, and postoperative reduction quality. A radiographic follow-up was done at least 3 months following the fracture (until consolidation). The definition of secondary displacement was: varus/valgus displacement &gt;10°, tuberosity translation &gt;5 mm, articular effraction or material breakage. 53 secondary displacements were found, with an incidence of 28.6%. Seventy-two percent were diagnosed at the first follow-up visit, which occurred at an average of 29 days postoperatively. Among all factors studied, only two were statistically significant for secondary displacement: 1) low proximal humeral bone density (defined by a Tingart index &lt;4) appears to be a risk factor, with a calculated relative risk of 2.71 (p = 0.04); and 2) the operator’s specialization in the upper limb appears to be a protective factor, with a relative risk of 0.27 (p = 0.01). A similar high incidence of complications after osteosynthesis of the proximal humerus is found in the literature, confirming the difficulty in managing these fractures. More attention should be given to patients with low bone density.",

    "abstract": "Complete distal biceps tendon ruptures are relatively uncommon. Conservative treatment may result in persistent pain and weakness. Therefore, surgical repair is usually indicated in order to restore strength. Different surgical techniques and fixation methods have been described. The most reported complications after surgery are iatrogenic nerve damage, heterotopic ossification (HO) and re-rupture. Heterotopic ossification can be variable in size. Significant HO can limit range of motion while minor HO often remains asymptomatic. The overall presence of HO is likely underreported in literature, as imaging is reserved for symptomatic patients. The purpose of this study is to report the prevalence and clinical implications of heterotopic ossification after surgical repair of the distal biceps tendon. This retrospective study assessed the prevalence and clinical relevance of postoperative HO after distal biceps tendon repair. CT-scans were used to evaluate size and location of the HO. VAS scores, DASH scores, MEPI, and range of motion (ROM) were assessed to evaluate pain, patient satisfaction and elbow function. HO was observed on CT images of 19 out of 35 patients (54%). The use of interference screws, timing of surgery after rupture and timing of radiographic assessment postoperatively did not influence the prevalence of HO. The presence of HO had no statistically significant impact on the VAS scores, ROM measurements and MEPI and DASH scores. According to our findings, the overall incidence of HO is higher than previously reported but there are no differences in clinical outcomes when compared to patients without HO.",

This two-part study aims to quantify the female workforce in orthopedic surgery in Belgium and assess the presence of unconscious biases among active orthopedic surgeons. Epidemiological data from national registries, orthopedic societies and universities in Belgium were analyzed. This included data on medical students, residents, active orthopedic surgeons and awards given by a Belgian orthopedic society. Additionally, a questionnaire was administered to Belgian orthopedic surgeons, assessing their perceptions of gender stereotypes and potential unconscious biases. 90 participants responded with 70% of men and mean age was 36 years old. The data revealed that 12% of active orthopedic surgeons in Belgium were women in 2020. However, the representation f women was higher among residents, with a thirty percent distribution. In one university, women had a slightly higher chance of getting accepted in the orthopedic training then men. The questionnaire results indicated the presence of unconscious bias regarding subspecialties, which aligned with the actual distribution. Women tend to specialize more in upper limb surgery and pediatrics while men focus more frequently on lower limb surgery. The findings highlight the need for addressing the underrepresentation of women in orthopedic surgery and traumatology in Belgium. If the current rate of progress continues, it is projected that 30% of active orthopedic surgeons will be female by the year 2074. Identifying and addressing factors contributing to the underrepresentation, such as lack of mentorship, unconscious biases, visibility issues, and discrimination, is crucial for empowering future female orthopedic surgeons and fostering diversity in the field. Collaboration among European universities and orthopedic societies can play a vital role in reducing barriers and promoting gender equality in orthopedic surgery and traumatology.",

    "abstract": "Fractures of the phalanges may result in a challenging complication known as malrotation, which can adversely affect the functionality of the fingers during flexion, leading to scissoring. The standard surgical approach for correcting this condition involves open corrective osteotomy and derotation, often at the level of the metacarpal, which includes the use of different techniques for osteotomy and fixation. However, postoperative complications such as finger stiffness and hardware irritation are common. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel and minimally invasive corrective osteotomy technique for malunited proximal phalanx fractures with rotational malalignment, which offers several advantages, such as accelerated rehabilitation and no prominent hardware.",

The addition of adhesive strips over the subcuticular suture appears to be based on anecdotal, rather than experimental evidence. We performed a prospective study to compare the postoperative wound complications of combination closure with subcuticular closure alone. The wounds of 60 consecutive patients undergoing foot surgery were assessed clinically for wound complications at one week postoperatively. Patients who had a combined closure were more likely to develop wound complications. They were also twice as likely to return to clinic for a further wound check. The addition of adhesive strips to such a closure appears to offer no clinical benefit, and can be detrimental to wound healing. We recommend meticulous closure of surgical wounds with continuous, absorbable, subcuticular suture without adhesive strips, for an optimal outcome.",

All complications, during and after surgery, were noted with special emphasis on incidence of dislocation and factors contributing to it. The results were gratifying and were comparable with major series of total hip replacement via the posterior approach. No patient had a dislocation. One hundred and five patients (89%) had no or minimal pain after the surgery. Eighty-six patients (73%) were mobilising without a stick. There were no major intra-operative complications and most (84%) patients rated the operation 'very good' at one year follow-up.

    "abstract": "Knee dislocation is an infrequent complication after rotating hinge total knee arthroplasty (RHTKA). The aim of the present study was to describe our experience with dislocating RHTKA in a consecutive prospective large series, its occurrence rate, causative mechanisms and to perform a review of available literature. In total, six dislocations were observed in 303 RHTKA procedures (NexGen RHK, ZimmerBiomet, Warsaw, Indiana, US) at a mean of 10 (range, 2 - 24) months after surgery. This results in a 2% dislocation rate, which is lower than the 3.1% cumulative rate reported earlier in literature. Men and women were distributed equally, with a mean age of 56 years old. The indication for RHTKA among the six dislocations was revision in 4 cases and primary arthroplasty for the other 2 cases. Analysis revealed that the main mechanism of hinge dislocation was forced knee flexion with concomitant extensor mechanism insufficiency (4/6 cases). The second cause was unscrewing of the locking pin (2/6 cases). This is probably caused by the screw home mechanism that results in a counterclockwise torque -and therefore a loosening- effect on locking bolts, specifically in right-sided RHTKA. Obesity probably predisposes to hinge dislocation since 83% of patients in this series were obese (BMI, range 34 to 52). The findings of this study suggest that dislocation of RHTKA is a rare complication that could happen to obsese patients without an adequate extensor mechanism. Level of evidence : IV.",

Since June 2017, a modification to the Latarjet procedure has been used in the treatment of posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability. The pectoralis minor insertion and a part of the conjoint tendon is retained on its anatomical position, by harvesting only the lateral part of the coracoid. We retrospectively enrolled the first 9 consecutively treated shoulders with a minimum of 6 months follow up and recorded scapulothoracic position and scapulothoracic motion, patient satisfaction, Oxford score, and Short Form (SF)-36. All patients underwent a radiographic review at final follow up. No scapular dyskinesis was observed at final follow- up. Radiographies consistently showed a bony spur at the original osteotomy site, suggesting a functional attachment of the pectoralis minor tendon to the scapula. Harvesting only the lateral part of the coracoid is technically feasible, efficient in treating anterior shoulder instability and avoids scapular dyskinesis.

    "abstract": "The number of revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgeries has increased over the years and it is expected that its number will keep rising. Most frequent reasons for revision are known to be aseptic loosening, infection, instability, periprosthetic frac- ture, arthrofibrosis and component malposition. The influence of the indication for revision on the outcome scores is not fully understood. Therefore, this work will evaluate and review the existing literature regarding outcome scores after revision TKA surgery. We conducted a sensitive and comprehensive search for published and unpublished studies relevant to the review question. We restricted our search to English studies published between January 2008 and December 2018. Our systematic review was done according to PRISMA guidelines. We withheld 19 studies (1419 knees) for inclusion. Of these, 9 papers reported outcome scores after TKA revision for aseptic loosening, 10 reported on revision for instability, 10 reported on stiffness or arthrofibrosis and 4 papers reported on component malposition. Although we found some papers suggesting that there is no difference in postoperative outcome scores depending on the aetiology of revision surgery, the majority of the included studies suggest differently. This review suggests there is a tendency for relative higher outcome scores after revision for aseptic loosening. Revision for malrotation might give comparable postoperative outcome scores and satisfaction ratios. Revision for instability tends to give lower postoperative outcome scores than aseptic loosening, although certain subgroups of instability show comparable results. Lowest postoperative scores might be found after revision for stiffness and arthrofibrosis.",

This study evaluates safety and accuracy of the endoscopic technique. Sixteen fresh-frozen paired cadaveric upper extremities were used. The distal biceps tendons were cut and then repaired with the classic single incision bone button technique. Eight were done through an open technique, and eight were repaired endoscopically. Safety and accuracy were assessed by comparing the distance of the repair to neurovascular structures as well as the distance of the bone tunnel to the native biceps insertion. Paired t-tests were used to compare measurements. Significance level was set at p=0.05. There were no significant differences between the open and endoscopic groups, for any of the anatomic measurements. The ulnar artery was the closest neurovascular structure to the tunnel, with an average of 1 mm. The radial and recurrent radial arteries were located at 3 and 19 mm respectively. The median nerve was an average 10 mm from the tunnel, and both the SBRN and PIN at 12 mm. The distance between the PIN and the endobutton at the posterior side of the radius was an average 6 mm. There were no significant differences in variance between both groups related to the placement of the tunnel relative to the native biceps insertion. The single incision endoscopic-assisted technique of distal biceps repair can be performed consistently and with no added risk to neurovascular structures when compared to the classic open technique.",

Six knees (4%) were infected. The survival time from implantation averaged 4.3 years, and the followup was 7 to 13 years for the Geomedic (mean 9.7) and 6 to 9 years for the Attenborough (mean 6.7). Mechanical problems were related to loosening of the tibial and femoral components, and revision was required for this reason. The success rate of the revision was 50% at 5.4 years; the less invasive the primary operation, the simpler the revision. Constrained prostheses must be used when ligaments are not intact. In case of infection, removal of the implants is not always necessary.",

    "abstract": "Treatment of fractures of the femoral neck by closed reduction and internal fixation results in a high incidence of complications, and often requires secondary total hip arthroplasty. We retrospectively studied 31 patients who underwent a Stanmore (Howmedica®) total hip arthroplasty performed five months (median) after osteosynthesis. The most common indications were: failure of fixation (n = 14), osteonecrosis (n = 9) and secondary osteoarthritis (n = 6). Eight patients had a maximum follow-up of 12 months; the median follow-up was 30 months in the remaining group of 23 patients. Although one patient had radiographical signs of femoral loosening, none of the patients studied needed revision of the total hip arthroplasty. Using the Merle d'Aubigne scoring system, we found excellent results in 94% of the cases. Despite the short-term follow-up and the small number of patients, we conclude that the Stanmore THA was a satisfactory salvage procedure after failure of internal fixation for femoral neck fracture.",

So effective joint preserving surgeries is essential to prevent or even delay the onset of osteoarthritis for these group of patients. This study aims to critically appraise and evaluate the evidence for the results and effectiveness of femoral condyle resurfacing (HemiCAP/ UniCAP) in treatment of patients with focal femoral condyle cartilage defect. Using the search terms : HemiCAP, UniCAP, Episurf, focal, femoral, condyle, inlay and resur-facing, we reviewed the PubMed and EMBASE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) to find any articles published up to March 2020. The short term follow-up of the HemiCAP shows (6.74 %) revision rate. However, 29.13 % loss of follow up let us consider these results with caution especially if the revision rate progressively increased with time to 19.3 % in 5-7 years with no enough evidence for the long term results except the data from the Australian Joint Registry 2018, where the cumulative revision rate was 40.6 % (33.5, 48.4) at ten years. The UniCAP that used for defect more than 4 cm 2 has a high revision rate (53.66 %) which is considered unacceptable revision rate in com-parison to another similar prosthesis such as Uni-Knee Arthroplasty (UKA). The evidence from published studies and our meta- analysis suggests that partial resurfacing of the femoral condyle (HemiCAP) doesn’t support its usage as a tool to treat the focal cartilage defect in middle- aged patients. The UniCAP as femoral condyle resurfacing has very high revision rate at 5-7 years (53.66 %) which make us recommend against its usage.",

This systematic review aims to provide an up-to-date evaluation of the literature, including assessment of a further three studies not analysed in previous reviews. In doing so, this is the first systematic review to include the reliability among non-spine subspecialty professionals and to document the wide variety between reliability across studies, particularly with regard to sub-type classification. Relevant studies were found via a systematic search of PubMed, EBESCO, Cochrane and Web of Science. Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted in line with Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. Twelve articles assessing the reliability of ATLICS were included in this review. The overall inter-observer reliability varied from fair to substantial, but the three additional studies in this review, compared to previous reviews, presented on average only fair reliability. The greatest variation of results was seen in A1 and B3 subtypes. Least reliably classified on average was A4 subtype. This systematic review concludes that ATLICS is reliable for the majority of injuries, but the variability within subtypes suggests the need for further research in assessing the needs of users in order to increase familiarity with ATLICS or perhaps the necessity to include more subtype-specific criteria into the system. Further research is also recommended on the reliability of modifiers, neurological classification and the application of ATLICS in a paediatric context.",

This study provides quantitative evidence in support of the beneficial effect of FDO after long term follow up. Retrospective clinical and kinematic evaluation of 31 CP patients (55 operated limbs) pre-, 1 and 3 years postoperatively after proximal FDO was conducted for a minimal follow-up of 3 years. This group con- sisted of 20 men and 11 women, aged 10.68±3.31 years at the time of surgery. Minimum follow up was 3 years (3.16±0.53 years), with 22 patients (38 operated limbs) having an additional follow up at 5 years (5.02±0.49 years). Age at FU3 and FU5 was 14.06±3.52 years and 15.39±3.08 years respectively. A set of clinical and kinematic parameters were ana- lyzed and showed a significant correction of mean hip rotation and femoral anteversion after FDO. Further plotting of individual data comparing 3 or 5 year postoperative values to 1 year postoperative values showed no further significant changes, indicating sustained correction of internally rotted gait until end of our follow up. Plotting mean hip rotation in stance as well as kinematic knee parameters according to age grouped cohorts could not show age at time of surgery to be a significant factor in recurrence of internally rotated gait or preoperative disturbances of knee motion in the sagittal plane. This study provides quantitative evidence on the beneficial effect of FDO, a surgical technique to improve internally rotated gait in cerebral palsy patients with spastic diplegia. Pre- and postoperative clinical and kinematic parameters are compared and results are discussed. Minimum follow up was 3 years with a mean follow up of 4.65±0.83 years. The effect of age at time of surgery on recurrence and kinematic parameters were studied.",

Only a few cases have been reported so far and majority of them have been reported to have unilateral hip involvement. We retrospectively reviewed clinical-radiological data of 10 patients (12 hips) with SSF complicating ONFH. All of them underwent uncemented total hip arthroplasty. All the available publications in the English language based medical literature were critically reviewed and results were summarized. The median age of presentation was 32 years (range : 24 years to 61 years). They were followed up for a mean duration of 25 months (range : 12 months to 59 months). The most common risk factor was corticosteroid consumption (7 out of 10 patients). All except one (modified Ficat and Arlet stage II) belonged to advanced stage of ONFH {stage III 3 patients (3 hips), stage IV 6 patients (8 hips)}. The mean time lag of ONFH to presentation was 22.3 months (range : 5 months to 60 months), and SSF to presentation was 13.8 days (range : 1 day to 28 days). Mean pre- operative Harris Hip Score was 10.8 (range : 8 to 14), which improved to 93 (range : 91 to 96) after total hip arthroplasty when last followed up (p&lt;0.05). Corticosteroids induced ONFH has a propensity to develop SSF. This entity should find a place in existing classification system.",

Supracondylar humerus fractures (SHFs) comprise the majority of fracture surgeries in the pediatric age range. We hypothesized that ADHD symptoms would be present in children with SHFs, and this characteristic trauma may be associated with an ADHD diagnosis. Thus, we compared the ADHD symptoms of children with and without SHFs. Further, we compared the trauma characteristics, gender, proneness to injury, and presence of prior trauma history of children diagnosed with and without ADHD. We recruited 41 children who were admitted to emergency service with an SHF and 41 age- and gender-matched children without a fracture history. A semi-structured diagnostic inter- view and a Swanson Nolan Pelham questionnaire were used to obtain data about ADHD symptoms. A clinical intake form was utilized for further clinical data. ADHD symptoms were significantly higher in the fracture group ; male gender, parent- reported proneness to injury, and prior history of trauma were significantly associated with ADHD. Orthopedic surgeons may provide early detection of ADHD by using screening tools or asking questions to caregivers and making referrals when needed. This may lead to prevention of further injuries.",

The aim of the study was to analyse the value of cementing the cervicocephalic blade during osteosynthesis with a proximal femoral nail. A prospective bicentric comparative study was con- ducted. Patients over 90 years of age with PTF were included. Centre A used a PFNA (Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation) nail without blade cementing and Centre B used the same nail with blade cementing. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of disassembly of the osteosynthesis requiring revision surgery. Secondary endpoints were functional out- come (resumption of walking), postoperative pain and duration of surgery. Sixty-four patients were included in Centre A and 23 patients were included in Centre B. Mean age, gender, functional abilities before fracture, fracture type and tip-apex distance were comparable between the groups. Postoperative pain and duration of surgery did not show significant differences between the groups. Four patients operated on with an uncemented PFNA (6.25%) and one patient operated on with a cemented PFNA nail (4.35%) showed early dismantling. The rate of patients returning to walking was significantly higher in the cemented group (p=0.00005). No significant differences in the rate of dismantling were observed between the two groups. However, the group operated on with a cemented PFNA showed better functional recovery with a significantly higher rate of walking recovery.",

No computed tomography studies in paediatric have assessed the optimal trajectory of ilio- sacral screws to prevent screw malposition. We used pelvic computed tomography from 80 children divided into four groups : females &lt;10 and ≥10 years and males &lt;10 and ≥10 years. A secure triangular corridor parallel to the upper S1 endplate was delineated based on three fixed landmarks. The optimal screw insertion angle was subtended by the horizontal and the line bisecting the secure corridor. Student’s t test was applied to determine whether the optimal screw insertion angle and/or anatomical parameters were associated with age and/or sex. Mean optimal angle was 32.3°±3.6°, 33.8°±4.7°, 30.2°±5.0°, and 30.4°±4.7° in the younger females, younger males, older females, and older males, respectively. The mean optimal angle differed between the two age groups (p=0.004) but not between females and males (p=0.55). Optimal mean screw length was 73.4±9.9 mm. Anatomical spinal canal parameters in the transverse plane varied with age (p=0.02) and with sex in the older children (p=0.008), and those in the sagittal plane varied with sex (p=0.04). Age affected ilio-sacral screw positioning, whereas sex did not. Several anatomical spinal canal parameters varied with age and sex. These results should help to ensure safe and easy ilio-sacral screw placement within a secure corridor.",

Major databases including Pubmed, MEDLINE and Embase were searched for relevant studies and the included studies reference lists were screened for further studies. A total of 6 studies were included in meta-analysis which was undertaken using RevMan software with 95% confidence interval (CI). Compared to control groups, patients who were anticoagulated with DOAC and required operative management of a hip fracture experienced a statistically significant delay to treatment. However independent analysis showed these patients did not experience an increased mortality risk when compared to the control group. While data is limited, treating clinicians should be comforted by these findings as operative manage- ment can be safely delayed to reduce the risk of intraoperative bleeding.",

The aim of this study to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a level 1 Trauma Centre in the Republic of Ireland (ROI). Patients admitted to the Trauma &amp; Orthopaedic (T&amp;O) Department at Cork University Hospital (CUH) and the South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital (SIVUH), and their associated fracture patterns and management, between 01/03/20 and the 15/04/20 were documented and compared to the patient admissions from the same time period one year earlier in 2019. The total number of T&amp;O operations performed decreased by 10.15% (P= 0.03)between the two time periods. The number of paediatric procedures fell by 40.32% (P= 0.15). Adult Distal radius and paediatric elbow fractures (excluding supracondylar fracture) increased by 88% and 13% (P= 0.19), (P= 0.04) respectively. Hip fractures remained the most common fracture-type admitted for surgery. The COVID-19 crisis has to lead to a decrease in the total numbers of trauma surgeries in a major trauma centre in the ROI. This decline is most evident in the number of paediatric and male adult patients presenting with fractures requiring operative management. Interestingly, fractures directly related to solo outdoor activities, such as running or cycling, as well as simple mechanical falls like ankle, distal radius, elbow, and hand fractures all increased. Irish males were more compliant with outdoors restrictions than females.",

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the outcomes and study the complications in patients treated for concomitant ipsilateral acetabular and femoral fractures (type ‘B’ floating hip injuries). This retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary care teaching hospital on patients operated for type B floating hip injuries, who had completed a minimum of one-year follow-up after the surgery and whose complete records were available. Those with floating hip injuries with pelvic fractures were excluded. All patients were operated on the femoral side first, followed by the acetabular side. 34 patients were included ; most of them were young males. A road traffic accident was the most common mode, with a dashboard injury being the most common mechanism of injury. No association between the type of acetabular and femoral fractures was found. The clinical (measured with Harris hip score) and radiological (Matta’s method) outcomes at the latest follow-up were excellent or good in &gt;60% cases and had a significant association with the quality of reduction on the post-operative radiographs. Com- plications were seen in 12 out of the 34 patients. Type B floating hips injuries can be managed well with acceptable short-term results by following a femur first strategy. However, patients must be informed of the possible complications and the probabilities of poorer outcomes when compared to isolated acetabular or femoral fractures.",

The purpose of this paper is to document such a cystic presentation with relatively benign clinico-radiologic course and to review the pertinent literature. A 27-year-old male presented with a pathologic fracture through a radiologically benign appearing solitary bone cyst in the distal tibial metaphysis. The fracture healed on conservative treatment, but the patient presented again a year later with pain and difficulty with weight bearing. Curetting and bone grafting done elsewhere was suggestive of an Ewing's sarcoma, which was later confirmed by a second biopsy. He was treated by standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by wide local excision and reconstruction with an intercalary allograft. At 2 years postoperative follow-up, the patient is without any evidence of local or distant recurrence. Awareness of this atypical presentation is important because it may help in an earlier diagnosis, avoid diagnostic confusion and thus may contribute to improved survival.",

Unexpectedly, the postoperative pulmonary function, measured as an absolute value after one year, was significantly better than the preoperative pulmonary function. Very probably the concave rib osteotomy had allowed expansion of the thoracic cage.

After installing the patient on a different frame, the prone position was well tolerated and the microdiscectomy could be performed without the need to repair the diaphragmatic hernia.",

The surgical procedure reported with the use of the Ilizarov apparatus for partial or total calcaneal OM is aimed to preserve the Hindfoot.We retrospectively reviewed 10 patients which were treated by radical debridement of the infected area, Ilizarov frame application and arthrodesis with bone reconstruction by the Ilizarov apparatus using tibial transport for Hindfoot salvage. The mean age at presentation was 33.5 years (range; 24-57) and the mean follow-up was 5.1 years (range; 2-12).Patients clinical and radiographic data were assessed according to the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle- Hindfoot score.The mean preoperative American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle-Hindfoot Score was 48.3(range; 38-86) while the mean postoperative (AOFAS) was 58.5 (range; 45-73) , p value < 0.01 . Clinically all patients had anatomically stable feet with deformity correction and no signs of infection recurrence.The use of Ilizarov distal tibial bone transport to fill massive hindfoot defects proved to be a reliable method for elimination of infection and reconstruction of large defects without the need for bony or soft tissue plastic procedures. The technique also has the ability to produce a rigid limb fixation following debridement and to fill in massive hindfoot defects due to other etiologies as well.",

    "abstract": "The evidence for the functional outcome of endo- prosthetic replacement (EPR) after tumour resection has been from few cohort studies. A scoping search revealed no systematic review on patient reported outcome measures after EPR around the knee. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the functional outcome of distal femoral and proximal tibial EPR after tumour resection. A systematic review was conducted using the PRISMA guidelines. The search identified 2560 articles from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Web of Science. 36 studies satisfying the selection criteria were included for data synthesis. Pooled analysis was performed for homogenous studies. Narrative synthesis was performed for all the studies due to heterogeneity in methodological and statistical analysis. Amongst the overall patient population of 2930, mean ages ranged from 18-66 years and the mean follow up periods in the studies ranged from 12 - 180 months. The weighted mean functional outcome was similar for patients who had DFEPR and PTEPR. The functional outcome scores of Rotating Hinge Knee implants (RHK) were significantly greater than that for Fixed Hinge Knee implants (FHK). The weighted mean functional outcome scores were higher after cemented fixation and after primary EPR procedures. The current evidence suggests that functional out- come after EPR in the knee is good, and RHK implants are better than FHK implants. Functional outcome after primary EPR was significantly better than following revision EPR, and this underscores the importance of minimising complications at the primary surgery.",

Complications like restricted shoulder range of motion and malunion of the proximal shaft fractures have however been reported. We conducted a retrospective chart re- view of patients treated with the extension casting method over a period of 16 years. Topographically, Garnavos P, M, D, PM and MD fractures and morphologically Simple, Complex and Intermediate fractures were included. Between 2003 and 2019, 74 patients were treated with extension casting. The fractures united at a mean of 10 weeks and there was no case of non-union. Humerus is one of the bones where conservative methodology is still very pertinent. Extension casting gives reproducible and good results. It also addresses patient comfort issues to a considerable extent by allowing shoulder motion and easier maintenance of personal hygiene.",

Unlike the classical Ponseti method, patients underwent a mini-open Achilles tenotomy before the first cast. 6-month follow-up of the foot deformities were assessed using Dimeglio classification clinically and lateral talocalcaneal and tibiocalcaneal angles radiologically. There were 20 male and 6 female patients with the median age of 14 days (4-37 days) and 11 bilateral and 15 unilateral deformities. The average follow-up period was 7 months (6-12 months). The mean Dimeglio scores before the Achilles tenotomy and Dimeglio score at the 6 th month follow-up were 14 (11-16) and 4 (4-6) for the right feet, 13 (10-16) and 4 (4-6) for the left feet respectively. The mean number of casting was 3.8 ± 0.4 for right feet and 3.7 ± 0.4 for left feet. The mean talocalcaneal angle was 24 ± 8.2 degrees for the right feet and 27 ± 8.2 degrees for the left feet. The mean tibiocalcaneal angle was 69 ± 12 for the right feet and 72 ± 14 degrees for the left feet. Early Achilles tenotomy can decrease the total number of cast for deformity correction in Ponseti method and provide good clinical and radiological outcomes at 6 th month follow-up in severe PEV deformities according to Dimeglio classification.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of Dupuytren disease (DD) continues to evolve. New insights in risk factors for recurrence and new treatment modalities have changed the management strategies for DD over the past decades. However, several differences may remain between these insights and their clinical application. The current tendencies in management of Dupuytren disease, were investigated in a web-based survey. The survey was sent to all members of the Belgian Hand Group, the professional organisation of hand surgeons in Belgium. The participants indicated their preferred treatment for clinical cases and answered questions on the use and timing of splinting, physiotherapy, medication and adapting the management depending on fibrosis diathesis. These findings were compared to recommendations found in the literature. Forty out of 135 surveyed members of the Belgian Hand Group completed the survey and 7 responded incom- pletely, yielding a response rate of 35% for most questions. This is comparable to similar studies. There appeared to be still room for debate on surgical techniques for difficult cases. CCH use increased since reimbursement became available in Belgium, mainly due to satisfying clinical results for patient and surgeon. The survey demonstrated a wide variety in pre- and postoperative splinting protocols, but consensus existed with the literature on postoperative night-time application of orthoses for 7 to 12 weeks.",

The wide awake local anesthesia no tourniquet (WALANT) technique is an local anesthetic method and it has been gaining popularity in orthopedic surgery in recent years. Our aim is to compare the efficacy of the WALANT and the PFNB techniques in pain management. This prospective study included 40 patients with lateral malleolar and medial malleolar fractures. The first group was anesthetized using the WALANT technique; in the second group, PFNB was performed. All patients were evaluated for intrasurgical bleeding amounts, mean arterial pressure, surgery time and VAS scores for presurgical pain, pain during the local anesthetic injection sequence, mean intrasurgical pain, mean postsurgical pain. A total of 40 patients in both groups were successfully operated on with the WALANT and the PFNB techniques. When the two groups were compared, statistically significant differences were observed for mean intrasurgical VAS (p = 0.033), mean postsurgical VAS (p = 0.038) and intrasurgical bleeding (p = 0.006). No significant difference was found in pain scores during anesthetic injection (p = 0.529), mean arterial pressure (p = 0.583) and surgery time (p = 0.277). The PFNB technique is more successful in pain management in the treatment of the unimalleolar fractures. Intrasurgical bleeding amounts were less detected in the WALANT tech- nique. The both techniques are a reliable and suitable anesthetic method in the surgical treatment of uni- malleolar fractures.",

The aim of the study is to determine if intraoperative coronal alignment during robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty correlates with radiographic alignment. We prospectively compared the pre- and postoperative limb alignment values measured on long leg standing radiographs with intraoperative robotic-assisted measurements for 100 patients who underwent primary total knee arthroplasty. Two-tailed bivariate Pearson correla- tions were performed to evaluate the strength of the association between radiographic and robotic- assisted alignment. The intraclass correlation coeffi- cient (ICC) was used to estimate interrater reliability. There was a male/female ratio of 1.16 and the mean age was 67 years (range 42-88). Robotic-assisted measurements slightly overestimated the degree of varus relative to radiographs. Radiographic and robo- tic-assisted measurements were strongly correlated (r = 0.915, p &amp;lt; 0.001) preoperatively, with a difference of 1.6 &amp;plusmn; 3.2&amp;deg;.

Therefore, the presence of kinesiophobia is essential for the success of the treatment. This study was planned to investigate the effects of kinesiophobia on Spatio-temporal parameters in patients who underwent unilateral TKA surgery. This study was a prospective and cross-sectional study. Seventy patients with TKA were assessed preoperatively in the 1st week (Pre1W) and post- operatively in the 3rd month (Post3M) and 12th month (Post12M). Spatiotemporal parameters were assessed using the Win-Track platform (Medicapteurs Technology, France). The Tampa kinesiophobia scale and Lequesne index were evaluated in all individuals. A significant relationship was found between the Pre1W, Post3M, and Post12M periods and Lequesne Index scores (p&lt;0.01), and this relationship was in favor of improvement. In the Post3M period, kinesiophobia increased compared to the Pre1W period, and kinesiophobia decreased effectively in the Post12M period (p&lt;0.01). The effect of kine-siophobia was evident in the first postoperative period. In the correlation analyses between spatiotemporal para- meters and kinesiophobia, significant negative correlations were observed (p&lt;0.01) in the early postoperative period (Post3M). Evaluating the effectiveness of kinesiophobia on Spatio-temporal parameters at different time intervals before and after TKA surgery may be necessary for the treatment process.",

The patient was a 1-year-old boy with recurrent torticollis, followed by a painless swelling over the right temporal bone. The diagnosis was confirmed by an open biopsy of the calvarial lesion. As LCH is a very rare cause of torticollis it was not considered in the initial differential by the primary care physicians and the diagnosis was delayed about 4 months. The patient received chemotherapy with steroids and etoposide for 52 weeks. He showed complete regression of the sign and imaging tests at the end of treatment were normal. No relapse of symptoms occurred during a follow-up period of 2 years.

The most important differential diagnosis is monostotic fibrous dysplasia, which is radiologically similar but without woven bone rimmed by active osteoblasts like ossifying fibroma on histological examination. No epitheloid cells are found as in adamantinoma. We report the case of a 45-year-old woman who had a 12-month history of pain and slight swelling. Radiographs showed a multilocular radiolucent lesion with sclerotic rim in the proximal tibia. The lesion was curetted and the defect was packed with bone graft and acrylic cement. Microscopic examination showed active osteoblasts rimming the irregulary woven bone. One-year follow-up showed good functional recovery without recurrence of the lesion.",

    "abstract": "Desmoid tumours are dense fibroblastic tumours occurring in any mesenchymal tissue at the site of a fascia. It is usual to distinguish extra-abdominal and abdominal forms, although they are microscopically similar. The extra-abdominal variety is also called aggressive fibromatosis (AF). Abdominal desmoid involves either the abdominal wall, particularly the lower part of the rectus abdominis muscle, or the abdominal cavity where it arises in the mesentery or from any muscular structure. The abdominal variety tends to occur more frequently in women of child-bearing age. This review will only focus on the extra-abdominal variety. AF is a tumour with many contrasts: it is a purely benign process but it may infiltrate vital structures and cause severe morbidity. The growth potential can be high in some cases, with early recurrence, whereas spontaneous regression can be observed in others. Owing to such a disconcerting tumoral behaviour, the treatment has been a matter for debate and is the subject of this article.",

The intervertebral disc is indeed the main structure that opposes the anteriorly directed shear forces. Of course, the disc degeneration might also be a consequence, rather than a cause of the slip. The authors describe an unusual case of progression of spondylolysis to spondylolisthesis in an adult, without any disc degeneration. They are not aware of a similar case in the literature. In 1999, an aircraft engineer with known asymptomatic spondylolysis was involved in a low impact motorcycle accident, after which a Grade I spondylolisthesis L4 was diagnosed. There was no predisposing disc space narrowing at any vertebral level. There may have been a certain degree of microscopic disc degeneration L4L5, a possibility which was confirmed by the development of a disc hernia L4L5, seven years after trauma. This case illustrates the potential for progression of spondylolysis to spondylolisthesis in an adult, without radiographical signs of disc degeneration at any level. The minimal trauma might have played a role. The authors recommend that patients with known spondylolysis who sustain acute exacerbation of their back pain should have standing radiographs.",

    "abstract": "In an attempt to reduce health care expenses, regulated competition between health care providers has been introduced in The Netherlands. As for total hip and knee arthroplasties, health care providers have to publish their prices to make them available for the insurance companies and the public. Eventually, competition between health care providers should result in optimal care for lower prices. The purpose of this study was to define the patients' consciousness of the overall costs and specialist's fee for a total knee arthroplasty. Thirty-nine patients with a recent total knee arthroplasty were asked to estimate the total costs and the surgeon's fee of this procedure. The average overall cost of a total knee arthroplasty in our hospital was Euro 11.500. The orthopaedic surgeon's fee represents a non-negotiable 5% of these total costs. The mean estimate of the overall costs of a total knee arthroplasty by the patients was Euro 10.000 (range: Euro 600 to Euro 55.000). Only 26% of the patients (n = 10) gave an estimate within the accepted correct range of Euro 8.500 to Euro 14.500. The surgeon's fee was estimated at 32% (range: 5% to 75%) of the total costs and a majority reckoned the actual fraction of 5% was low. Patients have a poor notion of the overall costs of a total knee arthroplasty and strongly overestimate the specialist's fee. Whether the introduction of budget competition in health care may actually result in a decrease in health care costs remains to be seen.",

Descriptive study of the creation process involving 19 patients aged 2 to 14 years for whom a restraint was placed between April 2018 and November 2018. This was mainly post-traumatic pathology (12) and children having a clubfoot (7). This type of restraint has the following characteristics : use of recyclable material ; lightness ; ventilation ; visibility of the underlying skin tissue and its hydro-compatibility. The major limitations remaining are production time and printing errors. The emergence of 3D printing, allows us to extend its application to the medical world. When the therapeutic effectiveness of a restraint is achieved, quality of life becomes the main selection criterion. Based on observations already made in the past, we were able to develop a model that combines the advantages of the different approaches. New 3D printing technologies allow the creation of restraint devices with many advantages and customized adaptation possibilities.",

Information of fourteen patients, 6 men and 8 women with a mean age of 61 years, was collected before and after total wrist arthroplasty (Universal 2 prosthesis, Integra) carried out by a single surgeon. Pre-operative mobility was determined by range of motion and compared to post- operative range of motion. Post-operative function was determined using the DASH (The disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand) score and the PRWE (patient-rated wrist evaluation and grip strength) score. Grip force between the operated and non- operated hand were compared postoperatively. Three patients experienced complications. Range of motion improved post-operatively, although not significantly, due to an increase in palmar flexion. The mean DASH score was 20% and the mean total PRWE was 54%. This study shows that total wrist arthroplasty, using the Universal 2 wrist prosthesis, gives reasonable results (survival rate 84%) by decreasing pain while preserving range of motion in patients with degenerative osteoarthritis of the wrist after 5 years. However the 10-year survival rate decreases steeply to an unsatisfying 35%.",

Templating in THA is essential for accurately predicting the optimal size of the implants required. It also reduces the risk of potential complications. To check the reproducibility of our preoperative planning, to compare the accuracy of templating between orthopedic surgeon (OS), orthopedic resident (OR) and data manager (DM), to determine the learning curve between the different planners and to evaluate the effect of body mass index impact on digital templating for THA. One hundred uncemented Corail ® Hip System using a ceramic on ceramic bearing surface were included into the study. The software used for templating was IMPAX-Orthopaedic-Tools. A calibration marker (28-mm ball) was used for calibration. All the anteroposterior pelvis radiographs were planned by three participants (OS, OR, DM). We systematically collected the precisely planned size measurements as well as the variation by 1 or 2 sizes of prostheses. At +/- 1 size, we did not find any significant difference between the participants with respectively 94%, 96% and 93% concordance for the cup, 88%, 90% and 90% for the stem and 85%, 84% and 83% for the neck. Our preoperative templating was accurate in predicting the required implant size and results were similar to those available in the literature. We did not find any difference between the planners and we were unable to objectivate a learning curve period. We conclude that this essential part of the planning procedure can be performed by the surgeon himself or an orthopedic resident or a data manager who has anatomical knowledge if the surgeon is unable to perform templating himself.",

Twenty-eight patients underwent hemiarthroplasty for intracapusular fracture and 52 underwent Dynamic Hip Screw fixation for extracapsular femoral neck fracture. The mean blood drainage in the postoperative period and the mean drop in haemoglobin level was higher in the DHS group as compared to the hemiarthroplasty group. Mean drainage in the first 6 postoperative hours was 150 ml (range: 10-450 ml) in the DHS group, versus 50 ml in the hemiarthroplasty group (range: 10-100 ml). Out of 52 cases of the dynamic hip screw fixation group, only 10 patients received autologous blood transfusion (19%), among which the drains collected more than 150 ml in only 4 (7%). The blood drainage in this group occurred in the first 6 hours only. Supplementary cross matched bank blood was transfused to patients in the DHS group (8%). Among 28 patients in the hemiarthroplasty group, only 6 patients received autologous blood reperfusion (21%), among which the drains collected more than 150 ml in only 4 (14%). Overall, only six patients out of 28 in the hemiarthroplasty and 10 out 52 in the DHS group had enough blood in their drains to warrant re-perfusion. We conclude that the routine use of Bellovac drains after femoral neck fracture surgery is not necessary and is not cost effective.",

Patients with anterolateral bowing of the tibia are usually treated with an ankle-foot orthosis until the deformity is improved. There is no documentation that an orthosis can prevent the fracture or correct the deformity, and if the deformity is not corrected, it will result in different mechanical problems. In this study, 6 legs in 6 patients with anterolateral bowing of the tibia with a narrow sclerotic medullary canal (Crawford type II) were treated using Ilizarov's method. The average age was 6.8 years. All patients underwent correction of the anterolateral bowing by excision of the affected part. If the gap was less than 4 cm, acute shortening followed by bone lengthening was done. If the gap was more than 4 cm, bone transport was preferred. The mean duration of follow-up was 3.2 years. The anterolateral bowing was corrected in all patients. Complications such as pin track infection, premature consolidation and delayed union at the docking site were encountered. We believe that Ilizarov's method offers a more efficient solution for this type of deformity than prophylactic orthotic treatment or prophylactic bypass bone graft.",

In an attempt to evaluate any potential benefits phenytoin may have on fracture healing, a prospective study was undertaken combining histology, histomorphometry and radiology, in which the effects of locally administered phenytoin were analysed. Twenty-four Wistar strain rats of 8-9 months age were assigned into two groups of 12 each (matched for age, sex and weight). In the study group, phenytoin 20 mg/kg was administered through a 24 gauge needle directly on to the fracture site every 72 hours, while in the control group an equivalent volume of normal saline was administered at similar intervals. At 28 days radiographic and histological analysis was done, the scoring for which did not show any statistical difference between the control and test animals. Histomorphometric analysis of the callus however, showed that the total periosteal callus on either side of the central bridging callus was mineralised to a greater extent in the phenytoin group animals as compared to the control group animals (p = 0.011). After analysing our data, we concluded that phenytoin does have an influence in fracture healing, albeit small, which is primarily on the hard callus region. The hard callus region is the high oxygen tension region and the first region to differentiate. It appears that the effect of phenytoin is probably exerted at the early mesenchymal differentiation stage. However our preliminary work shows that the effect is small and it is not justifiable at this stage to advocate the use of phenytoin clinically to augment fracture healing.",

Therefore, it is indispensable for orthopaedic surgeons to spot the potential areas of quality improvement. Evaluating the efficacy of the different ways of skin closure is an unacknowledged topic. We performed this study following both the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- analyses Statement (PRISMA) and the Cochrane Handbook for systematic reviews and meta-analysis. Articles were from any country, written in any language. We included all randomised control trials and retrospective cohort studies undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty who either received staples or subcuticular sutures for skin closure. The primary outcome was the incidence of wound infection. Secondary outcomes included length of stay (LOS), time to skin closure, total cost, and patient’s satisfaction. We included five studies in our cumulative meta- analysis. We conducted them using Review Manager V.5.0. We computed the risk ratio as a measure of the treatment effect, taking into account heterogeneity. We used Random-effect models. Primary skin closure with subcuticular sutures had insignificant marginal advantages for wound infections, LOS, and wound oozing. On the contrary, staples were more cost- effective and had less time for closure with higher patient’s satisfaction. Except for closure time and patient satisfaction , no significant difference between the two groups. The use of staples after THA may have several slight clinical advantages over the subcuticular sutures. However, owing to the complexities associated with wound closure, future clinical and laboratory studies assessing their complication outlines must be examined before an optimum technique can be determined.",

Dislocation is a concern(2-10%). Dual mobility cups have been suggested to address this complication. Our study sets out to compare dislocation rates between dual mobility cups versus unipolar cups. We performed a retrospective single centre multiple surgeon study of all THAs performed for NOFs between January 2012 and May 2018. A total of 322 total hip replacements (127 dual mobility and 195 unipolar ; Age range of patients, 29 to 91, mean 70 years) were identified for analysis using a database. Data was obtained from electronic patient records and radiographs. 12 patients sustained a dislocation of their THA out of our 322 patients. Of these, 10 dislocations occurred in the unipolar group (5.13%). From the dual mobility cups, 2 had dislocations(1.57%), both with a 28mm head. Both of these dislocations were in alcohol dependent patients with increased susceptibility to falls. Statistical analysis of our data was performed using chi-squared test (p value = 0.0723) In ‘Getting It Right First Time’ (GIRFT), the authors recommend that all patients that sustain a NOF fracture meeting the criteria of a THA to be offered a dual mobility acetabular cup to reduce the risk of dislocation. The cost of the dual mobility acetabular cup is offset from the cost of overall revision surgery. Limitations of our study are its retrospective nature and selection bias.",

The aim of the present study is to describe this particular complication and comparing the occurrence in porous coated and hydroxyapatite (HA) coated femoral implants. 62 consecutive revision hip replacements were per- formed between January 2010 and December 2016 at a single academic institution. Only revisions of a primary total hip replacement were included. All surgeries were performed by the same senior surgeon. Clinical follow-up involved examination with the Harris hip score (HHS) at 2 years post surgical intervention. Fracture occurrence and severity were compared between groups by means of the Vancouver classification for intraoperative fractures. Overall, significant higher rates of fracturing were observed in the porous coated group (81.8%, p&lt;0.05) compared to the HA coated group (43.5%, p&lt;0.05). Of these fractures, the majority (72,7%) were B3 fractures. There was a significant difference between the mean HHS in the porous-coated group versus the group with HA coating (mean Harris Hip Scores of 68,45 vs 86,17, p = .004). Surgeons have to be wary with implanting porous coated stems in primary hip arthroplasty, especially in younger patients who have a high likelihood of future revision surgery, due to the catastrophic peri-operative fractures associated with the removal of these stems.",

Extensor carpi ulnaris pathologies are characterized by pain locally localized to the wrist ulnar side. Outpatient records and wrist MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) tests were retrospectively scanned between January 2018 and July 2019. By examining the anamnesis and examination notes of the patients in the outpatient clinic records, patients with wrist ulnar side pain, pain or sensitivity on the ulnar styloid and provocation test (synergy) were assigned to the first study group (Group 1).The second study group was composed of patients who underwent wrist MR for the diagnosis or differential diagnosis of a synovial cyst around the wrist, without ulnar side pain (Group 2).While evaluating MR images in the axial plane, the depth and width of the ulnar groove, thickness of the ECU tendon were measured. The position of the ECU tendon relative to the ulnar groove and the forearm rotation during the shooting were recorded.105 cases evaluated, there were 41 cases in the symptomatic subgroup and 64 cases in the asymptomatic subgroup. Among all patients, the mean patient age was 38.05.In the evaluation according to whether cases were symptomatic or not, there was no significant relationship between being symptomatic and the degree of instability and MR withdrawal position.

Knee mega-prosthesis are mostly used for Total knee arthroplasty revision and tumor resection surgery but they can be used for the treatment of complex knee fractures. The purpose of the present study is to examine the short- to mid- term outcomes of their use for complex DFF of the elderly. We retrospectively identified 4 patients with DFF AO33C3 on osteoporotic bone treated by total knee arthroplasty from September 2015 to October 2019. The average age at the time of the surgery was 79,5 years (range, 69 to 95 years). All patients were females and underwent a total knee replacement by one senior surgeon, with the OSS TM Orthopaedic Salvage System (Zimmer Biomet, Warsaw, Indiana, USA). Outcome measures included clinical outcome scores, radiological analyses, reoperation rate and complications. At an average follow-up of 2,3 years (range, 0,6 to 4,2 years), the average Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) was 17,25 (range, 7 to 37), the average Oxford knee score was 35,25 (range, 25 to 41) and the average pain Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) was 0,5 (range, 0 to 1). 3 Patients had postoperative anemia but no implant related complications has been reported. Complex DFF of the elderly treated with mega knee arthroplasty exhibit good clinical outcomes scores. The patients should be selected carefully as the complication rate found in the literature remains high.",

While good results have been reported using the Marx technique, some issues have been observed. To address the mentioned issues, a modification to the Marx technique has been devised. Eleven patients were enrolled and their ligaments were repaired by the fixation of allograft on the proximal and distal attachment footprints of the superficial MCL. For preventing loss of knee ROM, MCL and other ligaments were reconstructed in 2 separate stages. At the last follow up the ROM, knee ligament laxity and functional outcome scores, subjective (IKDC) and Lysholm score were evaluated and recorded. Knee motion was maintained in all cases. Two cases demonstrated 1+ valgus instability at 30 degrees of knee flexion. Both were treated for combined MCL and PCL tear, the rest were stable. The average IKDC-subjective score was 93 ± 4 and the average Lysholm score was 92 ± 3. All patients were satisfied and returned to their previous level of activity. In this technique, the superficial MCL was recon- structed closer to its anatomical construct. Patients didn’t have any complaints of hardware under the skin and the need for a second surgery for hardware removal was avoided.

Patients were identified from the hospitals’ registration systems for humeral shaft fractures, nerve lesions, plating, nailing and external fixation during a 10-year period from January 2007 to December 2016. All radial nerve lesions were registered and followed-up in patient files. Results. 89 patients with locked intramedullary nailing were available for an outpatient follow-up. Mean age was 67 years at the time of injury. 72 fractures were non-pathological. Of these, 31 were nonunions. 28, 61 and zero were identified in the proximal, middle and distal thirds of the humeral shaft respectively. 76 procedures were closed and 13 were with open reduction. Six radial nerves had nerve exploration. Eight patients developed immediate postoperative radial nerve palsies. Of these, six developed after closed surgery, two after nerve exploration. Of seven available patients with a radial nerve palsy, six of these remitted. Two patients were later surgically explored. One patient out of 89 sustained a verifiable permanent radial nerve paralysis. Conclusions. In this study, the risk of a radial nerve palsy was 7.9 % with closed locked intramedullary nailing. This study suggests that exploration of the radial nerve is not necessary routinely in order to prevent radial nerve lesions when performing closed intramedullary nailing for humeral shaft fractures in adults with a preoperative normal radial nerve function.

The secondary aim was to describe the reliability of ADLF test in diagnosis of PJI intra- operatively. A prospective observational study was conducted in three independent orthopaedic centres. Twenty-two patients undergoing revision surgery (debridement, antibiotics and implant retention (DAIR), single or two-stage revision) for PJI were recruited, 13 female and 9 male with an average age of 64 years. Samples were collected intra-operatively at the start of the first surgical procedure and then at the completion of debridement or prior to reimplantation depending on the operation performed. These samples were tested using ADLF and then sent for microbiological analysis. The ADLF result was then compared to the corresponding culture result in order to determine the diagnostic predictive accuracy. The reliability of ADLF test to predict eradication of infection after debridement of PJI was excellent for specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) of which both where 100%, but had a poor sensitivity (14.3%) and negative predictive value (NPV) (62.5%). The reliability of ADLF test to predict PJI was poor with only a 50% sensitivity and specificity. The ADLF test has a high specificity and PPV for diagnosing eradication of infection after debridement. In contrast the ADLF testing appears to have poor diagnostic accuracy for PJI when used on intra-operative samples, prior to surgical intervention. No benefits or funds were received in suppo",

The hypothesis for this retro- spective study was that low-pressure tourniquet TKA would offer the benefits of tourniquet surgery without the potential negative effects on late blood loss after the procedure. Therefore, this study evaluated total (TBL) and hidden blood loss (HBL) in TKA with or without a tourniquet. We retrospectively compared two groups : one group (n= 54) undergoing TKA without a tourniquet and one group with a low-pressure tourniquet (n= 110). The outcomes compared were hemoglobin levels 2 weeks before surgery and at days 2 and 4 after surgery to calculate total and hidden blood loss, transfusion rate, and functional outcome. A higher total blood loss was observed in the no tourniquet group with a mean loss of 1073 mL against 890 mL in the tourniquet group (p-value = 0,003). Hidden blood loss values between both groups were statistically not significant : in the no-tourniquet group, Hb drop between D2 and D4 was 0.5 g/dL against 0.4 g/ dL in the low-pressure tourniquet group. The tourniquet-less group did not present with better functional scores. This study showed that low- pressure tourniquet use reduces TBL without increasing HBL in TKA.",

Accordingly, this study investigated how well representative biomarkers in the DMM model reflected specific changes in individual animals. Rats were randomly divided into the OA group and the sham group. OA model was established by destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM). After 2,4,6,8,10 and 12 weeks (n=14, each week), the concentrations of CTXII, COMP, C2C, and OC in serum were measured, and cartilage degeneration, osteophytes, and synovial membrane inflammation, typical of OA, were scored using Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) scoring system. Additionally, the correlation between each biomarker and the specific changes in osteoarthritis was analyzed for individual animals using the Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE). Statistical analysis showed a low correlation between CTXII and osteophyte score of the medial femur (coefficient = -0.0088, p= 0.0103), COMP and osteophyte score of the medial tibia (coefficient = -0.0911, p= 0.0003), and C2C and synovial membrane inflammation scores of the medial femoral (coefficient = 0.054, p= 0.0131). These results suggest that representative OA bio- markers in individual animals in the DMM model did not reflect histological scores well.",

Analyze outcome of circumferential arthrodesis (CA) with ALIF (Anterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion) and pedicle screw fixation for the treatment of all-grade isthmic spondylolisthesis, with indirect neurological decompression. Retrospective study of isthmic spondylolisthesis treated with CA, with one-year follow-up. Clinical scores were collected at one year: VAS-L, VAS-R and ODI. Pelvic parameters, L4-S1 lordosis and at index and adjacent levels, and lumbo-sacral angle (LSA) were measured pre- and post-operatively and at last follow-up. Foraminal surface and diameters were measured pre- operatively and at follow-up on CT-Scan. Level of evidence: IV. 87 patients were included. Mean VAS-L was 2.3, mean VAS-R was 1, and mean ODI was 13.8%. 10% of the patients presented a high-grade spondylolisthesis and 50% a grade II. Mean lordosis at index level shifted from 6° to 18°, L4-S1 lordosis increased from 37 to 45° and LSA shifted from 116 to 125° (p&lt;0.001). The foraminal surface increased from 50mm 2 to 70mm 2 at last follow-up mostly through the supero-inferior diameter, shifting from 7.4mm to 9.5mm (p&lt;0.001).

One infection, 5 sympathetic dysfunctions, one retrograde ejaculation, one iliac vein injury, one incisional hernia, one lateral femoral cutaneous nerve injury and two adjacent syndromes have been noted. CA is an efficient technique for the treatment of isthmic spondylolisthesis of all grades, with an acceptable rate of complications.

We analyzed D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) levels. The values of the septic group were evaluated as two groups; Group 1 (before the first stage) and Group 2 (before the second stage) to investigate the role of D-dimer in determining the timing of reimplantation. D-dimer level was significantly higher in the SR group compared to PA and AR groups (p<0.001 and p=0.045). CRP and ESR levels were significantly higher in the SR group compared to PA and AR groups. There was no statistically significant difference between preoperative D-dimer levels of Group 1 and Group 2 (p=0.2). Serum D-dimer level can be used as an easy and inexpensive test to support the diagnosis of PJI. But the D-dimer level is not useful to determine the timing of reimplantation.",

Two groups of machined bovine cancellous bone samples were created ; experimental (n = 26) and control (n = 26). The experimental group was cemented using the negative pressure technique and the control group was cemented in the absence of negative pressure. The relative cement intrusion depths were then assessed for each group using MicroCT. These samples were then further machined and tested to failure in torsion to estimate their mechanical properties. Results show mean cement intrusion depth for the negative pressure group to be 8,676 µm and 6,042 µm for the control group (p = 0.078). Mechanical testing revealed a greater mean torque in the negative pressure group (1.6223 Nm versus 1.2063 Nm) (p = 0.095). This work quantifies the effect of negative intraosseous pressure on cement intrusion depth in cancellous bone and for the first time relates this to increased mechanical strength.",

Five others provided shoulder function and pain relief satisfaction data. Mean DASH score was 15.6 (SD: 12.1). Greatest disability was with placing an object on an overhead shelf, heavy household chores, carrying an object > 4.54 kg (10 lbs), and recreational activities with upper extremity impact or free movements. Mean SPADI disability score was 15.7 (SD: 16.3). Greatest disability was with placing an object on a high shelf, carrying a 4.54 kg (10 lb) object, and washing the back. Patients were satisfied, but disability remained with overhead tasks, carrying heavy objects, sudden upper extremity movements and impact forces.",

Synthetic materials have been introduced on the market place in the seventies, but they have not superseded the traditional plaster of Paris. The more recent thermoplastic materials are used to make splints and orthoses, particularly at the wrist and hand. The present review of the literature confirms that synthetic materials present better physical and mechanical properties than the traditional plaster of Paris. In addition, they are lighter, they are more resistant to humidity, they are more radiotransparent and they generate less dust when removed. However, they are less malleable and cause higher pressure in case of limb edema. Plaster of Paris therefore remains indicated in the acute posttraumatic or postoperative period. This material is also cheaper, but the pecuniary benefit is limited for several reasons, particularly because plaster of Paris is associated with a higher rate of cast replacement.",

Orthopedic surgeons specialized in shoulder surgery were invited to complete a survey between November 2013 and February 2015. Seventy-one percent of the approached surgeons com-pleted the survey. Less experienced surgeons (< 6 years) and surgeons from the Netherlands find patient characteristics (e.g. smoking p=0.01) more relevant than more experienced surgeons (≥ 6 years) and surgeons from Belgium. Less experienced surgeons will less likely (p=0.001) perform resurfacing arthroplasty compare to experienced surgeons. The less and the experienced surgeons use similar indications for a reverse shoulder arthroplasty regarding age limit and cuff arthropathy without osteoarthritis. Less experienced surgeon will more likely (p=0.003) prescribe a low molecular weight heparin during the hospital stay after a shoulder arthroplasty. In this survey, we found a decrease in the use of resurfacing arthroplasty and a strong increase in the use of reverse shoulder arthroplasty. Besides, there is little consensus concerning pre-operative planning, patient characteristics, surgical technique, and patient reported outcome measures. Level of evidence: IV.",

In multi level disc degeneration anterior cervical disc fusion (ACDF) is often combined with a CDA. In this hybrid construction, motion is preserved at the level of the CDA. This will give less stiffness in the neck and decreases stress at the adjacent level. However, there is a lack of literature about the long term efficacy, safety and complication rate of CDA in hybrid constructions. In this article we present two cases of spontaneous destruction of a M6-C prosthesis in a hybrid construction 5 years after surgery. One reason seems to be the polymer sheath who is used in the M6 prosthesis. Degradation of this sheath causes foreign body reactions with osteolysis in the vertebral bodies. However, the increased mechanical loading at the adjacent levels on the CDA due to the fused vertebrae could also be one of the reasons.",

Rapid, accurate diagnosis and treatment are essential for a favorable prognosis. During the diagnostic process of distal biceps tendon ruptures, several problems can emerge. An answer to the following clinical questions is given based on an extensive literature review. - Which clinical tests are the most sensitive/ specific for clinical examination? - Can ultrasound evaluation of the distal biceps tendon be optimized? - Is ultrasound an equivalent alternative to MRI in the diagnosis of distal biceps tendon injuries? An extensive literature search was conducted through Pubmed and Embase. The search strategy was developed systematically in the Medline data- base (PubMed interface), using medical subject headings as well as free text words. A standardized clinical examination of the distal biceps tendon consisting of the Hook test, the Passive Forearm Pronation Test and the Biceps Crease Interval test has a high accuracy for correct diagnosis of full-thickness ruptures. Furthermore, Cobra sign, Supinator view and Pronator view give an additional value to the standard ultrasound examination of the distal biceps tendon. Finally, ultrasound can be considered a trustworthy and cost-effective alternative to MRI in evaluation of distal biceps tendon ruptures.",

The purpose of this study was to determine: (1) the effect of MUA on Flexion arc (2) the influence of timing of MUA from index procedure and of diabetes mellitus on final flexion achieved.We retrospectively evaluated patients who underwent manipulation following total knee arthroplasty at our institution between January 2016 to December 2018. For the purpose of analysis, we have divided the patients into two groups. Those who underwent manipulation within 12 weeks and later than 12 weeks. We have also compared the effect of MUA between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. All were operated with posterior stabilised (PS) prosthesis by a single senior arthroplasty surgeon. The final flexion achieved during their last clinical follow-up were recorded and compared with the pre MUA flexion.The incidence of MUA after TKA at our institute during this period is about 1.14 %. There was a significant statistical difference between the pre and post manipulation flexion, with p value <0.01. There was no significant statistical difference between those who were manipulated before 12 weeks and after 12 weeks in improving the Flexion of the operated knees. We have found that both the diabetic and non diabetic group had comparable flexion after the manipulation in our study.Manipulation after anaesthesia is a safe first intervention to improve post operative stiffness and gain additional range of motion following TKA in patients who develop stiffness. It can be done even after 12 weeks of surgery with reasonably good gain in range of motion.",

A retrospective study was carried out in a sample of 63 patients in working age who underwent an APM between July 2018 and July 2020. The following preoperative characteristics were assessed: age at surgery, meniscal side, sex, physical job demands (white versus blue collar worker), telework and work status (salaried versus self- employed). A linear regression analysis was used to study the association between job characteristics and RTW interval adjusted for socio-demographic and medical (meniscal side) factors. Telework was most strongly associated with interval for RTW (p <0,001, adjusted R Square: 20,8). The results suggested that telework supports early RTW independently of sociodemographic and medical factors. This study supported the need for a tailormade approach in the prescription of sick leave.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary uncemented femoral revision hip systems have become commonly used over the past decade and have enabled the reconstruction of leg length, offset and anteversion as independent variables through the use of modular junctions. Modular junction failures between the proximal body and distal stem have been described with revision systems, although this is rare. We sought to identify the survivorship of one revision system in a salvage arthroplasty scenario where no host bone support of the modular junction was present. From a series of 136 patients, 15 patients (16 hips) were identified without host bone support of the modular junction with a mean radiological follow up of over 6 years (76 months +/- 35 months). There have been no cases of prosthetic fracture over the follow-up duration, with two revisions performed for reasons of aseptic loosening and infection. The mean BMI of the study group was 30.2 with 78% of the cohort classified as overweight or obese. It is well recognised that, host bone support of the modular junction is preferable, however the satisfactory outcomes over the midterm in these complex patients suggests that modular revision systems remain an option.",

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the functional outcomes after posteromedial capsular release in case of fixed flexed deformity > 15 o . Between June 2011 and November 2018, 15 patients (6 males and 9 females) were treated with open posterior capsular release through medial approach for fixed flexion deformity of the knee > 15 o and prospectively followed with a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Primary outcome was knee extension measured with a manual goniometer and secondary outcome treatment related complications. All patients reported inability to walk and clinical semiology of pain and swelling. The mean age of the study population at surgery was 61.7 years with a mean BMI of 30.9 kg/m2. Complete data were recorded for all patients. Statistically significant improvement was found in clinical and functional assessment tools analyzed from baseline to the latest follow-up (p<0.05). More precisely, the mean postoperative fixed flexion deformity was decreased from 23.57 o to 2.86 o . No adverse effect or major complications were recorded during follow-up. Posterior open release via posteromedial was shown to be an efficient and safe salvage procedure to deal with persistent fixed flexion deformity of more than 15 o following TKA at two years follow-up. However, future studies with a higher number of participants and longer follow-up should be conducted to validate our data.",

An increased tendency for fibrotic healing after repetitive microtrauma could be an underlying mechanism. However, it remains unclear how strong this association is and if only mild signs of Dupuytren disease would also increase the risk of frozen shoulder. In 61 patients, we examined the hands for signs of Dupuytren disease and the shoulders for pain and limited motion. We found a 21,7% prevalence of frozen shoulder syndrome in patients with signs of Dupuytren disease versus 13,9% in those without. The other way around, in patients with frozen shoulder syndrome the prevalence of Dupuytren disease was 50% versus 36.7% in those without frozen shoulder syndrome. These differences were not statistically significant, contrary to similar research in the literature. However, methodological issues, especially the choice of control group, may explain the differences between our findings and previous studies. We conclude that the clinical association between Dupuytren disease may not be so strong as previously thought, especially in patients with only limited signs of the disease.",

The aim of our study is to evaluate the outcomes of open reduction of neglected elbow dislocation (NED) in children. A retrospective review of 26 neglected elbow dislocation was treated by open reduction at our institution between January 2010 and December 2018 was performed. Age, mechanism of injury, associated fracture, manipulation by bone- setters, infectious complications, were recorded. The SOFCOT criteria was used to assess the stiffness of the elbow in preoperative and in postoperative. Besides, in postoperative we used DI SCHINO Criteria to assess useful ROM and subjective criteria to evaluate pain and performance of daily activity. A total of 26 patients with a mean age of 10 years ranging from 5 to 14 years, were identified and followed for a median of 4 years postoperatively. The median duration before presentation was 5 months ranges from 22 days to 5 years. All patients except one were manipulated by bonesetters with massage and manipulation. The dislocation was postero-lateral in 15 cases (58%). 17 patients (65%) have associated fracture. 17 patients went for internal approach, 5 posterior approach, and 4 with combined internal and external approach. Reduction of the ulnar humeral joint was assisted with a lengthening of the triceps with a Speed V-Y muscle plasty in 13 patients. According to SOFCOT criteria at the last follow-up we obtained 15(58%) of minim and moderate elbow stiffness, and according to DI- SCHINO criteria at the last follow-up, 7(27 %) has a very good result, 7(27%) has a good result. The open reduction and the early rehabilitation remain the key stone of treatment of NED in children regardless the chronicity of the injury. Prevention remains the best way to improve the prognosis of neglected elbow dislocations.",

A total of 294 patients without posterior soft tissue repair were included as control group, and a total of 147 patients with repair of the short external rotator muscle and joint capsule were assigned to the repair group. All operated patients were observed to analyze the occurrence and risk of early postoperative dislocation. Within 6 months after hip arthroplasty, the early hip dislocation rate in the repair group was 0.68%, which was significantly lower than that in the control group (4.78%) (P < 0.05). The results of multifactorial analysis showed that age ≥75 years, combined limb or mental illness, artificial femoral head diameter <30 mm, posterolateral approach and prosthesis placement outside the safety zone, and improper handling were risk factors for dislocation (P < 0.05); The incidence of re-dislocation was lower in the targeted intervention group (P < 0.05). The occurrence of dislocation after THA is related to age, gender, and type of orthopedic disease. The risk factors should be explored to develop targeted intervention protocol, decreasing the dislocation rate and improving the prognosis.",

From February 2017 to November 2019, 98 elderly (≥65 years) patients with UITF were included in this single-center retrospective cohort study. Mean follow-up duration was 24.1±11.9 months. Patients were divided into the DFMS group (52 patients) and the PFN group (46 patients). In the DFMS group, trochanteric fixation was performed using a trochanteric cable plate system. Primary outcome measures included Harris hip score (HHS), mobility score, implant related complications and mortality. Secondary outcome measures included hospitalization duration, surgical time and transfusion rate. Mean age of the patients was 78.7±7.2 years (65-96 years). DFMS group had longer surgical time, higher transfusion rates and longer hospital stays (p<0.05). Mean HHS was 80.7±10.5 and 81.9±12.2 in the DFMS group and PFN group, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of HHS, mobility score and mortality. Implant failure rates were significantly higher in the PFN group (p=0.015).

Both surgical methods can be effectively used in the treatment of UITFs with similar satisfactory functional results and similar mortality rates. In addition, the DFMS group exhibited significantly lower implant failure rates and PFN group provided significantly lower surgical time duration, transfusion rate and hospital stay duration.",

Patients with a Rockwood grade III or higher were included. Clinical results were based on satisfaction, pain and functional scores. These outcome scores were compared to coracoclavicular distance measurement on X-ray. Secondly, clinical outcome scores were compared between patients who had surgery in the first 6 weeks after trauma and patients treated after 6 weeks. Overall, X-ray showed a good reduction in 71.1% of the patients (less than 50% loss of reduction). These patients showed better clinical results than patients with radiographical failure in terms of satisfaction (p = .001), Constant (p = .001), DASH (p = .031) and SPADI (p = .005) scores. In total, 78% of the patient had surgery in the first 6 weeks after trauma. When treated later (mean time to surgery of 8.8 months), patients showed worse results for satisfaction (p = .003) and DASH score (p = .006), suggesting that treatment of chronic cases might warrant additional fixation techniques. As a conclusion, these results showed that, in the acute approach, single-bundle arthroscopic coracoclavicular fixation is a good treatment in acromioclavicular joint dislocation Rockwood grade III or higher.",

The goal of the study was to investigate the MRI accuracy, results after surgical treatment, and natural history of untreated MRI-diagnosed hip TSGCT. Twenty-four consecutive patients with suspected TSGCT on hip MRI, between December 2006 and January 2018, were identified from our medical database. Six refused to participate. About 18 patients with a minimal follow-up of 18 months were enrolled. Charts were reviewed for histopathology results, specific treatment and recurrence. At the last follow-up, all patients had a clinical (Harris Hip Score [HHS]) and radiological examination (x-ray and MRI). Out of 18 patients with suspected TSGCT on MRI, with a mean age of 35y (range 17-52), 14 had surgi- cal resection and 4 refused surgery 1 of whom had a CT-guided biopsy. Out of 15 cases with biopsies, in 10 TSGCT was confirmed. Three surgically-treated patients showed recurrence on MRI after 24, 31 and 43 months.

In chronic calcifying tendinitis with insufficient conservative treatment, an arthroscopic excision of the calcification deposit may help, however, there is controversy about how it should be performed. This retrospective study, with prospectively collected results using the Surgical Outcome System™ (SOS, Arthrex®), evaluated the outcome of arthroscopic treatment of calcific tendinitis without rotator cuff repair. Outcome was measured by different scores such as Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Evaluation Form (ASES) and Single Assess- ment Numeric Scale (SANE). 54 patients were included in the analysis (male: 19; female: 35), mean age at surgery was 51 (range, 37-68) years.

Most improvement is seen in the first 3 months postoperatively but gradual progress is to be expected up until 2 years. No frozen shoulders or cuff tears were reported postoperatively. No reoperations were necessary during follow-up. A noticeable fast pain relief and functional recovery are seen when treating a patient with calcific tendinitis without repairing the rotator cuff.

A retrospective analysis of patients who underwent removal of their TSA combined with sonication of the implant for suspicion of PJI between April 2009 and August 2017 was performed. The diagnosis of PJI was based on the major criteria described by Parvizi. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, likelihood ratios and diagnostic accuracy for sonication cultures in comparison with periprosthetic tissue cultures. Data from 41 patients were analysed. Standard synovial fluid cultures combined with intraoperative periprosthetic tissue cultures had a sensitivity of 95%, specificity of 95% and total accuracy of 95%. Sonication cultures had a sensitivity of 91%, specificity of 68% and total accuracy of 80%. Six patients had negative standard cultures but positive sonication cultures. In patients with only one positive standard culture, the pathogen of the sonication culture corresponded to the pathogen of the positive soft tissue culture. We found a possible added value of sonication of TSA in the diagnosis of PJI in conjunction with standard intraoperative cultures. In some patients with suspicion of low-grade TSA infection, sonication could identify a possible causal microorganism despite negative standard cultures.",

This study primarily aims to define the position and variance of the LTS. Secondly, this study wants to investigate the relevance of the LTS position on the mechanical tibiofemoral angle (mTFA°) while planning and postoperatively landing the weight-bearing line (WBL) on this landmark. The LTS position was studied on preoperative full-leg standing radiographs (FLSR) and computed tomography (CT) scans in 70 cases. 3D models of the tibia were created in Mimics 23.0 and measurements were conducted in 3-matic 15.0 (Materialise, Leuven®). Next, 100 HTO cases were retrospectively planned with the WBL through the LTS according to Dugdale's method on FLSR. Finally, 55 postoperative FLSR which had the WBL on the LTS (±2%) were assessed for mTFA° outcome. Statistics were conducted in GraphPad 8.0. The LTS was located at 58.3%±1.9 [55-63%] in 2D and 57.3%±2.2 [53-63%] in 3D showing a high correlation (r=0.77 [0.65 to 0.85]). The planned mTFA on the LTS was 181.8°±0.3 (181.3°-182.5°). On postoperative FLSR, the mTFA was 182.2°±0.6 (180.9°-183.1°). The lateral tibial spine is located at 57-58% on the tibial plateau with a 10% maximal variation range. Good agreement was found between 2D and 3D imaging modalities while evaluating its position in the coronal plane. When aiming the WBL through the LTS during valgus-producing HTO, a consistent realignment of 181-183° mTFA can be expected when performing accurate surgery.",

The MDC95 was calculated according to MDC95 = standard error of measurement × 1.96 × √2. In the 2D and 3D- CT measurements, intraobserver reliability for coronal and sagittal positions of the tibial component were sufficiently reliable, where ICCs were >0.8. In the coronal plane, the ICCs for interobserver reliability were lower in 2D (ICC, 0.5-0.7) than in 3D-CT (ICC > 0.9). Bland-Altman plots showed systematic bias in sagittal alignment in the 2D assessment.

On average 24 months, patients were reconvened for a post-operative evaluation (subjective evaluation of pain, function and patient satisfaction; clinical evaluation with strength and mobility measures; post-operative X-rays). On X-rays, 2 criteria were evaluated: the bony erosion and the shortening of the thumb column (trapezium+metacarpal height measure, ratio between first and second metacarpal bones, a new radiological assessment tool based on a trapezoid relationship gradation). In most patients, surgery relieved pain and offered good functional results, according to the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand scale. Following surgery, our patients showed a subjective improvement, both in terms of pain and functional results.

This was a retrospective cohort in which patients undergoing simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA) were evaluated. Thirty patients were enrolled. The standard PAI was used for one knee, while the PAI solution was applied in the form of GNB to the other. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain scores were measured and recorded separately for each knee, at rest (static) and during exercise (dynamic). Active range of joint motion (JRM) for both knee joints was measured preoperatively, at postoperatively. Compared to the PAI group, the GNB group had lower VAS scores at 2 and 8 hours (p = 0.030 and p < 0.001, respectively). The GNB group also had lower dynamic VAS scores at 2, 8, and 24 hours (p = 0.009, p <0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). Static and dynamic VAS measurements did not demonstrate any differences between groups (GNB vs. PAI) at 48 hours and 30 days (p>0.05). When the reduction in VAS scores was assessed, we found that the decrease in both scores was significantly greater in the PAI group compared to the GNB group (p<0.001, for both). There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to drainage volume, complications and JRM (p>0.05).

    "abstract": "Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a well-known surgical procedure performed to address end stage osteoarthritis. The main goal is to relieve pain, recover articular function and return to normal function as soon as possible. Over the years it is frequently performed in the elderly, but lately there is an increased demand in a younger and more active population. Up to 25% of patients feel dissatisfied about their TKA. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is considered the main anteroposterior stabilizer of the knee; nevertheless the ACL is usually sacrificed during conventional TKA. Research shows this might be an unnecessary sacrifice in certain cases. The considerable dissatisfaction rate in mainly high-demanding patients, together with the literature reports on the importance of the ACL function, were the two main reasons for the development of bicruciate retaining (BCR) total knee arthroplasty. BCR TKA may offer superior knee kinematics and proprioception, through anterior cruciate ligament preservation, but requires a higher level of attention to obtain an accurate and precise component orientation to reach proper ligamentous balancing and restore the native knee biomechanics. Many surgeons abandoned its use due to its challenging technique and inconsistent results. Recent new BCR implant designs are promising. This systematic literature review aims to summarize the current state of BCR TKA and what to expect in the future.",

Peri-prosthetic BMD and clinical factors were assessed and compared. In addition, correlations between periprosthetic BMD changes and stem anteversion error were analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient in the two groups. A significantly better postoperative periprosthetic BMD change was found in zones 1 and 7 in the rectangular-tapered group. Additionally, no significant correlation was observed between stem anteversion error and periprosthetic BMD changes in the rectangular-tapered groups. However, in the tapered-wedge group, there were significant negative correlations between the stem anteversion error and BMD changes at 6 months and 24 months in zones 1 and 7. In the rectangular-tapered group, a significantly better postoperative periprosthetic BMD change was found particularly in the region proximal to the stem. Rectangular-tapered short stem can be more resistant to rotation due to higher medullary occupancy and may lead to better periprosthetic BMD than the tapered-wedge short stem, especially in the proximal region of the stem.",

    "abstract": "Fusion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ) is a commonly performed surgical procedure. Although the effect of first MTPJ fusion on reduction of Intermetatarsal angle (IMA) is well described, contributing factors remain unclear. The aim of this study was to identity predictive parameters for IMA reduction. Fifty-one patients (68 feet) who underwent a first MTPJ fusion and had an IMA greater than fourteen degrees were assessed retrospectively. The average age was 68 (31.4-79.3) years. Sixteen demographic and radiographic variables were evaluated using a multivariate regression analysis for association with change in IMA after surgery. The mean preoperative IMA was 16.11 (range, 14.0-22.5) degrees with a mean reduction of 4.95 (range, 0-17) degrees after surgery. Multivariate regression analysis revealed three significant independent predictors of the change in IMA. Increased preoperative IMA (β = .663, CI = .419, .908, P &lt;.001), increased preoperative translation at base of MT1 (β = .490, CI = 0.005, .974, P = 0.039), and less postoperative translation in the fusion (β= -0.693, CI= -1.054, -.331, P= 0.002) significantly increased the amount of IMA reduction. Pre-operative IMA and translation at the base of the first metatarsal were positive predictors for correction of IMA after first MTPJ fusion. Translation at the level of the MTP I fusion was a negative predictor for the amount of IMA correction. Based on these findings, we recommend minimizing the lateral translation of the proximal phalanx relative to the metatarsal head to optimize IMA correction after MTPJ fusion.",

Data related to age, gender, body mass index, ASA score, comorbidities, operative time, transfusion rate, length of stay, knee range of motion (ROM), Knee Society Score (KSS), complications, and mortality rates were evaluated. Mean follow-up duration was 39.0±14.7 months. Preoperative characteristics were similar among cohorts. Transfused units were significantly higher in the ssBTKA group (p&lt;0.001). Operative time and length of stay were significantly higher in the staBTKA group (respectively, p&lt;0.001 and p=0.004). Complication rates (except superficial infection rate which was significantly higher in the staBTKA group), revision rates, mortality rates and functional outcomes were statistically similar between the groups (p&gt;0.05). Presence of preoperative coronary artery disease comorbidity was significantly associated with increased postoperative myocardial infarction risk (p=0.001). ssBTKA provided similar functional results, shorter cumulative hospital stay and shorter operative time without increasing complications and mortality rates compared to staBTKA procedure. For patients with pre-existing coronary artery disease, a more cautious approach should be preferred to decrease complications.",

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 1000 mg of intravenous acetaminophen at 6-hour intervals (AAP group) or not to receive intravenous acetaminophen (control group). All patients underwent single-shot femoral nerve block after general anesthesia, as well as intraoperative periarticular infiltration of analgesia prior to implantation. The primary outcome was the postoperative numerical rating scale (NRS) pain score at rest. The NRS score was measured just before the administration of study drugs, immediately after arrival in the ward (time 0), and at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 48 h (time 1 to time 5, respectively) postoperatively. We also evaluated the mean doses of rescue opioid use for 24 h postoperatively. At time 5, the AAP group had significantly improved mean NRS score than controls (3.0 vs. 4.0; P &lt; 0.01). Rescue opioid use was significantly lower in the AAP group for 24 hours compared to controls (0.3 μg vs. 0.9 μg; P &lt; 0.01).

Although a fast return to sport is imperative for athletes, there is only limited literature on short-term functional outcomes after open reduction internal fixation of a clavicle fracture in a homogenous group of athletes. The aim of this study is to evaluate early (first 6 weeks) functional outcomes, return to sports and complications of elite or high-level recreational (± 8000 km per year) cyclists and motocross riders after surgical treatment of a midshaft clavicle fracture. The main study parameters were Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDash); QuickDash sports module, pain in rest and movement (Numeric Pain Rating Score) and time to return to sports (training indoor/outdoor and competition). All parameters were taken pre-operatively and at 2/4/6/12/24 weeks post-operative. A total of 34 cyclists (6 LTFU) and 9 motocross riders (2 LTFU) were included at baseline. A significant decrease in Quick dash scores between preoperative (33 ± 1.2) and 2 weeks PO (21.5 ± 1.2) and between 2 and 4 weeks PO (16.1 ± 1.3) was found for cyclists. The QuickDash scores of the motocross riders statistically improvement from preoperative (31.6 ± 3.3) to 6 weeks PO (14.1 ± 3.3). NRS score in rest for cyclists decreased significantly from 3.6 ± 0.2 to 1.0 ± 0.2 after two weeks. After 4 weeks, 93% of cyclists and 57% of motocross riders were training outside. After 6 weeks, 56% of cyclists and 57% of motocross riders had returned to competition. Our results show that early surgical treatment of midshaft clavicle fractures in elite cyclists and motocross riders is a safe method with few complications and good functional outcomes.",

    "abstract": "As China enters an aging society, the incidence of femoral neck fractures is increasing year by year. For some patients, total hip arthroplasty (THA) is the treatment of choice for displaced femoral neck fractures. Schizophrenia is a common combination of elderly patients with femoral neck fractures, and there are few reports on the treatment. This study describes the short-term efficacy of the supercapsular percutaneously assisted (SuperPATH) approach in the treatment of patients suffered with displaced femoral neck fractures combined with schizophrenia. A retrospective analysis of 20 elderly patients with displaced femoral neck fractures combined with schizophrenia who underwent THA using the SuperPATH approach. Record demographic data, postoperative reexamination of X-ray film to observe the position and the loosening condition of the prosthesis, the length of hospitalization, complications in the hospital and after discharge. The Harris score of hip joint function was used to evaluate postoperative hip joint function. The average age of the 20 patients was 73.1 years. All patients were followed up by outpatient clinic or telephone. The follow-up time was 3-12 months, with an average of 9.2 months. There was no incision infection, no tissue structure damage such as important nerves and blood vessels, and no complications such as early dislocation, loosening of the joint prosthesis, and deep vein thrombosis of lower extremities. The efficacy of the last follow-up was evaluated according to the Harris score of hip joint function: an average of 91 points (78-98 points); 13 cases were excellent, 5 cases were good, and 2 cases were fair. The SuperPATH approach has the advantages of less surgical damage, shorter recovery time, good surgical safety, preserving the normal tension of the muscles around the hip joint, and reducing the incidence rate of early postoperative dislocation of the joint prosthesis. The THA of the SuperPATH approach can treat patients with displaced femoral neck fractures combined with schizophrenia safely and effectively.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of prosthetic joint infections (PJI) regularly involves a two-stage surgical strategy. The second stage is generally performed when the surgeon estimates that the infection is under control based on either the treatment length or clinical and biological data. We have raised the question whether standardization of C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) values could be either indicative of infection control or predictive of infection recurrence. This was an analytical retrospective and monocentric cross-sectional observational study. The CRP and NLR values were recorded prior to the second-stage surgery in a sample of 100 patients who underwent a two-stage revision arthroplasty following a PJI, and these values were correlated with the absence of infectious recurrence within a 2-year follow-up. The statistical analysis consisted of evaluating the diagnostic validity of each marker, first individually, and then in combination. CRP was shown associated with a 68% sensitivity, 40% specificity, 27% positive predictive value (PPV), and 79% negative predictive value (NPV). The ROC curve was 51.1%. The NLR displayed a 12% sensitivity, 89% specificity, 27% PPV, and 75% NPV. The ROC curve was 47.9%. The combination of the two markers did not fundamentally improve the statistical results, with only a 43% concordance of the two markers, 27% sensitivity, 84% specificity, 37% PPV, and 77% NPV. Measuring CRP and NLR values, either individually or in combination, before the second-stage revision arthroplasty did not turn out to be predictive of either infection recurrence or cure within two years of follow-up. Therefore, an absolute test is still lacking, which would enable us to predict without failure the absence of control or the control of a PJI before or after second-stage revision.

Subsequently, empiric antibiotic therapy is commenced directly after surgery which is important for the successful treatment of PJI. The aim of this study is to evaluate current nationwide empiric antibiotic treatment regimens for PJI in the Netherlands. An electronic 15-question survey addressing the empiric antibiotic treatment strategy for PJI following THA or TKA was sent to orthopaedic surgeons in all Dutch hospitals in April 2019. Orthopaedic surgeons active in every single Dutch orthopaedic hospital (n=69) were approached. At least one surgeon in every hospital completed the survey (100% response rate). A protocol dictating the empiric antibiotic treatment following DAIR was used in 87% (60 hospitals). Among all hospitals, 72% (50 hospitals) used antibiotic monotherapy and 28% (19 hospitals) used combination therapy. Cefazolin was the most commonly used regimen in centres opting for monotherapy (42%, 29 hospitals). Similar regimens were used for the empiric treatment of suspected early PJI after revision surgery and for acute hematogenous PJI. In septic patients, combination therapy was preferred (64%). 81% (56 hospitals) incubated tissue biopsies for a minimum of 10 days whereas 16% (9 hospitals) indicated an incubation period of 7 days or less. Even in a small country such as the Netherlands there seems to be no uniformity regarding empiric antibiotic treatment for PJI. Increased uniformity regarding empiric treatment could be an important first step in improving PJI treatment.",

The technique included harvesting a bone plug from the lateral femoral neck, core decompression, and bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) application; the procedure was completed by press-fit insertion of the autologous bone plug in the debrided area. Autologous bone plug-sliding with core decompression and bone marrow concentrate aspirate application provides good clinical outcomes in the management of ONFH. A retrospective review was performed using records of patients operated on between October 2019 and June 2021. Only patients with Ficat-Arlet stage-2 ONFH, who underwent the procedure described, were included. Twenty- nine hips (18 patients) were included and evaluated clinically and radiologically. Clinical evaluation included the Harris hip score (HHS) and Visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, while radiological evaluation included direct radiographs. The average age was 39.8 years (± 11.7, range: 24-65 years). The average follow-up was 13.5 months (± 3.4, range: 8-19 months). There were improvements in the VAS pain and Harris hip scores in all patients.

No complications were encountered in any of the patients during the follow-up. None of the patients had femoral head collapse on the latest radiograph or required total hip replacement. The combination of the novel autologous bone plug-sliding method with conventional regenerative methods is a successful treatment choice for ONFH.",

The purpose of this article is to share our experience and assess if performing SBTHA carries more risk than unilateral total hip arthroplasty (UTHA). Methods: A retrospective data analysis was performed on 468 patients who underwent either UTHA (418 patients) or SBTHA (50 patients) using a direct anterior approach between June 2016 and December 2020. Apart from SBTHA patients being significantly younger, there was no significant preoperative difference in demographics, comorbidities, surgical variables and biological values between the two groups. Primary outcomes were 90-days emergency room (ER) visit and readmission, as well as 90-days minor and major complications. Secondary outcomes were length of stay (LOS), operative time and blood loss. Results: 90-days ER visit (p=0.244), 90- days readmission (p=0.091), overall complications rate (p=0.376), minor complications (p=0.952) and major complications (p=0.258) were not statistically different between the two groups. Operative time and average LOS were significantly longer in the SBTHA group (p&lt;0.001). Blood loss was significantly higher (p&lt;0.001) in the SBTHA group. However, no difference in the transfusion rate between the two groups was observed (p=0.724). Conclusion: Complication rate, 90- days hospital readmission and 90-days ER visit were similar between the two groups. This study shows that performing SBTHA is a safe, effective, and doesn’t carry additional risks for patients with bilateral symptomatic osteoarthritis.",

We aimed to investigate the correlation between the place where a hip fracture occurs, and the time to initiation of specialist fracture-specific treatment. We retrospectively analysed data that had been collected on 4917 consecutive hip fracture admissions to our unit. The recorded places of fall were divided into four groups, including those falling 'outside home', 'at home', 'residential or nursing home', and 'hospital inpatients' respectively. A 24-hour scale was used to record times of fall and of initiation of treatment. The latter was the time of admission to Accident & Emergency for groups 1-3, and the time of referral to the Orthopaedic team for group 4.23.5% patients fell outside their own home (group 1), and presented at only 2 hours post-injury. Patients in both group 2 (47.7%) and group 3 (23.6%) presented after 3 hours. Group 4 (4.9%) patients had to wait a median of 8 hours being referred to the Orthopaedic team. We found an interesting correlation between the place of injury and the delay in receiving treatment, in that those patients already receiving maximal healthcare attention, had to wait the longest to be referred to specialist care.",

Nevertheless, the authors conducted a prospective study in 60 patients about the effectiveness of scintigraphy, after the conventional roentgenographic examination, as an ultimate decision maker for the identification of the levels to be treated. Seventy-one levels were radiographically and scintigraphically positive, were seen as active, and thus treated. Thirty-seven levels were radiographically negative but positive scintigraphically, were considered as imminent fractures, and thus treated. Ten levels were positive radiographically, but negative scintigraphically, and were not treated as they were considered as healed. The Oswestry Disability Score (100% = worst possible condition) improved from 38.8% +/- 39.5% at baseline, to 2.38% +/- 3.99% on the first postoperative day (p < 0.001), to 2.00% +/- 3.40% at 1 month (p < 0.001) and to 1.93% +/- 3.33% at 6 months (p < 0.001). This preliminary study gives a hint that scintigraphy might work as the ultimate decision maker, even when plain radiographs are negative. Further studies will be needed to compare patients with VCFs positive radiographically and scintigraphically, and other patients with VCFs negative radiographically, but positive scintigraphically.",

The objective of the evaluation was to determine which factors influenced the results of the practical work, according to the characteristics of the students and their experiences in laparoscopy or in arthroscopy in the operating theatre or on the simulator for arthroscopy. Material and methods: In 2019 a total of 121 residents were included, corresponding to the full promotion. They filled out a preliminary questionnaire giving information on their general characteristics. Eight different workshops were evaluated. The grading of skills was as follows: “A” for “acquired”, “B” for “in progress” and “C” for “not acquired”. The data was collected on a computerized spreadsheet. The statistical analysis used the Welch test, the Chi2 test and the Fisher test. Results: The average “A” percentage across all workshops was 87.8%. Factors predictive of a good result were experience in laparoscopy as the main operator (p = 0.014) and male sex (p = 0.014). We observed that the residents who had not performed arthroscopy in clinical practice had done more training on simulators than the others (p = 0.044). Residents who had performed at least one arthroscopy as a main operator were predominantly female (p &lt; 0.001). Discussion: The interest of this study lies in the novelty of the analysis of the results of a whole promotion of residents in the SOCLE phase in osteosynthesis simulation. Conclusion: This novel evaluation deserves to be repeated by refining the evaluation tools before and during the course. It allowed us to know the weak points of the students during the simulated learning.",

Four normal children served as controls, 2 were below 5 years, one was 7 and one was 12 years old. We measured the acetabular coverage (AC) and the center-edge-angle (CEA) by utilising the reconstructed 3-dimensional CT images. The mean right and left AC angles were 82 +/- 12 and 82 +/- 20 degrees in group-I, 107 +/- 15 and 103 +/- 17 in group-II and 119 +/- 24 and 116 +/- 22 in group-lII, respectively (p < 0.05).

Surgical treatment was undertaken for any group II (Catterall's classification) patient, with the presence of two or more radiographic signs of the head at risk and the clinical sign of flexion with abduction, as well as for all cases classified by Catterall as groups III and IV. The surgical procedure we describe provided 147 radiologically and clinically normal hips in the short and long-term. However, in the long-term, 21 out of 168 patients presented with residual deformities such as shallow acetabulum, thickening of the acetabular floor, coxa magna, thicker and slightly shorter femoral neck. Thus for the vast majority of patients, the operation we describe here provided leg length equalisation and restored the working length of the abductors by maintaining the tip of the greater trochanter at the same level as on the unaffected side.",

The mean age was 73.4 years . The Fullfix stem (Mathys A.G., Bettlach, Switzerland) is characterised by a mat polished surface and a flange aimed to compress the cement during the insertion process. Early distal migration was determined in 36 patients using the computer assisted EBRA-FCA method (Einzel-Bild-Roentgen-Analyse femoral component analysis). At 2 years, subsidence reached a mean value of 0.44 mm (95%CI : 0.19, 0.70), whereafter the stem appeared stable, i.e. distal migration reached a plateau. Females showed significantly higher migration than males (p < 0.01). EBRA-FCA proved to be an accurate method to measure early migration, with a standard deviation below 1 mm (0.56 mm in the interval 1-2 years). Harris Hip Scores (HHS) at 2 years follow-up averaged 89.6 (95%CI : 79.5, 99.8). As expected considering the small extent of migration, there was no correlation between subsidence and HHS (p = 0.5).",

Because of his overgrowth, the patient had severe medical and orthopaedic problems and was almost immobile. Prior to surgery, he experienced a rapidly progressive thoracolumbar kyphosis to 600 (T10-L2). MRI of the brain and spine showed critical protraction of the spinal cord and myelopathy from compression at T12. Single-stage posterior resection of the hemivertebra with spinal shortening and dorsal transpedicular instrumentation of T10-L2 was performed. Although the bone tissue was cartilaginous and dysplastic, 420 (30%) correction was achieved along with decompression of the spinal canal. The patient experienced no neurological impairment post-operatively. At follow-up examination 1.5 year after surgery, the patient's movement disorder had improved markedly and he was able to stand and walk. This very rare case demonstrates that single-stage posterior hemivertebra resection and transpedicular instrumentation for correction of congenital kyphosis can be a safe and effective procedure even in a very challenging case.",

To see whether this longevity is associated with orthopaedic disability, especially physeal growth defects, we examined 105 patients aged between 5-25 years for evidence of clinically detectable premature epiphyseal fusions (PEF). Ours is a center focussed on transfusion dependent beta thalassemia (TDBT) patient management, and so detailed transfusion records related to age at first transfusion, regularity of transfusions and pre-transfusional haemoglobin (Hb) levels were available. Five (4.7%) patients had deformities or limb length discrepancies, which lead to the detection of PEF. All patients with PEF had pre transfusion haemoglobin levels of less than 8 gm/dL. On comparing with the literature, we found that the prevalence of clinically detectable PEF in TDBT patients has decreased with better blood transfusion regimes. Though the pathogenesis of PEF is yet to be conclusively established, it is apparent that better control of the disease to maintain pre-transfusional haemoglobin levels consistently above 8 gm/dL in the first decade, can decrease the occurrence of PEF.",

    "abstract": "The success of conversion Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) among primary THA and revision THA re- mains unclear. We hypothesized that most conversion THAss can be performed using primary implants and will have an uncomplicated post-operative course. Thirty-six patients (23 females, mean age 68,0y) who underwent conversion THA for failed interventions for proximal femur fractures in the period 2006-2018 were matched sequentially against patients of the same sex and age who underwent primary THA or revision THA. Data was collected on implants used, major complications, and mortality. PROMs used included the Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index, Harris Hip Score, Visual Analogue Scale and the EQ-5D Health Questionnaire. Seventy- two percent of patients who underwent conversion THA were treated with primary implants and never suffered from a major complication. PROMs were excellent for this group of patients. The distinction primary / conversion / revision THA could not explain differences in outcomes, however the necessity of using revision implants and the development of major complications could. The majority of conversion total hip arthroplasties can be considered a primary replacement. Predicting outcomes for THA should focus on patient frailty and technical difficulties dealing with infection, stability and loss of bone stock and should discard the conversion versus revision terminology.",

Promising features of the Dynesys system, as well as shortcomings, became obvious in several clinical studies. Since 2012, we started using a new PBDS device as an alternative for the Dynesys, to avoid the screw loosening and the kyphosing effect. The objective is to compare failure rates between the Dynesys and Balan-C type PBDS implant and factors affecting outcome. In a retrospective study we investigated a total of 90 patients with lumbar pedicle screw dynamic stabilization (a group of 64 patiënts with Dynesys stabilization is compared to a group of 26 patients with Balan-C stabilization). Mean follow-up was 48 and 38 months, respectively. Using logistic regression analysis the impact of baseline characteristics such as gender, age, body mass index (BMI), indication for surgery, primary or revision surgery, single versus more level surgery, surgeon’s experience and type of the implant on implant failure was analyzed. We found a statistically significant difference in failure rates between the two systems (13% in the Dynesys group versus 62% in the Balan-C group). In multivariate analysis, type of implant was associated with implant failure (odds ratio : 13). Our current results call for an optimization of the pre-and post-marketing surveillance of pedicle-based dynamic stabilization.",

    "abstract": "Purpose : distal femoral periprosthetic fracture (DFPPF) is a serious complication following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Recently, treatment of DFPPF with distal femoral arthroplasty (DFA) has gained popularity because of its posited benefits for both patients and the medical system. Short-term follow-up trials investigating DFA have demonstrated acceptable results with regards to function, pain relief and lower postoperative complications than ORIF in elderly patients. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate a consecutive series of DFPPF treated with DFA, with a minimum 2- year follow-up. Methods : We performed a retrospective study asses- sing the outcomes of distal femoral arthroplasty (DFA) for patients diagnosed with DFPPF. Results : Twenty patients were identified. The mean age of patients was 76.3 (SD, 9.41), the average time from the fracture to revision surgery was 6.7 days (SD, 11.35), The average operative time was 93.5 minutes (SD,16.6). The average follow-up time was 50.15 months (SD, 20.87). During this time, two patients (10%) had complications. One patient experienced a knee dislocation and the second patient had recurrent periprosthetic infections. At final follow up, the mean knee society score was 86.25 (SD, 9.44), the mean Forgotten joint score was 62.16(SD, 23.45) and 93.7 percent of patients were ambulatory. Conclusion : DFA following DFPPF is associated with high success rates and provides patients with the opportunity for return of function in a safe and reliable manner.",

A prospective cohort study was performed in level I academic center on 42 patients with mean age of 36 years (22-59). Eleven patients had isolated posterolateral column fractures whereas 31 patients had associated columns fractures. According to the suggested protocol, all cases of isolated posterolateral column fracture started treatment via arthroscopic evaluation of soft tissue injuries (menisci and liga- ments), arthroscopically assisted reduction and inter- nal fixation by rafting screws followed by ORIF if plating was needed. If associated with other columns fractures, columns were fixed sequentially in an anti-clockwise direction starting from anteromedial column. Average follow up was 26 months. Mean time to union was 16.3 (12-22) weeks. No radiological evidence of loss of coronal or sagittal alignment was detected at final follow up. Five patients had an average depression of 5 millimeters that did not need further intervention at this short-term follow up. Mean KOOS was 81 (72- 88). The average knee range of motion was (0° - 127°). One patient had temporary common peroneal nerve injury, one patient had deep infection and two had superficial wound infection. implementing the suggested protocol gives good to excellent radiological and functional results as regard posterolateral tibial plateau fracture.

    "abstract": "With advancements in minimally invasive surgical technique, pain management and rehabilitation proto- cols, and prevention of post-operative complications, outpatient total hip arthroplasty became a realistic goal. This study reports our experience of performing outpatient total hip arthroplasty assessing its feasi- bility and safety. Between December 2015 and January 2018, 52 outpatient total hip arthroplasties were performed. We implemented a peri-operative management proto- col that included education, improved analgesia and rapid rehabilitation. Patients were asked about any complications they had experienced after surgery and about the perception of their experience as outpatient. Any early post-operative emergency department visits, acute office appointments or hospital re-ad- missions were registered. Fifty-one of 52 patients (98,1%) enrolled in the study met the discharge criteria and achieved their goal of going home on the day of surgery, and only one patient (1,9%) required an overnight stay. There were two visits to the emergency room, with one hospital re-admission (1,9%) on the night of the surgery. There were no major post-discharge complications in the short-term follow-up (minimum of three months). Only one patient (1,9%) reported a significantly negative experience. With this first Belgian experience reporting on out- patient primary total hip arthroplasty, our data demonstrate that early discharge does not result in excessive re-admissions or other post-discharge complications due to an early discharge. This study suggests that total hip arthroplasty can be performed safely and successfully in appropriately selected patients and that patients who experienced that ambulatory protocol declared themselves highly satisfied.",

Three hundred patients who were diagnosed with grade 2, 3 and 4 medial patellar cartilage defect using MRI according to the International Cartilage Repair Society Classification System and 100 control subjects were evaluated. Trochlear morphology was evaluated based on lateral trochlear inclination (LTI), medial trochlear inclination (MTI), sulcus angle( SA), femoral lateral and medial condyle symmetry, trochlear facet asymmetry, and trochlear width on the axial MR images. The mean SA was significantly higher in the medial patellar cartilage defect group compared to the control group (p&lt;.05). The LTI and MTI of the cartilage defect group were significantly lower than those of the control group (p&lt;.05). With the decreasing LTI and MTI, there was an increase in medial patellar cartilage loss. LTI (r=-0.46) and MTI (r=-0.53) were moderately correlated with SA. There was no significant differences in femoral lateral and medial condyle symmetry, trochlear facet asymmetry, and trochlear width between groups with and without medial patellar cartilge defect (p &gt; .05). A flattened medial trochlea is a risk factor for cartilage structural damage of the medial patellofemoral joint, and it plays a role in the development of a defect in the medial patellar cartilage. The medial patellar cartilage defect is associated with the flattened lateral trochlea.",

Risk factors include fracture position, calcar length and medial hinge integrity. We routinely perform intra-articular biceps tenotomy with tenodesis at the level of pectoralis major to facilitate fragment identification and potentially ameliorate post-operative pain relief. Concern exists that tenotomising the biceps damages the adjacent arcuate artery, potentially increasing the rate of AVN. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether biceps tenodesis is associated with an increased risk of radiographically evident humeral head AVN. 61 fractures surgically treated over a 52-month period were retrospectively reviewed and radiographically assessed in accordance with Neer’s classification, calcar-length and medial hinge integrity. 40, 20 and 1 were four-, three- and two-part fractures respectively. 37 had a calcar-length less than 8mm and 26 suffered loss of the medial hinge. The median radiographic follow-up was 23 months. There was radiographic evidence of humeral head AVN in only one case, comparing favourably to rates quoted in current literature. In our experience, intra-articular biceps tenotomy with the deltopectoral approach was thus not associated with a significantly increased risk of humeral head AVN, even in complex four-part fractures.",

Due to this, treatment is primarily based on surgeon experience with unilateral fractures, however bi- lateral fractures add a level of complexity : loss of functional independence. The purpose of this study was to examine a cohort of patients with bilateral distal radius fractures to identify differences in demographics, mechanism of injury, and outcomes to further our understanding of these rare injuries. 23 patients were identified retrospectively over a 5-year period that met inclusion criteria. The medical records were reviewed with multiple demographic and clinical parameters recorded and analyzed. Males were more likely to sustain high-energy mechanisms (80% vs. 53%). Patients &lt;50 years old were more likely to sustain high-energy mechanisms (90% vs. 46%) and were more likely to be treated operatively (80% vs. 62%). The most commonly associated injury was a head injury (30%). All patients treated non-operatively reported minimal/no pain upon final follow-up where 57% of patients treated operatively noted regular pain. 75% of patients with medical comorbidities had minimal/no pain upon final follow- up. Conclusions : Patients with bilateral fractures were more likely to be younger males who suffered from higher energy mechanisms. Age was a critical factor in determining treatment strategy. Rates of associated head injuries were elevated, which is an important factor for the clinician to keep in mind when treating this population. As we further our understanding of this unique population, we can improve our treatment approaches and subsequently attain better outcomes.",

A comprehensive search of PubMed, Medline, Cochrane, CINAHL, and Embase databases was conducted, with papers published from the inception of the database to October 2020 included. All relevant articles were retrieved, and their bibliographies were hand searched for further references on Posterior condylar offset and revision total knee arthroplasty. The search strategy yielded 28 articles. After duplicate titles were excluded, abstracts and full text were reviewed. Nine studies were assessed for eligibility, four studies were excluded because they did not fully comply with the inclusion criteria. Six articles were finally included in this systematic review. Based on this systematic review restoration of the JL and PFCO in RTKR is associated with a significant improvement in the post-operative range of motion, KSS, OKS, patellar function, and SF-36. Reservation of JL should be a major consideration when undertaking RTKA. Of note, increasing PFCO to balance the flexion gap while maintaining joint line should be well assessed intra-operatively. The upper limit of the PFCO that widely accepted is up to 40 % greater than that of the native knee. 4 mm is the upper limit for JL restoration. Level of evidence III.",

Identifying a neurovascular “safe zone” for this approach is important in reducing iatrogenic injury. We aimed to identify a safe zone for minimally invasive calcaneal osteotomy without neurovascular injury. Three individuals independently assessed 100 con- secutive magnetic resonance imaging ankle studies. The distance of the medial neurovascular bundle from the level of the centre of the Achilles tendon insertion was measured. The points measured were centralised in three planes (axial, sagittal and coronal). The three sets of observations were statistically analysed with confidence intervals and intraclass correlation coefficient was calculated. The mean distance measured by the three observers were 22.91 mm (range 18.2-28.5 mm); 22.81 mm (range 18.7-26.7 mm); and 23.41 mm (range 19.2- 28.4 mm); overall mean 23.0 mm. The mean inter- observer variation was 1.1 mm. 95% confidence interval for observer 1 ranges from 22.45-23.25 mm, observer 2 ranges from 22.52-23.1 mm and observer 3 ranges from 22.97-23.65 mm. Overall 95% confidence interval ranges from 22.8-23.2 mm. Intraclass correlation coefficient for inter-observer reliability is 0.7, indicating strong agreement between the observers. This radiological study suggests an anatomical “safe zone” for minimally invasive medial calcaneal osteotomy is at least 18 mm (mean: 23 mm) from the level of insertion of the Achilles tendon. Individual variation between patients must be taken in to consideration during preoperative planning.",

    "abstract": "It has been reported that the effectiveness of arthroscopic procedures in terms of preventing recurrent dislocation has not matched that from open techniques. Also little is known about how these knots behave when exposed to physiological loading following repair. This study presents the development of a practical tool to allow surgeons to test the quality of their arthroscopic knots and allow them to make choices with regard to knot configuration and suture material. This study uses an apparatus to model the repair of a Bankart lesion. Ten examples of the Duncan loop and SMC knots were tied using PDS, Ethibond, Panacryl and Fibrewire. An arthroscopic knotting technique was used. Reverse slippage occurring during the tying process was recorded. Each knot was then left for 12 hours under loads equivalent to a Bankart repair and the subsequent reverse slippage was recorded. After initial passing of the Duncan loop and after passing of locking hitches the sutures were ranked inversely to size of suture loop (resistance to slippage). Only Fibrewire showed a significant difference (5.7 +/- 1.03 mm to 5.66 +/- 0.5 mm; p <0.05). After 12 hrs, some evidence of reverse slippage was noted, especially with Fibrewire (5.66 +/- 0.5 mm--significant p <0.05). The SMC knot showed generally inferior results. In this study using arthroscopic techniques, Fibrewire performed less well than other materials.",

The aim of this study is to evaluate the late results of treatment of severe unreduced slipped capital femoral epiphyses by combined epiphyseal stabilisation in situ using a single cancellous screw and biplane corrective trochanteric osteotomy. Eighteen hips with severe chronic slipped capital femoral epiphysis before physeal closure were treated by combined epiphyseal fixation in situ using a single cancellous screw, and biplane corrective osteotomy fixed by an angled blade plate. The average follow-up period was 8 years. All patients achieved near-normal hip flexion, internal rotation and abduction, and most were able to bear weight in the early postoperative period. A satisfactory correction of the head-shaft angle was obtained post-operatively on both antero-posterior and frog leg lateral radiographs. There was no instance of chondrolysis, avascular necrosis or early osteoarthrosis. This procedure appears to offer a workable solution to the problem posed by the severely slipped capital femoral epiphysis.",

The position of the screws was assessed on postoperative plain radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans, and the interobserver reliability in evaluation of the pedicle screw positions was studied. The technique was applied to insert 201 pedicle screws in 27 patients with various spine conditions. The positions of the screws were evaluated blindly by two independent orthopaedic surgeons and two independent radiologists. Interobserver reliability was evaluated separately for analysis of plain radiographs and CT scans, as well as for the different spinal segments and for the different spine conditions treated. The rate of malpositioned screws was between 6.5% and 32.8% in plain radiographs and between 3.5% and 6.5% in CT scans according to the different observers. In plain radiographs, the rates of malpositioned screws in the upper thoracic, lower thoracic and lumbosacral spine segments were between 3.8%-39.6%, 10.0%-36.3%, 4.4%-23.5%, respectively. In CT scans, the rates of malpositioned screws in the upper thoracic, lower thoracic and lumbosacral spine segments were between 3.8%-13.2%, 2.5%-8.8%, and 0%, respectively. Interobserver reliability was found to be poor in radiographs and fair in CT scans. The technique used for insertion of pedicle screws was found to be simple and reproducible. Assessment of the screw positions with only plain radiographs was not found reliable. A detailed and standard classification system should be developed in order to improve interobserver reliability in assessing the positions of the screws.",

    "abstract": "Corticotomy and periosteal elevation as a surgical procedure for management of chronic critical limb ischaemia is a relatively new technique. The current study aimed at assessing its safety, efficiency and cost/benefit ratio. The procedure was performed in 36patients. Preoperative documentation for age, sex, co-morbidities, ankle systolic pressure, and magnetic resonance contrast angiography was obtained. Early results included evaluation of skin perfusion. Late results involved assessment of wound healing, which was documented with photographs and was graded (healed, healing, resistant, recurrent), pain (intermittent claudication and pain at rest), Kelkar score, procedure morbidity, patient satisfaction and quality of life. Mean age was 68.03 +/- 5.5 years; 23 patients were males (63.9%) and 13 females (36.1%). Twenty (55.6%) patients had ankle systolic pressure < 50 mmHg and 29 (80.5%) had infra-inguinal vascular disease. Skin perfusion improved in 33/36 patients (91.7%). At final follow-up, 34 patients (94.1%) achieved complete wound healing. Relief from ischaemic rest pain and intermittent claudication was achieved in 86.1% and 55.6% respectively, with 20 (55.6%) patients having an excellent Kelkar score. Only one patient required a major amputation. Morbidity was noted in 17.7% of cases. Patient satisfaction scores at 12 months and at final follow-up were 7.1 +/- 1.3, and 8.7 +/- 1.7 respectively, on a scale from 0 to 10. Quality of life was markedly improved as compared to the preoperative status (overall score: p = 0.05, mental health scale: p <0.05 and pain/anxiety domain: p < 0.001). The procedure appears to represent an interesting tool, which should be evaluated in randomised studies. Our findings support the postulated angiogenic effect of the fracture haematoma.",

    "abstract": "There is no consensus as to the optimal skeletal fixation method for Gustilo-Anderson IIIb fractures. External fixation methods have previously shown higher rates of superficial infection, whilst internal fixation has shown higher risk of deep infection, but lower risk of other complications. This paper investigates outcomes in open tibial fractures based on fixation method. A retrospective review was performed for patients presenting to an ortho-plastic unit with GA IIIb tibial fractures between June 2013 and October 2021. 85 patients were identified. The most common implant was an intramedullary nail (IMN), used in 29 patients (34.1%); open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) was performed in 16 patients (18.8%). 18 patients (21.2%) were definitively managed with a frame alone. Mean follow-up from was 18 months (2-77). Patients with ORIF needed a mean of 3.37 operations; it was 2.48 for IMN which was significantly different from frames at 5.00 (p=0.000). The mean time to bony union after definitive fixation was 11.4 months. This differed depending on the implant used for fixation, with ORIF at 7.1 months, 10.1 for IMN, and frames at 17.2 months; ORIF significantly differed from frames (p=0.009). Superficial infection was common, seen in 38.8% of patients, and only 3 patients (4%) developed deep infections involving metalwork, with no difference in rates of either based on fixation method This study supports that ORIF has faster healing times, with less time to union compared to frames. It also shows that no implant was superior to another in terms of outcomes.",

In this prospective study, a single surgeon treated 20 patients with a (partially) intra-articular distal radius fracture with a dorsal rim avulsion or a dorsal Barton’s type fragment. They all underwent an open reduction and internal fixation by Dorsal Wrist Plating. A total of 17 patients had a follow-up period of at least 12 months (mean follow- up of 17 months) and these patients were included in the study. Both functional and radiological outcome parameters were measured. The total range of motion was 92 % of the contralateral side. The mean grip strength and key pinch were 24.6 kg and 6.9kg respectively compared to 29.5 kg and 7.4 kg on the non-operated side. The average Mayo Wrist Score was 89.7 (range 80-100) and the mean Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score was 4.5 (range 0-9.2). An articular step-off was only noted in 2 patients (1 and 2 mm respectively). Radial inclination was restored in all patients. Palmar tilt was anatomically restored in five patients. In all other patients, the palmar tilt was acceptably restored. There was no significant radial shortening in any of the patients. No infections, no tendon ruptures, no Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, or union problems were observed. Dorsal wrist plating seems to be a safe and reliable procedure in the treatment of intra-articular distal radius fractures with dorsal displacement.",

This case report demonstrates extensive asymmetrical leg edema caused by femoral vein compression based on iliopectineal bursitis (IB-itis) associated with advanced osteoarthritis (OA) of the left hip joint with an outline of relevant current literature. A female patient presented with left hip pain and edema in the leg. X-ray showed severe OA of the left hip. Computed Tomography (CT) concluded a cystic abnormality at the left iliopsoas muscle associated with the joint consistent with IB-itis, associated with a degenerative left hip joint. Hybrid total hip replacement was performed. At three-month follow-up her left leg showed no longer signs of extensive edema and she walked without the use of walking aids. IB-itis is mostly associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). There are no reports which only describe OA as cause of IB-itis. Extensive asymmetrical leg edema can be caused by venous compression of the femoral vein by an IB-itis. If the latter is the consequence of advanced hip OA, a total hip replacement can yield excellent clinical outcomes both functionally and with regard to the edema.",

This case report demonstrates extensive asymmetrical leg edema caused by femoral vein compression based on iliopectineal bursitis (IB-itis) associated with advanced osteoarthritis (OA) of the left hip joint with an outline of relevant current literature. A female patient presented with left hip pain and edema in the leg. X-ray showed severe OA of the left hip. Computed Tomography (CT) concluded a cystic abnormality at the left iliopsoas muscle associated with the joint consistent with IB-itis, associated with a degenerative left hip joint. Hybrid total hip replacement was performed. At three-month follow-up her left leg showed no longer signs of extensive edema and she walked without the use of walking aids. IB-itis is mostly associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). There are no reports which only describe OA as cause of IB-itis. Extensive asymmetrical leg edema can be caused by venous compression of the femoral vein by an IB-itis. If the latter is the consequence of advanced hip OA, a total hip replacement can yield excellent clinical outcomes both functionally and with regard to the edema.",

This study aimed to present clinical and radiological outcomes of talonavicular-cuneiform (TNC) arthrodesis in the treatment of patients with MWS. A retrospective study was performed on 8 consecutive patients (6 female, 2 male; mean age = 50 years; range = 33-64) who underwent TNC arthrodesis using plate fixation with autologous bone grafting for the treatment of MWS. To evaluate clinical status, the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle-Midfoot Score was performed immediately preoperatively and at the final follow-up. In radiographic evaluation, talus-first metatarsal angle (Meary’s angle) was measured preoperatively and at the final follow-up. Solid fusion was also examined on postoperative radiographs and computerised tomography. The mean follow-up was 35 months (range = 24-52). The mean AOFAS improved from 37 (range = 24-53) preoperatively to 85 (range = 80-93) at the final follow-up (p &lt; 0.001). No major intra- operative complications were observed in any of the patients. According to the Maceira and Rochera radiological staging system, 5 feet was stage 3, and 3 feet was stage 4. The mean union time was 10 months (range = 5-15). Radiographic solid fusion was achieved in all but one foot that developed talonavicular non-union. TNC arthrodesis using plate fixation with autologous bone grafting seems to be an effective surgical method for reconstruction of MWS.",

    "abstract": "Objective: This study aimed to investigate the associa-tion between patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), both pre- and post-operatively, and socio-economic deprivation among patients undergoing hip and knee replacement surgeries in the diverse socioeconomic region of Wirral. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, involving 1666 adult patients who underwent hip or knee replacement procedures between 2012 and 2019. Socioeconomic deprivation was assessed using the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD). Pre- and post-operative outcomes were measured using the Oxford Hip and Knee scores. Results: The mean scores for both pre-and post-operative assessments (Q1 and Q2) exhibited a strong positive correlation with PROM scores, regardless of gender, across both hip and knee replacements. However, the mean difference in scores between Q1 and Q2 showed no significant correlation with the IMD decile. Notably, patients residing in areas of higher socioeconomic deprivation demonstrated lower PROMs both before and after the surgery. Conclusion: The Oxford Hip and Knee scores are widely employed for evaluating health status in patients. In our study, these scores were influenced by IMD decile, supporting the holistic assessment approach employed by the treating unit, which does not rely solely on PROM scores as a trigger for arthroplasty discussions. Furthermore, our findings align with the practice of NHS Digital, which publishes PROM scores based on changes in PROM scores pre- and post-operation rather than absolute PROM scores. This approach appears to be less influenced by deprivation in the catchment area, as the improvement or change in scores was poorly correlated with socioeconomic factors.",

Patients and methods: A retrospective study was conducted on five patients with multiplanar angular deformities of the lower extremity combined with limb shortening(n=5). The objective of the study was to assess the effectiveness of computer-assisted preoperative design planning and 3D-printed surgical guide fabrication in guiding precise orthopedic procedures. The study compared various parameters, including femoral or tibial cross-sections, coronal and sagittal deformities, limb length, modified Barthel Index, and post-operative complications. Results: Five patients were granted 17.20±6.83 months of follow-up after surgery, with adequate correction of lower limb deformity, significant improvement in postoperative self-care ability improved Barthel index 90±3.08 points (P&lt;0.05). One patient experienced postoperative wound pain at 3 months, which subsequently diminished significantly by the 4-month follow-up assessment., four cases had no complications. Conclusions: The new surgical method of digital technology-assisted “Z” osteotomy for correction of complex deformities of the lower limbs has remarkable clinical results, can accurately correct multi-planar angular deformities and realize limb lengthening at the same time, being safe and reliable.",

Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is recognized as a complication after ISF and is one of the major causes of early hip osteoarthritis. Study aim: The aim of this study was to characterize the relation between clinical and radiological signs of FAI. Methods: A monocentric study that included all consecutive children treated for SCFE by ISF between 2006 and 2017 was performed. Clinical examination consisted in range of motion (ROM) measurement for both hips, impingements tests and functional scores (Harris Hip Score (HHS) and Womac score). Radiological analysis was based on signs of impingement (alpha angle, anterior head neck offset (OS), anterior head neck offset ratio (HNOR). Results: 36 hips were included. At follow-up, the difference between the mean hip ROM on the SCFE side and the healthy side were statistically significant in abduction and in internal rotation. Ten (28%) hips presented at least one clinical test positive for FAI (FADDIR and/or FABER). All the patients presented a good or excellent functional score. Eight patients (22%) presented all radiological signs of impingement; among these, 3 had a clinical sign of FAI. Twenty-eight hips (78%) presented at least one radiological sign of FAI; among these, 10 had clinical signs of FAI. Conclusion: Despite a high rate of radiological FAI, less than one-third of patients have clinical signs of FAI after ISF for SCEFE. Level of evidence: III: retrospective study",

This work is a retrospective study of 41 patients (45 knees) who underwent MPFL reconstruction using an extensor hallucis longus allograft. The patellar apprehension test, Kujala scale, and EQ-5D European quality of life scale were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively at 24 months.

Statistically significant differences were observed between pre- and postoperative variables on the Kujala scale (p &lt; .001) and the EQ-5D (p &lt; .001). The isolated MPFL presented an increase on the Kujala scale of 41.9 ± 13.4, in contrast to the reconstruction with tibial tubercle osteotomy with an increase of 29.4 ± 16.6 (p = 0.031). MPFL reconstruction with an extensor hallucis longus allograft is a suitable alternative in patients with patellofemoral instability because it offers clinically and radiologically satisfactory results. MPFL reconstruction combined with a tibial tubercle osteotomy can offer inferior functional outcomes to the isolated reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Background: The Ehlers Danlos Syndromes (EDS) are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and patients classically present with hypermobility, skin hyper-elasticity, blood vessel fragility and atrophic scarring. Due to hypermobility, disorders such as joint pain and early arthritis are common. The aim of this study was to assess clinical and radiological outcomes of total hip arthroplasty (THA) in patients with EDS treated in a high volume orthopaedic centre. Methods: A search was performed of the electronic patient record system at our institution from 1998 - 2019 using the search terms ‘EDS’ or ‘Danlos’ and ‘arthroplasty’. Over the 22-year study period, there were approximately 32,000 primary THAs performed at our institution. We collated demographic information including age, gender, BMI, smoking history and medical comorbidities. Implant type, bearing surfaces and size was also documented, with clinical and radiological assessment at last known follow up. Results: A total of n=5 primary THAs were identified in n=4 patients at a median follow-up of 3 years. All patients were female with a median age of 68 (SD 18.9) years and a median BMI of 30.7 (SD 4.5). The majority of patients were smokers, and had a chronic history of low back pain (n=3, 75%). Uncemented implants were used on n=3 occasions with the remainder being hybrid (n=2). Femoral head size ranged from 28mm to 44mm. One patient had a post-operative surgical wound erythema that resolved within 48 hours of onset, otherwise there were no significant wound complications. To date, there have been no documented dislocations, with all patients having satisfactory clinical and radiological outcome at last known follow up. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that total hip arthroplasty can be safely performed in patients with a diagnosis of EDS, with no significant complications in the intermediate term.",

Having a positive effect on both PONV and pain, perioperative administration of corticosteroids might improve rehabilitation and reduce length of hospital stay (LOS) after TKA. Aim of this review is to determine the effect of different corticosteroid dosages on PONV, pain, and LOS in TKA. A systematic search for articles comparing dosage effects of corticosteroids regarding PONV, pain, and LOS after primary unilateral TKA was conducted using EMBASE, PubMed publisher, MEDLINE, Cochrane, Google scholar, and Web-of-Science for articles published from inception to March 17, 2022. 16 studies were included involving 2352 TKA procedures. Most studies showed reduced pain scores in corticosteroid groups and some described better pain reduction in high-dose groups. All studies showed reduced PONV in the corticosteroid groups. LOS was similar in most studies comparing placebo and perioperative corticosteroids. Only one study reported increased infection rates and intramuscular venous thrombosis in the corticosteroid group. Concluding, current literature on corticosteroids use in TKA is highly variable in type, dosage, and timing of administering medication. Overall, corticosteroids mostly reduce pain and PONV with limited effects on LOS after TKA. Only minimal statistically significant and clinically relevant benefits were found in perioperative high-dose corticosteroids compared to low-dose. Given the short follow-up in most studies, it is not possible to evaluate safety of high-dose corticosteroids.",

The first case experienced a chronic wound at the tibial tuberosity. A fistula was excised followed by antibiotic therapy, however, dehiscence at the wound occurred for which an Ilizarov procedure was used. After two weeks the frame was removed and the wound was closed. The second patient underwent osteosynthesis of a tibia and fibula fracture but was complicated by infection. An Ilizarov device was applied for bone healing as well as the skin defect. Nine patients were included in total. Four of them attained enough skin length via the Ilizarov procedure for secondary closure. Three had the frame removed before having full wound covering and needed further granulation of the wound. Finally, two more patients underwent graft reconstruction. Three patients suffered from infectious complications. The gold standard in soft tissue closure remains skin or flap reconstruction, however, this is not advisable in poor overall health and decreased local vascularity. If an Ilizarov frame is present for bone reconstruction, it can simultaneously be used for skin closure. The results shown in the current study indicate that a satisfactory outcome can be achieved.",

We conducted a retrospective study in patients aged 18 to 60 years with femoral neck fractures and investigated medical records between January 2005 and December 2016. Patients were divided into two groups based on implants, screw and plate, used for fixation assigned. In addition, two groups were compared for their complications and functional outcomes, which were assessed with Harris Hip Score (HHS) and Parker Palmer mobility scores. Sixty-nine of 104 patients met the inclusion criteria. Forty patients were treated with cannulated screws, while 29 were treated with a proximal femoral locking plate. The two groups were comparable in terms of their perioperative variables. The overall complication rate (screw group, n = 10; plate group, n = 14) and non-union rate were significantly high in the plate group (p &lt; 0.05). Other complications did not show statistically significant differences. The screw group had better functional outcomes than the plate group, where only the Parker-Palmer mobility score comparison was significant (p &lt; 0.05). Poor reduction quality and Pauwels’ type III fractures were statistically associated with high complication rates regardless of the implants used (p &lt; 0.05). Although PFLP showed better outcomes in biomechanical studies than CSs, we observed poorer clinical results. Therefore, although some of our results appeared to be statistically significant, reduction quality should also be considered.",

Additional inclusion criteria were English- and Dutch-language articles published between January 2000 and December 2022 with at least 8 patients and at least 1 year of follow-up. Results: Seventeen articles were included, 9 covered tenodesis repair, 2 focused on capsulodesis, 3 on direct scapholunate ligament repair using bone anchors, and 3 on a combination of tenodesis and capsulodesis. No difference could be found between the types of surgical techniques in wrist mobility and grip strength. The Disability of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score, Visual Analogue Scale for pain and Mayo wrist scores showed no clinically relevant difference. With all methods, normal radiological values were obtained after surgery. The mean scapholunate angle was less than 60° and the scapholunate gap less than 3 mm. However, at longer follow-up an increase in this angle and gap was seen again. Discussion: This review did not allow to conclude that one technique was better than another to treat scapholunate dissociation because of poor quality of the included studies. Pre- and postoperative values were not always reported, there were insufficient comparative studies, and randomized prospective studies were missing.",

    "abstract": "Although bone tumors (BT) are relatively uncommon among the human neoplasm, they constitute the most frequent tumors in children and adolescents (CAA). Little information is available about the epidemiologic features of BT in CAA. We aimed to present and discuss epidemiological characteristics of BT in CAA in southern Tunisia, regarding the different histological types. This is a retrospective study including cases of BT in CAA collected in the pathology department at the Habib Bourguiba university hospital over a period of 15 years (2006- 2020). A total of 266 BT was diagnosed in our institution (42,7% among all BT in Southern Tunisia) divided into 200 benign bone tumors (BBT) (75,2%) and 66 malignant bone tumors (MBT) (24,8%). The mean age for all BT was 14,2 years (3-20 years) with male predominance (sex ratio: 1,48). The most common tumor was osteochondroma (42.2%) followed by osteosarcoma (14.6%) and Ewing sarcoma (6.4%). For BBT, the most affected age group was the 16 to 20 year - old - group (50,7%) with a male predominance (59.8%) and a predilection for lower limb (66.8%) then the upper limb (16,8%). Osteochondroma was the most common histological type (56.5%) followed by aneuvrysmal cyst (8,5%) and osteoid osteoma (6,5%). For MBT, the mean age was 12,5 years (5-20 years) and the most affected age group was the 11 to 15 year -old -group (59%). Boys were more affected (60.6%), with a preference for the lower limb (57%) followed by the pelvis (15,6%). Osteosarcoma was the most common MBT (60%) followed by Ewing sarcoma (24%). Given their rarity and heterogeneity, the diagnosis of BT is particular in CAA and requires a multidisciplinary approach. The reporting of epidemiological studies remains essential in order to expand our knowledge regarding these uncommon tumors.",

    "abstract": "Background and study aims: While working with increasing costs, hospital enterprises try to develop strategies to provide high quality services. In this study, we intended to perform the cost analysis of total knee arthroplasty. Materials and Methods: A total of 503 patients who were treated with total knee arthroplasty surgery due to gonarthrosis at Nev?ehir State Hospital Orthopedics and Traumatology clinic were included in the study. Procedures performed while the patient is in hospital were analyzed by dividing them into the costs of the implant applied to the patient, surgical procedure, medications used, blood and blood products transfusion, medical tests, anesthesia procedure, bed fee and other applied procedures. Results: The mean total cost was 7560.2 Turkish Lira (TL). The mean cost of the implant applied to the patient was 4847.7 TL, that of surgical procedure was 1800 TL, medications used 371.1 TL, blood and blood products transfusion 38.7 TL, medical tests 38.3 TL, anesthesia procedures 142.7 TL, bed fee 195.2 TL and other applied procedures 122.9 TL. Conclusion: In the cost analyses made in this study, it is observed that the share of implant, surgical procedure and anesthesia costs within the total cost is approximately 90%. It is not possible to cut back on the producedures in this 90% part and to modify them. To reduce the total cost, it seems most reasonable to focus on the costs of blood and blood products transfusion, medical tests, medications used and bed fees.",

    "abstract": "Background and aims: Arthrofibrosis is a complication of intra-articular knee surgery which is caused by intra-articular fibrosis. To date, several preventive therapies for arthrofibrosis have been reported. This systematic review aims to summarize current knowledge about pharmacological arthrofibrosis prevention. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in Medline, Web of Science, and Cochrane library using the search term ‘Arthrofibrosis AND prevention’. Subsequently, articles reporting the effects of a preventive pharmacological intervention against arthrofibrosis were included in this review. Results: 16 studies investigated the pharmacological prevention of arthrofibrosis of which 13 were conducted in animal models. Several drugs improved the range of motion (ROM) in animal models. Bevacizumab (ROM +39.4 degrees), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ROM +18.0-31.2 degrees), and rosiglitazone (ROM +19.5 degrees) significantly increased the ROM. Artesunate, mitomycin c, bevacizumab, hyaloglide, and botulinum toxin A significantly reduced adhesion scores. None of the drugs tested in humans improved the functional outcomes after joint arthroplasty. Methodological differences limited the ability to compare outcomes and, due to poor reporting of methodology, many studies had an unclear risk of bias. Conclusion: This review identified several drugs as potential candidates for arthrofibrosis prevention. These drugs modulate inflammation or alter the activity of fibroblasts. Most studies are conducted in experimental animal models and none of these results are currently translated into a clinical application. Moreover, the methodology and route of administration varied between studies. Nor were dose dependency studies conducted. Future studies should adopt a standardized approach to determine the effects of preventive pharmacological interventions on arthrofibrosis.",

    "abstract": "While many humeral shaft fractures can be successfully treated with nonoperative management, compression plating techniques using at least three or four screws on either side of the fracture are the current gold standard. We hypothesized that a less rigid construct using compression with only two screws on either side of the fracture can provide adequate strength for uneventful fracture union. This is a retrospective review of all the patients who underwent open reduction and compression plate fixation for acute diaphyseal humerus fractures (ADHFs) at an academic Level-1 urban trauma center between 2018 and 2023. Patients treated with compression plating using only two screws and three or four plate-holes on either side of the fracture (Group 1) were matched one-to-one with patients treated using the conventional number of screws (three or more on either side of the fracture – Group 2). The incidence of nonunion/malunion, infection, and implant failure was compared among the two groups. There were eleven matched patients in both groups. The nonunion, infection complications, and hardware failure rates were 0% and 9.1% for the control group (Group 2) and four-screw group (Group 1) respectively. This difference was not statistically significant (p = 1.00). Although convention dictates the use of six or more bicortical screws (at least three bicortical screws on each side of the fracture), four-screw bicortical fixation may be a feasible option for ADHFs treated with large fragment compression plating techniques.",

The aim of the study was to investigate the differences of the reamed versus the unreamed short proximal femoral nailing (PFN), in terms of the duration of surgery and the outcome. The impact of patients and fracture characteristics to the outcome was also evaluated. A retrospective analysis of 158 elderly patients, who sustained intertrochanteric fracture of the femur, with a minimum follow up of one year, was performed. 78 patients underwent a reamed proximal femoral nailing (PFN) whereas 80 patients underwent an unreamed PFN. The duration of surgery, the outcome and the complications between the reamed and the unreamed nailing were compared. A logistic regression was also conducted to estimate the risk factors affecting mortality. The mean duration of surgery for reamed and unreamed G nail was 48,87 min (C.I.: 47,30-50,44) and 42,45 min (C.I.: 41,30-43,60) respectively. No statistically significant difference regarding the need for transfusion and complications, such as wound healing problems and screw cut out was identified between the two types of nailing. The most important factors affecting mortality were the ASA (beta coefficient: 3,127, p-value: 0,002) and the need for transfusion (beta coefficient: 1,367, p-value: 0,05). The only difference found between the reamed and the unreamed PFN was the operation time, which was less for the later one.

    "abstract": "Proximal humeral fractures (PHF), ranking as the third most common osteoporotic fractures, pose a significant challenge in management. With a rising incidence in an aging population, controversy surrounds surgical versus nonoperative treatments, particularly for displaced 3- and 4-part fractures in older patients. Locking plates (LP) and proximal intramedullary nails (PHN) are primary choices for surgical intervention, but both methods entail complications. This retrospective study of 132 patients undergoing surgery for PHF (LP or PHN) aims to identify risk factors for postoperative complications. Results reveal a 31% complication rate, including secondary loss of reduction (17%) and intra-articular screw penetration (13%). Alcohol abuse emerges as the sole patient characteristic linked to complications. Non-anatomical surgical reduction, calcar comminution, and humeral shaft displacement over 10 mm also contribute to increased risks. LP and PHN show comparable complication rates, aligning with existing literature. The study underscores the pivotal role of achieving anatomical surgical reduction in minimizing complications. Surgical technique, fracture pattern, and patient characteristics significantly influence outcomes. Notably, alcohol abuse surfaces as a critical risk factor. The findings emphasize the importance of a nuanced approach to PHF management, tailoring interventions based on fracture characteristics and patient factors. Future research should explore these aspects, particularly in younger patient populations, to enrich our understanding of surgical outcomes in diverse age groups.",

The study cohort includes 53 patients, who underwent surgery for acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) dislocation Rockwood type 3, 4 and 5. Patient-reported outcome scores and clinical results, including Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), the Subjective Shoulder Value (SSV), the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Constant score (CS) results as well as loss of reduction rates on plain radiographs were compared. Nineteen patients in the DB group, 19 patients in the SA group and 15 patients in the WD group were included. Average time of follow up was 5 years. The mean VAS scores (SD) were 0.3 (0.6), 0.5 (0.8) and 1.2 (1.4) in the WD, DB and SA groups (p=0.06). There were no significant differences in DASH, SSV and Constant scores between groups. Loss of reduction on plain radiographs occurred in 4 patients in total (1 WD, 1 DB, 2 SA). The SSV score, the DASH score, the Constant score and the VAS-score revealed no statistically significant differences between the group with good alignment compared to groups with partial reduction or loss of reduction. In conclusion we can state that the use of anatomical reconstruction techniques with tendon allograft and additional button or suture anchors fixation does not affect the clinical and radiographical outcomes compared to the classic Weaver and Dunn procedure. Loss of reduction was not correlated to worse clinical outcome scores.",

Between 2016 and 2020, we performed 59 revision total hip replacements where a dual mobility cup (G7) was used. There were 23 males and 36 females. The average age was 74 years (range, 64-89). Acetabular components were revised in 47 (80%) cases and both the femoral and the acetabular components were revised in 12 (20%) cases. The average follow-up time was 4 years (range, 2-6 years). Average pre-operative and post-operative oxford hip scores were 17 and 36 respectively. The improvement was significant with P value of &lt;.001. Complications were noted in 5 (8%) patients. One patient had dislocation. This patient required re-revision with constrained liner. One patient had intraoperative fracture of the femur and was treated with plate and cables.

With the development of deep learning methods for human pose detection, kinematics can be quantified based on a video and this study aimed to investigate whether a relatively simple 2D multibody model could predict relevant dynamic biomarkers based on the kinematics using inverse dynamics. Six participants performed ten vertical and forward single leg hops while the kinematics and the ground reaction force “GRF” were captured using an optoelectronic system coupled with a force platform. The participants are modelled by a seven rigid bodies system and the sagittal plane kinematics was used as model input. Model outputs were compared to values measured by the force platform using intraclass correlation coefficients for seven outcomes: the peak vertical and antero-posterior GRFs and the impulses during the propulsion and landing phases and the loading ratio. The model reliability is either good or excellent for all outcomes (0,845 ≤ ICC ≤ 0.987). The study results are promising for deploying the developed model following a kinematics analysis based on a video. This could enable clinicians to assess their patients’ jumps more effectively using video recordings made with widely available smartphones, even outside the laboratory.",

(2017)1 was considered clear to more than 80% of patients, which was set as norm value where the questionnaire can be assumed clear and understable. The Dutch translation of the postoperative satisfaction questionnaire by Swarup et al. (2017)1 met the 80% clarity criterion and can be considered clear. This study provides a base for future research assessing the psychometric properties of this questionnaire.",

    "abstract": "Many options are available concerning the graft fixation in ACL reconstruction, one of them being a suspensory device. Our study aimed to compare the strength of two different devices of fixation (suspensory device vs screw) on the tibia. We enrolled 80 patients older than 18 years with an isolated ACL tear confirmed at the MRI, divided into two comparative groups for a prospective study. The only factor which changed was the tibial fixation. The surgical treatment, performed by a unique surgeon, used the same inside-out technique for the two groups, with a ST4-strand graft. Various intraoperative parameters were studied like the time of the tourniquet, the diameter of the graft or an associated meniscus tear. The AP knee laxity was evaluated at 6 months and 1 year after the surgery by a TELOS test. We also compared the two groups with subjective and objective surveys. We can conclude that the suspensory device can offer the same strengthening.",

The study evaluates the clinical and radiological outcomes of PRP intra-meniscal injection in meniscal tears. Forty-eight patients were injected with 3 injections of PRP at an interval of one week with a standardised technique under sonographic guidance. All the patients had MRI evidence of meniscal injury with failed conservative management for at least 3 months. The IKDC score and VAS score were recorded initially and during follow-ups. MRI was performed on at least 12 months post-injection. Medial meniscus tear (n=33) was most commonly present. The mean follow-up of the patient was 14.4 months (Range: 12-16 months) except for 1 patient. Horizontal or oblique tears were the most common injury suffered by the patients (n=35). According to MRI classification, 6 patients had grade 1 lesions, 28 patients had grade 2 lesions, and 14 patients had grade 3 lesions. The mean IKDC and VAS scores improved significantly at the last follow-up. Pain at the site of the injection for 1-2 days was the most common adverse effect. Two patients were surgically intervened at 4 and 6 months respectively. Intra-meniscal PRP injection can be a promising modality to manage low-grade meniscal injuries. It is easy, and minimally invasive to manage meniscal tears. Although there was no radiological evidence of healing, clinical improvement was seen in all the patients. Further, long-term randomized studies are required to ascertain the benefits.",

The mean age was 63.7 years (range, 34–82 years). The average maximum tumor diameter was 15.9 cm (range, 5–28 cm). The maximum tumor diameter (≥20 cm) was significantly associated with local recurrence (p=0.042). Ten patients (16.1%) developed local recurrence, and the mean time to recurrence was 48.4 months (range, 5–161 months).

Subsequently, preoperative data related to predictive factors will be collected from the research subjects, followed by a clinicopathological conference, chemotherapy, and surgery. Afterward, an evaluation of pulmonary metastasis will be conducted six months after the diagnosis. A total of 47 osteosarcoma patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were analyzed. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed statistically significant predictive factors for the risk of pulmonary metastasis in osteosarcoma: ALP levels (p=0.014), LDH levels (p=0.038), presence of pathological fractures (p=0.025), and tumor size (p=0.027).",

Very rarely, brucellosis can cause periprosthetic joint infections (PJI). In this case-based literature review, we summarize the current medical literature regarding Brucella PJI, with the aim to raise awareness among clinicians, particularly in non-endemic areas. We report a case of a woman with a 3 weeks history of increasing hip pain, who was eventually diagnosed with Brucella PJI. We searched multiple databases to identify all case reports on Brucella PJI in humans published from February, 1983 to December, 2023. A total of 42 cases from 38 published articles were retrieved and summarized, along with our case. Mean age was 65.5 years, with sex ratio nearly one. Almost all patients presented with local symptoms and 56% with systemic symptoms. Only knee (n=30) and hip (n=13) prosthetic joint were involved. If performed, culture showed positive results on synovial fluid (74%), intra- operative tissue (79%), and/or blood (38%). Serological confirmation was obtained in 97%. Antimicrobial treatment consisted of a combination of doxycycline and rifampin in most cases, with in nearly half of the cases the addition of an aminoglycoside. The majority of patients (n=24) were surgically treated with a two stage exchange arthroplasty; although other options were successful as well. Brucella PJI is a rare but potentially severe manifestation of brucellosis. Brucella PJI must be considered in patients from endemic areas, especially when another causative agent has not been isolated. If culture results remain negative, PCR or serology should be performed. To date, there is no uniform recommendation for the duration of antimicrobial therapy nor the preferred surgical procedure. Relapse is possible even with adequate therapy.",

Small colony variants auxotrophyc for menadione had been related with false-negative results in culture of patient with chronic osteomyelitis, but menadione supplementation can increase bone culture performance. The purpose was to evaluate the effect of menadione supplementation on isolates in bone cultures, in a cohort of patients with osteomyelitis, Medellín- Colombia. We performed a study of a retrospective cohort with 40 adult patients with culture-negative and chronic osteomyelitis, supplemented with 3 doses of menadione. Effect was defined as the proportion of positive bone cultures after treatment administration. The comparison of the effect with clinical variables was made with Chi-square, Fisher and Mann-Whitney U test in SPSS 29.0. Microbiological isolates from bone culture ranged from 0% (pre- treatment) to 62.5% (post-treatment), mainly S. aureus sensitive to methicillin, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, E. coli and Enterobacter spp. This effect did not present statistical differences according to the clinical characteristics or comorbidities of the patients. We concluded that in patients with chronic osteomyelitis and negative bone cultures, menadione supplementation produces a high proportion of isolates and identification of the etiological agent, which favors correct treatment and reduces readmissions, complications, and resistance to antibiotics.",

Graft incorporation was not consistent in the 4 to 10-year postoperative period, but in cases with more than 10 years follow-up, a major portion of the graft got incorporated into the host bone. A classification system for the incorporated grafts is suggested. The presence of avascular necrosis seems to initially hinder graft incorporation, but if the bone revascularises, graft incorporation proceeds at a comparable rate. This study shows that cortical bone gets well incorporated into host cancellous bone and helps to reconstitute the neck in cases of femoral neck nonunions.",

This article presents the results of a trapeziectomy with a ligament recontruction/tendon interposition procedure. We evaluated 60 male patients with 76 operated thumbs. The mean follow- up was 62 months (ranging from 13 to 133 months, with SD of 33 months). The outcome was measured with the disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand score, a Nelson Hospital score, a Visual analogue scale score and range of motion. The preoperative height of the trapezium was measured and compared with the height of the trapezial space postoperativaly. The disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand score improved from 25.6 to 16.1. The Visual analogue scale score for pain, satisfaction, dexterity and funcion were correlated with each other. On x-ray, there was an average loss of 67% of trapezial height compared preoperativaly with postoperativaly, but no correlation was found with clinical outcome parameters.",

All acute injuries that occurred in Flanders during 2009-2013, collected by the insurance, were analysed. The incidence and parameters such as date of birth, date of occurrence of the injury, gender and diagnosis were evaluated. Injury incidence varied from 7.40% up to 8.45%. Females and players at age 16-17, 14-15 and older than 30 are at higher risk. The ankle/foot region is most frequently injured. There is a higher risk of injury after season-and Christmas break. Age, gender and chronometry are risk factors to get injured. Sprains are the most frequent, while the nkle/foot region is the most susceptible to injury.

Using an imageless computer-navigation system (Stryker©) we prospectively collected measurements of dynamic coronal pre-implant alignment during primary total knee arthroplasty. Coronal alignment of the osteoarthritic knee was determined at maxi- mal extension and 90° flexion. Measurements were subgrouped as varus (≤-3°), neutral (>-3°, <+3°) or valgus (≥+3°). Of 545 osteoarthritic knees (347 females), coronal alignment in extension was 261 (48%) varus, 197 (36%) neutral and 87 (16%) valgus. Varus extension alignment was more common in male versus female knees (p< .0001). Valgus ex- tension alignment was more common in female versus male knees (p= .002). In flexion, 174 (66%) of varus knees remained varus. Coronal alignment remained unchanged (within +3° ; -3°) in flexion versus extension in approximately half of the OA knees observed. This insight into a changing coronal deformity might contribute to a better understanding of osteoarthritic knee behaviour.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the study is to evaluate the accuracy of detecting subscapularis tendon tears on different imaging modalities in comparison with surgical findings. In addition, the accuracy of long head of biceps tendon pathology in assisting the diagnosis of a subscapularis tear was evaluated. Retrospectively, 336 patients who underwent surgery in the UZ Brussel for rotator cuff pathology and had pre-operative imaging at the hospital were included. Pathology of the subscapularis tendon and the long head of biceps tendon on imaging modalities was compared to arthroscopic and/or open surgery findings. 111 of the 336 patients (33.0%) had a subscapularis tear diagnosed during surgery. None of the imaging modalities reaches the cut-off weighted kappa value (k) for substantial agreement of 0.61. Magnetic re- sonance imaging and magnetic resonance arthro- graphy have the highest k of 0.288, indicating minimal agreement with arthroscopy. Computed tomography arthrography (k = 0.167) and ultrasound (k = 0.173) shows both no agreement. Biceps instability was significantly correlated with a subscapularis tear, but the negative predictive value was always higher than the positive predictive value on ultrasound, magnetic resonance arthrography and computed tomography arthrography. The negative predictive value for detection of full thickness tears is as high as 96.2% on magnetic resonance arthrography. Accurate imaging diagnosis in daily practice of subscapularis tendon tears remains a challenge with the best results for magnetic resonance arthrography. The value of biceps instability lies in its negative predictive value rather than its positive predictive value.",

Data was collected using the National Hip Fracture Database data submitted by UHL and split into two cohorts - Pre Covid-19 and Post Covid-19. Data has been collected for 67 consecutive patients in April 2019 (Pre Covid-19) and 87 consecutive patients in April 2020 (Post Covid-19) as of 4th May after the introduction of the Covid-19 measures locally. Data has been collected on demographics- age and sex, ASA, admission time, time of operation, 30 day mortality and length of stay. The average time to theatre in the pre Covid-19 cohort was 27.3 hours and in the post Covid-19 cohort was 45.1 hours. This is an increase of 65.2%. All patients in the pre Covid-19 cohort were operated on and 4 in the post Covid-19 were conservatively managed. However, there were no significant effects on 30 day mortality or length of stay. In conclusion, the measures taken due to the Covid-19 pandemic had a profound impact on the care of hip fracture patients with significant delays in time to theatre.

Active range of motion improved in 83% (25/30) of joints, with a mean improvement of the total arc of motion of 25 degrees. On radiographic assessment, no signs of circumferential lucency or subsidence were observed. Additional surgery was necessary for three out of 32 implants, including implant removal in two cases. 93.75% (30/32) implants survived after a mean follow-up of 33 months. Our results confirm that at least at short term follow up, the MatOrtho PIP arthroplasty can be a successful procedure with high patient satisfaction and functional improvement.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to measure cortex thickness and medullar canal width of the bicipital tuberosity, to evaluate the accessibility of a intramedullar fixation device and the resistance to pullout strengths of the anterior cortex. The final objective was to determine the length of tendon ingrowth size that will be expected when using this surgical technique. A total of 144 computer tomography images of the proximal radius were used. Bone thickness of the anterior and posterior cortex and medullar canal size were measured. The possible ingrowth of the tendon was measured both for an anatomical and non- anatomical reinsertion. Statistical and concordance analyses of results were performed. The average width of the medullar canal was 8,7mm proximal, 7,9mm distal and 7,7mm at the tuberosity. The average posterior and anterior cortex measured respectively 2,5mm and 2,9mm proximal, 3,2mm and 3,2mm distal and 2,8mm and 1,9mm at the radial tuberosity. The possible non-anatomical ingrowth was 7,6 mm on average and the possible anatomical ingrowth was 7,6mm on average. The radial tuberosity anatomy can accommodate the new distal biceps fixation device. The anterior cortex on which the new device relies for support has a similar thickness as the posterior cortex used in bicortical fixation devices which may suggest similar resistance to pull-out strengths. The availability for intra-osseous fixation of the tendon stump may avoids tendon gapping. The intra-osseous length for the tendon stump surpassed reported tendon slippage during mobilization and active contraction of the distal biceps tendon.",

This study aimed to evaluate the location of the radial head fracture fragments and the influence of the Mason type on the size of the fracture fragment. Forty-one radial head fractures (31 Mason type I and 10 type II) with an elliptical radial head were included in this retrospective study and 3D reconstructed. First, the fragments were repositioned to their original location. Next, the orientation of the scanned forearm was evaluated using the position of the longest axis relative to the proximal radio-ulnar joint, and all radial heads were rotated to the neutral rotation. The radial head was divided into 4 quadrants (anteromedial, anterolateral, posteromedial, and posterolateral). The location of the fracture line in correlation with these 4 quadrants was evaluated. All fracture fragments were located in the anteromedial quadrant. Thirty-eight (93%) were located in the anterolateral quadrant. The posterolateral quadrant was involved in 32%. At last, the average fracture fragment size was evaluated according to the Mason classification. A significant difference was found in the average fracture fragment size between Mason type I (38% of the radial head surface) and type II (48% of the radial head surface). It was concluded that there is an important involvement of the anterior quadrants of the fracture. The mean size of the fracture is significantly larger in Mason type II compared to type I.",

In method I (control or gold standard), a transparent plastic graph paper sheet with 2.5 mm squares was placed on the wound to trace the wound edges. This was scanned and analyzed in Adobe Photoshop (PS6) to estimate the area. In the novel method (method II), we clicked a photo with one-inch lines marked (on either side of the wound). This photo was similarly assessed in PS6. A two-sample t-test was used for analysis. Photos were clicked every third day. The time taken to calculate the resultant area was also noted. 484 photos and 1936 values were analyzed. The mean areas obtained were 10690 mm 2 and 10859 mm 2 respectively by methods I and II. The mean difference was 0.824%, 95% CI [-0.05, 1.60] and p = 0.923. The inter and intra- observer variation was < 2% for all readings. The time taken by the novel method was much lesser than the time-tested method (mean = 82 sec vs 178 sec; p < 0.01). The difference in area by the two methods is not statistically significant. The accuracy of both methods is therefore comparable. Our novel method is easier, more cost-effective, equally accurate, safer and reproducible in comparison with the transparency squares method, especially for flat or 2-dimensional wounds.",

A survey was distributed among 141 experts on traumatology and arthroplasty of the knee. The survey assessed the likelihood of TKA surgery after TPF in various patient and radiological characteristics. The level of experience with this of each responder was also noted. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all items. 141 participants were approached and 68 responded (48.2%). Responders were not more likely to proceed with TKA based on fracture types, impaired mobility, multiple incisions for ORIF, body mass index and ASA classification. However, in patients with pre-existing osteoarthritis (OA) and age ≥ 80 a majority would be more likely to proceed with TKA, with respectively 69.1% and 50.0%. The most strongly considered factors were the presence of pre-existing OA, the age of the patient and the type of fracture, with respectively 55.9%, 51.4% and 42.6% of responders ranking it in their top three most important factors. The study showed that the presence of pre-existing symptomatic OA and age of the patient were valued highest and increased the probability of a TKA in acute TPFs.",

Efforts to close the defect with annular repair devices have been attempted several times, but the results were controversial. The present aims to detect whether the annular repair techniques were useful for reducing the re-herniation and re- operation rate. The Pubmed, Cochrane library, and Embase databases were searched to retrieve relevant studies published before January 1, 2021. Continuous variables were compared by calculating the standard difference of the means (SDM), whereas categorical dichotomous variables were assessed using relative risks (RRs). A random-effects model was used if the heterogeneity statistic was significant; otherwise, a fixed-effects model was used. A total of 10 researches were suitable for the meta-analysis, including four different repair techniques and 1907 participates. Compared with the control group, there was no statistical difference with the ODI, VAS-leg, and VAS-back scales for patients treated with the annular repair. However, using an annular repair device was associated with a significant reduction in the re- herniation (p=0.004) and re-operation (0.004) rates. There was no difference between the groups with perioperative complications. However, much more device-related long-term complications happened in the annual repair group (p=0.031) though it still decreased the overall re-operation rate significantly (p=0.006).Our results demonstrated that using an annular repair device was safe and beneficial for reducing re-herniation and re-operation rates.",

    "abstract": "The proximity of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) to the femur exposes the SFA to risks that have serious complications. Although surgeons have used the lateral or medial approach to lessen these risks, they have not been eliminated. Therefore, this study aimed to identify dangerous and safe zones in terms of the SFA that can be used during femoral surgical procedures, using anatomical reference points. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of 50 patients aged between 16 and 60 years obtained from the local institution's database was examined. Radiological and clinical measurements were performed to determine the position of the SFA relative to the femur. The mean age of the patients included in this study was 38.08 ± 9.44 (16-60) years. The average ratio of the distance between the proximal and distal borders of the dangerous zone and the lateral joint spaces (LJS) to the distance between the greater trochanter (GT) and LJS was 0.5722 ± 0.053, respectively. The average ratio of the distance between the end of the dangerous zone and LJS to the distance between the GT and LJS was 0.4108 ± 0.05026. This study found that 40% and 60% of the clinically measured distance between the GT and LJS can be used to determine safe and dangerous zones during femoral surgery. Additionally, the half distance between the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and medial joint space (MJS) and one-fourth of the distance between the ASIS and LJS can be used to determine safe and dangerous zones in patients whose GT are not easily palpated.",

    "abstract": "The last decade there is an exponential increase in opioid related deaths. This is proven to be correlated with the rising medical prescription rates of strong opioids. We investigated whether pain after hallux valgus surgery under popliteal nerve block could be adequately controlled without the prescription of oral opioids, with a single transdermal fentanyl patch. In this prospective observational study with 100 patients undergoing corrective first metatarsal osteotomies we prospectively investigated the adverse effects and need for extra pain medication. The transdermal fentanyl patch was applied one hour before surgery, prior to the ultrasound guided popliteal nerve block. Patients filled out a questionnaire every 6 hours to evaluate the pain [VAS-score], nausea [PONV-score], activity [acivity and ambulation score] and the intake of extra medication. Postoperative pain was well controlled [Mean VAS 2,53]. The maximum mean VAS score [3.93] was recorded 36 hours postoperatively. 63.8% of patients had less pain than expected. No major adverse effects were reported by the patients. Nausea was mainly mild and the majority of patients reported ‘no effect’ or ‘sometimes’ effect on daily activities. In an era where surgeons need to be aware of the threat of overuse of strong opioids, the use of a single transdermal fentanyl patch in combination with an ultrasound guided nerve block can be a good alternative in hallux valgus surgery. The use of the patch seems to obviate the need for oral opioids after discharge. Nausea and vomiting were a concern – as expected –, but only at 24 and 36 hours. On the other hand nausea did not seem to affect activity, as there was a gradual increase in activity score over time.",

The aim of this work is to assess the radiological results of offset restoration and selection of endoprosthesis implant in a dysplastic hip joint. The study group consisted of patients who had a surgery in the period between 2016 and 2018. All of them had a cementless total hip endoprosthesis. The group consisted of 91 patients (96 hip joints), with an average age of 42 years (31-47 years). 55 left and 41 right hip joints. 70 females and 21 males. The control group consisted of patients who were not diagnosed with hip joint dysplasia. The control group consisted of 70 patients (70 hip joints), with an average age of 35 years (19-55 years). 53 females and 17 males. The radiographic assessment included the measuring of medialization and distalization which describe the offset of hip joint. The joint decentration was classified according to Crowe. Based on radiographic measurements we have achieved statistically significant (p<0.05) changes in medialization and distalization parameters. We have not noticed a statistically significant difference for medialization parameter (p=0.8259) after a surgery when compared to the control group. For all patients we have achieved a restoration of correct offset in the horizontal plane. The main idea behind endoprosthesis in a dysplastic coxarthosis is the implantation of endoprosthesis cup in an anatomically correct location. Small screw- in cup and conical stem offer great possibility of restoring correct offset of a dysplastic hip joint.",

As a consequence providing methods that can be implemented to reduce cyst occurrence and also to highlight areas of current weakness in the literature that could be strengthened so as to improve our ability to manage peri anchor cyst formation. We performed a literature review of the National Library of Medicine focused around rotator cuff repair and peri anchor cysts. We summarise the literature whilst incorporating a detailed analysis of the pathological processes underpinning peri anchor cyst formation. There are two theories behind peri anchor cyst occurrence, biochemical and biomechanical. It is our belief that cyst formation occurs as a result of both. The biochemical make up of an anchor plays a crucial role in cyst occurrence and it’s timing post-operatively. Consequently anchor material plays a vital role in peri anchor cyst formation. Tear size, degree of retraction, number of anchors and varying bone density within the humeral head are all important biomechanical factors. Further investigation is required into certain aspects of rotator cuff surgery to improve our understanding of peri anchor cyst occurrence. From a biomechanical perspective these include: Anchor configuration to both the tear and each other and also tear type itself. From a biochemical perspective we need to further investigate the anchor suture material. It would also be of benefit if a validated grading criteria of peri anchor cysts was produced.",

In four of these eight patients, RLLs were non-progressive, without clinical implications. In two cemented UKAs, RLLs were progressive and were revised with total knee arthroplasty. Early severe osteopenia of the tibia (zone 1 to 7) in the frontal view was observed in two cementless medial UKA cases. The demineralisation occurred spontaneously five months after surgery.

    "abstract": "Although various surgical techniques have been reported for the treatment of advanced Kienböck's disease (Lichtman stage IIIB and above), the ap- propriate operative treatment is still being debated. This study compared the clinical and radiological outcomes of combined radial wedge and shortening osteotomy (CRWSO) and scaphocapitate arthrodesis (SCA) in the treatment of advanced Kienböck's disease (above type IIIB) with a minimum of 3 years of follow-up. We analyzed the data from 16 and 13 patients who underwent CRWSO and SCA, respectively. The average follow-up period was 48.6±12.8 months. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the flexion-extension arc, grip strength, Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Questionnaire (DASH), and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain. The following radiological parameters were measured: ulnar variance (UV), carpal height ratio (CHR), radioscaphoid angle (RSA), and Stahl index (SI). Osteoarthritic changes in the radiocarpal and midcarpal joints were evaluated using computed tomography (CT). Clinically, both groups showed significant improvements in the grip strength, DASH, and VAS at final follow-up. However, regarding the flexion-extension arc, the CRWSO group showed a significant improvement, while the SCA group did not. Radiologically, compared to the preoperative values, the CHR results improved at final follow-up in the CRWSO and SCA groups. There was no statistically significant difference in the degree of CHR correction between the 2 groups. By the final follow-up visit, none of the patients in either group had progressed from Lichtman stage IIIB to stage IV. Considering restoration of wrist joint range of motion, CRWSO may be a good alternative for limited carpal arthrodesis for advanced Kienböck's disease.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to evaluate the intraobserver and inter- observer variations of the five primary classification systems for assessing tibial plateau fractures via standard X-Ray, biplanar and reconstructed 3D CT images. Using anteroposterior (AP) – lateral X-Ray, and CT images, one hundred tibial plateau fractures were evaluated and classified by four surgeons according to the AO, Moore, Schatzker, modified Duparc, and 3-column classification systems. Each observer evaluated the radiographs and CT images separately – listed each time randomly – on a total of 3 occasions: with an initial evaluation, and then subsequently in weeks 4 and 8. Intra- and interobserver variabilities were assessed using the Kappa statistics. Intra- and interobserver variabilities were 0.55 ± 0.03 and 0.50 ± 0.05 for AO, 0.58 ± 0.08 and 0.56 ± 0.02 for Schatzker, 0.52 ± 0.06 and 0.49 ± 0.04 for Moore, 0.58 ± 0.06 and 0.51± 0.06 for the modified Duparc, and 0.66 ± 0.03 and 0.68 ± 0.02 for the 3-column classification. Evaluation of tibial plateau fractures using 3-column classification in conjunction with radiographic classifications has higher levels of consistency compared to radiographic classifications alone.",

A literature search was carried out consulting Pubmed -Medline, Cochrane central and Scopus to select randomized clinical trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies or case series, that evaluated functional and pain outcomes after physical therapy in patients aged 65 or over, affected by massive rotator cuff tears. The present systematic review followed the Cochrane methodology for systematic reviews and the reporting was implemented using through the PRISMA guidelines. The Cochrane risk of bias tool and MINOR score were used for methodologic assessment. Nine articles were included. Data concerning physical activity, functional outcomes and pain assessment were obtained from the included studies. The exercise protocols assessed within the included studies were extremely wide with equally different methods of evaluation of the outcomes. However, most of the studies demonstrated a trend of improvement after the treatment, in terms of functional scores, pain, ROM and quality of life. An intermediate methodological quality of the included papers was assessed through the risk of bias evaluation. Our results showed a positive trend in patients who underwent physical exercise therapy. Our conclusion is that further studies of a high level of evidence are needed to achieve consistent evidence to improve clinical practice in the future.",

    "abstract": "Achieving an adequate cast mold is critical for successful nonoperative management of pediatric forearm fractures. A high cast index (>0.8) is as- sociated with an increased risk of loss of reduction and failure of conservative management. Waterproof cast liners offer improved patient satisfaction compared to conventional cotton liners, however they may carry different mechanical properties compared to traditional cotton liners. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the cast index differs between waterproof and traditional cotton cast liners when used to stabilize pediatric forearm fractures. We retrospectively reviewed all forearm fractures casted in a pediatric orthopedic surgeon's clinic between December 2009 and January 2017. Either a waterproof or cotton cast liner was utilized according to parent and patient preferences. The cast index was determined on follow-up radiographs and compared between groups. Overall, 127 fractures met the criteria for this study. Twenty-five fractures had waterproof liners and 102 fractures had cotton liners placed. Waterproof liner casts showed a significantly higher cast index (0.832 vs 0.777; p=0.001), with a significantly higher proportion of casts with index greater than 0.8 (64.0% vs 35.3%; p=0.009). The use of waterproof cast liners is associated with a higher cast index compared to traditional cotton cast liners. Although waterproof liners may be associated with higher patient satisfaction scores, providers should be aware of this difference in mechanical properties and may consider altering their casting technique accordingly.",

The aim of the current study is to highlight the benefits of the medial column fusion surgery in the treatment of this condition. Nine adult patients with rigid degenerative pesplanovalgus (without significant valgus heel deformity) underwent medial column fusion between January 2015 to December 2020. The procedure was combined with subtalar fusion in four patients and lateral column lengthening in one patient. The mean follow-up period was 19.5 months (range, 15–27). Regular clinical and radiological reviews was carried out in the postoperative period. The mean Manchester Oxford foot score was good in 7 patients, and fair in two patients. The mean Meary angle was 5.8 ± 5.4° preoperatively and improved to 0.9 ± 7.7° at final follow-up, and the mean Pitch angle also improved from 12.5 ± 3.7° preoperatively to 23.2 ± 4.1° (P &lt; .001). In a patient, and at a different stage, talo-navicular fusion was added to the medial column fusion.The outcome of this series of cases was encouraging and medial column fusion continues to be a good option in the management of rigid pesplanovalgus deformity.",

A retrospective single center cohort analysis with a total of 71 patients who underwent the implantation of the FNS between December 2019 and December 2021, was performed. 31 males and 40 females were included. There was no exclusion based on BMI, ASA score, Garden classification or Pauwels classification. Primary outcome was the revision rate after FNS implantation. Secondary outcomes comprise the reason for revision surgery as well as the time toward revision surgery and the 30-day mortality. The revision ratio was 11 out of 71 patients (15.5%) with an average time to revision surgery of 10 months. Most common reason for revision was avascular necrosis (AVN) in 45.5%. Other reasons for revision surgery were implant failure due to a secondary fall on to the hip with the FNS implant in place, cut-out, cut-through and malunion in respectively 27.3%, 9%, 9% and 9% of the revision patients. The one- hole plate was used in 72% of the patients. Mean follow-up was 18.07 months (range 6-30 months). Full weight bearing instruction was given to 85.9% of the patients. Partial weight bearing in 14.1% of the patients. In conclusion, the FNS has similar revision ratio when used for femoral neck fractures compared to cannulated screw fixation in literature. The predominant reason for revision is AVN and implant failure with no difference between the use of the one- or-two-hole plate in this study.",

These techniques use bone tunnels in the clavicle and coracoid to insert the Tightrope implants. This multicenter retrospective study compares long term radiographic follow up of clavicular tunnel widening in two groups of patients with high-grade ACJ injury who underwent reconstruction using two different surgical techniques. The first group of 23 patients underwent an arthroscopic single clavicular tunnel ACJ reconstruction. The second group of 23 patiënts underwent an open double clavicular tunnel reconstruction. Inclusion criteria are Rockwood grade III or higher injury and minimum 18 months of follow-up. Exclusion criteria are distal clavicle fracture and additional stabilization techniques. Radiographic results were measured on anteroposterior shoulder radiographs taken at the first and last follow-up. Clavicular tunnel widening is the main outcome measurement. Secondary outcomes are heterotopic ligament calcifications, migration of buttons, tunnel fracture and loss of acromioclavicular reduction. The mean clavicular tunnel widening in the single clavicular tunnel technique is 1.91 mm. In the double clavicular tunnel technique, the widening of the medial tunnel is 2.52 mm and 3.59 mm in the lateral tunnel. The difference in widening between the single tunnel and the lateral tunnel is significant (p=0.003). A very clear observation on all follow-up X-rays was a reorientation of the clavicular tunnels towards the coracoid. The double clavicular tunnel technique has more tunnel widening in both tunnels compared to the single bundle technique.",

    "abstract": "Chronic pain and functional limitations caused by coxarthrosis are important factors in the onset of depression, as there are higher rates of depression in this group of patients than in the general population. Total hip arthroplasty (THA) has been shown to decrease pain and improve function in these patients, which may positively influence the patient’s depressive symptoms. The objectives of the study are to evaluate the differences between patients with depression and patients without depression in the immediate postoperative period (pain and hospitalization time) and to evaluate functional outcomes one year after surgery. Therefore, we conducted a prospective cohort study in which all patients with indications for primary total hip arthroplasty during 2018 were included. Preoperatively, patients completed the PHQ-9 questionnaire, and were classified into patients with depression (if preoperative PHQ-9 &gt; or = to 10) and patients without depression (pre PHQ-9 &lt; to 10). During the hospital stay, postoperative pain was assessed by VAS, and the need for analgesic rescue with major opioids. One year after surgery, the PHQ-9 test was retaken, and functional outcomes were assessed. The results showed that both groups were comparable in terms of sex, age, BMI, and ASA. No differences were found in postoperative pain or hospitalization time. There were also no differences between the two groups of patients in functional outcomes one year after surgery. Therefore, we can conclude that patients with a diagnosis of depression do not present worse postoperative pain after THA. In addition, they show a significant improvement in their depressive symptoms one year after surgery.",

The objective of this study is to evaluate patient-report- ed outcomes and hospital costs of hip replacement six months after surgery. Both generic (EQ-5D) and specific (HOOS) PROMs of general hospital patients undergoing hip replacement surgery in 2021 were conducted. The results of these PROMs were then combined with financial and health management data. The mean difference (SD) in QALYs between the preoperative and postoperative phases is 0.20 QALYs (0.32 QALYs). The average cost (SD) of all stays is €4,792 (€1,640). Amongst the five dimensions evaluated in the EQ-5D health questionnaire, the ‘pain’ dimension seems to be associated with the greatest improvement in quality of life. As regards Belgium, the 26,066 arthroplasties performed in 2020 might constitute a gain of 123,000 years of life in good health. The relationship between QALYs and costs described in this study posits a ratio of €23,960 per year of life gained in good health. Given that in Belgium more than 3% of the hospital healthcare budget is devoted to hip prostheses, it would seem relevant to us to apply PROM tools to the entire patient population to assess treatment effectiveness more broadly, identify patient needs and, also, monitor the quality of care provided.",

The PROMs consisted of the Oxford Hip Score (OHS) and the Western Ontario and McMaster University Index (WOMAC). At a mean of 11.3 years follow-up 32 patients (13.1%) had died of unrelated causes. Of the remaining cohort all 198 patients (212 THAs) have been reached for evaluation. There were no patients considered as lost to follow-up. At a mean of 11.3 years 11 patients (11 THAs) have had a revision of either the femoral implant or acetabular component resulting in an overall survival of 95.5%. There was no statistically significant difference (p=0.564) in survival between the ABG I and II THAs. Radiographic there were no changes between the ABG I and II last follow up.

    "abstract": "Compartment syndrome of the thigh and a pseudoaneurysm of the arteria profunda femoris are rare entities that usually occur independently. Untreated, both can lead to life-threatening complications making prompt diagnosis and management mandatory. The diagnosis of an acute compartment syndrome can be suspected clinically, and subsequently needs to be confirmed by intra-compartmental pressure measurement. Treatment should be done by urgent fasciotomy within 6 hours. A pseudoaneurysm can also be suspected clinically. Various imaging modalities exist to confirm the diagnosis, with duplex ultrasound being the diagnostic test of choice. Treatment is depending on the importance of clinical symptoms and on the size of the pseudoaneurysm. We present the first case in which an acute compartment syndrome of the thigh was complicated by a pseudoaneurysm of the arteria profunda femoris. The pseudoaneurysm was subsequently complicated by hemorrhage and infection.",

Therefore, in this meta-analysis, we aimed to investigate the diagnostic performance of SPECT/CT for identification of aseptic loosening in patients with persistent pain following the total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA). Electronic databases including Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane library, and Embase were systematically searched for identifying relevant published studies from their inception to April 2023. Quality evaluation of the included studies was carried out using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2). SPECT/CT had pooled sensitivity of 94% (95% CI: 92-95%) and pooled specificity of 86% (95% CI: 83-89%) for diagnosis of aseptic loosening. The pooled positive likelihood ratio (LR) was estimated as 6.92 (95% CI: 3.74-12.81), the pooled negative LR was estimated as 0.1 (95% CI: 0.06-0.16), and the pooled diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) was estimated as 89.82 (95% CI: 33.04- 244.21). The Summary receiver operating characteristics (SROC) analysis revealed high accuracy with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.96. The findings of this meta-analysis revealed that SPECT/CT has high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of aseptic loosening in patients who underwent TKA or THA. Therefore, SPECT/CT can be considered as an encouraging diagnostic adjunct, particularly in cases with uncertain results of bone scan.",

    "abstract": "This meta-analysis focuses on the controversial efficacy and safety of microfragmented adipose tissue (MFAT) as compared with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in the clinical treatment of knee osteoarthritis (KOA). We have attempted to provide an evidence-based medicine protocol for the conservative treatment of KOA. Researchers collected and compared randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that used microfragmented adipose tissue and platelet-rich plasma to treat knee osteoarthritis. We searched CNKI, Wanfang Database, CMJD, PubMed, Sinomed, Cochrane Library, and Embase for studies published up to May 31, 2023. Two investigators independently screened literature, extracted data, and assessed bias risk using the Cochrane bias risk tool. The researchers then performed a meta-analysis using Revman 5.4 statistics software provided by the Cochrane Library. A total of 4 randomized controlled trials involving 266 patients (326 knees) were included. There were 161 knees in the MFAT group and 165 knees in the PRP group. Meta-analysis showed a statistically significant difference in VAS scores between the MFAT group and the PRP group at 12 months after treatment [MD=0.99, 95% CI (0.31, 1.67), P=0.004]. This result showed that VAS scores were lower in the PRP group than in the MFAT group, and that PRP injection reduced pain more effectively than MFAT injection. At 6 months after treatment, Tegner activity scale scores in the MFAT group were higher than that in the PRP group [MD=0.65, 95% CI (0.11, 1.19), P=0.02], and the difference was statistically significant. There were no significant differences in the remaining indicators between the two groups. Based on this meta-analysis, PRP appears to be more effective than MFAT in treating KOA in terms of long-term pain relief. However, MFAT was superior to PRP in improving short-term activity function. Overall, there was no significant difference between MFAT and PRP in the treatment of KOA. In addition, MFAT does not increase the risk of adverse events compared to PRP. However, at present, there are few clinical studies on MFAT and PRP, which need to be verified by more rigorously designed clinical trials.",

The overall outcomes of bone transport in treating upper- middle vs. lower- middle tibial bone defects are similar. However, the upper- middle tibia bone defects heal faster than the lower- middle tibial bone defects, and distal transport has a greater adverse effect on the ankle and foot joints than proximal transport.

This study sought to ascertain the efficacy of retrograde intramedullary tibial nails (RTN) for treating extra-articular distal tibial fractures in high-risk patients. Between January 2019 and December 2021, 13 patients considered at high risk for postoperative complications underwent RTN fixation. Comorbidities in the patient sample included diabetes, renal disease, hypertension, severe osteoporosis, hemorrhagic blisters, long-term smoking, alcoholism and so on. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed to assess treatment data, wound complications, infections, hardware failure, time to bone union, and functional outcomes. The mean preoperative waiting time and operation duration was 7.1 ± 1.7 days and 61.1 ± 7.1 minutes, respectively. The hospital stay time ranged from 10 to 16 days, with a mean of 12.6 ± 1.9 days. All patients were monitored for a mean follow-up time of 17.5 ± 3.3 months. All patients achieved fracture union with an average healing time of 5.0 ± 0.7 months. No implant failure or persistent pain was observed in the surgical site. Two patients had superficial infection, but no further complications resulted from the incision. At the final follow-up, the average AOFAS score was 84.0 ± 7.3 points, with an excellent and good rate of 76.9%. RTN appears to be a reliable treatment option for extra-articular distal tibial fractures in high-risk patients.",

We prospectively investigate the efficacy of FNS vs. CCS fixation combined with ERAS in the treatment of unstable intracapsular FNF. 70 consecutive patients with unstable intracapsular femoral neck fracture met the inclusion criteria were randomly divided into FNS group and CCS group (each 35 cases). ERAS was applied in both groups. The perioperative period and follow-up results were compared. The operation time, fluoroscopy time, fracture reduction quality and follow-up time were not significantly different between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05). The blood loss in the FNS group was significantly more than that in CCS group whereas the time to start weight-bearing, fracture healing time, internal fixation failure in the FNS group were significantly less than those in the CCS group (P &lt; 0.05). The neck shortening and revision surgery of the FNS group showed a trend of superiority to CCS group but the difference was not significantly different (P &gt; 0.05). The AVN in the two groups was similar. At the last follow-up, the Harris hip score in the FNS group was higher than that in the CCS group (P &lt; 0.05). Hence, FNS fixation with ERAS for FNF can provide earlier weight-bearing, fewer complications related to the implant, faster healing and better functional recovery than CCS fixation with ERAS, which is consistent with the better biomechanical properties of FNS.",

Prospective data was collected on all hip fracture admissions in patients over 50 years from May 2016 to February 2018 from ISD NHS Scotland to identify length of stay. It was found that patients discharged home via rehabilitation wards were less likely to have returned to their own home by 30 days post admission and were also significantly more likely to stay in hospital for 40 days or more when compared to patients discharged directly home. In conclusion, the use of community rehabilitation units has been thought to improve functional outcome scores for activities of daily living compared to discharge from surgical wards. This study has highlighted increased length of stay using rehabilitation beds also that further analysis is required for care pathways to make the best use of resources available to minimise hospital stay, bed usage/cost of care and quicker return to the patient’s place of residence. It has also highlighted the huge variation across Scotland in the process of hip fracture care.",

    "abstract": "Accurate survival prediction of patients with long-bone metastases is challenging, but important for optimizing treatment. The Skeletal Oncology Research Group (SORG) machine learning algorithm (MLA) has been previously developed and internally validated to predict 90-day and 1-year survival. External validation showed promise in the United States and Taiwan. To ensure global generalizability, the algorithm remains to be validated in Europe. We therefore asked: does the SORG-MLA for long-bone metastases accurately predict 90-day and 1-year survival in a European cohort? One-hundred seventy-four patients undergoing surgery for long-bone metastases between 1997-2019 were included at a tertiary referral Orthopaedic Oncology Center in the Netherlands. Model performance measures included discrimination, calibration, overall performance, and decision curve analysis. The SORG-MLA retained reasonable discriminative ability, showing an area under the curve of 0.73 for 90-day mortality and 0.77 for 1-year mortality. However, the calibration analysis demonstrated overestimation of European patients’ 90- day mortality (calibration intercept -0.54, slope 0.60). For 1-year mortality (calibration intercept 0.01, slope 0.60) this was not the case. The Brier score predictions were lower than their respective null model (0.13 versus 0.14 for 90-day; 0.20 versus 0.25 for 1-year), suggesting good overall performance of the SORG-MLA for both timepoints. The SORG-MLA showed promise in predicting survival of patients with extremity metastatic disease. However, clinicians should keep in mind that due to differences in patient population, the model tends to underestimate survival in this Dutch cohort.

    "abstract": "Clavicle fractures represent one of the most frequent type of fractures. However, there is no consensus on the treatment of these fractures and their relative indications for surgery. The purpose of this study is to determine whether surgical treatment of mid-diaphyseal clavicular fractures indeed results in fewer complications and better radiological outcomes, as current trends suggest, in comparison to conservative treatment. A retrospective multicenter study was conducted between January 2005 and April 2017, involving adult patients aged 16 to 75 years with mid-diaphyseal clavicular fractures. Out of a total of 715 clavicle fractures assessed, 220 met the inclusion criteria for this study. The research encompassed a matched-pair cohort, comparing clavicle fractures treated surgically and those managed conservatively. The consolidation rate was respectively 94.5% In the operative group, and 89.1% in the conservative group. There was no statistically significant difference in terms of consolidation (p-value: 0.219). The surgical group had an infection rate of 1.8%. Additionally, 31.8% of patients experienced hardware-related discomfort, and 43.6% required a secondary surgery to remove the plate. The results of this study reveal a similar rate of consolidation between the two treatment approaches. However, there is a noticeable but not significant difference in pseudarthrosis incidence in the conservative group, which is typically asymptomatic and does not usually require surgical intervention. On the other hand, patients who have undergone osteosynthesis often experience hardware-related discomfort and may require a subsequent procedure for hardware removal. Low profile dual plating might reduce this inconvenient.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to evaluate and compare the clinical outcomes of two groups of patients subject to bi-cruciate retaining (BCR) or posterior-stabilized (PS) implants. It was hypothesized that patients treated with BCR prostheses would present higher flexion and better clinical and functional results than those treated with PS implants. This prospective study included thirty-two patients treated for primary knee osteoarthritis and assigned to two matched groups for their demographic characteristics and comorbidities. Those with functioning cruciate ligaments received bi- cruciate retaining prostheses. In the case of ligaments’ insufficiency, the posterior-stabilised design was selected. The primary outcome was knee flexion, and secondary outcomes included the patient’s reported outcomes as recorded by the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire, visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, treatment- related complications, and surgical time. Complete data were recorded for all patients with a minimum of 2 years of follow-up. This study found a statistically significant improvement in all the analysed clinical and functional assessment tools from baseline to the latest follow-up (p&lt;0.05) for both groups. However, no statistically significant difference was found between the two groups. Furthermore, bi-cruciate retaining design is surgical time. There was no evidence of clinical superiority of bi-cruciate retaining compared to posterior stabilized knee implants. Therefore, further randomized studies with more participants and a longer follow-up on comparing bi-cruciate retaining and posterior stabilized implants in primary knee osteoarthritis could be rewarding.",

    "abstract": "Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) using hamstring autograft presents a greater risk of surgical site infection than other transplants (0.5% to 1.5%). Various prophylactic methods have been evaluated, such as double antibiotic protection with intravenous Cefazolin and soaking of the transplant with vancomycin, which results in a near- zero infection rate. This soaking method has only been studied in vitro, confirming the absence of toxicity of vancomycin on tenocytes. The primary objective of our study was to assess the mechanical quality of vancomycin-soaked tendon transplants at 6 months post-operatively. The secondary objective was to assess the rate of new rupture at 1 year. This is a retrospective, single-center study including patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using a vancomycin- soaked hamstring autograft at Rennes University Hospital between December 2018 and February 2021. An objective assessment of joint laxity by means of the GNRB® at 134N was performed at 6 months post-operatively and a clinical evaluation (Lysholm and subjective IKDC questionnaires) at 1 year were performed. Fifty-three patients aged between 18 and 57 years were included. At 6 months, GNRB® of the operated knee joints was significantly different compared with the non-operated ones but was below the threshold for complete or partial rupture according to the manufacturer’s clinical significance threshold (3 mm for a complete rupture and 1.5 mm for a partial rupture). At one year, 3.8% of our population had an early rupture, the reason for which was technical defects in the positioning of the graft. The stability of knees reconstructed with a Vancomycine soaked ACL graft is comparable with that of the contralateral knee with an intact ACL. Level of evidence : IV, retrospective study.",

Long term ICU admission is associated with a less familiar complication: the formation of heterotopic ossifications (HO). In this case report we would like to emphasize the unrecognized burden of the coronavirus pandemic in patient care from the perspective of the orthopedic surgeon. We describe two patients with major HOs around their hip joints after COVID-19. Current literature underlines the increased prevalence of HO formation in COVID-19 patients requiring long-lasting mechanical ventilation and ICU admission including prone positioning. Preventing HO formation remains a difficult undertaking without obvious evidence supporting a golden standard treatment. We advice early passive mobilization during ICU stay, also during prone positioning, serum ALP follow-up during admission, NSAID administration if possible and a low threshold in the use of radiotherapy of joints with a limited range of motion.",

Two cases were presented: an extra-articular fracture, with dorsal displacement (Frykman type I) and a displaced intra-articular fracture (Frykman type VII). Treatment of choice and rationale of choice were investigated. 158 responses were collected. In case of a Frykman type I, the majority of surgeons would have performed a closed reduction and intrafocal K-wiring (37.3%) or volar plating (34.8%). In case of a Frykman type VII, volar plating was the primary treatment of choice (66.5%), closed reduction and K-wiring was chosen in 24.7% and external fixation in 4.4%. We cannot conclude on a consensus in treatment choice amongst Belgian orthopaedic surgeons. Compared to previous research, an increase in the use of volar plating in intra- as well as in extra-articular distal radius fractures was noticed.",

    "abstract": "Elderly patients who present with an inability to weight bear following a fall, with normal radiographs, should be appropriately investigated to rule out an occult hip fracture (OHF). We aim to identify both the range and incidence of the differential diagnosis of acute traumatic hip pain in a large series of patients investigated for OHF. A retrospective analysis of consecutive patients investigated for an OHF with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. Dedicated musculo- skeletal radiologists reported the MRI scans. All diagnoses including hip fractures, other fractures and soft tissue injuries were recorded. Case notes were reviewed for all patients to identify subsequent complications, management and outcomes. A total of 157 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. 52 (33%) patients had a fracture of the proximal femur. The majority of patients with proximal femoral fractures required surgical intervention. 9 patients who had fractures of the greater trochanter of the femur without fracture extension across the femoral neck were managed non-operatively. 40 (25%) patients had fractures of the pelvis, with a combined pubic rami and sacral fracture occurring frequently. The most common diagnosis was a soft tissue injury alone that was seen in 60 (38%) patients imaged. Injuries to the gluteal muscle group, iliopsaos complex and trochanteric bursa were most prevalent. All patients with soft tissue injuries or fractures of the pelvis were successfully managed non-operatively. This study highlights a wide range of differential diagnoses in elderly patients presenting with acute traumatic hip pain. The proximal femur was frac- tured in 33% of patients imaged for OHFs in our series. The most common diagnosis was a soft tissue injury around the hip and pelvis ; these injuries can be successfully managed without surgery.",

    "abstract": "Obtaining a spine that is well balanced after fusion for scoliotic deformity is primordial for the patients’ quality of life. A simple T-shaped instrument combined with standard intraoperative fluoroscopy can be of great help to evaluate the coronal alignment quickly. The aim of this study was to evaluate if a T-shaped device could predict the postoperative coronal balance. Before finalization of the rod fixation, the balance was checked by verifying the relationship between the T-shaped instrument and the upper instrumented vertebra (UIV), and final adjustments were made to correct the coronal balance. A retrospective study was conducted on 48 patients who underwent surgery to correct scoliotic deformity. Intraoperative and postoperative coronal alignment was measured independently by two observers. The mean intraoperative horizontal offset measured between T-shaped instrument and the center of the UIV was 1,69mm to the right with a standard deviation (SD) of 12,43 mm. On postoperative full spine radiographs, the mean offset between the centra sacral vertical line and the center of the UIV was 2,44mm to the left with a SD of 13,10mm. There is no significant difference in coronal balance between both measurements (p=0,12). With this technique we were able to predict the postoperative coronal balance in all but one patient (97,92%). We conclude that the use of a simple T-shaped instrument can provide adequate intraoperative assessment of coronal balance in correcting scoliotic deformity. Level of evidence : IV – case series",

The current paper, studies the accuracy and concordance between observers reviewing these radiographs. A prospective radiographic and medical note review of ten patients who underwent total hip replacement for primary osteoarthritis, with a mean age of 69 years. Early and 6 weeks postoperative x-rays were assessed for hip profile and version profile using computer aided design (CAD) by two observers on two different occasions. The observers were Orthopaedic surgeons who perform arthroplasty of the hip. The results were analyzed statistically. Dimensions, including Femoral offset, medial offset and ilioischial offset showed a high degree of inter- film and intra-film correlation, with inter-class correlation (ICC) over 0.8. Except of the intra-film correlation of ilioischial offset measured on the post- operative films (p=0.067) by the first rater, all the intra and inter film correlation were significantly over the benchmark of 0.6. In terms of stem alignment, cup inclination and cup version, the intra-film correlation by rater n°2 ranges from 0.574 to 0.975 and were significantly over the benchmark of 0.6, except in the case of cup inclination measured on the 6 th? week follow-up ; meanwhile the intra-film correlation by rater n°1 ranges from 0.581 to 0.819 and none were significantly over the benchmark of 0.6. The inter-rater reliability and inter-film correlation showed a dichotomy of results among different dimensions of the measurement. Dimensions of femo- ral offset, medial offset and ilioischial offset showed a substantial degree of reliability in terms of inter-rater reliability, inter-film correlation, and intra-rater/film reliability.",

Twenty-two patients in our database met the in- clusion criteria for this retrospective study, with at least 6 months follow-up. Fourteen participated and were invited for a clinical examination and asked to fill out two questionnaires. They were evaluated for pain (VAS), impairment (NHS), disability (Quick DASH), opposition (Kapandji test) and grip strength (hydraulic dynamometer). Results of the questionnaires were compared to a cohort study of primary LRTI’s. Kapandji test and grip strength were compared to the contralateral side. Compared to primary LRTI’s, revision surgery showed mild deterioration of impairment and disability. The average VAS score was 2.9 out of 10. Twelve patients mentioned a sense of strength loss, which could be quantified with the dynamometer : a mean of 15.1 kg (operated thumb) versus 20.5 kg (contralateral). There was a relatively small decline of opposition with Kapandji 8.6 versus 9.9. The overall satisfaction was good for 8 patients, fair for 3 and poor for the remaining 3 (mainly based on strength loss). One patient needed a second revision. Failed first carpometacarpal joint replacement can be salvaged by ligament reconstruction with tendon interposition, providing an acceptable functional outcome in 79% of cases studied. However, compared to the functional outcome of primary LRTI’s, mild aggravation of impairment and disability should be taken into account.",

The goal of this study was to assess a potential overgrowth after plating and identify impact on function. We conducted a retrospective study of all pediatric patients who underwent open surgery of the radius and/or ulna diaphysis with internal fixation by plating, in our institution, between October 2013 and July 2019. At last follow-up, functional and radiological outcomes were compared between the operated and uninjured forearm. Range of motion (ROM) of the wrist and elbow, clinical scores, radial and ulnar length were measured. A positive bone length discrepancy of more than 2mm was considered as an overgrowth. Were also studied the radio-ulnar index, radial inclination and radiocarpal angle. Thirteen patients were included. The mean age was 12.1 years old (±3.0 years), they were plated on the radius (10 cases) or on the ulna (3 cases). Mean follow- up was 4.4 years (± 1.8). In two cases, the plated bone (radius) was significantly longer than the uninjured one. There was no significant difference regarding radio-ulnar index, radial inclination and radiocarpal angle. The only statistically significant difference between the operated and uninjured forearm was the pronation/supination range, which was greater in the uninjured forearm (mean 160 ±48° versus 175 ±49°, p=0.01). This study confirms the good functional and radiological outcomes after plating even in a skeletally immature forearm. Level of evidence : IV.",

The University of California, Los Angeles scale, the German classification system according to the Reichsausschuß für Arbeitszeitermittlung, the Tegner score and the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score were used to asses the employment status, sport status and clinical outcome at the time of surgery and at final follow-up, minimum 2 years after surgery. The pre- and postoperative hip knee ankle angle (HKA) were documented. The desired postoperative alignment target was 0°-2° valgus mechanical axis. 30 open wedge HTOs were performed of which 27 patients were retrospectively included in the study. 25 out of 26 patients returned to work and 15 out of 17 patients returned to sport following surgery. Outcome scores were significantly higher after surgery. The mean postoperative HKA was 0,9° of valgus mechanical axis. This study shows excellent outcome in sport and work activity and clinical outcome after open wedge HTO. We furthermore suggest that these outcomes can be obtained with a postoperative alignment of 0°-2° of valgus mechanical axis.",

Secondly, it examined the mobility and the complications in the two groups after the same period of time. The rate of readmission, complications and knee mobility of 32 outpatients (M-age : 61 years ± 10 ; 10 females), were compared against those of 32 birth- matched inpatients (M-age : 64 years ± 8.6 ; 10 females). No patient was re-admitted in either group. Post- surgical complications included one hematoma resorbed at 6 weeks in the outpatient group and three joint effusions in the inpatient group. There were no instances of deep venous thrombosis, failure of primary fixation, infection, or wound dehiscence. Knee mobility was identical between the two groups. This is the first study to compare inpatient and outpatient total knee arthroplasty in a Belgian setting. Our study suggests that day-care total knee arthroplasty in selected patients is possible without increasing the rate of re-admission and complications, and without affecting the mobility at 6 weeks. However, the Belgian financial incentives do not seem to currently promote this surgical approach. These results should be confirmed with a larger sample to define the adequate length of stay after a total knee arthroplasty.",

We remain convinced that improving quality is a continuous concern for medical professionals and hospital management. However, we believe that patients, medical professionals and hospital managers might define quality care in a somewhat different way and we question the methodology of imposing a 2 vast amount of strict protocols as a way to improve quality in patient care. There is no conclusive evidence to support that these uniformly imposed “quality programs” improve patient care, except on safety issues.",

In this study, our aim was to develop an evaluating and reporting standardization for routine hip examinations to define both hip morphology and impingement. A total of 108 patients with routine hip magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and antero-posterior pelvic radiograph (PR) were included in this retrospective study. Alpha angle (AA), acetabular depth (AD), acetabular protrusion, acetabular anteversion, collo- diaphyseal angle (CDA), lateral center-edge angle (LCEA) and Tönnis angle (TA) were measured. The differences and associations between these parameters were evaluated according to imaging modality or plane, and sex. Although a significant difference has been found between the axial AA and the coronal AA mean values measured on MRI, there was also a strong correlation. Coronal measurements were significantly higher. AA values measured in PR and coronal MRI were comparable. Males had higher AA in both planes as compared to females. There were no significant differences between CDA values in MRI and PR. There was a significant difference and a moderate correlation between AD values in MRI and PR. We suggest that routine reports should include a measurement of AA in two planes, and measurement of CDA in PR or MRI. Due to the difference in AD between MRI and radiography, LCEA or TA may represent better alternatives. Checking for a negative Tönnis sign would represent a practical approach.",

A consecutive patient series with pre-operative inflammatory marker levels, an aspiration culture of either hip or knee arthroplasty and intra-operative culture samples from subsequent revision surgery was compiled. This retrospective patient cohort analysis included 128 aspiration. The data were analysed to compare pre-operative aspiration cultures, serum ESR and CRP levels to the chosen gold standard for PJI diagnosis of intra-operative culture samples. A diagnostic algorithm was created using the above tests combined with clinical suspicion index. The values that had the highest sensitivity and specificity of predicting PJI were &gt;5 for CRP and &gt;16 for ESR. CRP used individually had the highest sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of any test (75.0% and 75.9%, respectively). ESR + aspirate had the highest specificity and positive predictive value (PPV), of 100% for both. Using all three tests together the specificity and PPV were higher than the test individual values (95.3% and 85.0% respectively). Based on subgroup analyses the combination of ESR or CRP plus joint aspiration has superior PPV compared to individual tests. ESR and CRP had the highest NPV when used in isolation.

We retrospectively analyzed postoperative CT scans after primary THA to clear the question whether such occult periprosthetic fractures of the acetabulum require particular treatment strategy. Between 2014 and 2018 we identified 115 CT scans of 114 patients after primary cementless THA with elliptical cups using a direct anterior approach. The CT scans were obtained as part of other investigations. Localization of the fracture, patients demographics, clinical (WOMAC, Harris Hip Score) and radiological outcome were analyzed. Fracture and non-Fracture group were compared with regard to demographics and short-term outcome after 1 year. Four occult fractures (3.5%) were identified. Three fractures involved the posterior wall. All patients had an uneventful routine postoperative rehabilitation. Patients with occult fractures showed similar post- operative HHS and WOMAC scores at 3 (HHS p = 0.576, WOMAC p = 0.128) and 12 (HHS p = 0.479, WOMAC p = 0.588) months.

Clinical and radiological short-term outcome was not impaired by the occurrence of an occult periprosthetic fracture of the acetabulum. The incidental detection of an occult periprosthetic fracture of the acetabulum does not seem to oblige the surgeon to adapt the postoperative regime.",

We reviewed the postoperative complications, re-operations, clinical and radiological results of this treatment modality. A retrospective cohort study was conducted. Investigated parameters include wrist mobility (wrist extension and -flexion), strength (grip- and pinch strength), patient-reported outcome scores : Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score (Q-DASH) and Patient Rated Wrist/Hand Evaluation score (PRWHE) and radiographic measurements : scapholunate (SL) angle, radiolunate (RL) angle and capitolunate (CL) angle. Ten wrists were included in nine patients. No revision surgery was performed. Two patients had transient neuropraxia of the radial nerve. Postoperative flexion-extension arc was 112°. Grip-strength was significantly increased after surgery (20 to 28kg). The average VAS score the past week was 1.75 (range 0-6.7), the average maximum VAS score was 3.0 (range 0-10). The mean PRWHE score was 16.6 (range 0- 69). The mean Q-DASH score was 17.95 (range 0-51). The current study indicates that distal scaphoid resection for isolated STT arthritis is a save procedure with minimal complications. It significantly improves grip strength. Mobility of the wrist was similar to contralateral wrist after surgery. Pain postoperatively was very limited (low VAS scores) and good functional scores (Q-DASH and PRWHE) were noted. Our findings support the prior findings that excisional arthroplasty might worsen carpal instability.",

    "abstract": "Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common peripheral neuropathy, caused by compression of the median nerve. Symptoms usually are present for months and aggravate over time. Acute onset of complaints and symptoms, like coldness of the hand, should raise awareness of a possible vascular cause of CTS.Persistent median artery (PMA) is a very rare anatomical variant of the blood supply of the upper limb. The presence of a thrombosed PMA is an extremely rare cause of CTS. In this article a case is presented in which the patient has carpal tunnel syndrome of his left hand, caused by a thrombosed persistent median artery. Conservative treatment, consisting of rest, ice applica- tion and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, failed. Surgical excision of the thrombosis and open exploration of the carpal tunnel was performed, with complete relief of symptoms. In literature different treatment options, like conservative treatment with antiplatelet therapy or surgical excision of the throm- bosis and decompression of the nerve, are described with good results. However up until now, no consensus exists about the golden standard in treatment of a thrombosed persistent median artery.",

This study aimed to systematically review the literature describing the outcome following TKR with the use of a Mini-keel. Electronic searches of databases were undertaken in July 2019 by two experienced orthopaedic surgeons according to the PRISMA guidelines for literature describing the outcomes of TKR with the use of a Mini-keel. Quality of studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist. The initial search found a total of 623 studies from all the databases. Seven studies met all the inclusion criteria and were eligible for critical appraisal and quality assessment. In total, 2,198 cases were included in the systematic review. Thirty-five revision cases due to aseptic loosening were found from the systematic review. Two studies were negative about using a Mini-keel and three studies were positive about it, while the other two studies did not judge the quality of a Mini-keel. There have been conflicting conclusions among studies for the use of a Mini-keel. There remains a paucity of prospective cohort studies between TKRs with the use of a Mini-keel and those with the use of a conventional implant, which makes it difficult to determine the usefulness and reliability of this implant.",

This study was aimed at evaluating femoral growth following proximal tibia resection (PTR) and placement of an extendible endoprosthesis with sliding stem. This was a retrospective study. The demographic and clinical data were collected. All the patients with malignant tumors were fully staged and commenced on appropriate chemotherapy. An expected discrepancy of &gt; 3cm was considered sub- stantial enough to warrant extendible prosthesis. Twelve patients who had follow up full length scanogram of the lower limbs were included for the evaluation of femoral growth. The last available scanograms were used for growth comparison of the femur. The age at resection for all twelve patients ranged from 4-13 years. The commonest histological diagnosis was Osteosarcoma. In the twelve patients assessed for the growth of femur, the mean femoral length was 96% [89%-102%] of the unaffected femur. Distal femoral physeal growth continued after im- plantation of a sliding extendible prosthesis after resection of proximal tibia tumors.",

    "abstract": "Fast track programs have been introduced to reduce perioperative complication rates and to quickly reintegrate the patient into everyday life. The aim of this retrospective case-control study was to identify patient characteristics and patient-independent factors that influence fast track programs in hip arthroplasty. A total of 1138 patients were examined. A hospital stay of more than seven days was used to define the case group. In addition to the causes for the longer hospitalisation, age, sex, BMI, chronic nicotine and alcohol abuse, ASA score, surgical duration, anaemia and blood transfusion as well as concomitant diseases were assessed. The statistical analysis included two-sample t-test, chi-square test and logistic regression analyses. An 95% confidence interval was calculated (p<0.05). 16.9% of patients could not leave the hospital on the seventh day. The main causes were delayed wound healing (69.4%), increased CRP (43.0%>100 mg/l), and internal complications (19.7%). At a mean of 69.2 ± 10.7 years, the age of the case group was significantly higher than that of the control group, which had a mean of 63.3 ± 10.3 years (p<0.001). Cardiac comorbidities (p<0.001), BMI (p=0.023), and alcohol consumption (p<0.001) increased the risk for longer hospitalisation. Significant patient-independent factors were duration of the surgery (p<0.001) and transfusion (p<0.001). Successful application of fast-track hip arthroplasty is possible for every patient. However, longer hospi- talisation and delayed discharge must be taken into account for patients with advanced age, cardiac comorbidities, alcohol consumption, and high BMI.",

This report describes the case of a 51-year-old man who presented with a large Morel-Lavallée lesion on the left calf that was not diagnosed on two visits to the emergency department. Given the deteriorating condition of the skin, we performed surgical drainage of the effusion because the skin was showing signs of major damage. Complications occurred following surgery, with cellulitis in the lower limb caused by Citrobacter Koseri, a gram-negative bacillus that is rarely implicated in soft tissue infections, and wound dehiscence. The purpose of our article is to present the difficulty involved in choosing the right treatment from among the many proposed in the literature, and to inform any practitioner working in an emergency setting about the existence of this often overlooked condition.",

    "abstract": "In orthopaedics, patient reported outcomes (PROMs) are designed to quantify changes in pain and to assess physical function, most often after joint arthroplasty. However, PROMs have some disadvantages, most important is their subjective nature. The aim was to investigate how patient-self-reported-outcomes of general health, disease-specific outcome and physical function, joint-awareness and self-perceived activity- levels are correlated with objectively-measured physical-activity (PA) parameters derived from wearable activity-monitors (AM) in subjects with a hip-arthroplasty. A prospective cohort study was conducted in a group of 32 patients, with a mean follow-up of 10 years after total hip arthroplasty. To assess different domains, the SF-36 (general health), HOOS-PS (pain/functional outcome), FJS-12 (joint awareness) and SQUASH (physical activity) were chosen. Activity-monitoring was performed using a 3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer. No significant correlations between PA-parameters and the FJS-12 and SQUASH were found. The HOOS- PS was significant correlated with BMI, the daily time walking and total-time active and the amount of daily steps. The physical functioning-subscale of the SF-36 was significant negative correlated with BMI and time sitting, but significant positive correlated with time walking, total-time active and the amount of daily steps. Considering the value of PA for maintaining general health, the value of using sensor-based AMs to assess efficacy of treatments in this health related dimension or use it as a tool for patient education, awareness and communication, seems very high.",

    "abstract": "Open and comminuted mid-distal fractures often result from high-energy trauma, and a concomitant poor blood supply often leads to skin necrosis, infection, and bone union. To circumvent such complications, we used limited-reduction and bilateral-external fixators to treat open and comminuted mid-distal tibial fractures with compromised soft tissue. A retrospective series of 34 patients who had open and comminuted mid-distal tibial fractures and treated by bilateral-external fixators with limited-internal fixation were analyzed. Patients were followed for 10-25 months (mean: 12 months) post-treatment and osseous union was achieved in each case. The average union time was 16.3 weeks. Based on the Johner- Wruhs criteria, the retrospective series consisted of 21 'excellent' cases, 8 'good' cases, 4 'fair' cases, and a 'poor' case. The total percentage of 'excellent' and 'good' cases of fracture recovery was 85.29%. Bilateral-external and limited-internal fixators pro- vided high bone union rate and excellent ankle-joint motion. Hence, it is an appropriate surgical approach for treating open and comminuted mid-distal tibial fractures with compromised soft tissue.",

All four guidelines have in common a recommendation for the use of low-molecular-weight heparin except where contraindicated. However, there is little consensus between guidelines relating to which mechanical methods should be used. Given the risk of thromboembolism in trauma patients and increasing interest in this condition clinicians should be aware of local and national guidelines relating to venous thromboembolism prevention in trauma patients.

We report a girl with congenital anterolateral bowing of the fibula with a 24 year follow-up. Asymptomatic bowing of her left leg below the knee was noted at the age of three years. Radiographs showed an isolated anterolateral bowing of the fibula with a normal ipsilateral tibia. Supervised neglect was advised. A spontaneous fracture occurred one year later. A shortening osteotomy resulted in solid consolidation of the fracture. At the age of 27 years the deformity had progressed into a two-level fracture of the fibular diaphysis with pseudoarthrosis. The segment in-between the fractures was resected. Following this, the patient returned to a normal level of activities in just a matter of weeks. She could even participate in recreational tennis six weeks after surgery and was then discharged from the outpatient clinic. Isolated congenital anterolateral bowing of the fibula is a very rare condition and there is no consensus on its treatment. In this case, removal of the painful pseudarthrotic fragment of the fibula led to a good result.",

The classical midline interlaminar approach is often difficult because the facet joint obviates a direct view of the nerve, and a partial facetectomy is required. Consequently, the risk of instability or continued postoperative back pain is increased. The authors performed a microsurgical muscle-splitting approach in an attempt to obtain a direct view of the disc rupture without sacrificing the facet joint. Twenty-eight consecutive patients were operated upon with this surgical procedure. A retrospective study showed that 10 patients (35.7%) had an excellent, 13 (46.4%) a good, 4 (14.3%) a fair and one (3.6%) a poor result, according to the Macnab criteria. No serious postoperative complications were noted. This procedure is safe, effective and less invasive.",

By two years of medical treatment, rickets had resolved and the growth plates of the lower limbs' joints had closed. Non weight-bearing, gentle physiotherapy and bracing led to good results in the hip, ankle and wrist joints and to unacceptable residual valgus angular and rotational deformity of the right knee. Severely handicapped paediatric patients with metabolic bone disorders, non-compliant with bracing and with co-existent soft tissue contractures, are probably not good candidates for conservative treatment of severe angular limb deformities. However, non-operative treatment of minimal or moderate slippage of the proximal femoral epiphysis (as well as other major epiphyses) can lead to good results.",

    "abstract": "Tibial eminentia fractures are avulsion fractures of the anterior cruciate ligament caused with additional injuries like meniscus tears or ligamentous injuries. Arthroscopic assisted internal fixation has become a preferred technique with the development of arthroscopic techniques. We aimed to present our results for arthroscopic assisted double tibial tunnel fixation in patients with displaced eminentia fracture. Twenty patients who were operated on for eminentia fracture between January 2010 and May 2014 were included in this study. All fractures were type II according to Meyers's classification. Eminentia was reduced with two nonabsorbable sutures through the ACL. Two tibial tunnels were created over the medial proximal tibia with a 2.4 mm cannulated drill. The two suture ends taken out of the 2 tibial tunnels were connected on the bone bridge between the tunnels. Patients were evaluated with Lysholm score, Tegner score, IKDC score and examined for clinical and radiological evidence of bony union. Quadriceps exercises were started on the third day. The patients were followed up with a locked knee brace in extension for 3 weeks after surgery and later patients were encouraged to mobilize as pain allowed. The preoperative Lysholm score was 75 ±3.3 and the postoperative Lysholm score was 94.5 ±3. Tegner score was 3.52±1.02 preoperatively and 6.84±1.099 postoperatively. International Knee Documentation Committee(IKDC) score was abnormal in all of the 20 patients preoperatively but normal postoperatively. The postoperative scores of the patients were statistically significant when compared with preoperative activity scores(p<0,0001). Tibial eminentia fractures may lead to pain, knee instability, malunion, laxity, or extension deficit. The technique we have described together with early rehabilitation may give good clinical results.",

The Western Ontario Rotator Cuff (WORC) index is the PROM for shoulder pathology with the most psychometric properties but is very time consuming. The Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) method is a PROM that takes less time to answer and to analyze. The aim of the study is to evaluate the intra- class correlation between these two outcome scores in establishing shoulder function in patients with non-traumatic rotator cuff pathologies. Fifty five subjects of both genders and different ages presenting with non-traumatic shoulder pain for more than 12 weeks had a physical examination and ultrasound as well as MRI arthrogram scan findings that were consistent of a non-traumatic rotator cuff (RC) based pathology. On the same moment a WORC index and a SANE score questionnaire were filled in by the subject. The intra class correlation of both PROMs was statistically analyzed. The WORC index score and the SANE score show a moderate correlation with an Intra Class Coefficient (ICC) of r = 0.60 (95% CI:0.40-0.75). This study demonstrates a moderate correlation between the WORC index score and the SANE score in rating the disability of patients with atraumatic RC disease. The SANE score is applicable in research and clinical practice and is for the patient and the researcher an almost no time consuming PROM.",

This study aimed to use the extent of joint depression and lateral widening in computed tomography (CT) to predict the soft tissue injury accompanying fractures.The study included 23 patients with type Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen-classified 41B fractures. Demographics, mechanism of injury, age, gender, and injury sites were assessed. Post-traumatic radiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and CT were obtained. MRI evaluated the meniscal, cruciate, and collateral ligament injuries, and CT measured the extent of joint depression and lateral widening in millimeters using digital imaging software. The relationship between joint depression, lateral widening, and soft tissue injuries was statistically analyzed. Of the 23 patients, 17 (74%) were males and 6 (26%) were females. Lateral meniscus injuries increased and the risk of bucket handle lateral meniscus tears increased as the CT joint depression exceeded 12 mm (p < 0.05). Joint depression of <5.9 mm was associated with medial meniscus injury (p < 0.05). The mean distribution examination of all soft tissue injuries and joint depression revealed no statistically significant difference between the groups (p > 0.05). Increased joint depression in lateral tibial plateau fractures increases the risk of lateral meniscus bucket handle tear, and decreased joint depression increases the risk of medial meniscus injury. Accordingly implementing the treatment plan and patient management will improve the clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Previous literature has reported changes in the length or thickness of the patellar tendon (PT) following primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This study aims to determine the structural changes in both the length and thickness of the PT after primary TKA using ultrasound (US) and to investigate the association between these changes and clinical outcomes after a minimum follow-up of 48 months. This prospective study used the US on 60 knees of 32 patients (aged 54-80, mean 64.8±7 years) before and after primary TKA to evaluate changes in both the length and thickness of the patellar tendon. Clinical outcomes were assessed with HSS and Kujala scores. At the latest follow-up evaluation, there was a significant overall shortening of PT by 9.1% (p<0.001), in addition to significant global thickening by 20% (p<0.001). Besides, there was significant thickening by 30% in the proximal 1/3 (p<0.01) and 27% in the middle 1/3 (p<0.01) segments of PT. There was a significant negative correlation between the thickening identified in all three parts of the tendon and both clinical outcome measures (p<0.05). The results show the presence significant changes in PT in terms of length and thickness after primary TKA; in addition, increased thickness in PT was more strongly and significantly associated with inferior clinical outcomes, including functionality and anterior knee pain, than shortness in PT. This study also suggests that the US is a viable, non-invasive method for documenting PT changes in both length and thickness after TKA with serial scans.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we aimed to show the results of exchange nail and decortication in patients whose subtrochanteric femur fractures were treated with intramedullary nails and subsequently developed fracture nonunion and nail breakage com- plications. This study consisted of patients presenting with subtrochanteric femur fractures between January 2013 and April 2019 who underwent surgery and later experienced nail breakage due to hypertrophic nonunion. There were a total of 10 patients aged 26-62 years (Avg 40,30, SD: 9,989). Nine patients were smokers, and 1 patient had diabetes and hypertension. Three patients were admitted to the trauma center due to a car accident and 7 patients were admitted because of a fall. The infection parameters of all patients were normal. All patients had pathological movement complications and pain at the fracture site. Preoperatively, medulla diameter was measured with standard radiography in all patients. The diameters of the old nails applied to the patients ranged from 10 to 12 mm, and the diameters of the newly applied nails ranged from 14 to 16 mm. The fracture lines of all patients were opened to remove the broken nails, and decortication was performed. No additional autograft or allograft was applied to any patient. Union was achieved in all patients. We conclude that the use of larger diameter nails in conjunction with decortication will prevent nail breakage, improve healing and provide early union in patients with subtrochanteric femur fractures with hypertrophic pseudoarthrosis.",

Authors carried out a systematic review and metanalysis of the literature on DDH treated in patients aged eight years of age or older. A literature search was carefully performed from June 2019 to June 2020. The articles had to report one stage reconstructive surgical treatment of DDH for patients eight years or older, presenting clinical and radiographic evaluation according to the Tonnis and Severin, and McKay systems. Meta-analysis was carried out using the software metanalyst to perform the pooled effect size Nine studies met the inclusion criteria. They assessed a total of 234 patients and 266 hips. Female patients accounted for 75.7% (eight unknown) and the follow-up ranged from 1 to 17.4 years. The majority of the procedures included an acetabular surgery (93.9%) while femoral shortening was performed in 78%. Acceptable outcomes were found in between 67% (Mckay system) and 91% (Severin system) of the cases. Femoral varus and derrotation shortening associated with redirectional osteotomy of the acetabulum (for those with closed triradiate cartilage) or acetabular redirection/reshaping were the most prevalent combined procedures; this strategy can lead to 60% of acceptable clinical results and 90% of radiographically acceptable results. Therefore, our findings give credence to the recommendation for the treatment of DDH in patients over eight years old.",

Our institution implemented a virtual trauma assessment clinic to reduce attendance to our district hospital which was stimulated by the development of 'safe-distanced' care. The audit aimed to evaluate the impact of our trauma assessment clinic on care provision and presentation to hospital. All patients were managed according to the newly implemented virtual trauma assessment clinic protocol. Data was prospectively collected over a 6.5 week period from 23rd March 2020 to 7th May 2020. These referrals were reviewed twice weekly by a Consultant-led multidisciplinary team. 142 patients were referred to the virtual trauma assessment clinic. Mean age of referrals was 33.04 years. 43% (n=61) were male patients. Overall 32.4% (n=46) of new referrals were discharged directly to their family doctor. 30.3% (n=43) were discharged for physiotherapy follow up. 36.6% (n=52) required presentation to the hospital for further clinical review and 0.7% (n=1) was admitted for surgical intervention. Overall, this represents a reduction of 63% of patients attending the hospital. A simple virtual trauma assessment clinic model resulted in significant reduction in unnecessary attendance at face-to-face fracture clinics enhancing patient and staff safety during a global pandemic. This virtual trauma assessment clinic model has allowed the mobilisation of staff to assist with other essential duties in other areas of our hospital without compromising care.",

Thirty-nine patients were retrospectively included. Functional results and their variations were analyzed at two, six, and twelve weeks using self-questionnaires filled out during consultation (VAS scores, QuickDASH, EuroQol-5D-5L, and EuroQol- 5D-VAS). The duration of work leave was extracted from medical records. Two weeks after the trauma, patients mostly had a very moderate impact of their fracture on their daily life with an average VAS of 4.2±1, QuickDASH of 42.2±20.9, and EuroQol-5D-VAS of 78±11. QuickDASH and EuroQol-5D-VAS scores showed significant improvement between two and twelve weeks of follow-up, decreasing from 42.2±20.9 to 2.1±6 and from 78±11 to 96±6, respectively (p<0.0001). The dimensions of common activities, pain, and autonomy had the most patients in the \"moderate impairment\" subgroup at two weeks. Only the dimension of common activities still had 21% of patients moderately impacted. Twenty-five patients returned to work at an average of 21.8±1.5 days. Syndactyly treatment offers good functional results at two weeks that are confirmed during follow-up, compatible with reduced medical follow-up and early return to work.",

This study aimed to investigate the radiographic outcome, complication and revision rate following percutaneous radial head reduction without fixation in Mason type II fractures. A retrospective study was performed between 2016 and 2021. Data on demographics, dislocation in mm based on pre, one week and at least 6 weeks post-operative x-rays as well as complications including revision surgery were noted. In all patients a 2.0mm K-wire was used as metal bone tamps to reduce the fracture under imaging intensifier until no step was identifiable following an immobilization in a backslap for a week. If no secondary dislocation was noted patients were allowed to actively move the elbow. In 36 patients at a mean age of 38.6±10.7years a percutaneous elevation was performed. The mean displacement at time of initial presentation was 2.2±1.1mm on Coyle and on lateral view 1.2±1.0mm. At initial and final follow up (9.3±2.1days, respectively 64.6±180.8days), the fracture gap was reduced with a displacement of 0.2±0.6mm on Coyle view, respectively 0.2±0.5mm, and 0.3±0.5mm, respectively 0.1±0.3mm on lateral view (p&lt;0.005). The mean surgical time was 14.8±12.2minutes and no complication nor secondary fracture dislocation was observed.

Plate fixation and tripod fixation are two commonly employed techniques but risk damage to soft tissues and implant-related complications. Intramedullary fixation is commonly used in pediatric cases and reduces the potential drawbacks of open fixation. This systematic review aimed to analyze outcomes of intramedullary fixation in adults in terms of function, union, and complication rates. A systematic review of the literature was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines using Medline and EMBASE’s online databases. The review was registered on the PROSPERO database. Studies were appraised using the Methodological Index for non-randomized studies (MINORS) tool. Seven studies were deemed eligible for inclusion (n=55). Mean ages of patients ranged from 31.3 to 44.2 years, and mean follow-up ranged from 9 to 86 months. The Mayo Elbow Performance score (MEPs) was reported in five case series (mean scores 81.8 -97.9) and the prevalence of excellent results ranged from 71% and 83%. Although 100% of fractures united, the pooled complication rate was 24% (range 0-50%). The most common complications were elbow stiffness (7%), superficial radial nerve neuropraxia (7%), malunion (5%), and AVN (1.8%). No study reported any patients requiring revision surgery. Intramedullary fixation for radial head and neck fractures appears to provide a reliable alternative treatment option in terms of union, range of motion, and functional outcomes. Further robust trials direct comparing against open fixation techniques are required.",

The available pelvic computed tomography (CT) scans which were obtained in the diagnostic imaging center with a 1 mm slice width were evaluated. The pelvic type was classified with the help of MPR (Multiplanar Reformat) and 3D (Three Dimensional) imaging modes. All evaluated bony pelvic structures were anatomically intact. 40 types of android, gynecoid, anthropoid, and platypelloid pelvis were determined. CT sections were created in MPR imaging mode. Anterior obturator oblique (AOO) and inlet images were created for anterior column evaluation, while iliac oblique (IO) and outlet images were created for posterior column evaluation. The possibility of obtaining a linear corridor for acetabular columns was investigated by measuring corridor width and lengthon images of pelvic CTs. A linear corridor could not be obtained between the pubic tubercle and the supraacetabular region of 12 (30%) CTs in the anterior column of gynecoid pelvis group. The diameter of the anterior column corridor was below 5.5 mm in 10 (25%) of Gynecoid pelvis group, 5 (12.5%) of Anthropoid pelvis group, and 10 of Platypelloid pelvis group, , and all those scans belonged to the female gender. There was a statistically significant difference between pelvis types in terms of anterior and posterior column diameters (p <0.001). While the android pelvis type had the highest diameter and corridor length in both anterior column and posterior column measurements, the gynecoid pelvic type had the lowest diameter and corridor length. In the evaluations made according to gender, both anterior and posterior column diameters were larger and longer in males than in females (p <0.001). Pelvis type is an important factor which can affect anterior and posterior column diameter and length of acetabulum. Pelvic typing before acetabular surgery can help the surgeon determining the most appropriate patient position, surgical approach, and implant selection. Level of Evidence: Level 2.",

From April 2014 to December 2017, 21 patients suffering from recalcitrant ITB friction syndrome were surgically treated with the aforementioned technique. 15 patients (15 knees) were available for a written retrospective reassessment after completion of a follow-up period of at least 12 months. Residual pain was scored using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The functional outcome was evaluated by two patient reported outcome measurement scales (PROMs), the Lysholm and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score. Return to sport was analysed by duration of the inactivity period as well as by the Tegner score. Overall satisfaction was evaluated using a modified Boyden scale. At final follow-up of one year, the performed intervention resulted in a pain reduction (VAS 4.2 (1-8) to 1.4 (0-6)) and improved knee function (Lysholm 59.53 to 87.73, IKDC 75) with return to sport (Tegner 4.3 to 5.4) after a median of 23.8 weeks (6 to 52). Twelve patients reported good or excellent results (80%) at final follow-up, and 12 patients (80%) would undergo surgery again, if necessary. The treatment of recalcitrant ITB friction syndrome by combining neurectomy of the lateral retinacular nerve with elliptic excision of the ITB resulted in good to excellent results in 80% of treated cases with return to sport in 93%.",

The length of the harvested hamstring tendon is critical to the outcome of the surgery as it may influence the final length and thickness of the graft. The goal of this study was to attempt to establish a relation- ship between the height, weight and body mass index and the harvested length of the semitendinosus tendon of patients having ACLR surgery. This was a retrospective study. The weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) of patients for primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction were noted. The average length of the tendon was noted. The correla- tion between each of these anthropometric parameters and the tendon length was estimated. The range of values for the semitendinosus length, height and weight in males and females respectively were 24-39cm (31.26 +/- 2.93) and 26-35cm (29.26 +/- 2.08); 1.6-1.96 m and 1.65-1.8m; and 52-110kg and 60-106kg. Only the height revealed a moderate correlation with the length of the harvested tendon among the male patients. Linear regression analyses yielded the equation Sem- itendinosus tendon length = 23.25xheight-10.28 at a p-value of 0.002. Patient height could be predictive of the length of the harvested semitendinosus tendon.",

In total, 107 DEGs related to the prognosis of metastatic OS were identified. Then, 46 DEGs were isolated as the optimized prognostic gene signature, and a metastatic-OS discriminating classifier was constructed, which had a high accuracy in distinguishing metastatic from non-metastatic OS samples. Furthermore, four optimized prognostic gene signatures (ALOX5AP, COL21A1, HLA-DQB1, and LDHB) were further screened, and the prognostic prediction model for metastatic OS was constructed. This model possesses a relatively satisfying prediction ability both in the training set and validation set.

    "abstract": "Open reduction and internal fixation of extended lateral column tibial plateau fractures through a tibial condyle osteotomy and limited arthrotomy with the use of free subchondral locking screws is a straightforward and safe technique. However, these free subchondral screws are enclosed in the subchondral bone and therefore virtually impossible to remove after bone healing. The question arises whether these free subchondral screws might hinder a future total knee arthroplasty. In order to refute this, we retrospectively reviewed all surgically managed tibial plateau fractures in our tertiary center during one year and assessed the number, position and configuration of these in situ subchondral screws and K-wires. In addition, we performed a cadaver study, wherein we prepared 7 tibial plateaus for a total knee arthroplasty tibial component placement with free subchondral screws in situ. In this experiment, we demonstrated that free subchondral screws do not interfere with total knee arthroplasty, but they can increase operative time in some cases. We also provide recommendations to avoid difficulties and potential complications.",

Approximately 15000 patients who applied to our spine outpatient clinic with the suspicion of scoliosis between 2011 and 2018 were reviewed retrospectively. 292 patients were included in the study. The patients were divided into 3 groups. Group 1; control group group 2; group with the possibility of developing scoliosis under follow-upand group 3; the patient group diagnosed with scoliosis. Spinal curvature degrees of the patients were measured using the Cobb method. The MPV and NLR values of the patients were compared with the degree of curvature measured by the cobb method. NLR was 2.17 ± 2.10 K/ul in Group 1, 2.42 ± 1.76 K/ul in Group 2, and 2.72 ± 3.91 K/ul in Group 3. Although the NLR of the 3rd group was higher than the other 2 groups, it was not statistically significant. (p &gt; 0.05). MPV was 7.90 ± 1.07 fL in Group 1, 7.95 ±1.39 fL in Group 2, 8.33 ± 1.37 fL in Group 3.MPV was higher in Group 3 and was found to be statistically significant (p=0.024). After adjusting for the effects of gender and age variables on the groups, the difference in MPV between groups became more significant (p=0.017) . While there was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of NLR, it was observed that MPV was statistically significantly higher in patients with AIS.Could this relationship be a promising inflammatory marker for AIS? We think that this question should be answered by studies involving larger patient and control groups.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to demonstrate that measuring the medial gap before bone resection during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) provides an optimum gap adjustment in varus knees. In this study, patients were separated into two groups. Group 1 included patients whose medial joint gap was measured before bone resection and Group 2 included patients who underwent conventional technique without measuring. The medial joint gap was measured with a custom-made gap measuring device up to the point that the knee was corrected and aligned along its mechanical axis. Medial joint gap distances, distal medial femoral bone cut thicknesses, amounts of tibial resection calculated; gap internal distances measured after cutting and the thicknesses of the trial inserts were recorded. A comparison was made between the groups concerning the number of patients requiring an additional tibial bone cut and the distribution of insert thicknesses. Extra tibial bone resections were performed in two (5.7%) patients in Group 1 and 10 (28.6%) patients in Group 2. In Group 1, where the medial joint gap was measured, the need for an additional bone resection was statistically less (p=0.018). In comparing the distribution of insert size by group, the number of patients on whom an 8 mm insert had been used was significantly greater in Group 1 (p=0.024). The findings obtained in this study suggest that measuring the medial joint gap before bone resection in total knee arthroplasty may prevent repeated bone recutting and additional bone resections.",

We present a prospective series of 35 ankle fractures involving the PM, operated for a period of 4 years (2018-2022). Direct posterolateral approach was used in 20 ankles, 15 were operated via a posteromedial approach. Clinical and functional assessment was performed according to the criteria of AOFAS. 14 patients received an excellent score, 16 had good and the rest had an average score. The overall score was 85,4 (54-100). The average range of motion was 50° (15°-55°).Eight patients had superficial skin necrosis along the surgical incision. Thirteen patients need their fibular plates removed due to local irritation. Five patients, operated through a posterolateral approach, had lateral heel numbness suggestive of a sural nerve disfunction. PM is important for normal ankle kinematics. When it’s direct fixation is considered appropriate, the safest and shortest route is optimal. It is determined by the preoperative CT. The posterolateral approach is more versatile, but lead to more complications in our study.",

Our results showed a significant improvement in NRS, ROM and functional scores postoperatively compared to preoperatively for both the Persona and the balanSys implants. Although the flexion ROM for the Persona group was higher at 6 and 12 months postoperative compared to the balanSys, this was mainly a regaining of the preoperative ROM. Throughout all timepoints, there were no statistically significant differences observed in NSAID and opioid usage between the balanSys and Persona groups. Both implants are safe and efficient to use in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. Although Persona had an improved postoperative flexion, this did not have an impact on any of the patient-reported outcomes.",

The DASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) questionnaire has been shown to be improved by a greater margin in the medium term for surgical interventions, than non surgical interventions. However, a study found that PRWE can be considered superior to the DASH questionnaire for DRFs, due to greater specificity to wrist pain and function. Conflicting data makes it difficult to determine surgical vs non-surgical superiority for DRF’s over time with PRWE as a recovery metric. PubMed and Cochrane were searched for randomised controlled trials up to 31.8.23, reporting PRWE over 3, and 12 months. Data was extracted by 2 researchers. The differences in PRWE over time post surgical and non-surgical interventions was assessed using unpaired T testing. 1226 records were screened. 4 studies enrolling 817 participants met the eligibility criteria and were analysed. Significantly lower PRWE in surgical intervention has been identified at the 3 month mark (p&lt;0.001). There was greater significant change in non-surgical intervention between months 3 and 12 (p&lt;0.001). Change in PRWE over time may be a good indicator of functional outcomes in DRFs post surgical or non-surgical interventions. This could inform future clinical trial design and surgical decision-making. Further work is required to design even more user-friendly and digital patient- reported outcomes specifically for DRFs.",

    "abstract": "The use of personal protective equipment (PPE) can significantly reduce staff exposure to harmful radiation and infection. Fluoroscopic procedures in orthopaedic theatre can generate high levels of radiation and good adherence to PPE use is essential to reduce long term cancer risk, including thyroid cancer. To assess baseline compliance with PPE, availability of PPE in theatre and carry out an intervention to promote greater use of PPE. This was a closed-loop interventional study set in a level 1 trauma centre and an elective/rehabilitation unit. Data were collected in 40 cases pre and post-intervention from 26th May-7th July 2017. All health care practitioners present at fluoroscopic screening were observed. PPE availability was audited daily. A questionnaire was used to assess surgical and nursing knowledge/practices regarding radiation/infection safety. An educational presentation was delivered to the groups at highest risk of exposure. 39/41 questionnaires were completed (29 surgeons, 10 nurses). 41% of respondents had taken a radiation training course or felt they had adequate training. There was a significant increase in the use of thyroid guards by surgeons 13/115 (11.3%) pre-intervention to 54/117 (46.2%) post-intervention (p&lt;0.001) and radiographers (p=0.019) post-intervention. Logistic regression showed an 89.7% increased likelihood of thyroid guard use post-intervention and a 12.7% increased chance of thyroid guard use for each extra guard available. A short educational, easily replicated session, significantly improved compliance with thyroid guards by orthopaedic surgeons.",

Indeed, the fluid elapsed after the first postoperative day would no longer be pure blood. An early withdrawal of redon could then be considered. A monocentric prospective study of 25 patients undergoing total knee or primary hip replacement surgery, for osteo-arthritis, was conducted. Redon flow was evaluated in total volume and in composition by the sedimentation study. A qualitative analysis of the content of the redon was also carried out. To compare the elements found in the drained liquid with the blood data, a preoperative and two postoperative blood samples were taken. 18 TKA and 7 THA were included. A qualitative analysis of the postoperative flow of 11 TKA and 5 THA was requested. Decreases of sedimentation volumes and protein levels were found in the drained liquid compared to the blood for both TKA and THA. Our results tend to prove that on postoperative D1, the liquid drained in the redon would be blood, but that the liquid drained on D2 and D3 would be a mixture of blood and serum. Therefore, the real postoperative blood loss would be overestimated.",

Whereas some data is available utilising different approaches, to our belief this study provides the first in vivo FV data in DA-THA using the MAKO™ robot. To improve the accuracy of the femoral stem version in DA-THA, we want to ask the following question: How effectively can we reproduce the native femoral version in DA- THA using the MAKO™ robot? The first 125 total hip cases through DAA with the use of the combined anteversion concept and the help of the MAKO™ robot from a single institution, single surgeon from January 2020 to July 2021 were retrospectively analysed. The native version (NV) and broach version (BV) were determined with the use of the MAKO™ preoperative computed tomography planning software. The data of the NV and BV of 115 withheld patients was normally distributed. The native femoral version ranged from -12° till 33° (mean 7,8° +/- 8,1) and the broach version ranged from -18° till 43° (mean 8,2° +/- 9,9). The Pearson correlation coefficient between the NV and BV was 0,78. The native femoral version can be reproduced by broaching the proximal femur, in a robotically implanted direct anterior cementless THA, with 78% effectiveness. Stem placement seemed to be more precise with growing experience, however this appeared not to be significant.",

The aim of this study is to assess the reliability of different PJI risk assessment scales between two matched pairs of THA groups. This study included 37 patients with PJI following THA performed between 2012 and 2020 (Group A). Each patient in this group was matched, based on sex, age, and follow-up duration, with a control patient who underwent the same surgical procedure without any septic complications (Group B) during the same period. Each patient’s assessment included the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score and a retrospective evaluation using three different preoperative, specific PJI risk assessment scales: the International Consensus Meeting (ICM) Preoperative Risk Calculator for PJI, the Mayo PJI Risk Score, and the KLIC-score. The two groups were statistically compared using descriptive analyses, both for binomial data and numerical variables. Statistically significant higher values were observed in the preoperative ASA score and surgical time in Group A. Statistically different higher scores were determined only with the ICM risk calculator score in Group A. No significant differences were found using the KLIC score and Mayo score between the two groups. We emphasize the reliability of the ASA score as a nonspecific preoperative assessment scale for PJI. The ICM risk calculator was confirmed as a reliable, specific preoperative assessment scale for PJI, suggesting its routine adoption in THA clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Femoral shaft fractures represent approximately 1.6% of all bony injuries in children. There is a first peak in early childhood and a second one in midadolescence. Although femoral shaft fractures are disabling injuries, most heal rapidly without significant complications. Traction and casting were standard treatment up to a few years ago. Duration of hospitalisation was high. Recently however, a variety of operative treatments has changed this picture drastically, resulting in less impairment, shorter hospital stay and reduced cost (1). This last problem is specifically addressed in one of a series of articles in this issue. Gaid and Jeer compared cost of operative and non-operative treatment. Operative treatment reduced the inpatient stay by 75% and the overall cost by 30% to 60%, depending on the method used for non operative treatment. Although an acceptable final outcome is seen with either conservative or operative treatment, we agree with the authors that treatment cost should be considered if both options are justified. In the literature about comparative economics, however, no clear consensus has been reached. Early spica casting has been shown in several studies to be most cost-effective. Still, more than economic considerations, age, type of fracture and family environment should be considered in discussing treatment options. Up to 6 years of age, immediate or early spica casting is the treatment of choice, when no more than 2 cm of initial shortening is present, and no marked instability. The study by Puttaswamaiah et al clearly shows the higher rate of malunion in children older than 7 years of age and with comminuted fractures, when treated conservatively with early spica casting. In children older than 6 years and throughout maturity, treatment modalities have evolved from conservative to operative. Among the operative approaches, flexible intramedullary nailing has taken a major place. Complications are relatively infrequent. A technique-related complication, which can be avoided, is leaving the rods too long, causing painful bursae. Approximately 3% show a clinically significant leg length discrepancy. The study of Gogi et al shows indeed a minor leg length discrepancy in most cases, decreasing over time. Leg lengthening is more frequent than shortening. Barlas and Beg confirm the superiority of flexible intramedullary nailing over external fixation, as the latter treatment shows more complications and slower recovery. They conclude that external fixation should be reserved for open or severely comminuted fractures, which is in agreement with most authors. Pin track infection is the most common complication. Among the major complications are refractures or fractures through pin sites.",

    "abstract": "Abstract More than 130 surgical procedures have been described to treat hallux valgus deformity. The spike first distal metatarsal osteotomy was first described by Gibson and Piggott in 1962. Despite having the advantage of using only patient's material, this technique has been abandoned by most orthopaedic surgeons, due to fear of complications such as breaking of the bony peg and loosening of fixation at the osteotomy site. A group of surgeons at our hospital have performed 422 Gibson-Piggott procedures between 1985 and 2005 with consistently good results. This fact convinced us to revisit the procedure. Thirty seven consecutive patients (43 feet) who had surgery between July 2000 and December 2002 were randomly selected as sample. A Questionnaire based on the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AFOS) Score was used for evaluation. Thirty three patients (36 feet), i.e. 89% responded to our survey. Average follow-up after surgery was 47 months (between 31 and 63 months). Results showed that 30 patients (91%) had no or only mild pain, 29 patients (88%) had no or only slight limitation in activities of daily living and 31 patients (94%) were able to use fashionable or comfortable shoes with no problems. When using numerical evaluation, 28 patients (85%) scored 65 or more points (from a total of 95 points), representing a good postoperative result, comparable with other modern distal metatarsal osteotomies. In conclusion, the Gibson-Piggott procedure was shown to be a valuable technique in the treatment of mild or moderate hallux valgus deformity.",

    "abstract": "We studied the Denham knee prosthesis (Biomet, Warsaw, IN) in revision of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in situations of extreme bone loss or ligamentous disruption including revision from previous hinged implants. We reviewed 34 patients (38 knees) at an average of 7. 5 years after surgery (range 4-12 years). No patient was lost to follow-up although 15 unrelated deaths occurred during the study. There were six failures, of which five were due to infections in patients who received a revision for infection. A further two patients experienced a poor result. The remaining 30 patients had an excellent or good result. In our setting, the Denham TKA effectively addressed problems of loss of bone stock and ligamentous disruption with simple instrumentation and a remarkably small number of implants.",

Considering the incidences reported in the literature, we should have experienced between 22 and 86 cases of acute compartment syndrome. The purpose of this prospective study was to confirm these findings and at the same time to look for possible explanations for this unexpected observation. During a period of one year and four months, 257 tibial fractures were prospectively analyzed for clinical signs and late sequelae of acute compartment syndrome. In 156 of these patients, presenting 158 fractures of the tibia, the pressure in the anterior compartment was systematically measured. No single case of compartment syndrome was diagnosed in this series, and no late sequelae of acute compartment syndrome were noted. The hypothesis we forward for total absence of acute compartment syndrome is the favourable effect of the continuously high surrounding temperatures on safeguarding the arteriovenous pressure gradient and lowering the vascular resistance. We suggest that further investigation should be carried out to study this hypothesis.",

Whole blood metal ions were sampled in 50 patients with bilateral 36mm Corail-Pinnacle THAs. Patients were divided into ARMD (n=10) and non-ARMD groups (n=40), with optimal ion thresholds for identifying ARMD determined using receiver operating characteristic analysis. Maximum cobalt or chromium produced the highest area under the curve (71.8%). The optimal ion threshold for distinguishing between patients with and without ARMD was 4.0μg/l (90.0%=sensitivity, 65.0%=specificity, 39.1%=positive predictive value, 96.3%=negative predictive value). Fixed regulatory authority thresholds missed more patients with ARMD (10%-12% missed) compared to our threshold (2% missed). Bilateral THA patients with blood metal ions below our threshold were at low-risk of ARMD. Compared to currently recommended fixed authority thresholds, our threshold appears preferable for managing patients with these particular implants.",

Patients in the LIA group reported equal pain scores at D0, significantly better PONV scores and pain scores at D2 and D7. In addition to faster mobilisation and elimination of the risks and burden of an epidural catheter and PCEA, LIA delivers equal to better analgesia, and better PONV and general comfort scores.",

We compared these two technical options referring to patients' functional, radiological and ultrasound data. Forty patients were surgically treated for lateral pain- ful instability of the ankle. Twenty patients underwent ligamentoplasty using the Brostrom-Gould technique and twenty underwent a ligamentoplasty by allograft tendon. Patients were matched in age and gender. The assessment was done at 2.5 years postoperatively by functional scores (Olerud & Molander, and Foot & Ankle Outcome), dynamic x-rays (focused on varus and anterior drawer stress tests) and ultrasound examination (focused on anterior talo-fibular and calcaneo-fibular ligaments). No significant difference was found between the two techniques for all scores. Functional scores were more than 75% and the complication rate was low (<10%). Regarding the surgical technique, the tendon allograft could not prove to be more beneficial.",

In our study we collected postoperative vitamin D, calcium and albumin bloodserum levels from 163 patients who were admitted with a femur fracture and from 233 patients who were admitted for an elective hip arthroplasty during the period of 365 days. Results : 84.21% of the fracture population had a vitamin D deficiency (< 20 ng/mL) as well as 77.30% of the elective hip arthroplasty population. There were no significant seasonal differences in the fracture population. 80.27% of the fracture population had an albumin deficiency (< 29 g/L) compared to 38.75% of the reference population. There were no significant statistical differences in vitamin D and albumin bloodserum levels between the under 75 years old age group and the over 75 years old age group. We can make the tentative assumption that systematic screening for all hip fracture patients and all elective hip arthroplasty patients admitted to our orthopedic ward - independent of their age, season or pathology - is justified and we advise other hospitals to implement this as well.",

Orthopedic surgeons specialized in shoulder surgery were invited to complete a survey between November 2013 and February 2015. Seventy-one percent of the approached surgeons com-pleted the survey. Less experienced surgeons (< 6 years) and surgeons from the Netherlands find patient characteristics (e.g. smoking p=0.01) more relevant than more experienced surgeons (≥ 6 years) and surgeons from Belgium. Less experienced surgeons will less likely (p=0.001) perform resurfacing arthroplasty compare to experienced surgeons. The less and the experienced surgeons use similar indications for a reverse shoulder arthroplasty regarding age limit and cuff arthropathy without osteoarthritis. Less experienced surgeon will more likely (p=0.003) prescribe a low molecular weight heparin during the hospital stay after a shoulder arthroplasty. In this survey, we found a decrease in the use of resurfacing arthroplasty and a strong increase in the use of reverse shoulder arthroplasty.

The projections show a shift in performing procedures at younger age. Forecasts of length of stay indicate a substantial shortening. By 2025, the required number of hospital beds will be halved.

Taking standard radiography as the reference, there were no relevant differences between the handheld device and optical navigation in terms of measure- ment of accuracy or in outlier occurrence.

The aim of this study is to discuss the functional outcome, clinical outcome and pain scores of these fractures and to analyze these outcome results based on fracture location. A systematic review in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines was conducted. Pubmed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane library and Ovid have been screened. A total of 78 RTSA in 12 articles were retained for qualitative analysis. The average minimum follow- up was 33.3 ± 14.4 months (range 12-60 months) and the mean age was 74.4 ± 5.6 years (range 63-85 years) with a mean female percentage of 90.9%. Overall, the mean DASH score was 39.8 ± 9.4 points (range 29.5- 48.0 points), ASES score 53.4 ± 23.3 points (range 13.3-95.0 points), SST 3.2 ± 2.2 points (range 0.0- 5.1 points), the only OSS 28.0 points and Constant- Murley shoulder score 50.5 ± 20.0 points (range 31.5- 69.0).

The VAS score averaged of 3.8 ± 2.8 points (range 0.8-9.0 points). A subgroup analysis of acromial and scapular spine fractures was performed. Acromial and scapular spine fractures have an undeniable effect on RTSA outcomes, however patients still improve compared to their preoperative state.

Three pelvic antero-posterior radiographs have been studied for each patient, one at 2 postoperative months, one at 1 postoperative year and one at the latest clinical follow up (mean 76 postoperative months). The shelf gap decreased from 108% at 2 months to 104% at the last follow-up (p<0.001). There was an increase of the total acetabular depth to 168% by the presence of the shelf graft (p<0.001).

A progressive remodeling with shelf gap reduction was occurring during the following months after the surgery. An increase of the total acetabular depth and a decrease of the migration index without a lateral overgrowth of the paleo-acetabulum was observed.

In less than 1% of cases, complications are clinically significant and include mainly haema-toma and bleeding. We present a case of acute compartment syndrome (ACS) following CNB of the proximal fibula. A 26-year-old female patient was referred to our sarcoma center with a suspicion of giant cell tumor (GCT) of the proximal fibula. The CT-guided CNB under local anesthesia had caused transient severe pain irradiating to the foot, rapidly subsiding after correction of the needle trajectory. The patient was discharged on the same day without residual symptoms. She presented at the emergency department 48 hours later with severe leg pain and swelling. Compartment pressure was elevated. Urgent fasciotomies were performed, revealing muscle edema, without significant haematoma. Postoperatively, paresthesia improved progressively and the patient regained a normal neurologic status within 4 months. Pathologic analysis confirmed the diagnosis of GCT, which was resected after neoadjuvant denosumab therapy. At the 2-year follow up visit, the patient still presented pain at exertion, but had no objective neurological sequela. ACS is not a well-known complication of CNB in the diagnosis of bone tumors. This rare complication might be diagnosed too late, or even missed, due to pre-existing pain, which can sometimes be severe in GCT, and to the usually short post-procedure surveillance in an outpatient procedure.",

    "abstract": "Robert Danis (1880-1962) was a Belgian general surgeon mostly remembered for his contributions in the field of bone and joint surgery, a medical subdiscipline currently known as orthopaedic trauma surgery. He initiated this with his first book (1) on the subject in 1932. Danis was the first to develop a concept for biomechanically stable internal fracture fixation, creating and producing his own screws and plates with self-developed machine tools. In 1938 he produced a steel plate with screws that exerted axial compression during use. A device known as the coapteur. By 1949 he had reported on 1500 clinical cases. His surgical technique with bone frag- ment repositioning and plate fixation allowed early movement and rehabilitation, one of the four main principles of the AO/ASIF [Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen/Association for the Study of Internal Fixation] which is the AO Foundation today. Danis' clinical and scientific work caught the attention of Maurice Muller, a swiss surgeon and researcher, who was the originator of the AO/ASIF and one of its founders later on. Both surgeons met personally in Brussels in 1950.",

In order to determine MSIS criteria, pre-operative blood tests, as well as bacteriological, cytological and histological analyses of intraoperative tissues were performed. The synovasure test was performed following the protocol on articular fluid intraoperatively and showed a sensitivity of 83.3%, a specificity of 95.7%, a positive predictive value of 83.3% and a negative predictive value of 95.7%.",

We evaluated feasibility, complications and early functional outcome. There were no major complications. Postoperative leg length discrepancy was on average +0.6mm and offset -0.5mm. The mean acetabular cup inclination was 42.0° and the mean anteversion was 14.5°. The mean WOMAC score was 46 before, 76 at 1 month and 86 at 3 months after surgery. Functional scores (OARSI) were significantly improved at 3 months. Superior in situ total hip replacement is a reliable and reproducible technique with an excellent clinical outcome. It is an iteration to the posterior approach, hence the learning curve is steep and if needed, conversion to a standard posterior approach is possible.",

Objectives of the study were to determine the feasibility and tolerance of the procedure. Methods Patients older than 60 years were recruited when presenting at the emergency departments with a low-energy pertrochanteric fracture on one side and with a fracture risk assessed for the contralateral side with BMD, T-Score or other bone quality evaluation tool, FRAX index, or fall risk assessment. Pain and functional ability were assessed at the different follow-up visits using VAS, WOMAC and OHS-12 scores. Results Twelve patients were included and reached a one-year follow-up. Mean age was 82 years old (65 - 91). The average hospital stay was 13 days (3 - 29). The prophylactic surgery did not delay the hospital discharge for any patient. The procedure did not lead to unresolvable serious adverse events. At 3 weeks, all patients were able to walk 6 meters, half of them in less of 30 seconds. Minimal pain was reported all along the follow-up visits, except at 3 years when one patient presented high pain in both hips. WOMAC and OHS-12 scores showed a moderate to mild hip impairment. Conclusion The good short and medium-term outcomes of this pilot study demonstrate the feasibility and the tolerability of the device. Further studies should focus on the efficacy of this immediate and lasting bone reinforcement technique.",

Our aim was to assess the reliability of the measurements of the displacement and the treatment recommendations of these fractures. The maximum displacement of 57 children with displaced humeral medial epicondyle fractures was analyzed on radiographs by six raters (4 paediatric surgeons, 2 paediatric radiologists) at two time points. In addition, the four surgeons recorded their treatment recommendation. Intraobserver and interobserver reliability were calculated with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Kappa values. The ICC for the intraobserver reliability ranged between 0.67 and 0.93. The raters disagreed with their own measurements between 8.8% and 28.1%. The ICC for the interobserver reliability of all six raters was 0.90 for measurement 1 and 0.93 for measurement 2. All six raters disagreed (difference > 2mm) in 93% of the cases in measurement 1 and in 91.2% in measurement 2. Treatment recommendations of the four paediatric surgeons between the two time points differed in 5.3% to 28.1% of the cases. Furthermore, the treatment recommendations were concordant in 24 cases (42%) at time point 1 and 32 cases (56.1%) at time point 2. In displaced paediatric medial epicondyle fractures, disagreement regarding measurement of displacement and recommendation for treatment is high. Validated and standardized measurement tools and a clear threshold for operative fixation of displaced medial epicondyle fractures are needed.",

    "abstract": "Fractured neck of femur is a common but potentially devastating complication of frailty. In other surgical specialities, there is an inverse relationship between surgical experience and duration of surgery; however, this has not been quantified in hip trauma. In perioperative hip fracture care, prolonged surgery may be associated with increased morbidity and significantly impacts on the conduct of anaesthesia. Specifically, low-dose spinal anaesthesia, which is associated with improved haemodynamic stability, cannot be used if surgery is likely to be prolonged. We studied the duration of hip fracture surgery undertaken in our institution and compared this to surgical expertise. We retrospectively explored our theatre database to identify patients who underwent hip fracture surgery in our hospital over a 62-month period, recording duration of surgery and primary operating surgeon. Surgeons were classified into one of 3 groups: Consultant hip surgeon (specialist interest in hip surgery), Consultant orthopaedic surgeon but non-hip specialist, or Non-consultant (trainee or non-training grade). We identified 1426 hip fracture procedures. Consultant hip surgeons performed all types of hip fracture surgery faster, and with reduced variation in surgical duration, than did either non-hip specialist consultants or non-consultant grades. Consultant hip surgeons consistently performed hip fracture surgery in under 60 minutes. Specialist consultant hip surgeons make low-dose spinal anaesthesia (with shorter block duration but increased haemodynamic stability) feasible. Our data supports the development of dedicated hip fracture trauma lists where patients should be operated on by specialist hip surgeons or trainees directly under their supervision.",

Group (A) including 28 patients operated with zero- profile implant and group (B) including 26 patients operated with integrated cage-plate implant. Mean operative time, blood loss, incidence of dysphagia and any other complications related to the procedure were recorded and compared. Patients were assessed radiologically by measuring cervical lordosis using the Cobb angle and the segmental angle. Patients were assessed clinically by the Japanese orthopedic association score and the neck disability index. These values were also compared. The mean age of the patients in group (A) was 49.5±11 years, and in group (B) it was 49.8±11.6 years. Mean blood loss and operative time in group (A) were 77.3±9.4 ml and 72.1±7.9 minutes, while in group B, they were 80.7±9.5 ml and 74.8±8.4 minutes with no statistically significant difference between both groups. There were also no statistically significant difference between both groups as regards incidence of dysphagia, clinical scores nor radiological parameters. In conclusion, both zero-profile implant and integrated cage-plate implant have comparable satisfactory clinical and radiological results in treatment of single level cervical disc diseases with little complications.",

The total hospitalization period (3,05 days) was significantly shorter in pandemic than the same period of the last year (8,06 days). (p<0.05). No complications and mortality were observed in any of our patients with faster trauma treatment strategy in pandemic. The operation of orthopedic trauma patients requiring surgery during a pandemic in a shorter time than normal time will not increase the complication and mortality, but will also help to use the bed more effectively by reducing the hospital stay.",

We wanted to determine whether or not running whipstitches all over the graft affected the risk of iterative rupture and the overall outcome of the procedure. Two groups of 32 patients comparable in terms of sex, age, sport level and type of sport practiced were recruited in this prospective cohort study. DT4 SAMBBA was performed for all patients by a single surgeon. One cohort was treated with a full length running whipstitches during SAMBBA DT4 transplant preparation (F), the other had a classical SAMBBA DT4 graft preparation (NO F). The ACL RSI, subjective IKDC and KOOS scores were established preoperatively and with a 4 years follow-up. Complication rates (iterative rupture, cyclops syndrome) as well as pre and postoperative score variations were calculated. No statistically significant difference in terms of frequency of iterative rupture or complications could be demonstrated (NO F 9.3% vs F 3.1%, p = 0.61). There was no difference either on score variations compared pre and post operatively. Full running whipstitches of the DT4 SAMBBA transplant does not seem to influence the ligamentoplasty outcomes with a 4 years follow-up.",

A search was conducted using the Pubmed, Medline and Web of Science databases. Barometric pressure, temperature and humidity are the weather conditions that are found to be correlated most to the worsening of pain complaints. But, due to the difficulty of measuring the impact of these variables and the great diversity in study protocols, an analysis of studies regarding this topic shows conflicting results. Central sensitization mechanisms and the function of a Transient Receptor Potential channel might explain the pain hypersensitivity to cold weather. Joint pain, caused by central sensitization mechanisms, cannot always be treated with joint arthroplasty. When pain remains present after joint arthroplasty, centrally mediated pain constitutes an important role.",

    "abstract": "The pullout performance of various pedicle screws after artificial fusion process was investigated in this study. Normal, cannulated (cemented), novel expandable and normal (cemented) pedicle screws were tested. Polyurethane foams (Grade 10 and Grade 40) produced by casting method were used as test materials. The instrumentation of pedicle screws has been carried out with production of foams, simultaneously. For cemented pedicle screws, 3D models were prepared with respect to the anteriosuperior and oblique radiographs by using PMMA before casting procedure. Pullout tests were performed in an Instron 3369 testing device. Load versus displacement graph was recorded and the ultimate force was defined as the pullout strength sustained before failure of screw. As expected, the pullout strengths of pedicle screws in postfusion are higher than before fusion. Pullout strengths increased significantly by artificial fusion in Grade 10 foams compared to Grade 40 foams. Additionally, while the pullout strengths of normal, cannulated and novel expandable pedicle screws increased by artificial fusion, cemented normal pedicle screws had lower pullout values than before fusion in Grade 40 foams. When the cemented normal pedicle screws are excluded, other screws have almost similar pullout strength level. On the other hand, the pedicle screws have different increasing behaviour also, there is no correlation between each other. As a result, the novel expandable pedicle screws can be used instead of normal and cannulated ones due to their performances in non-cemented usage.",

This monocentric series aims to retrospectively assess the outcome of electrostimulation treatment for delayed union after traumatic fractures or knee osteotomy. Patients treated with electrostimulation for delayed union (no bony union on radiographic imaging at 90 days after osteotomy or fracture treatment) over an 8-year period were screened. The delay of treatment, success rate, revision rate and demographic data (age, sex, location of fracture, presence of osteosynthesis materials) were investigated. A questionnaire assessed objective (nicotine abuse, NRS pain assessment, activity levels) and subjective (comfort, usability, cost-effectiveness) aspects. Electrostimulation delivered radiographic healing in 75% of the fracture group and 66% of the osteotomy group. No statistical significant difference (N=136) in success rate was found for age, sex, presence of osteosynthesis material, delay or fracture location. Success rate did differ significantly with pain, activity level and smoking (p<0.05). Reflective questions to patients were answered mostly positively. The use of electrostimulation for the delayed union of fractures and knee osteotomies delivers high healing rates avoiding the burden of surgical reintervention. It is generally well received by the patient. No difference in success rate was found between sex, age or fracture location, nor did the delay of therapy onset or presence of osteosynthesis material seem to affect the success rate. Smoking had a negative influence on the efficacy of bone electrostimulation.",

Such information can be obtained by using clinical and imaging assessment after conservative treatment in affected patients.Subacromial impingement syndrome is a clinical presentation that can be associated with early stages of the disease. We aimed to describe the natural history of degenerative rotator cuff disease from the early stages by studying clinical and imaging outcomes in non-operated patients with subacromial impingement syndrome.Patients with subacromial impingement syndrome were prospectively included. They had conservative treatment and were assessed before treatment and during at least 12-month follow-up. Assessment included clinical evaluation on a 0- to 100-point Constant scale and subscales as well as MRI of the rotator cuff. Clinical results were compared to baseline MRI findings and according to lesional progression.We included 26 patients with mean age 59.1 (SD 9.6), mean pain duration 23.1 (31.3) months; mean total Constant score 39.1 (12.1). Overall, 9 patients had no tear, 9 had a partial tear and 8 had a full-thickness tear. Mean follow-up was 21 (SD 10) months. Total Constant score and subscores improved at follow-up in the overall sample. Patients without tear and those with partial or full-thickness tear at baseline showed clinical improvement. MRI of the rotator cuff at follow-up indicated lesional worsening in 7 patients. However, clinical improvement did not differ by lesional progression or not.We report on 21-month clinical and MRI assessments of degenerative rotator cuff disorders including early stages of the disease. Clinical improvement was not related to MRI changes over time. Further investigations are needed to verify our findings in larger study populations.",

To replace the classical aggressive surgeries, minimally invasive techniques were developed giving differing results based on variable radiographic criteria.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate with volumetric MRI calculations the benefit of percutaneous injection of demineralized bone matrix mixed with autogenous bone marrow on both types of cysts. Twenty-seven cysts; 6 aggressive aneurysmal bone cysts (ABCs) and 21 active simple bone cysts (SBCs) were treated with our percutaneous treatment in this case series. Regular MRIs were performed to calculate their volumetric evolution starting before treatment and with a minimal two-year follow-up. A cyst was considered healed when its final residual volume shrank to less than 50%. To allow statistical comparison between both types of cysts, 13 previously reported ABCs treated with the same protocol in our institution were joined to the 6 present ABCs. Four ABCs healed with a single injection while the 2 others recurred. Five SBCs healed with a single injection, 9 others after a second injection and 2 others after a third injection. Five SBCs were considered non-healed. The present healing rate in 67% of ABCs is consistent with the previous series as there was no significant difference (p=0.37). The better global healing rate for ABC (79%) was not statistically different from the SBC healing rate (76%) (p=0.83). The percutaneous injection of demineralized bone matrix mixed with bone marrow is an effective treatment for both types of cysts.",

Our research question was whether earlier surgical repair leads to superior functional results. This review was conducted according to PRISMA statement. A literature search of Pubmed, Embase, Cohrane was conducted, with two researchers assessing studies for eligibility and quality. A total of 20 studies, published between 1980 and 2019, met the inclusion criteria and were divided into two groups based on duration of symptoms before surgery. Group A comprised of studies in which duration was &lt; 3 months and Group B &gt; 3 months. Within each group there was a statistically significant improvement in the CS from pre-operative to post-operative outcome, but the improvement for Group A was statistically higher in comparison to Group B (P=0.01). Nevertheless, there was no significant difference in the final outcome for the two groups (P=0.29). The re-tear rate per 100 patients was calculated 28.5(±7.2) for Group A, and 17.2 (±12.56) for Group B (P=0.056). Our results suggest that functional outcome and tendon healing may not be valid arguments for early surgical repair. Therefore, repair of traumatic RCTs could be recommended whenever technically possible.",

The goal of our study was to compare 2 types of coverage flap for the reconstruction of the finger web spaces: a volar flap described by Blauth and a dorsal flap described by Gilbert. Between 1993 and 2015, children affected by simple and complex syndactylies (partial or complete) were treated in 2 french pediatric hospitals and were selected for our analytic, comparative, retrospective review. The 2 hospitals used different surgical techniques: one used a volar flap described by Blauth and the other a dorsal flap described by Gilbert. The children were followed up to look for signs according to the stages of the Classification of Withey and to evaluate a global result according to the score of Withey. Our secondary criteria of judgement were the aspect of the surgical scar according to the VSS (Vancouver Scar Scale) and the satisfaction of the parents and children. The age of the children, need for a surgical revision and time of last follow- up were also studied. We found statistically significant differences between group I (volar flap) and group II (dorsal flap) in favor of the volar flap: higher scores of Withey (even when the number of commissures was increasing) and better VSS (regardless of the number of web spaces treated). There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of age, follow-up, or rate of surgical revision. All in all, the volar flap presented less sequelae in terms of scar retraction. Regardless of the flap used, the cosmetic results of the full-thickness skin graft used impacted the result both on the receiving site (dyschromia, hairiness) and the donor site.",

We investigated the impact of both reimbursement systems on the funding of a University Hospital in Belgium. All patients from the UZ Brussel with a severity of illness score of one or two whom had an elective total hip replacement implanted between January 1st and May 31st 2018, were included retrospectively. We compared their invoicing data to those of patients operated in the same period but one year later. Moreover, we simulated the invoicing data of both groups as if they had been operated in the other period. Overall, we compared invoicing data of 41 patients before and 30 after the introduction of both renewed reimbursement systems. After the introduction of both new laws, we noted a loss of funding per patient and per intervention between 46.8€ and 753.5€ for a single room and, between 105.5€ and 1877.7€ for a double room. We noted the highest loss in the subcategory “physicians’ fees”. The renewed reimbursement system is not “budget neutral”. In time, the new system can lead to an optimization of care, but it can also lead to a progressive decrease of funding if future fees and implant reimbursements would be aligned towards the national mean. More- over, we fear the new financing system could affect the quality of care and/or result in the selection of profitable patients.",

    "abstract": "Exposure of the coracoid process during arthroscopic stabilization of acute acromioclavicular disjunctions (ACDs) can be achieved either by passing an extra- articular optical portal through the subacromial space or by an intra-articular optical route through the glenohumeral joint with opening of the rotator interval. The objective of our study was to compare the impact on the functional results of these two optical routes. This was a retrospective, multicentre study that included patients operated on for an acute acromioclavicular disjunction arthroscopically. The treatment consisted of surgical stabilization under arthroscopy. The surgical indication was retained for an acromioclavicular disjunction of grade 3, 4 or 5, according to the Rockwood classification. Group 1, which consisted of 10 patients, was operated on with an extra-articular subacromial optical route, and group 2, which consisted of 12 patients, was operated on with an intra-articular optical route with opening of the rotator interval according to the habits of the surgeon. A follow-up of 3 months was performed. The functional results were evaluated for each patient using the Constant score, Quick DASH, and SSV. The delays in returning to professional and sports activities were also noted. A precise postoperative radiological analysis made it possible to analyse the quality of the radiological reduction. No significant difference between the two groups was found between the Constant score (88 vs. 90; p = 0.56), Quick DASH (7 vs. 7; p = 0.58), or SSV (88 vs. 93; p = 0.36). The times to return to work (6.8 weeks vs. 7.0 weeks; p = 0.54) and sports activities (15.6 weeks vs. 19.5 weeks; p = 0.53) were also comparable. The quality of the radiological reduction was satisfactory in the two groups and did not depend on the approach. No clinically or radiologically significant differences between the extra-articular and intra-articular optical portals in the surgical treatment of acute ACDs were found. The optical route can be chosen according to the habits of the surgeon.",

A total of 182 patients with medial compartment osteoarthritis and treated by UKA between January 2012 and January 2017 were enrolled in this study. Computed tomography (CT) was used to measure the rotation of components. Patients were divided into two groups according to the insert design. These groups were divided into three subgroups according to the angle of the tibia relative to the femur (TFRA) (A): TFRA 0° to 5° either internal or external rotation; (B): TFRA &gt;5° internal rotation, and (C): TFRA &gt;5° external rotation. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of age, body mass index (BMI) and follow-up period. KSS scores increased as the tibial component rotation (TCR) external rotation increased, but there was no correlation for WOMAC score. (P: 0,039 r: 0,207; P:0,347 r:0,095, respectively) Post-operative KSS and WOMAC scores decreased as TFRA external rotation was increased.

    "abstract": "The timing of definitive fixation of open ankle malleolar fractures is still controversial. This study intended to evaluate the outcome of patients who were managed by immediate definitive fixation in comparison to delayed definitive fixation following open ankle malleolar fractures. This was an IRB approved retrospective case control study of 32 patients who were treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for open ankle malleolar fractures at our Level I trauma center 2011-2018. Patients were divided into 2 groups; immediate ORIF group (within 24 hours) and delayed ORIF group (first stage included debridement and external fixator or splinting followed by second stage of delayed ORIF). Outcomes assessed were postoperative complications (wound healing, infection, nonunion). Logistic regression models were used to access the unadjusted and adjusted associations between post- operative complications and selected co factors. The immediate definitive fixation group included 22 patients while the delayed staged fixation group included 10 patients. Gustilo type II and III open fractures were associated with higher complications rate (p-value = 0.012) in both groups. Comparing the 2 groups, There was no increase in complication in the immediate fixation group compared to the delayed group. Complications following open ankle malleolar fractures are usually associated with Gustilo type II and III open fractures. Immediate definitive fixation after adequate debridement was not found to increase complication rate compared to staged management.",

    "abstract": "Atlantoaxial segments have not been discussed in existing studies on prevertebral soft tissue (PVST) swelling after cervical operations. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of PVST swelling after anterior cervical internal fixation at different segments. This retrospective study included patients who underwent transoral atlantoaxial reduction plate (TARP) internal fixation (Group I, n=73), C3/C4 anterior decompression and vertebral fixation (Group II, n=77), or C5/C6 anterior decompression and vertebral fixation (Group III, n=75) at our Hospital. The PVST thickness at C2, C3, and C4 segments was measured before and 3 days after the operation. Time of extubation, number of patients with postoperative re-intubation and dysphagia were collected. Results show that all patients had significant postoperative PVST thickening (all P<0.01). PVST thickening at C2, C3, and C4 was significantly greater in Group I than in Groups II and III (all P<0.01). PVST thickening at C2, C3, and C4 in Group I was 1.87 (14.12mm/7.54mm), 1.82 (12.90mm/7.07mm) and 1.71 (12.09mm/7.07mm) times of that in Group II, respectively. PVST thickening at C2, C3, and C4 in Group I was 2.66 (14.12mm/5.31mm), 1.50 (12.90mm/8.62mm) and 1.32 (12.09mm/9.18mm) times of that in Group III, respectively. The patients in Group I had significantly later postoperative extubation (Both P<0.01) than the patients in Groups II and III. None of the patients had postoperative re-intubation or dysphagia. We conclude that PVST swelling was greater in patients who underwent TARP internal fixation than in patients who underwent anterior C3/C4 or C5/C6 internal fixation. Hence, after TARP internal fixation, patients should be given proper respiratory tract management and monitoring.",

    "abstract": "The purpose is to introduce a novel scaphoid screw placement surgery based on a novel three-dimensional (3D) printing guiding template through dorsal approach, and to evaluate the clinical feasibility and accuracy. The diagnose of scaphoid fracture was confirmed by Computed Tomography (CT) scanning, and subsequently the CT scanning data was input into a three-dimension imaging system(Hongsong software, China). An individualized 3D skin surface template with a guiding hole was printed. We put the template to the correct position on patient’s wrist. Fluoroscopy was used to confirm the accurate position after drilling of Kirschner wire according to the prefabricated holes of template. Finally, the hollow screw was inserted through the wire. The operations were performed successfully without incision and complications. The operation time was below 20 minutes and the blood loss was below 1ml. The intraoperative fluoroscopy demonstrated good position of the screws. Postoperative imaging showed that the screws were considered to be placed perpendicularly to the fracture plane in the scaphoid. Three months after the operation, the patients acquired good recovery of the motor function of their hands. This present study suggested that the computer-assisted 3D printing guiding template is effective, reliable, and minimally invasive for the treatment of type B scaphoid fracture through dorsal approach.",

    "abstract": "Patients with long-segment cervical spinal fusion resulting from spinal ankylosing disorders (SADs) are at high risk for highly unstable cervical spine fractures necessitating surgery as the treatment of choice; however, without an existing gold standard. Specifically, patients without concomitant myelo- pathy, representing a rare entity, may benefit from a minimized surgical approach of a single-stage posterior stabilization without bone grafting for posterolateral fusion. This retrospective monocenter study in a Level I trauma center included all patients treated with navigated posterior stabilization without posterolateral bone grafting between January 2013 and January 2019 for cervical spine fractures in preexisting SADs without myelopathy. The outcomes were analyzed based on complication rates, revision frequency, neurologic deficits, and fusion times and rates. Fusion was evaluated by X-ray and computed tomography. 14 patients (11 male, 3 female) with a mean age of 72.7 ± 17.6 years were included. Five fractures were at the upper and nine at the subaxial cervical spine (predominantly C5-7). There was one surgery-specific complication of postoperative paresthesia. There was no infection, implant loosening, or dislocation, and no revision surgery necessary. All fractures healed after a median time of 4 months and 12 months being the latest time of fusion in one patient. Single-stage posterior stabilization without posterolateral fusion is an alternative for patients with SADs and cervical spine fractures without myelopathy. They can benefit from a minimization of surgical trauma while having equal times of fusion and no increased rate of complications.",

    "abstract": "Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory granulomatous disease that can develop in almost any organ system. Rheumatologists may encounter sarcoidosis in different situations varying from arthralgia to bone involvement. While the peripheral skeleton was a frequent location, data regarding axial involvement is scarce. Most patients with vertebral involvement have a known diagnosis of intrathoracic sarcoidosis. They tend to report mechanical pain or tenderness over the involved area. Imaging modalities, particularly Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), are a mainstay of axial screening. It helps exclude differential diagnoses and delineate the extent of bone involvement. Histological confirmation combined with the ap- propriate clinical and radiological presentation is the key of diagnosis. Corticosteroids remain the cornerstone of treatment. In refractory cases, methotrexate is the steroid- sparing agent of choice. Biologic therapies may be used, although the evidence base for their efficacy is bone sarcoidosis controversial.",

    "abstract": "For revision hip arthroplasty, both cemented and cementless techniques have been described for implantation of modular and non-modular implants. Although many articles have been published on non-modular prosthesis, there is a dearth of data on cementless, modular revision arthroplasty in young patients. This study aims to analyze the complication rate of modular tapered stems in young patients below 65 years of age as compared to elderly patients older than 85 years old, in order to predict the complication rate. A retrospective study was performed using a major revision hip arthroplasty center database. Inclusion criteria consisted of patients undergoing modular, cementless revision total hip arthroplasties. Data on demographics, functional outcome, intraoperative, early and medium term complications were assessed. In total, 42 patients met inclusion criteria (&lt;65 years old: 25 patients; &gt;85 years old: 17 patients). For the &lt;65 years old cohort, the mean age and follow-up time was 55.4 ± 9.3 years old and 13.3 ± 13.2 months, respectively. For the &gt;85 years old cohort, the mean age and follow-up time was 87.6 ± 2.1 years old and 4.3±8.8 years, respectively. For intraoperative and short-term complications, no significant differences were observed. Medium term complication is noted in 23.8% (n=10/42) overall, preferentially affecting the elderly group at 41.2% (only 12.0% in the younger cohort; p=0.029). To our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the complication rate and implant survival for modular revision hip arthroplasty based on age group. It shows that the complication rate is significantly lower in young patients and age should be a consideration in surgical decision making",

Our case series comprises of 11 patients undergoing this procedure. Their mean preoperative extension deficit was 52° at the MP joint and 43° at the PIP joint. Full extension of the MP joint and a mean of 8° extension deficit at the PIP joint was achieved with surgery. All patients maintained full extension at the MP joint, with a follow-up of 1 to 3 years. Minor complications were reported. The ulnar lateral digital flap is a simple and reliable alternative when surgically treating Dupuytren’s disease of the fifth finger.",

    "abstract": "A brachial plexus birth injury (BPBI) can lead to a limited shoulder function, especially abduction and external rotation. One of the treatment options to restore those shoulder functions is a latissimus dorsi transfer (LDT). The aim of this study is to analyze long-term functional outcome after a single LDT and compare these results with LDT combined with subscapularis muscle lengthening (SSL) or subscapularis muscle release (SSR). This cohort study included 39 patients (≤12 years old) with one-sided BPBI. All patients had an inter- nal rotation- and adduction contracture without glenohumeral joint deformity. A LDT was performed with or without SSL or SSR, resulting in 3 patient study groups. Demographic data and pre- and post- operative Mallet scores were collected and analysed for each group. The median age was 4.0 years (IQR 3.1) and there were no differences in patient demographics. In all patients surgery improved external rotation and overall shoulder function, at 9.8 years follow-up. Also, the total Mallet score increased significantly with 1.7 (p=0.001) in our (entire) study cohort. A LDT, with a SSL or SSR in case of an intra-operative internal contracture, improves shoulder function and preserves external rotation in patients (≤12 years old) with BPBI, at a follow up of 9.8 years.",

    "abstract": "Neglected acetabular fractures are often challenging to treat. The aim of this study is to highlight the technique of acetabular distraction with porous metal cup as a viable technique to address such complex cases. This is a prospective study of seven patients who had neglected acetabular fracture or fracture non-union that were managed with total hip arthroplasty using acetabular distraction and porous metal cup with cemented liner. The average age of the patients was 51 years (range 36-58 years). Average time of follow up was 18 months (range 12-36 months). Radiological results at latest follow up and by comparing serial radiographs showed that all cases had a well-fixed implant construct without evidence of loosening or malorientation. Average Harris hip score pre-operatively was 46, which improved to an average of 84 post-operatively. Our study shows that total hip replacement using acetabular distraction with porous metal cup provide early good results in reconstruction of acetabular bony deficiencies due to neglected acetabular fracture.",

    "abstract": "Coronal malalignment of the knee joint is very common in developing countries especially because of nutritional rickets. Significant valgus deformity needs to be treated surgically to improve appearance, gait and function of the patient. The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the results of supracondylar “V” osteotomy as a surgical technique for correction of the valgus knee deformity. This study was conducted in a tertiary level teaching hospital and 30 cases were included in the study. For all the patients deformity was assessed using ana- tomical tibiofemoral angle, mechanical axis deviation and intermalleolar distance preoperatively and post- operatively. The average age of our patients was 13.7 years and the average follow up was3.29 years (1.39-14.22 yrs). Clinically the average value of intermalleolar distance preoperatively was 16cm and 3.2 cm postperatively. Average pre-operative tibiofemoral angle was 23° and the average postoperative angle was 6 0 which was found to be statistically significant using the Paired t test (p&lt;0.005). The average value of preoperative mechanical axis deviation was 3.1 cm which decreased to an average value of 1.1 cm postoperatively. The results with this technique have been encouraging. The advantages of this technique are low morbidity, good stability allowing early ambulation, ability to adjust alignment postoperatively by casting and no need for internal fixation. Few studies have been conducted on osteotomies that do not require internal fixation and are inherently stable. This technique has the advantage of practically no occurrence of any infection or a second surgery to remove hardware in children and adolescents. Since no specialized instrumentation, image intensifier and implants are required, it is cost effective and can be used in any primary care or district level surgical setup in a developing country like ours.",

Since these registries may con- tain confounding factors, we conducted a single center cohort study comparing survival and reason for failure between THA for an acute femoral neck fracture and OA using the same hip prosthesis after a minimum follow-up of 2 years. We retrospectively analyzed 2782 patients who had undergone THA with an Accolade TMZF stem and a Trident cup between March 2009 and September 2014. Primary diagnosis before THA was osteoarthritis (OA group : n=2610) or acute femoral fracture (Fracture group : n=172). Patients in both groups were operated on by the same hip surgeons. Effect of diagnosis on THA survival was analyzed using Cox-regression analysis. Chi-square tests were used to illustrate the different reasons for revision between the groups. Mean follow-up was 4.6 years (2-7.6). A total of 100 revisions were performed. The revision risk was comparable between the OA and Fracture group (HR=1.04, 95% CI :0.46-2.39). No differences were found between the OA and Fracture group with respect to the occurrence of periprosthetic fractures (0.8% vs. 0.6%, p=0.71) and revisions for dislocation (0.6% vs. 1.2%, p=0.38). We found no difference in outcome or reason for revision between THA for OA or femoral neck frac- ture. Using an implant with a proven ODEP rating and having experienced hip surgeons carry out the procedures may be more important than the primary diagnosis.",

Our goal is to judge feasibility of the X-pander® in clinical practice ; a device developed to mimic the real press-fit obtained by the definitive cup, to ensure satisfactory press-fit. In this feasibility study 45 experienced orthopaedic surgeons from 7 European countries filled in a structured survey after 78 primary THA and 31 revision surgeries, using the X-pander instead of traditional trial cups. Primary outcomes were decision change concerning cup size or further reaming and increased confidence regarding cup insertion and size. Additionally, potential association between the primary outcomes and procedure (primary or revi- sion), bone quality and experience of the surgeon were evaluated. In 33.3% of the primary and 32.2% of the revision cases the X-pander measurement changed the deci- sion and further reaming or change of cup size was decided. In 61.5% and 58.1% of respectively the primary and revision THAs the X-pander was judged to give fairly to much more reliable information than traditional trial cups. The X-pander could lead to less additional screw fixation, as stated in 37.2% of the primary and 25.8% of the revision cases and to better cup insertion in respectively 50.0% and 51.6%. This study validates that the X-pander may be a suitable option for accurate sizing and assessment of the reamed acetabulum and could replace traditional trial cups in THA.",

    "abstract": "Patients with ACL tears with ALL injury have more clinical complaints (instability, feeling of the pop on the knee or knee sliding). patients have ALL injury with partial ACL tears, It is unclear whether the choice of treatment will be conservative or surgical. This study aimed to determine the effect of anterolateral ligament (ALL) status, whether intact or ruptured, on the choice of conservative or surgical treatment in patients with partial anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. Between 2015 and 2019, patients with suspected partial ACL tears were identified on both physical examination and MR imaging. 122 patients who had partial ACL tears and also status of patient’s ALL could be evaluated by radiologist were included in the study, retrospectively. Sixty-two patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were determined as group 1, and 60 patients who did not undergo ACL reconstruction were defined as group 2. In patients with partial ACL rupture with or without ACL reconstruction, it was evaluated whether a ruptured or non- ruptured ALL was effective in this decision of conservative or surgically. The MRIs of patients with partial ACL tears were evaluated by a radiologist and it was concluded that the ALLs of 50 patients were ruptured, and 72 were intact. The ALLs of 36 patients in group 1 were ruptured, and 26 patients were intact. Fourteen patients in group 2 had ruptured ALLs, 46 patient’s ALLs were intact. Seventy-two percent of the patients with partial ACL tears who had ruptured ALLs in MRI underwent ACL reconstruction. It was found that ACL reconstruction was performed more frequently in patients with partial ACL tears with ALL rupture. Therefore, we believe that preoperative evaluations of ALLs using MRI in patients with partial ACL tears are essential for surgical planning.",

    "abstract": "A new flat detector and pulsed fluoroscopy technology is available to further reduce radiation exposure in radiological monitoring during scoliosis treatment in children and adolescents. The aim of this study is to compare different settings of the system (opening area(OA) and image quality settings (IQS)) in order to find the optimal parameters with high image quality and the lowest possible radiation exposure. Therefore, we examined four cadaver spines (T1 to sacrum) with the flat detector technique using digital pulsed fluoroscopy and simulated the abdominal soft tissues. The images were merged and evaluated by three different investigators using an established scoring system. For comparison, we used digital radiography images of the cadaver spines. The values for the DAP increased from the small OA (33% ; 0.56 µGy·m²) to the maximum OA (100% ; 0.82 µGy·m²) by 45% (p = .003) and from the low image quality setting (0.57 µGy·m²) to the high setting (0.84 µGy·m²) by 48% (p = .028). Despite the low DAP, the setting 33% OA achieved the best point values for image quality, therefore this setting is clearly preferred. Using a digital fluoroscopy system allows a significant reduction of radiation exposure by a factor of 7.5 (3.88µGy·m² to 0.5µGy·m²) compared to slot- scanning x-ray (EOS). Due to this success, the flat detector and pulsed fluoroscopy technology can be an alternative to established methods such as X-ray and EOS in clinical use.",

It is composed of synovial- like mononuclear cells, admixed with multinucleate giant cells, foam cells, siderophages and inflammatory cells (1). It can have various clinical manifestations, and is therefore subdivided in a diffuse and a localized/ nodular subtype. Furthermore, the lesions can have an intra- or extra-articular location. The purpose of this paper is to present the case of a 41-year-old male suffering from multifocal extra- and intra-articular TGCT of the right knee, with involvement of the pes anserinus bursa and an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) autograft respectively. The ACL reconstruction was performed 11 years prior to the diagnosis of the TGCT, using tendons harvested from the pes anserinus. Our case illustrates the risk of transferring TGCT from an extra- to intra-articular location during ACL reconstruction, when using tendons of a pes anserinus prone to develop this condition.

    "abstract": "Elderly patients who present with an inability to weight bear following a fall, with normal radiographs, should be appropriately investigated to rule out an occult hip fracture (OHF).We aim to identify both the range and incidence of the differential diagnosis of acute traumatic hip pain in a large series of patients investigated for OHF.A retrospective analysis of consecutive patients investigated for an OHF with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed.Dedicated musculoskeletal radiologists reported the MRI scans.All diagnoses including hip fractures, other fractures and soft tissue injuries were recorded.Case notes were reviewed for all patients to identify subsequent complications, management and outcomes.A total of 157 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria.52 (33%) patients had a fracture of the proximal femur.The majority of patients with proximal femoral fractures required surgical intervention.9 patients who had fractures of the greater trochanter of the femur without fracture extension across the femoral neck were managed non-operatively.40 (25%) patients had fractures of the pelvis, with a combined pubic rami and sacral fracture occurring frequently.The most common diagnosis was a soft tissue injury alone that was seen in 60 (38%) patients imaged.Injuries to the gluteal muscle group, iliopsaos complex and trochanteric bursa were most prevalent.All patients with soft tissue injuries or fractures of the pelvis were successfully managed non-operatively.This study highlights a wide range of differential diagnoses in elderly patients presenting with acute traumatic hip pain.The proximal femur was fractured in 33% of patients imaged for OHFs in our series.The most common diagnosis was a soft tissue injury around the hip and pelvis ; these injuries can be successfully managed without surgery.",

The mean age of the patients was 9.1 years (range, 0-16 ; 11 female/21 male), and median follow-up period was 3.21 years (range, 1-10 years). The median size of the excised tumour was 11 cm (range, 6-28 cm) in maximal dimension. Big lipomas in children can be treated with marginal resection procedures without biopsy with lower complication and local recurrence ratio compared to adult patients with similar tumours in similar size and location.",

The 630 cases were divided into two groups. In group I, 120 neonates and infants aged 1 week to 2 months (195 hips) were treated by various methods of hip abduction (Von Rosen splint, clothes, pillows, plastic splints). The follow-up ranged from 1 to 13 years (mean 1.4 years). The results were excellent in 94.5%, good in 4%, fair in 1%, and poor in 0.5%. All 510 infants (810 hips) of Group II were treated with a specially designed abduction brace. The brace was applied only for reducible dislocations that were stable in the safe zone of abduction. A satisfactory range of abduction was obtained prior to the application of the brace. The results of treatment with the brace in 810 hips were excellent in 91%, good in 4.5%, fair in 3.5% and poor in 1%. Ischemic necrosis of the proximal femoral epiphysis occurred in 6% of the hips in Group I, and was significant enough to cause deformity in 2.55%, and in 7% of the hips of Group II, with significant changes in 2.7%. The brace has been used for 22 years and found practical and reliable. The results of treatment compare favorably with other series in the literature.",
